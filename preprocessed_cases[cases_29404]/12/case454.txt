the panel affirmed the district court order denying a request for a preliminary injunction seeking to stay enforcement of a city of berkeley ordinance requiring cell phone retailers to inform prospective cell phone purchasers that carrying a cell phone in certain ways may cause them to exceed federal communications commission guidelines for exposure to radiation.
applying zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio,the panel held that the city compelled disclosure of commercial speech complied with the first amendment because the information in the disclosure was reasonably related to a substantial governmental interest and was purely factual.accordingly,the panel concluded that plaintiff had little likelihood of success on its first amendment claim that the disclosure compelled by the berkeley ordinance was unconstitutional.
the panel determined that there was little likelihood of success on plaintiff contention that the berkeley ordinance was preempted.the panel held that berkeley compelled disclosure did no more than alert consumers to the safety disclosures that the federal communication commission requires,and to direct consumers to federally compelled instructions in their user manuals providing specific information about how to avoid excessive exposure.the panel held that far from conflicting with federal law and policy,the berkeley ordinance complements and reinforces it.
in affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction,the panel further determined that there was no irreparable harm based on the first amendment or preemption,that the balance of equities tipped in berkeley favor,that the ordinance was in the public interest,and that an injunction would harm that interest.
dissenting in part,judge friedland stated that berkeley ordinance likely violates the first amendment and therefore should have been preliminarily enjoined.she stated that taken as a whole,the most natural reading of the berkeley disclosure warns that carrying a cell phone in one pocket is unsafe.yet berkeley had not attempted to argue,let alone to prove,that message was true.
fletcher,circuit judge 
a city of berkeley ordinance requires cell phone retailers to inform prospective cell phone purchasers that carrying a cell phone in certain ways may cause them to exceed federal communications commission guidelines for exposure to radiation.ctia,a trade association formerly known as cellular telephone industries association,challenges the ordinance on two grounds.first,it argues that the ordinance violates the first amendment.second,it argues that the ordinance is preempted.
ctia requested a preliminary injunction staying enforcement of the ordinance.the district court denied ctia request,and ctia filed an interlocutory appeal.we affirm and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in may,the city of berkeley passed an ordinance requiring cell phone retailers to disclose information to prospective cell phone purchasers about the federal government radiation exposure guidelines relevant to cell phone use.under findings and purpose,the ordinance provided 
requirements for the testing of cell phones were established by the federal government in.
b.these requirements established specific absorption rates sar for cell phones.
c.the protocols for testing the sar for cell phones carried on a person body assumed that they would be carried a small distance away from the body,in a holster or belt clip,which was the common practice at that time.testing of cell phones under these protocols has generally been conducted based on an assumed separation of millimeters.
to protect the safety of their consumers,manufacturers recommend that their cell phones be carried away from the body,or be used in conjunction with devices.
consumers are not generally aware of these safety recommendations.
currently,it is much more common for cell phones to be carried in pockets or other locations rather than holsters or belt clips,resulting in much smaller separation distances than the safety recommendations specify.
g.some consumers may change their behavior to better protect themselves and their children if they were aware of these safety recommendations.
h.while the disclosures and warnings that accompany cell phones generally advise consumers not to wear them against their bodies,in pockets,waistbands,these disclosures and warnings are often buried in fine print,are not written in easily understood language,or are accessible only by looking for the information on the device itself.
i.the purpose of this chapter is to assure that consumers have the information they need to make their own choices about the extent and nature of their exposure to radiation.

ctia challenged the compelled disclosure provision of the ordinance,arguing that it violated the first amendment and was preempted.one sentence of the compelled disclosure stated,the potential risk is greater for children.the district court held that this sentence was preempted,and it issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.in december,berkeley the ordinance without the offending sentence.in its current form,the compelled disclosure provision provides 
a.a cell phone retailer shall provide to each customer who buys or leases a cell phone a notice containing the following language 
the city of berkeley requires that you be provided the following notice 
to assure safety,the federal government requires that cell phones meet rf exposure guidelines.if you carry or use your phone in a pants or shirt pocket or tucked into a bra when the phone is on and connected to a wireless network,you may exceed the federal guidelines for exposure to rf radiation.refer to the instructions in your phone or user manual for information about how to use your phone safely.

the ordinance requires that the compelled disclosure be provided either on a prominently displayed poster no less than by inches with no smaller than font,or on a handout no less than by inches with no smaller than font.the logo of the city of berkeley must be placed on the poster and handout.the ordinance provides that a cell phone retailer may include additional information on the poster or handout if it is clear that the additional information is not part of the compelled disclosure.b the paper on which the notice is printed may contain other information in the discretion of the cell phone retailer,as long as that information is distinct from the notice language required by subdivision a of this section.
ctia challenged the current ordinance,arguing,as it had before,that the ordinance violates the first amendment and is preempted.the district court noted that the preempted sentence had been removed from the ordinance,dissolved its previously entered injunction,and denied ctia request for a new preliminary injunction.ctia filed an interlocutory appeal.

iii.regulatory background 
the federal communications commission fcc has regulatory jurisdiction over transmitting services in the united states.in,after extensive consultation with other agencies,the fcc issued a rule designed to limit the specific absorption rate sar of rf radiation from transmitters,including cell phones 
by this action,we are amending our rules to adopt new guidelines and methods for evaluating the environmental effects of rf radiation from transmitters.we are adopting maximum permissible exposure mpe limits for electric and magnetic field strength and power density for transmitters operating at frequencies from khz to ghz we are also adopting limits for localized partial body absorption that will apply to certain portable transmitting devices we believe that the guidelines we are adopting will protect the public and workers from exposure to potentially harmful rf fields.
in reaching our decision on the adoption of new rf exposure guidelines we have carefully considered the large number of comments submitted in this proceeding,and particularly those submitted by the environmental protection agency epa,the food and drug administration fda and other federal health and safety agencies.the new guidelines we are adopting are based substantially on the recommendations of those agencies,and we believe that these guidelines represent a consensus view of the federal agencies responsible for matters relating to the public safety and health.
in re guidelines for evaluating the environmental effects of radiation,fed.reg,emphases added.
out of concern for the safety of cell phone users,the fcc rejected an industry proposal to exclude devices such as cell phones from the rule adopting sar limits 
most commenting parties,including federal health and safety agencies,support the use of the american national standards institute institute of electrical and electronic engineers sar limits for localized partial body exposure for evaluating devices designed to be used in the immediate vicinity of the body.therefore,in view of the consensus and the scientific support in the record,we are adopting the sar limits for the determination of safe exposure from devices designed to be used in the immediate vicinity of the body based upon the guidelines.
the sar limits we are adopting will generally apply to portable devices that are designed to be used with any part of the radiating structure of the device in direct contact with the body of the user or within cm of the body under normal conditions of use.for example,this definition would apply to cellular telephones.
in re guidelines for evaluating the environmental effects of radiation fcc guidelines for radiofrequency radiation,fcc,emphases added.
the fcc has a policy with respect to sar limits 
the intent of our exposure limits is to provide a cap that both protects the public based on scientific consensus and allows for efficient and practical implementation of wireless services.the present commission exposure limit is a rule.that is,so long as exposure levels are below a specified limit value,there is no requirement to further reduce exposure.our current rf exposure guidelines are an example of such regulation,including a significant safety factor,whereby the exposure limits are set at a level on the order of times below the level at which adverse biological effects have been observed in laboratory animals as a result of tissue heating resulting from rf exposure.
in re reassessment of fcc radiofrequency exposure limits and policies,fcc rcd.the fcc recognizes that its required margin of safety is large 
e xceeding the sar limit does not necessarily imply unsafe operation,nor do lower sar quantities imply safer operation.the limits were set with a large safety factor,to be well below a threshold for unacceptable rises in tissue temperature.as a result,exposure well above the specified sar limit should not create an unsafe condition.in sum,using a device against the body without a spacer will generally result in actual sar below the maximum sar tested moreover,a use that possibly results in with the sar limit should not be viewed with significantly greater concern than compliant use.
id.at emphasis added.
there are two ways to ensure compliance with sar limits reducing the amount of rf radiation from a transmitting device,and increasing the distance between the device and the user.different devices emit different amounts of rf radiation,with the result that the minimum distance between the device and the user to achieve compliance with sar limits varies somewhat from device to device.the fcc requires that cell phone user manuals contain information that alerts users to the minimum distances appropriate for the device they are using 
specific information must be included in the operating manuals to enable users to select accessories that meet the minimum test separation distance requirements.users must be fully informed of the operating requirements and restrictions,to the extent that the typical user can easily understand the information,to acquire the required accessories to maintain compliance.instructions on how to place and orient a device in accessories,in accordance with the test results,should also be included in the user instructions.all supported accessory operating configurations must be clearly disclosed to users,through conspicuous instructions in the user guide and user manual,to ensure unsupported operations are avoided.
in re exposure procedures and equipment authorization policies for mobile and portable devices,fcc office of engineering and technology laboratory division d,fcc exposure procedures emphasis added.compliance with this disclosure requirement is a prerequisite for approval of a transmitting device by the fcc.see id.at.
the following are examples of cell phone user manuals that comply with the fcc disclosure requirement

iv.discussion

likelihood of success 
ctia makes two arguments against the berkeley ordinance.first,it argues that the ordinance violates the first amendment.second,it argues that the ordinance is preempted.we take the arguments in turn.
first amendment 
the underlying disclosure at issue is the disclosure that the fcc compels cell phone manufacturers to provide to consumers.however,ctia has not sued the fcc.rather,ctia has sued berkeley,challenging the disclosure berkeley compels cell phone retailers to provide to the same consumers.the berkeley ordinance requires cell phone retailers to disclose,in summary form,the same information to consumers that the fcc already requires cell phone manufacturers to disclose.the berkeley disclosure then directs consumers to user manuals for more specific information.
central hudson or zauderer 
the parties agree that berkeley ordinance is a regulation of commercial speech.central hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,see hunt city of,cir.however,they disagree about whether the ordinance compliance with the first amendment should be analyzed under central hudson or under zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio.
under central hudson,the government may restrict or prohibit commercial speech that is neither misleading nor connected to unlawful activity,as long as the governmental interest in regulating the speech is substantial.at.the restriction or prohibition must directly advance the governmental interest asserted,and must not be more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.id.at.under zauderer as we interpret it today,the government may compel truthful disclosure in commercial speech as long as the compelled disclosure is reasonably related to a substantial governmental interest.zauderer,at see discussion infra.
we apply the intermediate scrutiny test mandated by central hudson in commercial speech cases where speech is restricted or prohibited,on the ground that in such cases intermediate scrutiny appropriately protects the interests of both the speaker the seller and the audience the purchaser.but one size does not fit all in commercial speech cases.in central hudson itself,the supreme court cautioned,the protection available for particular commercial expression turns on the nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its regulation.central hudson,at.
five years after central hudson,the court held that central hudson intermediate scrutiny test does not apply to compelled,as distinct from restricted or prohibited,commercial speech.in zauderer,defendant zauderer advertised legal services to prospective dalkon shield plaintiffs in a number of ohio newspapers.the advertisement stated,inter alia,the cases are handled on a contingent fee basis of the amount recovered.if there is no recovery,no legal fees are owed by our clients.zauderer,at.zauderer was disciplined under ohio state bar disciplinary rules on the ground that the advertisement was deceptive within the meaning of the rules,id.at,because it failed to disclose the client potential liability for costs even if her suit were unsuccessful.id.at.the court noted that the bar disciplinary rules required zauderer to include in his advertising purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which his services will be available.id.at.the court wrote,ohio has not attempted to prevent attorneys from conveying information to the public it has only required them to provide somewhat more information than they might otherwise be inclined to present.id.at.the supreme court declined to apply the central hudson test 
because the extension of first amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides,appellant constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information is minimal.we recognize that unjustified or unduly burden some disclosure requirements might offend the first amendment by chilling protected commercial speech.but we hold that an advertiser rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the state interest in preventing deception of consumers.
id.at internal citation omitted.see also milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states,following zauderer and using its preventing deception language.
b.the zauderer test 
substantial governmental interest 
ctia contends that the zauderer exception to the general rule of central hudson does not apply in this case because the speech compelled by the berkeley ordinance does not prevent deception of consumers.this is the first time we have had occasion in this circuit to squarely address the question whether,in the absence of a rationale,the zauderer test applies.video software dealers ass schwarzenegger,cir.invalidating compelled disclosure on video game packaging,noting that the disclosure would arguably now convey a false statement that certain conduct is illegal when it is not,and the state has no legitimate reason to force retailers to affix false information on their products.several of our sister circuits,however,have answered this question.they have unanimously concluded that the zauderer exception for compelled speech applies even in circumstances where the disclosure does not protect against deceptive speech.
in american meat institute department of agriculture,cir.en banc,a department of agriculture regulation required identification of the country of origin on the packaging of meat and meat products.id.at.the regulation implemented a federal statute requiring labeling.see.the circuit held that zauderer should not be read to apply only to cases where speech prevents or corrects deceptive speech.it noted that on the facts of both zauderer and milavetz in which the court repeated zauderer preventing deception language there had been deceptive speech given the subject of both cases,it was natural for the court to express the rule in such terms.the language could have been simply descriptive of the circumstances to which the court applied its new rule.am.meat,at.the circuit concluded,the language with which zauderer justified its approach sweeps far more broadly than the interest in remedying deception.id.
in national electrical manufacturers association sorrell,cir,a vermont statute required manufacturers of products to label their products and packaging to inform consumers that the products contained mercury and instructing them that the products should be disposed of or recycled as hazardous waste.id.at.the second circuit held that the compelled disclosure was supported by a substantial state interest in protecting human health and the environment.id.at.citing zauderer,the court recognized that the compelled disclosure did not prevent consumer confusion or deception.sorrell.at.it nonetheless upheld the disclosure as not inconsistent with the policies underlying first amendment protection of commercial speech.id.m andated disclosure of accurate,factual,commercial information does not offend the core first amendment values of promoting efficient exchange of information or protecting individual liberty interests.id.at see also rest.ass city bd.of health,cir.zauderer holding was broad enough to encompass nonmisleading disclosure requirements.discount tobacco city lottery,united states,cir.upholding federally required health warnings on cigarette packaging and in cigarette advertisements,relying on the second circuit opinion in sorrell pharm.care mgmt.ass rowe,cir.noting that the court had found no cases limiting application of the zauderer compelled speech test to prevention or correction of deceptive advertising dwyer cappell,cir.describing but not relying on zauderer criterion.
we agree with our sister circuits that under zauderer the prevention of consumer deception is not the only governmental interest that may permissibly be furthered by compelled commercial speech.we conclude that any governmental interest will suffice so long as it is substantial.in american meat,the circuit declined to decide whether the governmental interest must be substantial,leaving open the question whether a interest might suffice.see am.meat,at because the interest motivating the rule is a substantial one,we need not decide whether a lesser interest could suffice under zauderer.we answer the question avoided in american meat,holding that zauderer requires that the compelled disclosure further some substantial that is,more than trivial governmental interest.central hudson explicitly requires that a substantial interest be furthered by a challenged regulation prohibiting or restricting commercial speech,and we see nothing in zauderer that would allow a lesser interest to justify compelled commercial speech.to use the words of the second circuit in sorrell,the interest at stake must be more than the satisfaction of mere consumer curiosity.sorrell,at see also am.meat,at information has an historical pedigree that lifts it well beyond idle curiosity.
ii.purely factual information 
the court in zauderer noted that the compelled disclosure in that case was of purely factual and uncontroversial information.zauderer,at.the court did not,however,require in its constitutional test that the disclosed information be purely factual and uncontroversial.some lower courts have recited,without discussion,the purely factual and uncontroversial language as part of the zauderer test.see,ass of mfrs,cir.but whatever may be the complexities of applying the standard in discrete situations,as a matter of precedent,an obligation in the commercial sphere to disclose purely factual and uncontroversial information about a product draws deferential first amendment review.safelite,jepsen,cir.on a cursory review,our precedent arguably supports the district court conclusion that this law simply requires disclosure of accurate,factual information.cent.illinois light citizens util,cir.in zauderer,the court held that ohio could constitutionally require an attorney to include in a commercial advertisement,purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which the attorney services are available.
given that the purpose of the compelled disclosure is to provide accurate factual information to the consumer,we agree that any compelled disclosure must be purely factual.however,uncontroversial in this context refers to the factual accuracy of the compelled disclosure,not to its subjective impact on the audience.this is clear from zauderer itself.the state of ohio required attorneys to disclose the client potential liability for costs even if her suit were unsuccessful.zauderer,at.ohio law permitted attorneys to charge clients for costs even after advertising and agreeing to represent their clients on a basis and losing the suit.recognizing that the difference between fees and costs might not be apparent to prospective clients,ohio required attorneys to disclose that a contingency fee arrangement might still require the client to pay some money to the attorney.this required disclosure was factually accurate.that the disclosure may have caused controversy,for example by discouraging customers from hiring lawyers who offered arrangements because they feared hidden costs or by harming the reputation of the lawyers who offered such fee arrangements,did not affect the constitutional analysis.what mattered was that the disclosure provided accurate factual information to the consumer.we therefore conclude that zauderer requires only that the information be purely factual.
application of zauderer test 
under zauderer,compelled disclosure of commercial speech complies with the first amendment if the information in the disclosure is reasonably related to a substantial governmental interest and is purely factual.the question before us is whether the speech compelled by the berkeley ordinance satisfies this test.
reasonably related to a substantial governmental interest 
there is no question that protecting the health and safety of consumers is a substantial governmental interest.see,posadas de puerto rico assocs.tourism of puerto rico,h ealth,safety,and welfare constitute a substantial governmental interest.the federal government and berkeley have both sought to further that interest.by adopting sar limits on exposure to rf radiation,the fcc has furthered the interest of protecting the health and safety of cell phone users in the united states.it has done so by adopting a highly protective policy,setting low sar limits on rf radiation and compelling cell phone manufacturers to disclose information to cell phone users that will allow them to avoid exceeding those limits.by passing its ordinance,the city of berkeley has furthered that same interest.after finding that cell phone users are largely unaware of the fcc policy and of the information in their user manuals,the berkeley city council decided to compel retailers in berkeley to provide,in summary form,the same information that the fcc already requires cell phone manufacturers to provide to those same consumers,and to direct those consumers to their user manuals for more detailed information.see jensen,ex.a survey reflecting that a majority of persons surveyed were not aware that the government radiation tests to assure the safety of cell phones assume that a cell phone would not be carried against your body,but would instead be held at least to millimeters from your body.
ctia argues strenuously that radiation from cell phones has not been proven dangerous to consumers.limiting itself to research published when the record was made in this case,ctia is correct in pointing out that there was nothing then before the district court showing that such radiation had been proven dangerous.but this is beside the point.the fact that rf radiation from cell phones had not been proven dangerous was well known to the fcc in when it adopted sar limits to rf radiation was well known in when it refused to exclude cell phones from its rule adopting sar limits and was well known in when it required cell phone manufacturers to tell consumers how to avoid exceeding sar limits.after extensive consultation with federal agencies with expertise about the health effects of radiation,the fcc decided,despite the lack of proof of dangerousness,that the best policy was to adopt sar limits with a large margin of safety.
the fcc concluded that requiring cell phone manufacturers to inform consumers in their users manuals of sar limits on rf radiation,and to tell them how to avoid excessive exposure,furthered the federal government interest in protecting their health and safety.the city of berkeley concluded that consumers were largely unaware of the contents of their users manuals.agreeing with the fcc that the information about sar limits and methods of avoiding excessive exposure is important,berkeley requires cell phone retailers to provide some of that same information to consumers and to direct them to their user manuals for further details.we are not in a position to disagree with the conclusions of fcc and berkeley that this compelled disclosure is reasonably related to protection of the health and safety of consumers.
ii.purely factual 
ctia argues that berkeley compelled disclosure is not purely factual within the meaning of zauderer.we disagree.
for the convenience of the reader,we again provide the full text of the compelled disclosure 
the city of berkeley requires that you be provided the following notice 
to assure safety,the federal government requires that cell phones meet rf exposure guidelines.if you carry or use your phone in a pants or shirt pocket or tucked into a bra when the phone is on and connected to a wireless network,you may exceed the federal guidelines for exposure to rf radiation.refer to the instructions in your phone or user manual for information about how to use your phone safely.
berkeley mun.code a.
the text of the compelled disclosure is literally true.we take it sentence by sentence 
to assure safety,the federal government requires that cell phones meet rf exposure guidelines.this statement is true.as recounted above,beginning in the federal government has set rf exposure guidelines with which cell phones must comply.
if you carry or use your cell phone in a pants or shirt pocket or tucked into a bra when the phone is on and connected to a wireless network,you may exceed the federal guidelines for exposure to rf radiation.this statement is also true.the fcc has established sar limits for rf radiation,and has concluded that maintaining a certain separation between a cell phone and the user body protect consumers from exceeding these limits.
refer to the instructions in your phone or user manual for information about how to use your phone safely.this sentence is an instruction rather than a direct factual statement.however,it clearly implies a factual statement that information about how to use your phone safely in compliance with the fcc rf exposure guidelines to assure safety,may be found either in a cell phone or user manual.this implied statement,too,is true.
we recognize,of course,that a statement may be literally true but nonetheless misleading and,in that sense,untrue.that is what ctia argues here.ctia argues that the compelled disclosure is inflammatory and misleading,and that it is therefore not purely factual.ctia bases its argument solely on the text of the ordinance.
ctia argues that t he ordinance requires an inflammatory warning about unfounded safety risks that t he ordinance clearly and deliberately suggests that the federal rf energy testing guideline the sar limit is the demarcation point of safety for cell phones,such that exposure to rf energy above that limit creates a safety hazard and that t he ordinance is misleading for the additional reason that it uses the inflammatory term radiation,which is fraught with negative associations,in order to stoke consumer anxiety.ctia argues further that the phrase rf radiation is fraught with negative associations,that it is used in the compelled disclosure in order to stoke consumer anxiety,and that it is therefore not purely factual.
we read the text differently.the first sentence tells consumers that cell phones are required to meet federal rf exposure guidelines in order t o assure safety.far from inflammatory,this statement is largely reassuring.it assures consumers that the cell phones they are about to buy or lease meet federally imposed safety guidelines.
the second sentence tells consumers what to do in order to avoid exceeding federal guidelines.this statement may not be reassuring,but it is hardly inflammatory.it provides in summary form information that the fcc has concluded that consumers should know in order to ensure their safety.indeed,the fcc specifically requires cell phone manufacturers to provide this information to consumers.see fcc exposure procedures d specific information must be included in the operating manuals to enable users to select accessories that meet the minimum test separation distance requirements.all supported accessory operating configurations must be clearly disclosed to users,through conspicuous instructions in the user guide and user manual,to ensure unsupported operations are avoided.emphasis added.
the third sentence tells consumers to consult their user manuals to obtain further information that is,to obtain the very information the fcc requires cell phone manufacturers to provide in conspicuous instructions in user manuals.
further,the phrase rf radiation,used in the second sentence,is precisely the phrase the fcc has used,beginning in,to refer to emissions from cell phones.see fcc guidelines for radio frequency radiation at,supra at rf radiation.we do not fault berkeley for using the term rf radiation when referring to cell phone emissions when it is not only the technically correct term,but also the term the fcc itself uses to refer to such emissions.
finally,we note that the berkeley ordinance allows a cell phone retailer to add to the compelled disclosure.if a retailer is concerned,as ctia contends it should be,that the term rf radiation is inflammatory and misleading,the retailer may add to the compelled disclosure any further statement it sees fit to add.see b the paper on which the notice is printed may contain other information in the discretion of the cell phone retailer.ctia has put nothing in the record to indicate that any berkeley retailer has felt it necessary,or even useful,to add explanatory information about the nature of rf radiation.nor has ctia presented any evidence in the district court showing how berkeley consumers have understood the compelled disclosure,or evidence showing that sales of cell phones in berkeley were,or are likely to be,depressed as a result of the compelled disclosure.
likelihood of success 
based on the foregoing,we conclude that ctia has little likelihood of success on its first amendment claim that the disclosure compelled by the berkeley ordinance is unconstititutional.
preemption 
conflict preemption 
federal preemption occurs when congress enacts a statute that explicitly preempts state law state law actually conflicts with federal law or federal law occupies a legislative field to such an extent that it is reasonable to conclude that congress left no room for state regulation in the legislative field.chae slm,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.ctia contends that berkeley compelled disclosure is invalid because of conflict preemption.
conflict preemption is implicit preemption of state law that occurs where there is an actual conflict between state and federal law.mcclellan,cir.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.when congress charges an agency with balancing competing objectives,it intends the agency to use its reasoned judgment to weigh the relevant considerations and determine how best to prioritize those objectives.allowing a state law to impose a different standard impermissibly permits a of those objectives.farina nokia,cir.conflict preemption arises either when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.mcclellan,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we are concerned here with obstacle preemption.ctia contends that berkeley compelled disclosure creates an impermissible obstacle by requiring more disclosure than is required by the fcc.see crosby foreign trade council,finding preemption where a challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.internal quotation marks omitted.

the centerpiece of ctia argument is that the fcc does not compel cell phone manufacturers to provide information to consumers about sar limits on rf radiation exposure.ctia did not make this argument in the district court.indeed,it conceded in its briefing in the district court that the fcc did so require.see,plaintiff reply in support of motion for a preliminary injunction at the manner in which berkeley requires ctia members to deliver berkeley message at the point of sale,rather than in a user manual also distinguishes the ordinance from the fcc requirements.emphasis added.ctia made this argument for the first time in its reply brief in this court,and it repeated the argument during oral argument to our panel.
