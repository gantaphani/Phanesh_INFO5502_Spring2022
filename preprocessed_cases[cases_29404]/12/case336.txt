background 
procedural history 
in january of,plaintiff petitioned utu general chairman elswick to represent him in a grievance action to recover thirty shares of csx common stock which plaintiff claimed were owed to him under a labor agreement between utu and csx.elswick informed plaintiff that he did not qualify for the shares because he was not in active service as a trainman as of november,a required condition,according to elswick,for distribution of csx shares under the labor agreement.plaintiff appealed elswick determination to the utu board of appeals,the union internal appeals board.the board of appeals ruled that plaintiff was entitled to the thirty shares of stock and instructed elswick to proceed with plaintiff claim.elswick removed himself from the action and appointed utu robert earley to represent plaintiff in arbitration proceedings.
on may,public law board plb,a private arbitration panel created pursuant to the rla,convened a hearing at the baltimore,maryland offices of csx to consider whether plaintiff was entitled to the distribution of csx stock under the labor agreement.prior to the start of the hearing,the three plb members,earley,as utu representative for plaintiff,howard emerick,as the senior director of csx,and raymond cluster,as plb chair and neutral arbitrator,requested that everyone else leave the room so that they could hold an executive session.executive sessions are held at plb hearings to discuss pending cases,resolve procedural matters,or determine matters remaining from previous plb hearings.plaintiff,who had brought two tape recorders with him to record the plb proceedings,left the recorders in the room while the executive session was held.the executive session was then recorded,unbeknownst to the plb members,the tape of which plaintiff listened to following the hearing.on july,the plb decided that plaintiff was not entitled to the shares of csx stock under the labor agreement.
internal union actions against earley 
on december,plaintiff filed internal union charges against earley.plaintiff wrote to thompson,chair of the utu executive board,presenting formal charges against earley for breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing as a union representative at the plb hearing.on january,earley was notified by the executive board that it would proceed with the charges brought against him by plaintiff.a disciplinary hearing was set for march.
on march,lance ruck,a member of the utu,filed a charge with the executive board against earley after reviewing both tape and transcript copies of the executive session.see earley executive bd.of the utu.in that charge,ruck alleged that earley argued against the official position of the utu in the executive session.he also alleged that earley therefore failed to perform his duties as required by the utu.ruck stated that his claims against earley were for the same wrongdoing as those alleged by plaintiff.
earley action against plaintiff 
on march,earley filed an action against plaintiff in the united states district court for the district of maryland requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on grounds that plaintiff taping of the executive session violated the act as well as the maryland statute.cts.jud.proc.code,et.on march,earley moved for a temporary restraining order to prohibit plaintiff from using or disclosing the substance of the executive session tapes at a trial before the executive board.on march,the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting plaintiff from participating in the utu internal proceedings against earley.see earley smoot.plaintiff was further ordered to refrain from using the executive session tapes except in connection with his defense against earley action under the act.see executive board.at.the district court then transferred the action to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.id.on october,the district court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting plaintiff from using or disclosing the tape recording of the executive session,which was subsequently vacated on january.id.at.the district court found that plaintiff had intentionally recorded the executive session in violation of the act.
plaintiff action against csx and utu csx and utu counterclaims 
on march,plaintiff filed his complaint in this action,alleging that the plb decision should be set aside,that the utu breached its duty of fair representation,and that csx breached the labor agreement.plaintiff attached a transcript copy of the executive session tapes as exhibit a to his complaint.on april,the utu filed a counterclaim,alleging that plaintiff violated the act by taping the executive session and subsequently disclosing and using the illegally intercepted communications.on may,csx also filed a counterclaim under the act.
also on may,csx filed a motion to strike exhibit a from plaintiff complaint,or,in the alternative,to seal the exhibit.on may,the district court held a case management conference,at which plaintiff agreed to withdraw exhibit a from his complaint.
subsequently,both utu and csx filed motions for summary judgment,to which plaintiff filed responses pro se.on february,new counsel made an appearance on behalf of plaintiff.counsel filed supplemental briefs in opposition to the motions for summary judgment.
on january,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of utu and csx as to plaintiff claims.the district court held that the plb award should not be set aside under the limited standard of review governing arbitration awards under the rla.the district court also found no material facts in dispute to support a claim that the utu had breached its duty of fair representation.
on march,the district court conducted a bench trial on the utu and csx counterclaims under the act.the district court found that plaintiff was not credible and had intentionally recorded the executive session and then distributed the illegal interception in violation of the act.the district court awarded and in statutory damages to utu and csx respectively,in connection with thirteen violations committed by plaintiff under the act.the district court also found that plaintiff violations were willful,wanton and reckless,and thereby awarded utu and csx each in punitive damages pursuant to b,as well as finding utu and csx entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs under b.
utu and csx filed motions for attorneys fees.on september,two days before the date set for the hearing on attorneys fees,plaintiff filed an opposition to the utu and csx requests.the district court determined that plaintiff response was not timely.on september,the district court held a hearing on attorneys fees,which plaintiff failed to attend.on september,the district court awarded csx in fees and costs.on october,the district court awarded utu in fees and costs.on october,plaintiff filed his notice of appeal,appealing from the district court awards of summary judgment,statutory and punitive damages,as well as attorneys fees and costs in favor of defendants.
ii.substantive history 
plaintiff is employed by csx,a virginia corporation,and is a member of utu,an unincorporated labor organization headquartered in cleveland,ohio.in october of,utu and csx negotiated a new labor agreement which included a provision for the contribution of thirty shares of csx common stock into the retirement plan account of train service employees who satisfied the eligibility rules under the labor agreement.
in,plaintiff held both train and engine service seniority with csx.as of november,plaintiff was employed in engine service,but not train service,which elswick interpreted as precluding plaintiff eligibility for the csx stock distribution under the labor agreement.
the may,plb hearing was held to determine plaintiff eligibility for the csx stock.plaintiff brought two tape recorders to the hearing,to record the proceedings.at trial,there was conflicting testimony as to whether plaintiff set the tape recorders on the table in front of him.no one else at the hearing saw or was aware of the tape recorders.plaintiff testified that when he was told to leave the room,so that the plb members could hold the executive session,he placed all of his belongings,including the tape recorders,in a bag which he left in the room where the executive session was then held.the tape recorders,inside plaintiff bag,recorded the executive session.plaintiff did not request permission from anyone to record either the plb hearing or the executive session.
on his way home from the hearing,plaintiff listened to the tape recordings of the executive session.plaintiff later played the tapes for howard goodloe,joe ely and danny mills,three members of utu local located in virginia.plaintiff later called ruck,a utu member in texas,and told him about the tapes.in june of,plaintiff sent ruck a copy of the tapes.
several months later,plaintiff made arrangements to have the tapes transcribed by a court reporter in virginia.on october,plaintiff sent copies of the transcript to thomas dubose,international president of the utu,at his office in cleveland,ohio,and to another utu official,sargent,in an attempt to have utu investigate earley conduct.dubose determined that there was nothing improper in earley conduct.plaintiff also provided copies of the transcript to thompson,located in missouri,in support of his internal union filing.plaintiff also provided a copy of the transcript to his attorney,in kentucky,who then attached the transcript to plaintiff complaint in this case.
in august of,plaintiff distributed the transcript to utu members attending a utu convention in atlanta.
discussion 
plaintiff argues that neither csx nor utu had standing to bring claims under the act.provides for civil relief under the act for any person whose wire,oral,or electronic communication is intercepted,disclosed,or intentionally used in violation of this chapter.defines person as any individual,partnership,association,joint stock company,trust,or corporation.whether a claimant has standing under the act is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.see united states bridwell grocery and video,cir.
csx standing 
plaintiff argues that csx did not have standing to bring its counterclaim because there was no evidence that the recorded executive session concerned csx business.however,this claim is inconsistent with the record,including plaintiff own complaint.plaintiff secretly tape recorded emerick,csx senior director of employee relations,at the plb executive session.emerick was csx designated representative on the plb.emerick job duties included representing csx at plb meetings.at the executive session,emerick was meeting with two other persons,on csx property,to adjust grievances by csx employees.plaintiff own complaint stated 
all actions taken by emerick as a member of plb were within the scope of emerick employment with csx also emerick performed all acts referred to herein with the full cloak of authority and with complete agreement and acquiescence of csx in all actions he took as a member of plb.finally,all actions of emerick and the consequences thereof are directly imputable to csx.
csx cites two cases in support of organizations having standing to bring claims under the act.in hatchigian local union,wl,dist.lexis,the court found that a labor union had standing to bring a claim under on the following grounds 
d efendant local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers also has standing.person is defined by to include any association,thereby including a union local the use of the term whose in the statute confers standing upon those who have a possessory interest in the communication.individual defendant mackin was the local business manager.the conversation allegedly took place over a union telephone and concerned the local affairs.under these alleged circumstances,the local had a possessory interest in the communication sufficient to confer standing upon it.
hatchigian,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
csx also cites pba local woodbridge police dep t,which,although finding the union not to have standing to bring a claim under,did so on grounds that the union did not have an identifiable injury under the act.specifically,there was no evidence that any conversations related to union activity had actually been intercepted w here there has been no interception,there can have been no injury.pba local.at citation omitted.in this case,plaintiff not only attached the intercepted conversation to his complaint,he then went on to specifically allege that emerick intercepted conduct was in fact csx conduct.
plaintiff argues that pba local and hatchigian do not cure one particular flaw in csx standing argument no evidence has shown the contents of the intercepted conversation to have belonged to csx,and thus no evidence has established that csx was a person whose communication was intercepted under.however,if csx does not have a possessory interest in the confidential statements made by its senior director of employee relations,acting as the designated representative for csx on the plb,at the executive session portion of a plb proceeding held on csx property,regarding grievance adjustments by csx employees,then it is difficult to conceive of a corporation or association ever having standing under the act.we find that csx,as a corporation,had standing to bring its counterclaim as a person whose communication was intercepted and disclosed in violation of the act under.
utu standing 
plaintiff also argues that utu did not have standing to bring a claim under the act,in that earley was acting in a specially designated independent capacity at the executive session as to negotiations over the shares of stock.specifically,plaintiff argues that because earley was the utu representative for plaintiff at the meeting,then earley could not have been acting at that time as a utu agent.
plaintiff cites no law in support of the position that when a vice president of a union represents a union member in a negotiation,that vice president ceases to act on behalf of the union.plaintiff does reference an affidavit by emerick to support his position that earley was not acting as agent for utu at the plb meeting.however,the emerick affidavit clearly stated that earley did not cease to be a utu representative when representing plaintiff at the meeting 
chairman cluster then called upon the utu to proceed.earley proceeded to present plaintiff claim the utu representatives,earley,elswick and sargent,along with plaintiff left the room for about ten minutes and when they returned earley asked on behalf of plaintiff whether plaintiff could submit post hearing information.
at.plaintiff offers no authority in support of his position that representing union members is not part of the work of union representatives.absent such authority,we find that earley role at the plb meeting as utu representative for plaintiff,rather than as utu representative per se,does not sever the agency relationship between earley and the utu.just as plaintiff,in his complaint,imputed emerick actions at the plb meeting to csx,earley actions,as utu representative,are imputable to utu.therefore,utu,an association,had standing as a person whose communication was intercepted and disclosed in violation of the act under.
ii.substantial evidence 
plaintiff argues that the district court finding that plaintiff intentionally recorded the plb executive session was against the weight of the evidence.this court reviews a district court factual findings on intent under a clearly erroneous standard.see west fred wright construction,cir.a finding of fact will be deemed clearly erroneous only where it is against the clear weight of the evidence or when upon review of the evidence,the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.citations and internal quotations omitted.when factual findings rest upon credibility determinations,this court affords great deference to the findings of the district court.schroyer frankel,cir.
the following facts are undisputed.plaintiff brought two tape recorders to the plb hearing to have a complete record of the proceedings.plaintiff turned the recorders on prior to the start of the plb hearing,without requesting or receiving permission from anyone to record the proceedings.the plb members did not give plaintiff permission to record their discussion during the executive session.plaintiff,upon being told by the plb members to leave the room so that the executive session could be held,left his bag in the hearing room,which contained the tape players that recorded the executive session.when finding,on these facts,that plaintiff intended to intercept oral communications made during the executive session,the district court noted 
plaintiff testified at trial that he inadvertently left the tape recorders on during the executive session this court,however,did not find plaintiff to be a credible witness several times during his testimony,plaintiff was impeached with his own answers to defendant csx request for admissions and the statement of admitted or stipulated facts.this court does not credit plaintiff testimony that he did not intentionally intercept,disclose,and use the communications made during the executive session of the public law board.this court did find the trial testimony of howard emerick,robert earley,and kim thompson credible.accordingly,all conflicting testimony is resolved against plaintiff.
plaintiff testimony conflicted with the testimony of earley and emerick.plaintiff testified that he placed the tape recorders on the table in the hearing room before the start of proceedings.earley and emerick testified that they did not see any tape recorders at any time.earley stated,at the commencement of the hearing,the only thing that was on the table was the tablets,the briefs that were filed,and pens and pencils.at.earley responded specifically that he did not see any tape recorders on the table during the hearing.emerick testified that at the hearing he sat almost directly across the narrow end of the table,probably no more than four feet from plaintiff.at.emerick also testified that he did not see any tape recorders on the table,which,had they been there,he would assuredly have been able to see.at.the district court,as it expressly stated,resolved the conflicting testimony on whether plaintiff had placed the tape recorders on the table in front of him against plaintiff.
given the conflicting testimony on whether plaintiff initially placed the tape recorders in plain sight,the suspicious circumstances of leaving a bag containing running recorders in a meeting room that plaintiff had been asked to leave,and the deference this court affords district court credibility determinations,we find the district court determination that plaintiff intended to record the executive session not to have been clearly erroneous.
iii.statutory damages 
plaintiff argues that the district court award of in statutory damages to defendants was in violation of c b as well as several exceptions to damages recognized by this court.specifically,plaintiff argues that i under dorris absher,cir,c b establishes a statutory award per claimant ii under nix,cir,the adjudication and defense exceptions should have shielded plaintiff from liability as to plaintiff distribution of the transcript to his lawyer and the attachment of the transcript to his complaint iii under smith securities and exchange commission,cir,plaintiff filing of the executive session transcript with the district court in march of should have shielded plaintiff from liability as to the distribution and iv plaintiff should not be liable for any disclosure by ruck,who was not plaintiff agent.this court reviews a district court award of damages based on statutory interpretation de novo.see structures,structures,cir.
the compensatory damages provision of the act,c,reads as follows 
c computation of damages.
in any other action under this section,the court may assess as damages whichever is the greater of 
a the sum of the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff and any profits made by the violator as a result of the violation or 
b statutory damages of whichever is the greater of a day for each day of violation or.
this court in dorris held that under c b,the liquidated damages amount may not be applied per violation of the act if the violations are sufficiently interrelated and.dorris,at.specifically,the is designed to compensate a plaintiff for all of the transgressor misdeeds under the act arising out of a closely related course of conduct that takes place over a relatively short period of time.id.this court in dorris also noted,w e need not decide whether violations of the act widely separated by time,place,or people would lead to a different result,because the question is not currently before us.dorris,at.dorris involved an span in which a director secretly recorded conversations among four employees,played the recording for his wife and two friends,and then terminated two of the employees based on information gained from the recordings.
plaintiff argues,under dorris,that his conduct was closely related and occurred over a relatively short period of time,and thus his statutory damages should be limited to a of per claimant under c b.both utu and csx argue that plaintiff violations were widely separated by time,place,and people,requiring separate statutory awards under the dorris reading of c b.
utu argues that nine of plaintiff violations of the act do not form a closely related course of conduct eight of which occurring over a ten month period,and the ninth four years after plaintiff initial violation.plaintiff violations also occurred in six states,involving disclosure to at least eleven different persons 
unlike dorris,the violations in this case did not occur over an span or involve a handful of people in one location.rather,as detailed above,the violations occurred over a series of months and,in one case,years,involving multiple parties in multiple states.we therefore must address the widely separated question left unanswered by this court in dorris.
currently,only one circuit has directly addressed,in the case of widespread violations of the act,whether the liquidated damages amount under c b is to be applied per violation.in desilets stores,cir,the first circuit held that,for each claimant,statutory damages under c b are limited to unless violations of the act occurred on more than one hundred separate days.the desilets court found that an eighth circuit case,bess bess,cir,did not support a per violation application of statutory damages under c b.specifically,the desilets court found the following 
the bess court did not hold that interception and disclosure by the same person warrants multiple liquidated awards under the act.if the opinion in bess supports any view,it supports a view consistent with our own interpretation of the damages provision that the number of days of violation determines the amount of a liquidated damages award,and not the number of discrete violations on any given day,nor the different types of violations that might occur.
desilets,at.
we agree that bess is consistent with the desilets rule that statutory damages under c b are limited to unless violations of the act occurred on more than one hundred separate days.claimant action in bess was brought prior to the amendment to the act under the former,a claimant could collect statutory damages equal to the greater of per day of violation or.the amendment to raised the liquidated damages amount to.claimant in bess had introduced twelve tapes of intercepted phone conversations,each tape representing one day of interception.bess,at.the interceptions occurred in.the magistrate judge,finding the interceptions to have occurred on twelve separate days,awarded claimant in statutory damages under the former.on appeal,the bess court found that an additional violation occurred in,which raised the total number of violations to thirteen.the bess court awarded claimant an additional in damages,bringing claimant total statutory damages under to.id.at.
the bess court did not consider whether the additional violation,which occurred two years after the twelve violations,might have entitled claimant to an additional,rather than,under the former.although the bess court noted that claimant made no argument that the statute entitled her to more than the per day figure,bess,at,the desilets court interpreted this statement as referring to the possibility of collecting more than per day because the violation on the additional day was of a different type,being a disclosure rather than an interception.desilets,at.given claimant statutory award in bess,and the bess court ambiguous note that claimant had only argued for the per day figure,we agree with the first circuit in desilets that if bess supports any view on statutory damages under c b,it supports a view consistent with the desilets rule that a claimant may be awarded over in statutory damages only if violations of the act occurred on more than one hundred separate days.
we find that the liquidated damages amount under c b is not to be applied per violation of the act,for three reasons.first,the precedential support of dorris,desilets and bess.second,as this court explained in dorris,the amount under c b,unlike the amount,has no per violation authorization.congress knows how to specify an award that is to be multiplied on the basis of the frequency of the violation,because it did so by providing for damages of per day for each day of violation.dorris,at.third,as detailed below,applying the amount per violation would render the a day provision meaningless.
we are required to construe the language of a statute so as to avoid making any word meaningless or superfluous.see fulps city of springfield,cir citing yamaguchi state farm mutual auto.insurance,cir zimmerman north american signal,cir.therefore,we must consider the meaning of the a day for each day of violation provision within the statutory damages scheme of c b.
congress,in its amendment to,raised the minimum liquidated damages amount from to,but left the a day for each day of violation provision unchanged.if the amount were to be applied per violation,the only way for the a day provision to retain meaning,that is,to possibly result in an award of damages greater than,would be if over one hundred days of violation were somehow included within one discrete violation of the act.some courts have understood violation in a manner that may be consistent with such an approach,finding several days of prohibited activity to constitute one violation however,finding multiple days of prohibited activity as falling under one violation is directly contrary to this court decision in dorris,as well as the first circuit in desilets and the eighth circuit in bess,which all found violations corresponding to particular actions or to several actions on a particular day moreover,deal and campiti found days or weeks,not months,of activity to have occurred within one discrete violation.
upon review of pertinent case law,we find it implausible that more than one hundred days of violation would fall under one overarching violation of the act.because such an implausibility would be required under a per violation reading of c b that nevertheless retained meaning for the a day provision,we find that the liquidated damages amount under c b should not be applied per violation of the act.
we also agree with the first circuit that liquidated damages under c b should not be awarded per type of violation of the act.certainly,each interception separately injures a victim,as does each disclosure,and each intentional use of intercepted conversations.but c b describes only one inclusive method for calculating damages.desilets,at.we find it counterintuitive that multiple interceptions by one defendant on multiple days could collectively give rise to one award of liquidated damages,while one day of isolated actions,by that same defendant,of one interception,one disclosure,and one intentional use,could give rise to three.therefore,we agree with the first circuit in desilets that statutory damages under c b should depend only on the number of days on which the act was violated,rather than on whether the act was violated by a prohibited interception,disclosure,or intentional use.a particular defendant liability under c b should not turn on the consistency or variety of his violations.while measuring damages by days of violation does create the possibility of treating different defendants similarly since single and multiple violations on any given day both count as one,at least this imbalance arises from the plain language of c b,rather than treating one disclosure and one use differently from two interceptions,a position whose statutory foundation we have not been able to divine.
by following the desilets understanding of c b,we answer the unexplored question in dorris,whether violations of the act widely separated by time,place,or people would lead to a result different from applying the liquidated damages amount per claimant rather than per violation.dorris,at.thus,the provisional interrelated and qualifier in dorris need not apply to questions of damages under c b rather,the straightforward rule of desilets,that a claimant may be awarded more than in damages under c b only if violations of the act occurred on more than one hundred separate days,may now control.the liquidated damages amount under c b is designed to compensate a claimant for all of a transgressor misdeeds under the act,unless that transgressor has violated the act on more than one hundred separate days,in which case compensation is for each such day.
while adopting the desilets rule will reduce plaintiff liability in this case,plaintiff is not further assisted by any of the various liability exceptions that he has argued on appeal.first,the defense and adjudication exceptions under nix do not apply to plaintiff distribution of the executive session transcript to his lawyer or the attachment of the transcript to plaintiff complaint because plaintiff was not,at that time,defending against charges brought under the act see nix,at.
second,plaintiff filing of the executive session transcript with the district court in march of does not,under smith,shield plaintiff from liability in connection with the distribution.the smith court found as follows 
although the act provides for a separate cause of action for each individual disclosure of an unlawfully intercepted communication,it does not proscribe the disclosure of information that has become part of the public record.
smith,at citing fultz gilliam,cir spatafore united states,cir fleming united states,cir.
plaintiff argues that because the executive session transcript became part of the public record when he filed the transcript with his complaint,plaintiff is not liable,under smith,for the subsequent distribution.however,in response to csx motion to strike the transcript from plaintiff complaint,the transcript was removed from the record in may of.even assuming that this court in smith understood information that has become part of the public record to include information that was publically available for three months in,the public record exception under smith,fultz,spatafore,and fleming does not shield plaintiff from liability in this case.
in smith,plaintiff had not opposed a motion by the securities and exchange commission to unseal transcripts filed with the united states district court for the central district of california,thereby obviating any argument on plaintiff part that the transcripts should not be part of the public record.smith,at.conversely,in this case csx opposed plaintiff filing of the executive session transcript,which plaintiff then agreed to withdraw from the record.further,both spatafore and fleming concerned admission into evidence of legally obtained wiretap evidence that had already been made part of the public record in prior criminal prosecutions.fultz referenced the legislative history of the act,which stated that disclosure of intercepted communication
