appellant kennith shroyer filed a class action against new cingular wireless services,a corporation resulting from the merger of at t wireless services,and cingular wireless corporation.at the time of the merger in,shroyer had a contract for wireless telephone services with at t.he alleged that,immediately following the merger,his cellular phone service was severely degraded.he claimed that new cingular disregarded its obligations under the existing at t contract by failing to provide adequate service coverage and requiring shroyer to sign a different contract with new cingular if he desired to get the service that at t had contracted to provide under the first agreement.he also claimed that new cingular misrepresented and omitted key facts about the consequence of the merger to the federal communications commission fcc,and that the fcc would not have approved the merger if it had known that new cingular planned to ignore the obligations of existing at t contracts.on these allegations,he made claims for breach of contract fraud and deceit unfair competition under cal.bus.and a demand for a declaratory judgment 
the district court granted new cingular b motion to dismiss each of the claims,and shroyer appeals.we affirm the denial of the declaratory judgment and the dismissal of the fraud and unfair competition claims,but we reverse the dismissal of the breach of contract claim.
federal preemption 
new cingular argues that shroyer claims are preempted by.c a because the claims challenge the quality and rates of service,and those areas are reserved exclusively to the fcc.we reject this contention with regard to shroyer breach of contract claim and his misrepresentation claim.in the main,shroyer is challenging new cingular rates and quality of service only insofar as they are contrary to the ones to which he had contractual rights or were misrepresented he is not asking the court to rule on the reasonableness of a particular rate,and the quality of service is an issue only as it relates to,or was misrepresented as satisfying,the contract on which he sues.the claims are state law claims that do not tread on the fcc exclusive power to regulate rates and market entry.to the degree,however,that shroyer unfair competition claim alleges unfairness resulting from the merger itself or its approval by the fcc,it is.
section provides n o state or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service,except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a state from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services.c a.the fcc has stated that does not prevent states from deciding whether under state law,there was a difference between promise and performance of the terms and conditions of a contract.in re wireless consumers alliance.in that opinion,the fcc reject ed arguments by cellular phone service providers that and consumer fraud claims are in fact disguised attacks on the reasonableness of the rate charged for the service.id.new cingular would have this court rely on bastien v.at t wireless,cir,to hold that the substance of shroyer claims is really an attack on the service,and that deciding the case would necessarily involve regulating the modes and conditions under which new cingular may begin offering service.but the fcc rejected this per se argument in in re wireless consumers alliance,and so do we 
bastien dealt with a at t wireless consumer who was dissatisfied with the signal he was receiving on his cellular phone.he alleged that at t breached its contract and violated a state consumer protection statute by failing to build sufficient cell towers and misrepresenting the quality of its services.bastien,at.the seventh circuit held that although some of the claims sounded in traditional state law,they were all founded on the fact that at t wireless had not built more towers and more fully developed its network at the time bastien tried to use the system.id.at.the fcc has interpreted bastien to hold that it is the substance of the claim,not its form,that determines preemption.in re wireless consumers alliance,at.new cingular correctly asserts that in both that case and here,the plaintiffs challenged the level of service they received as wireless customers.but the important difference lies in the theories on which they based their challenges.the plaintiff in bastien was asking the court to decide the requisite number of cellular towers needed to support service.here,on the other hand,shroyer is asking the court to decide whether new cingular has performed its promise in a contract and whether it misrepresented the level of service it would provide.the latter inquiries are ones that,as interpreted in wireless,leaves open to state adjudication similarly,a court does not have to determine the reasonableness of rates to decide shroyer fraud claim,for a carrier may charge whatever price it wishes and provide the level of service it wishes,as long as it does not misrepresent either the price or the quality of service.in re wireless consumers alliance,at.consequently,the fraud claim,like shroyer other claims,is not preempted by.
furthermore,bastien dealt with market entry,which the states are expressly excluded from regulating by.shroyer breach of contract claim does not.shroyer claims that new cingular broke the terms of the contract when the service,support,and cellular phone reception significantly decreased.this breach of contract claim does not depend on whether new cingular service is above or below the proper standard for cell phone service its claim is that the level of service is other than that promised in shroyer cell phone contract.shroyer may or may not be able to prove his breach of contract claim,but the claim as stated is not preempted by although the bastien panel uses broad language to describe the type of claims that would be preempted,it is not persuasive here because bastien relied on authority that has been expressly rejected by the fcc.
the bastien panel stated that t here can be no doubt that congress intended complete preemption as to suits regarding rates and entry.bastien,at.a complaint that service quality is poor is really an attack on the rates charged for the service the act makes the fcc responsible for determining the number,placement and operation of the cellular towers and other infrastructure.id.at.bastien cites the supreme court case of at t central office telephone,as authority for the proposition that most consumer complaints will involve the rates charged by telephone companies or their quality of service.bastien,at.however,central office telephone found preemption based on the federal filed rate requirements of the communications act the fcc has stated that the filed rate doctrine does not apply to c questions.at.
rather,the fcc ruled that the award of monetary damages based on state contract or tort causes of action is not necessarily equivalent to rate regulation and thus is not generally by.see id.at.we agree that the breach of contract and misrepresentation claims of shroyer are not preempted.
elements of shroyer unfair competitition claim,however,depend on the assessment of the public benefit of the merger.that determination has already been made by the fcc,and reexamination of that issue under state law is preempted either by or by the ordinary principles of conflict.
ii.failure to state a claim 
we review de novo an order granting a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b gibson office of attorney,cir.we have held that dismissal for failure to state a claim is proper only where there is no cognizable legal theory or an absence of sufficient facts alleged to support a cognizable legal theory.navarro block,cir.in addition,to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief.ashcroft iqbal.
breach of contract 
shroyer sufficiently states a claim that new cingular breached its contract with him.he alleges that his service degraded after the merger,in violation of at t promise in the contract.he also alleges t
