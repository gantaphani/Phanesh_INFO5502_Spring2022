mobile communications operators mobile relay associates mra and skitronics petition for review of two orders of the federal communications commission fcc or commission reconfiguring the electromagnetic spectrum mhz band.the reconfiguration plan,which the commission established to eliminate interference with public safety communications,segregates different communications system architectures in separate segments of the band.under the plan,mra and skitronics,mhz licensees which operate specialized mobile radio smr systems that broadcast signals from a base station antenna situated at a high elevation,will be segregated from licensees who operate enhanced specialized mobile radio esmr systems,which use smaller and more numerous base stations and a cellular network architecture.pursuant to the plan restrictions licensees required to move to parts of the band set aside for smr use will be unable to use that spectrum to operate esmr services.mra and skitronics argue the reconfiguration plan arbitrarily treats them differently from similarly situated licensees,constitutes unlawful retroactive agency action and unconstitutionally takes their protected interest in spectrum.they also claim that the fcc overvalued spectrum offered by nextel communications,nextel pursuant to the spectrum migration.in addition mra claims that the commission was obligated to compensate it for its customer loss resulting from the migration.nextel and fellow esmr licensee southern linc intervene,arguing the commission orders are lawful.for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petition for review.
since the the fcc has licensed spectrum in the mhz band to a variety of licensees providing mobile communications.at that time technology did not allow for contiguous spectrum use by a single user so a large part of the mhz band was interleaved,with different kinds of communications technologies operating on adjacent frequencies in the band.improving public safety communications in the mhz band consolidating the mhz transportation and business pool channels,notice of proposed rule making nprm,wl.because of the minimal restrictions the commission placed on the band use,licensees operating in it have developed a number of different network architectures to provide mobile communications for users.one technology is a system,whose network architecture consists of a large antenna placed at a high elevation such as a tower,mountain,hilltop or tall building transmitting a signal across a roughly circular geographical area with the antenna at the center.in a system the system operator assigns a network user to one channel or frequency on which a base unit and all mobile radio units on that user network operate.signal propagation physics dictate that the farther a mobile unit is from the central antenna,the weaker the signal.id.at.
around the fcc began licensing mhz band spectrum use to public safety providers like police and fire departments and medical rescue teams,which use their spectrum space to develop and operate mobile communications systems by which first responders communicate with each other and with their dispatchers via or vehicular mobile radio units id.the commission also licensed frequencies in the band to commercial licensees using network architecture known as specialized mobile radio smr systems.the typical commercial service provided on an smr system is service for taxicab companies,service fleets and other businesses requiring mobile communications which,like public safety communications systems,use a dispatcher.the mobile units are all tuned to the same station and can both listen and respond.an smr licensee sells communications services to subscribers which use the licensee equipment and network architecture for mobile communications operations.
later mhz licensees developed enhanced smr,or esmr,systems.in an esmr system the system operator divides the service area into several multiple antenna sites,placed at a lower altitude,each of which is called a cell and operates at a lower power and covers a smaller area than an smr antenna unlike the smr system,in which the operator assigns the user a single channel for the entire service area,in the esmr system the same channel may be used in cells by different users at the same time.as the mobile unit moves from one cell to another,the communications link is automatically handed off to the next cell and the channel switches with no noticeable effect on the user.the esmr system can support a greater number of users than the smr system and,because it allows for a frequency reuse within the same system,is a more therefore more of spectrum.id.at.
the commission issued two types of mhz licenses for the two different system architectures.consistent with smr system use,the commission first issued a license to an mhz band operator,which license it granted free of charge and allowed the user to construct a transmitter at a specific site.the license gives the licensee the right to serve a particular area defined by the fcc via reference to the territory covered by the licensee proposed base station.in the the fcc began auctioning economic area ea licenses in the mhz band,which license authorized the licensee to serve a large geographic area,usually defined by political boundaries,from any site or sites the licensee chose,subject to the rights of incumbent licensees already licensed to operate in that geographic area.
as esmr system use increased,so too did interference with the public safety systems in the mhz band.the source of the interference was the overlap of the different architectures and their operations proximity on the spectrum,particularly where a public safety mobile or portable radio was within an esmr transmitter range.specifically,public safety radio users experienced coverage loss in areas where adequate coverage previously existed within their system.for example,if an en route police officer or firefighter near the outermost border of his network range attempted to communicate by portable radio with a distant base station and was also within the range of a,cell site using an adjacent band frequency,his communication could be disrupted and he could miss a critical transmission from his base station or be unable to call for assistance in the fcc initiated a rulemaking and solicited proposals to remedy the interference problem.nprm,wl.in response to the nprm a wireless service provider coalition including intervenor nextel,the largest mhz licensee and esmr system operator in the united states,proposed that the commission segregate and esmr systems into a separate block of the mhz band the consensus plan.nextel offered for public safety use part of its mhz spectrum holdings in what the fcc previously called the general category part of the band.because moving to a new part of the spectrum band is an expensive process,requiring retuning or even replacing the licensee and,for commercial operators,their customers equipment to operate on the new frequency,nextel also agreed to pay the costs associated with the relocation of all current mhz licensees.nextel,as an esmr provider,proposed to move its operations to a new block of spectrum in the mhz band dedicated exclusively to esmr operations.in exchange it also sought new spectrum in the ghz band 
in a report and order released on august,the commission largely adopted the consensus plan structural solution,dividing the mhz band into several smaller blocks and assigning esmr cellular operations,public safety and commercial smr operations to the appropriate blocks according to their respective network architectures.improving public safety communications in the mhz band consolidating the and mhz transportation and business pool channels,report and order,fifth report and order,fourth memorandum opinion and order,and order,wl rebanding decision the commission recognized the mhz band m√©lange of generally incompatible and cellular technologies as the root cause of the interference thus it decided that creating new frequency blocks and placing similar system architectures in like spectrum and isolating dissimilar architectures from one another would minimize interference.rebanding decision.the five smaller blocks of frequencies created by the rebanding decision are as follows 
a mhz spectrum block at the mhz band lower end dedicated exclusively to public safety radio communication systems the npspac block.all private users in this portion of the band must move to new spectrum.
an interleaved block for both public safety and private systems.most of the safety operators that remain in the interleaved block under the plan are smr licensees that operate systems.a licensee in the interleaved block can implement cellular architecture without prior approval from the commission so long as the licensee does not operate a high density cellular system as defines that term.a high density system uses especially low antenna sites and especially small cells esmr systems were the spectrum high density cellular systems that principally caused interference with public safety and commercial smr systems.
an expansion block and a guard block to provide additional spectral separation between esmr users and public safety and smr users.public safety channels currently operating on expansion block frequencies can relocate at their election.esmr operators can operate in the expansion and guard blocks subject to strict interference guidelines.rebanding decision.
the esmr block,reserved for licensees operating esmr systems.all esmr systems are required to migrate to the esmr block.no system can operate in the esmr block.the commission recognized that in some cases the proposed esmr block would not contain sufficient spectrum to accommodate all esmr users systems.accordingly,to allow intervenor southern linc,a large esmr operator in the southeast,to migrate to the esmr block,the commission expanded the size of the esmr block in those counties where southern linc provides service.rebanding decision.the commission allowed southern linc and nextel to reach a private arrangement regarding in the esmr block.
the rebanding decision required many mhz band users,including nextel and mra,to relocate to different parts of the spectrum.many smr and esmr licensees,for example,were located in what had been the general category block but was slated to become the new npspac block under the new configuration those licenseholders would have nonconforming operations and therefore had to move.the commission stated that it was committed to ensuring that the band reconfiguration would not result in the degradation of existing service,rebanding decision,and assigned relocation details to a transition administrator appointed by and reporting to the commission.id.at.to compensate nextel for its offer to pay all relocation costs,the commission adopted a value for value approach under which it would determine the value of the mhz spectrum nextel was forfeiting,plus relocation costs,and then offset that amount against the estimated value of the ghz replacement spectrum nextel requested as well as nextel spectrum in the new esmr block.rebanding decision.
mra,an smr licensee operating in colorado,provides communications services from four locations with overlapping service areas covering metropolitan denver.pet rs br.its licenses are all of the type.approximately half of its mhz band spectrum is located in the npspac block and those operations are thereby scheduled for migration to the interleaved block at nextel expense.the other half of its mhz band spectrum is already located in the interleaved block.under the reconfiguration mra will be unable to develop a esmr architecture network using its spectrum.skitronics,an smr licensee operating in the carolinas and west virginia,holds mhz and ea licenses in the interleaved block its licenses are located within the geographic boundaries of the ea licenses it subsequently acquired at auction it provides mobile communications via mobile dispatch services for taxicab companies,trucking companies and other small businesses.like mra,it also operates smr systems in each of its markets and its customers can manually to a new channel when passing out of the range of one cell and into another.id.at.mra and skitronics petition for review of the rebanding decision under a.

mra and skitronics make five challenges to the rebanding decision,claiming the fcc arbitrarily treated them differently from similarly situated intervenors nextel and southern linc engaged in unlawful retroactive rulemaking and,alternatively,even if its action constituted permissible secondary retroactivity under bowen georgetown university hospital,d,its action was unreasonable confiscated their spectrum rights without compensation in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution unreasonably declined to reimburse mra for churn,or loss of subscribers,due to migration and undervalued the new spectrum granted to nextel pursuant to the consensus plan.we believe that the first four claims lack merit and that mra and skitronics lack standing to bring the fifth.
mra and skitronics first claim they are similarly situated to nextel and southern linc in that they are mhz licensees operating smr systems.like nextel and southern linc,they also held spectrum rights which allowed them to develop more efficient architectures and to deploy newer equipment,convert to esmr.despite these similarities,however,under the rebanding decision the fcc assigned nextel and southern linc to the esmr block,which allows them to operate esmr systems,and assigned mra and skitronics to the interleaved block,which is dedicated to smr operations,thus depriving them of the flexibility to convert to esmr architecture in the future.mra and skitronics argue the commission therefore acted arbitrarily in allowing nextel and southern linc to move into the esmr block without affording them the same right.
despite the similarities they claim to share with nextel and southern linc,mra and skitronics acknowledged both to the commission during the rulemaking process and to us on brief that their current operations do not meet the commission definition of cellular under the rebanding decision.see improving public safety communications in the mhz band,reply mra comments,wt docket,at,mra holds numerous licenses used for both internal communications and service to customers,all of which operate using the same type of system architecture,high elevation,repeater transmitter,reaching mobile and portable units over a large geographic area as do most other traditional smr and public safety licensees in the mhz band.improving public safety communications in the mhz band,skitronics comments,wt docket,at may,skitronics presently only offers traditional smr mobile dispatch services pet rs br.mra system lacks capability id.at petitioners current operations do not meet the fcc definition of cellular for this proceeding,at least five overlapping cells with capability.this distinction alone is a sufficiently reasonable basis for the fcc different treatment of the smr and the esmr licensees.the commission stated purpose in its rebanding decision was to create distance on the spectrum between systems with,smr operators as well as esmr systems in order to reduce harmful interference caused by the esmr systems.see rebanding decision reconfiguration of the mhz band is intended to separate generally incompatible technologies whose current proximity to each other is the identified root cause of unacceptable interference.because the esmr systems caused the interference with public safety and smr systems,it was reasonable for the commission to segregate mra and skitronics,both smr system operators,from the new esmr block.
mra and skitronics rely on our decision in melody music fcc,for the proposition that the commission can not discriminate within a class of licenses.there the fcc refused to renew the license of a radio station operator who had secretly given assistance to contestants in answering questions on a number of television quiz shows the licensee had produced.at the same time,however,the commission,making no mention of the network role or lack of role in the deception,had granted several license renewals to nbc,which aired and for a time owned the tainted quiz shows.the radio station operator appealed the fcc denial of its request for license renewal and we concluded that the commission refusal at least to explain its different treatment of appellant and nbc was error.id.at.because the commission did not explain the relevance of those differences between nbc and the radio station to the purposes of the federal communications act,we remanded the matter for it to explain its decision to treat the two renewal applicants differently,given that both were connected with the deceptive practices and their renewal applications were considered by the commission at virtually the same time.id.at.in melody music,we concluded the fcc decision to treat the two licensees differently was arbitrary and capricious because it did not give an adequate explanation for doing so.see also data fcc,fcc explanation for not applying prior prevailing standard was intolerably mute rather than tolerably terse and therefore matter was remanded for more fully articulated rationale quoting action for children television fcc.here,by contrast,the fcc adequately explained its rationale for treating smr systems differently from esmr systems like those operated by mra and skitronics,as well as by public safety entities,suffered from interference due to the cellular architecture of licensees like nextel and southern linc.unlike the two licensees in melody music,the licensees here are not similarly and southern linc operate cellular systems and mra and skitronics do the fcc explained in detail why their differences justify differential treatment.see rebanding decision and cellular systems generally incompatible id.segregation will minimize unacceptable interference in the mhz band by placing similar system architectures in like spectrum and isolating dissimilar architectures from each other.the commission decision to authorize nextel and southern linc move to the esmr block but not to allow mra and skitronics the same move was eminently reasonable.
skitronics also claims the fcc engaged in retroactive rulemaking because skitronics had purchased eight ea mhz smr licenses at auction with the expectation that they could be used for a number of operations,including esmr operations,as business permitted with the rebanding decision,however,skitronics maintains,the commission retroactively impaired the skitronics right before the rebanding decision to use its eight ea licenses to operate an esmr system in the had bargained for at auction.
in their reply brief,mra and skitronics discussed the fcc reconsideration order which,inter alia,provided skitronics partial relief by allowing it and other ea licensees to move immediately to the esmr block with its entire system,including its systems,operating in the short term if it must,so long as it converts its entire system to esmr before the end of its current license term of march.pet rs reply br.citing improving public safety communications in the mhz band memorandum opinion and order,wl reconsideration order.while the rebanding decision had dedicated the esmr block exclusively for the use of esmr systems,the reconsideration order allowed licensees to relocate both their ea and licenses to the esmr block so long as the licenses were part of an integrated communications system at the time of the rebanding decision.reconsideration order because skitronics had an integrated communications system when the rebanding decision issued,it retains the ability to move to the esmr block so long as it converts to esmr by the end of its current license term.
still,despite the reconsideration order,skitronics claim is not moot.although skitronics now has the ability to move to the esmr block and convert to esmr architecture,it must convert to esmr by,a limitation on its license that would not exist were we to grant the relief it seeks on the merits,however,the retroactivity claim fails.retroactive rules alter the past legal consequences of past actions.bowen,at.scalia,concurring emphasis in original.however,an agency order that alters the future effect,not the past legal consequences of an action,sinclair broad.group fcc,or that upsets expectations based on prior law,directv,fcc,quotation omitted,is not retroactive.while the rebanding decision may have frustrated skitronics expectation that it would be able to operate an esmr system in its spectrum allotment,the effect of the rebanding decision is purely prospective.to conclude otherwise would hamstring not only the fcc in its spectrum management,but also any agency whose decision affects the financial expectations of regulated entities.as we stated in chemical waste management epa,
it is often the case that a business will undertake a certain course of conduct based on the current law,and will then find its expectations frustrated when the law changes.this has never been thought to constitute retroactive lawmaking,and indeed most economic regulation would be unworkable if all laws disrupting prior expectations were deemed suspect.
id.at.as in chemical waste management,skitronics finds its present range of options constrained by its own past actions the purchase of ea licenses at auction even though it could not have foreseen those consequences when the action occurred.this does not,however,make the rule a retroactive regulation.id.
secondary occurs if an agency rule affects a regulated entity investment made in reliance on the regulatory status quo before the rule be upheld if it is reasonable,if it is not arbitrary or capricious.directv,at citation omitted see sinclair,at if commission rule is a t most secondarily retroactive,the only question is whether the agency action is reasonable.the rebanding decision was reasonable because,as discussed earlier,the commission sought to segregate incompatible mobile communications architectures to reduce interference with public safety systems pursuant to its public interest mandate.see directv,at a change in policy is not arbitrary or capricious merely because it alters the current state of affairs.the commission is entitled to reconsider and revise its views as to the public interest and the means needed to protect that interest if it gives a reasoned explanation for the revision.quotation omitted.
mra and skitronics also make a constitutional claim in reconfiguring the mhz band the commission has unlawfully taken their property in violation of the takings clause because the segregation of the smr system architectures to parts of the mhz band that do not allow for conversion to esmr architecture reduces the value of their spectrum assignments.mra and skitronics held mhz smr spectrum licenses which,until the reconfiguration of that band,entitled them to operate either smr or cellular esmr systems and to progress from one mode to the other if business needs required.the fcc action deprives them of this flexibility without compensation,they argue,and therefore constitutes an unconstitutional taking.
the commission grants a licensee the right to the use of the spectrum for a set period of time but not the ownership thereof.see also fcc sanders.radio station.the policy of the communications act is clear that no person is to have anything in the nature of a property right as a result of the granting of a license.nbc fcc,spectrum is not the private property of any individual or group tamm,supporting order vacating grant of en banc rehearing and remand to fcc,cert.denied,d.moreover,the commission has the unilateral authority,provided it gives notice to the licensee,to modify a license either for a limited time or for the duration of the term thereof,if in the judgment of the commission such action will promote the public interest,convenience,and necessity.a.broadly defined,the licenses mra and skitronics hold confer the right to use the spectrum for a duration expressly limited by statute subject to the commission considerable regulatory power and authority.this right does not constitute a property interest protected by the fifth amendment.
mra next maintains that even if the fcc validly reconfigured the mhz band,it nonetheless acted arbitrarily in refusing to compensate mra for the inevitable customer loss,or chum,that it will suffer as a result of the migration.a migrating mhz smr can expect customer churn in the range of per cent when it migrates,mra claims,and its losses due to churn will amount to more than a million dollars.pet rs br.mra asserts the fcc failure to include compensation for churn in calculating nextel reimbursement of other relocation costs is arbitrary and capricious.not so.
mra estimates its customer loss based on an earlier migration from the mhz band that occurred when it sold mhz channels to nextel and moved its customers to systems operating below mhz.see notice of oral ex parte presentation,mra comments,wt docket,at.but mra estimate is too flimsy of a basis on which to challenge the commission reconfiguration.first,the customers channels were earlier moved out of the mhz completely therefore mra had to replace its customers handsets completely.but the reconfiguration under attack here requires simply retuning and consequently customer inconvenience here is not,as mra claims,exactly the same.see int rs br.and as the fcc points out,we have consistently upheld its decisions that impose considerable costs on private actors in the regulated industry.see,cmty.television,fcc,upholding rules requiring all broadcasters to convert from analog to digital.the commission reasonably decided not to compensate mra for churn.
finally mra and skitronics argue that the fcc improperly undervalued that part of the esmr block of the reconfigured mhz spectrum it granted nextel under the rebanding decision.the fcc argues that even if mra and skitronics are correct that it undervalued the spectrum granted to nextel,mra and skitronics have identified no injury traceable to the alleged overvaluation.furthermore,assuming mra and skitronics prevailed on the improper valuation claim,nextel would then be required to pay additional funds into the treasury pursuant to the agreement between it and the commission the possibility that mra and skitronics would receive the relief they cancellation of the rebanding on the theory that the commission would revalue relocation costs so high that nextel would withdraw its offer of compensation under the consensus plan is purely speculative.because mra and skitronics alleged injury is far from likely to be redressed by the commission,they lack standing to press their claim.resp t br.citing wrestling coaches ass dep t of,a plaintiff standing fails where it is purely speculative that a requested change in government policy will alter the behavior of regulated third parties.
in response mra and skitronics argue that the windfall nextel receives due to the undervaluation will be of material assistance in nextel efforts to compete against them.agency action that results in such a skewed playing field among competitors,they claim,is a sufficiently redressable injury to confer standing.pet rs reply br.while we have recognized competitor standing in the licensing context,the party seeking to establish standing on that basis must demonstrate that it is a direct and current competitor whose bottom line may be adversely affected by the challenged government action.kerm,fcc,quoting new world radio fcc,emphases in new world.in kerm,we concluded that because kerm did not present evidence that the fcc failure to take enforcement action against its competitor kayh caused it loss such as lost advertising revenues for kerm or otherwise adverse effects on kerm financial interests,it could not establish standing on the basis of competitive injury.id.at.kerm instead vaguely assert ed only that it competes with kayh and that its own radio stations serve much of the same audience as kayh.such b are allegations are insufficient to establish a petitioner standing to seek judicial review of administrative action.id.quotation marks omitted alterations in original quoting sierra club epa.
the fcc claims that it does not matter that mra may compete with nextel in some minor way,emphasizing that nextel operates on a nationwide basis,not just in the or markets where mra and skitronics have operations,resp t br.nevertheless,because nextel operates in some of the same markets,the requirement that nextel be a direct and current competitor of mra and skitronics is likely met.mra and skitronics lack competitor standing,however,because they have failed to make a concrete showing that they are likely to suffer financial injury.claiming the regulatory action creates a skewed playing field,as mra and skitronics assert,is not enough that claim is a bare assertion of competition of the type we found insufficient in kerm.ass of data processing serv.orgs.camp,d agency rule allowing banks to sell data processing services interfered with existing contracts held by data processing company petitioner which could therefore show more than that rule application might entail some future loss of profits.accordingly,mra and skitronics are without competitor standing to bring their valuation claim.
for the foregoing reasons,mra and skitronics petition for review of the federal communication commission rebanding decision and reconsideration order is denied.
so ordered.
public safety providers also use systems because they are relatively inexpensive to set up and operate.
traditional cellular telephone systems are similar to esmr systems in terms of their system architectures and the service they provide to consumers but they operate in a different spectrum band and use somewhat different technology.improving public safety communications in the mhz band.unlike other cellular telephone providers,intervenors nextel and southern linc operate in the mhz band.
the commission identified two types of interference caused by cellular systems to which systems were susceptible out of band emission oobe interference,where a signal spills over a transmitter licensed frequency into adjacent spectrum,and intermodulation interference,where two signals in use in a particular cell mix within the mobile radio to form a third frequency that nullifies the desired signal.in the first type of interference the mobile radio picks up a cellular system signal on an adjacent frequency,thereby interfering with communications with the base station.in the second type of interference the third frequency blocks the channel on which the mobile radio attempts to communicate.
frequencies in the ghz band are used to offer broadband personal communications services pcs such as wireless internet service.
the commission later amended and clarified the rebanding decision with three errata and a supplemental order released on december.improving public safety communications in the mhz band,wl reconsideration order.the petitioners challenge encompasses the rebanding decision,the errata and the reconsideration order.pet rs br.
the rebanding decision defines a cellular system as an esmr system with more than five overlapping interactive cells featuring capability,the capability to hand off calls from one cell to the next as a user moves through the coverage area and with at least one site that uses a low elevation antenna a
