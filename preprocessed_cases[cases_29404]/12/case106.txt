this appeal presents a recurring issue in constitutional law the extent to which congress can use one of its powers to enact a statute that it could not enact under another of its arguably relevant powers.see,ry.labor executives ass gibbons,d heart of atlanta motel,united states,d in re cases.here the statute involved is section of title,which prohibits the unauthorized recording of performances as well as the copying,distribution,sale,rental,and trafficking of these bootlegged phonorecords.the constitutional grants of congressional power at issue are the commerce clause,art.i,cl,which permits congress t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes,and the copyright clause,art.i,cl,which empowers congress t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.
the district court held that section was not validly enacted under the copyright clause because it gives rights to performers that are unlimited in time without requiring that the performer have reduced his or her performance to a fixed form.see united states martignon,d.the court also held that congress could not enact such legislation under the c ommerce c lause or any other clause,when the legislation conflicts with the limitation s imposed by the copyright clause.id.at internal footnote omitted.
after examining the statute,its background,the two relevant constitutional clauses,and applicable precedent,we conclude that congress was free to act under the commerce clause to enact section a and.our conclusion is limited to those provisions alone and does not reach other provisions of the uruguay round agreements act uraa,stat,from which section is drawn.

section a provides that a person who,without the consent of the performer or performers,knowingly and for commercial advantage or private financial gain

district court proceedings 
on october,a grand jury charged martignon,the proprietor of midnight records in manhattan,with one count of violating section by reproducing an unauthorized phonorecord and by distributing and selling and offering to distribute and sell phonorecords of performances which had been recorded or fixed without the consent of the performer or performers.martignon moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that section violated the copyright clause because live performances are not writings within the meaning of the clause and because live performances were given protection for perpetuity rather than for a limited time.martignon also claimed that the statute violated the first amendment.the government responded that congress had authority to enact section under the commerce and necessary and proper clauses 
the district court granted the motion to dismiss.martignon,d at.the court began its analysis with an examination of whether section was copyright or commercial regulation.id.at.although the court acknowledged that if congress had the power to enact section under the commerce clause,its belief that it was acting under the copyright clause would not be dispositive,id.at,it held that it is still essential to determine how to classify a statute in order to ensure that it does not run afoul of any express limitations imposed on congress when regulating in the respective arena,id.at.for four separate but related reasons,judge baer concluded that section was more closely tied to the copyright than to the commerce clause.first,the agreement that it implemented,trips,was intended to protect intellectual property.id.second,the words of the statute were consistent with the purpose of the copyright clause,encouraging authors and inventors to create by granting them exclusive rights in their writings and discoveries.id.third,the committee on the judiciary report describes the legislation in terms of copyright and contains no mention of commerce.id.at citing,at.fourth,section follows the criminal copyright provision and refers to the definitions in title,the copyright title of the united states code.id.at.
despite the appearance of section,the district court held that it could not be sustained under the copyright clause because it provides seemingly perpetual protection for unfixed musical performances.id.at.because the performances are unfixed at the time they are recorded,the court held that they were not writings within the coverage of the copyright clause.id.at.because the protection accorded a live performance is perpetual,the court reasoned that section violates the limited times provision of the copyright clause.id.at.
finally,the court held that congress could not do indirectly,under the commerce clause or the necessary and proper clause,what it is forbidden to do directly under the copyright clause.id.at.more specifically,the court held congress may not,if the copyright clause does not allow for such legislation,enact the law under a separate grant of power,even when that separate grant provides proper authority.id.at.because section was,in judge baer view,legislation,it could not be enacted under any other clause of the constitution if it violated the limitations of the copyright clause.id.the district court therefore found section unconstitutional.id.at.as an alternative to finding an absolute ban against enacting legislation under any clause other than the copyright clause,judge baer held that even if congress may enact legislation under grants other than the copyright clause,such legislation may not be fundamentally inconsistent with the fixation and durational limitations imposed by the copyright clause.id.he then found fundamental inconsistency between the limited times provision and section failure to impose a time limit for violations 
on october,the government filed a timely notice of appeal.
the government contentions on appeal 
the government argues that the district court order is erroneous for two principal reasons.first,they claim that the copyright clause is solely an affirmative grant of power and does not limit congress power to act under other clauses of the constitution.second,even assuming that the copyright clause has some limitations,the government contends that these limitations can only apply to matters within its scope,that is,fixed creative works or writings.
discussion 
because the government concedes congress could not have enacted section pursuant to the copyright clause,we must determine whether the copyright clause limitations also limit congress power to regulate creative works under the commerce clause.on its face,article i,simply grants powers to congress.no section clause,including the copyright clause,states that congress can make certain laws only pursuant to that particular clause or that any limitations on the power granted by that clause carry over to congress power to act in a related area under a different section clause.nevertheless,in limited instances,the expressed limitations of one clause do apply externally to another clause.see gibbons,at.to determine whether section is invalid because it violates limitations of the copyright clause,we must analyze the extent to which the copyright clause can be read to limit congress power to enact legislation under the commerce clause.because a central focus of the parties argument on external limitations is whether writings in the copyright clause is part of that clause grant of power or its limitations,we first consider whether the grant of power in the copyright clause can be separated with any clarity from constitutionally created limitations on that power.we conclude that another word in the copyright clause securing may more easily be read to be at least a part of the clause grant of power,rather than a limitation we thus need not determine on which side of the line writings falls.primarily focusing on a trio of cases,heart of atlanta,and which the supreme court has considered issues similar to the one that confronts us,we conclude that the commerce clause suffices as authority for section.
scope and limits of the copyright clause 
in graham john deere,the court described the copyright clause as both a grant of power and a limitation,d.seizing on this phrase,martignon argues that the grant of power is the authority to regulate creative works and that the limitations are the requirements of fixation and.martignon also graham did not so the limitations apply externally to the copyright clause to limit congress power to enact legislation under other portions of article i.
the copyright clause provides that congress has the power t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.const,cl.the government argues that this clause means that the government has the power to regulate creative and fixed works by granting their creators exclusive rights for a limited time.martignon,on the other hand,contends that the clause gives the government the power to regulate creative works by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights in written works for a limited time.under the government interpretation of the clause,performances are completely outside the scope of the copyright clause because they are not fixed.under martignon interpretation,performances are within the scope of the copyright clause because they are creative works but violate its limits because the performances are not fixed and the protection is granted for an unlimited time.in an alternative argument,martignon claims that the subsections underlying the charge against him violate the limited times of whether the fixation requirement is considered as part of the grant of power or as a he could only have sold,copied or distributed fixed works.martignon further argues that once we determine original works are within the scope of the copyright clause,we must necessarily conclude that congress can not regulate original works under any other grant of power.
it is not clear from the wording of the copyright clause where the grant of power ends and where the limitation s begin s.this clause allows congress t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.one could draw the line between grant and limitation s almost anywhere in this sentence.for example,the grant of power could be to pass legislation to promote the useful arts and sciences,limited,however,to the realm of the original,to the method of granting exclusive rights,and to a period of limited duration.conversely,the clause can be construed to allow congress to pass legislation giving creators of original work an exclusive right in their fixed work,limited only by the requirement that the grant be of limited duration.we find no useful punctuation or structural clues in the text of the clause.indeed,the limited times language,which both parties agree is a limitation rather than part of a grant of power,is squarely in the middle of the clause.further,the graham court read the creativity requirement,t o promote the useful arts,as a limitation on congress power,thus suggesting that the power granted and the limitations are virtually coterminous.see at.the text of the copyright clause does not alone provide sufficient guidance for us to decide where to draw that line for purposes of deciding this case.
the supreme court has indicated that congress can sometimes enact legislation under one constitutional provision that it could not have enacted under another.see,heart of atlanta,at.upholding a civil rights statute as a permissible exercise of commerce clause power,although a similar statute previously had been declared unconstitutional as beyond the power of congress under the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments,see the civil rights cases.however,this power is not unlimited.see gibbons,at.holding that a statute was repugnant to the bankruptcy clause and could not be considered a legitimate exercise of commerce clause power even though bankruptcy and commerce are intimately connected.because the parties attach different import to these cases and to the cases,we examine them to determine where to draw the line between a law which,while related to one constitutional provision and unauthorized by it,can be validly enacted under a different provision and legislative action that is prohibited under one provision and can not be enacted under another even though it is seemingly within the purview of the second provision.we find no absolute answers because none of the cases cited by the parties is directly on point.however,we do find strong indicators of the lines along which our analysis must proceed.
we begin with the cases in which the court held that a criminal trademark statute was not authorized by the copyright clause because trademarks do not require originality.at.the court then held that because the trademark statute was not limited to interstate commerce,it could not be justified as an exercise of commerce clause power id.at.we read this case as standing for the proposition that when an intellectual property law could not have been enacted pursuant to the copyright clause because it governs works lacking originality,a court should alternatively consider whether it was validly enacted under the commerce clause.
heart of atlanta considered a law prohibiting discrimination on account of race in privately owned public accommodations such as motels and hotels.at.the legislation that the heart of atlanta court considered was not the first attempt by congress to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations.some eighty years previously,after considering any authority the fourteenth amendment gave congress to enact legislation prohibiting private discrimination,the court had held that a very similar statute was unconstitutional.the civil rights cases,at.
the fourteenth amendment provides in pertinent part no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life,liberty,or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.the court,therefore,held that some form of state action was necessary to trigger congress power under the fourteenth amendment.the civil rights cases,at.because the statute under consideration applied to private actors,the court invalidated it.id.at.in passing,the court said,whether congress,in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce among the several states,might or might not pass a law regulating rights in public conveyances passing from one state to another,is also a question which is not now before us,as the sections in question are not conceived in any such view.id.at.
in contrast,before enacting the civil rights bill at issue in heart of atlanta,congress heard testimony that discrimination by race or color places burdens upon interstate commerce.heart of atlanta,at.further,congress limited the applicability of the act to those motels,inns,and hotels that offered more than five rooms to transient guests and therefore affected interstate commerce.id.at.the court held that the civil rights cases were inapposite because the statute in question was confined to institutions affecting interstate commerce.id.at.despite its conclusion t hat congress was legislating against moral wrongs,the court upheld the law based on the overwhelming evidence of the disruptive effect that racial discrimination has had on commercial intercourse.id.at.
heart of atlanta takes us a step further than the cases.from the latter case,we draw the not surprising conclusion that if a statute is outside even the most generalized interpretation of the scope of the copyright clause,it is not a copyright law,it can be regulated under the commerce clause.however,it can not be said that racial discrimination is outside the scope of the fourteenth amendment instead,it is at its core.therefore,at least in some instances,congress can regulate under the commerce clause what it could not regulate under an amendment specifically aimed at the wrong at issue.
martignon,however,contends that heart of atlanta is very different from this case because the fourteenth amendment contains no specific limitations on congress general power to enact legislation.the fourteenth amendment,of course,is limited to state action,but that restriction is expressed as a part of the grant of power given to congress rather than as a limitation on the power once granted.thus,in martignon view,heart of atlanta closely resembles the cases.just as the copyright clause empowers congress to regulate creative works,the fourteenth amendment grants congress the power to act against discrimination.it then would follow that just as congress was free to regulate trademarks under the commerce clause,it was also free to prohibit discrimination that was not under the same clause.while martignon argument may have some logic to support it,the heart of atlanta court drew no such subtle distinctions between the grant of power and limitations on the grant of power.rather,the court simply reasoned that it did matter if congress lacked the power to enact legislation covering private actors under the fourteenth amendment as long as it possessed sufficient power under the commerce clause.
we turn finally to gibbons,which is at the heart of martignon claim that congress could not enact section under the commerce clause because of limitations contained in the copyright clause.in,the chicago,rock island,and pacific railroad rock island petitioned for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws.gibbons,at.in,a strike caused rock island to stop operations,and the bankruptcy court directed rock island trustee to prepare a liquidation plan.id.in june,the bankruptcy court concluded that claims could not be paid out of rock island assets.id.at.congress responded by enacting the rock island railroad transition and employee assistance act rita.id.at.rita provided that the trustee must pay up to million to rock island employees who were not hired by other carriers.id.at.these payments were to be made as administrative expenses,which would give them priority over other creditors claims.id.at.
when the matter reached the supreme court,it invalidated the pertinent rita provisions as repugnant to art.i,cl,the bankruptcy clause,of the constitution.id.at.first,the court analyzed whether rita was an exercise of congress bankruptcy clause or commerce clause power.it acknowledged that d istinguishing a congressional exercise of power under the commerce clause from an exercise under the bankruptcy clause is not an easy task,for the two clauses are closely related.id.nevertheless,and for several reasons,the court found that congress exercised its power under the bankruptcy clause.id.at.first,rita contained specific directives to the bankruptcy court concerning the distribution of the property of a particular estate.id.at.second,it rearranged the priorities of various payments from the estate,giving the employees priority over other creditors.id.third,the events surrounding the enactment of the legislation indicated that congress knew it was exercising its powers under the bankruptcy clause.id.at.finally,rita was passed almost five years after rock island sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws.id.at.
the court then turned its attention briefly to the commerce clause,saying,w e do not understand either appellant or the united states to argue that congress may enact bankruptcy laws pursuant to its power under the commerce clause.id.at.the court also noted that the bankruptcy clause contain ed an affirmative limitation or restriction upon congress power that bankruptcy laws must be uniform throughout the united was not contained in the commerce clause.id.the court therefore reasoned that if we were to hold that congress had the power to enact nonuniform bankruptcy laws pursuant to the commerce clause,we would eradicate from the constitution a limitation on the power of congress to enact bankruptcy laws.id.at.the court then examined the uniformity requirement,found that rita violated this requirement,and declared it unconstitutional.id.at.
gibbons analysis differs in one important respect from the cases we have previously examined it considers whether rita was really a bankruptcy or a commercial regulation.read too broadly,this aspect of gibbons would conflict with clear supreme court precedent holding that it does not matter that congress believes it is legislating under a clause which would not give it the power it seeks as long as it actually has the power to legislate under another.see woods cloyd miller.a careful reading of gibbons avoids any such conflict.the gibbons court considered primarily what rita did,not congress belief as to which clause authorized its action.rita mandated that an existing bankruptcy proceeding be handled differently from any other bankruptcy in the united states.it also altered the statutory priorities for paying debts and the administrative scheme contemplated by the bankruptcy code.it was a bankruptcy law.
we believe that the supreme court cases allow the regulation of matters that could not be regulated under the copyright clause in a manner arguably inconsistent with that clause unless the statute at issue is a copyright law.we draw this lesson from heart of atlanta and from gibbons.in heart of atlanta,the court found authority for congress to enact a statute that prohibited race discrimination in public accommodations affecting interstate commerce,even though the prohibition ran to discrimination not involving state action,under the commerce clause although the fourteenth amendment did not allow congress to enact a similar statute.the gibbons court found that rita was actually a bankruptcy law,not that it was very close to a bankruptcy law or that it was.because gibbons is the only
