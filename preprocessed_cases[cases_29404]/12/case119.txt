this case presents the question of whether federal courts have diversity jurisdiction over private causes of action brought under the telephone consumer protection act tcpa.sherman gottlieb gottlieb appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york glasser,entered on may,dismissing his claims under the tcpa for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissing his parallel state law claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction.relying primarily on this court decision in foxhall realty law offices,telecommunications premium services,cir,where we held that congress intended to divest the federal courts of federal question jurisdiction over private tcpa claims,the district court concluded that jurisdiction over tcpa claims resides in the state courts exclusively and that federal courts lack diversity jurisdiction over such claims.gottlieb carnival,d.the district court reasoned that it must be assumed that the second circuit used its words carefully and advisedly when we stated in foxhall that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over tcpa claims.id.at.our ruling in foxhall,however,related only to the existence of federal question jurisdiction over private tcpa claims we did not consider in that case whether federal courts have diversity jurisdiction over such claims we hold here that congress did not divest the federal courts of diversity jurisdiction over private actions under the tcpa.we thus vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
the following facts are taken from gottlieb complaint.
gottlieb is a travel agent who works from his home in staten island,new york.in connection with his work,he has a fax machine associated with two telephone numbers.between early and,gottlieb received,via his fax machine,over unsolicited advertisements from carnival corporation carnival,a company organized under the laws of panama and having its principal place of business in florida.gottlieb continued receiving faxes from carnival even though he sent carnival written instructions,via facsimile,requesting that they cease sending him unsolicited advertisements.he also contacted the telephone number listed on those advertisements to request that his fax numbers be removed from carnival list.in,carnival began including the following language on the bottom of its faxes carnival does not endorse nor authorize the practice of blast faxing or unsolicited faxing of any materials promoting carnival or its products.
in count one of his complaint gottlieb seeks statutory damages of under the tcpa for each of the approximately unsolicited fax advertisements he received from carnival.in count two,he alleges that carnival acted knowingly and willfully and seeks treble damages for each statutory violation.in count three,he seeks injunctive relief under the tcpa.finally,in count four,gottlieb seeks statutory damages of for each fax sent by carnival in violation of new york general business law,a parallel new york statute.
discussion 
the tcpa prohibits,inter alia,the use of any telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send,to a telephone facsimile machine,an unsolicited advertisement absent certain conditions not present here.b c.section b provides a private right of action under the statute and states that a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state an action for injunctive relief or damages.section b further establishes damages of for each violation of the statute and treble damages if the defendant violates the statute willfully or knowingly.
this court concluded in foxhall that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over private actions under the tcpa and held that,pursuant to,federal courts lack federal question jurisdiction over such claims.at.we emphasized in foxhall the language of b providing that a person may bring an action in state court.central to our reasoning was the fact that state courts are courts of general jurisdiction,and therefore no express grant of jurisdiction is required to confer concurrent jurisdiction on state and federal courts.id.by contrast,federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction which thus require a specific grant of jurisdiction.id.we reasoned that the permissive authorization in the statute extending only to courts of general jurisdiction was significant.in order to give effect and meaning to every provision of the statute,we joined several other federal courts of appeals and held that congress intended to confer exclusive state court jurisdiction over private rights of action under the tcpa.id.in brief,we concluded that the statutory language constituted a specific expression of congressional intent that trumped the more general grant of federal question jurisdiction in.id.at.
we did not consider in foxhall whether congress intended that federal courts have diversity jurisdiction over private tcpa claims.our discussion of exclusive jurisdiction in foxhall must be read in context.foxhall dealt only with federal question jurisdiction diversity jurisdiction was not raised in foxhall our ruling in foxhall thus does not govern the resolution of this case.
this case presents a question of statutory construction.statutory analysis begins with the text and its plain meaning,if it has one.see natural res.def.council,muszynski,cir.if a statute is ambiguous,we resort to the canons of statutory construction to help resolve the ambiguity.id.finally,w hen the plain language and canons of statutory interpretation fail to resolve statutory ambiguity,we will resort to legislative history.united states dauray,cir.
nothing in b,or in any other provision of the statute,expressly divests federal courts of diversity jurisdiction over private actions under the tcpa.because the statute is ambiguous,however,we consider the two canons of statutory construction that are most helpful to our interpretation of the tcpa.first,when determining the meaning of a statutory provision,the text should be placed in the context of the entire statutory structure.natural res.def.council,at.a statute is to be considered in all its parts when construing any one of them.dauray,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.normally,a statute must,if reasonably possible,be construed in a way that will give force and effect to each of its provisions rather than render some of them meaningless.allen oil,comm r,cir.second,b ackground principles of law in effect at the time congress passes a statute can be useful in statutory interpretation.united states kerley,cir see also norman singer,sutherland statutory construction legislation never is written on a clean slate,nor is it ever read in isolation or applied in a vacuum.
statutory structure 
the statutory analyses of the tcpa in earlier cases do not directly pertain to diversity jurisdiction,but they nonetheless inform our interpretation of the statute.both this court in foxhall and the fourth circuit in international science and technology institute,inacom communications,cir,the leading case to have held that courts lack federal question jurisdiction over private tcpa claims,emphasized the statutory structure of the tcpa and the communications act of the act.both courts found it significant that,in f of the tcpa,congress vested exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts over actions brought by state attorneys general on behalf of state residents foxhall,at int l,at.the fourth circuit noted that congress wrote precisely,making jurisdictional distinctions in the very same section of the act by providing that private actions may be brought in appropriate state courts and that actions by the states must be brought in the federal courts.at.section f,however,limits only the jurisdiction of state courts,not the independent jurisdiction of federal courts.moreover,congress explicit investiture of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts in f indicates that in b,which does not include such language,congress did not similarly vest categorical,exclusive jurisdiction in state courts for private tcpa claims,and therefore did not divest federal courts of both federal question and diversity jurisdiction.
both this court in foxhall and the fourth circuit also found it significant that congress explicitly provided for concurrent federal and state court jurisdiction in other parts of the act,but not in b foxhall,at int l,at.we reject the argument that congress failure to provide explicitly for concurrent jurisdiction in b means that the provision precludes federal courts from exercising diversity jurisdiction over private tcpa claims.when used in or to describe federal statutes,the term concurrent jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law.see gulf offshore mobil oil,d noting the rule that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims and its importance prior to the creation of general jurisdiction in see also hathorn lovorn,d acknowledging the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction over federal questions.the provisions of the act that establish concurrent jurisdiction do not give any indication of varying from this rule.see,infra.thus,congress explicit provision for concurrent jurisdiction in other parts of the act concerns the existence of federal question jurisdiction,not diversity jurisdiction,and congress failure to provide explicitly for concurrent jurisdiction in b has no bearing on its intent with respect to diversity jurisdiction.
just as nothing in the language of b expresses a congressional intent to divest the federal courts of diversity jurisdiction under over private actions under the tcpa,nothing in the statutory structure indicates that intent.it is consistent with both the statutory language and the structure of the tcpa and the act to interpret those provisions of the act authorizing concurrent jurisdiction to confer federal question and jurisdiction f to confer exclusive federal jurisdiction over actions brought by the states and b to confer federal diversity and jurisdiction over private claims.we find this to be the most reasonable interpretation of the statute.
background principles 
our conclusion is confirmed by reference to the background principles in effect at the time congress passed the tcpa.the supreme court has indicated that congress legislates against the backdrop of existing jurisdictional rules that apply unless congress specifies otherwise.see shoshone mining rutter.holding that where the statute did not specify which courts had jurisdiction,it unquestionably meant that the competency of the court should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in respect to the jurisdiction of the federal courts.the question,then,is whether diversity jurisdiction may be presumed to apply to causes of action unless congress has made a clear statement otherwise.that is,if diversity jurisdiction is not presumed for causes of action,the statutory ambiguity in b should be resolved by concluding that federal courts do not have diversity jurisdiction over private actions under the tcpa.on the other hand,if is an independent grant of federal jurisdiction intended to prevent discrimination against parties regardless of whether state or federal substantive law is involved,then diversity jurisdiction is presumed to exist for all causes of action so long as the statutory requirements are satisfied.in that event,must itself be explicitly abrogated by congress,and b is not a clear statement of congressional intent to deprive federal courts of diversity jurisdiction.
a plausible argument against finding diversity jurisdiction over private tcpa claims is that such jurisdiction is not presumed over rights of action created by federal statutes.such statutes,the argument goes,typically give rise to federal question jurisdiction and concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts,but not diversity jurisdiction.where congress expresses the intent that a federal statute creating a private right of action not give rise to federal question jurisdiction,the argument continues,the only remaining jurisdiction lies in the state courts.under this analysis,congress must explicitly state that a right of action gives rise to diversity jurisdiction in the absence of such a clear statement,federal jurisdiction will be found lacking if there is no federal question jurisdiction.
while the argument is intriguing,it is not persuasive.nothing in limits its application to causes of action in fact,the diversity statute gives federal courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions where there is diversity of citizenship and the requirement is satisfied.a.we thus reject the argument that causes of action do not give rise to diversity jurisdiction.although the tcpa is an anomalous statute,creating a private right of action over which federal courts lack federal question jurisdiction,nothing in indicates that diversity jurisdiction does not exist where causes of action are concerned.moreover,the usual admonition that the diversity statute must be strictly construed against intrusion on the right of state courts to decide their own controversies,see city of indianapolis chase bank,is not relevant when a cause of action is at issue.thus,we see no reason to resolve the statutory ambiguity by finding diversity jurisdiction not to exist in this case.
we think the better course is to proceed according to the rule that applies to all causes of action,whether created by state or federal law,unless congress expresses a clear intent to the contrary.understanding to apply presumptively to all causes of action,we acknowledge the principle of statutory construction that repeal or amendment by implication is disfavored.see.river water conserv.dist.united states,d rosencrans united states.when there are statutes clearly defining the jurisdiction of the courts,the force and effect of such provisions should not be disturbed by a mere implication flowing from subsequent legislation.here,there is no clear statement of congressional intent to divest the federal courts of diversity jurisdiction over private tcpa claims as the supreme court has stated,i n the absence of some affirmative showing of an intent to repeal,the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.river water,at.quoting morton mancari,d.as is clear from the statutory framework of the tcpa and the act,discussed above,there is no such irreconcilability between and b we thus conclude that applies to private actions under the tcpa 
legislative history 
having resolved the textual ambiguity by employing canons of statutory construction,we would not ordinarily consult the tcpa legislative history.we find it advisable to do so in this case,however,because foxhall,the district court,and the parties have relied on that history.nothing in the legislative history undermines our conclusion that congress did not intend to divest the federal courts of diversity jurisdiction over private tcpa claims.
the senate report on the bill noted that state legislation prohibiting unsolicited telemarketing had had limited effect because states do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls.many states have expressed a desire for federal legislation to regulate interstate telemarketing calls to supplement their restrictions on intrastate calls,at,as reprinted in.the report went on to state that f ederal action is necessary because states do not have the jurisdiction to protect their citizens against those who use these machines to place interstate calls.id.at,at.similarly,the report of the house of representatives indicated that m any states have passed laws that seek to regulate telemarketing through various time,place and manner restrictions however,telemarketers can easily avoid the restrictions of state law,simply by locating their phone centers out of state,at.the bill senate sponsor made the following statement in support of the bill
