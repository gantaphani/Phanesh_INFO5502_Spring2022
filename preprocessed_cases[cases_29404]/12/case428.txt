acs provides corporate services to its parent,alltel corporation,and to other subsidiaries.within acs,the administrative services department delivers services such as real estate,corporate travel,mail services,and document services.steven kavanaugh,the vice president of administrative services,makes employment decisions regarding the personnel in administrative services.document department at issue in this the of administrative services that provides document copying,distribution,and printing services for alltel and its subsidiaries.
in july,kavanaugh and the director of office services hired desi ledbetter as the customer service supervisor within document services.ledbetter reported to the director and was responsible for overseeing and managing the copiers,incoming copy and print jobs,outsourced print jobs,and production.he also maintained the customer services budget and supervised four employees.ledbetter consistently received positive performance evaluations from the director,as well as yearly merit increases in salary.
in february,alltel reorganized due to instability in the telecommunications market,eliminating over jobs,including several at acs.the director of office services position was eliminated,with its responsibilities distributed within administrative services.on february,kavanaugh named ledbetter acting manager of document services,where he assumed the director duties of supervising the production services employees and managing the document services budget.he retained his previous duties as customer service supervisor.
in march,ledbetter asked kavanaugh for additional compensation in his new position.kavanaugh replied that he was acting manager until further notice,and that no reclassification would be authorized until a decision was made about the future status of the document services department.kavanaugh,concerned about the declining production volume in document services,told ledbetter that upper management was discussing the possibility of outsourcing the department.
ledbetter did not make further inquiry until august,when he asked kavanaugh if his position could be evaluated for reclassification and a pay raise.kavanaugh responded that he would consider reclassification at the beginning of the next year.after hearing no response by the beginning of,ledbetter kavanaugh about the reclassification.in february,kavanaugh agreed to submit ledbetter acting manager position to the corporate compensation department for evaluation 
to begin the evaluation process,on february,kavanaugh gave ledbetter approval to fill out a job evaluation form for his position.ledbetter completed it on february and returned it to kavanaugh.after receiving no response for almost a month,ledbetter asked kavanaugh if he had received it.on march,kavanaugh said he had not found time to review it.anxious to remove the term acting from his title,on april,ledbetter decided to involve human resources in the reclassification process.after a series of between ledbetter,kavanaugh,and human resources in late spring,kavanaugh forwarded the form to corporate compensation on june.on july,ledbetter again asked human resources the status of his reclassification.he did not receive a response until august,when he learned that kavanaugh was still discussing the issue with corporate compensation.
on october,kavanaugh informed ledbetter that corporate compensation had authorized a reclassification of his position from pay grade to.when the reclassification took effect on january,kavanaugh recommended that ledbetter salary be calculated at the percentile of grade,or increase over his previous salary.ledbetter responded that he believed pay grade was more appropriate,because it was the grade at which most management positions were classified.he also requested that kavanaugh authorize retroactive pay to february,when he became acting manager.kavanaugh denied both requests,prompting ledbetter again to take his concerns to human resources.after reviewing ledbetter reclassification process,members of human resources and corporate compensation determined that ledbetter received a fair evaluation,was properly classified at pay grade,and should not receive retroactive pay.
ledbetter sued acs,claiming he was paid less than other caucasian managers and forced to assume the title of acting manager for months while attempting to get reclassified.after a bench trial,the district court held that acs intentionally discriminated against ledbetter by failing to reclassify his position at the time of the reorganization in february,paying him less than other caucasian managers between february and january,and giving him the acting title for months.as to damages,the district court determined that ledbetter pay grade was properly grade,but ordered that it be retroactive to when he became acting manager.the court awarded ledbetter in backpay,in compensatory damages for emotional distress,and costs and attorney fees.both parties appeal.
on appeal,acs argues that the district court finding of intentional discrimination is not factually supported by the record.this court reviews the district court ultimate finding of discrimination for clear error,giving due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.a anderson city of bessemer city,d presence of discrimination is a finding of fact that can not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.a finding of discrimination will be overturned only if not supported by substantial evidence,based on an erroneous construction of the law,or it is clear that the district court has committed a mistake.day johnson,cir.this court need only decide whether the record as a whole supports the ultimate finding of discrimination.tadlock powell,cir the mcdonnell douglas presumptions disappear upon review of a district court determination that discrimination has occurred.
the district court properly applied the mcdonnell douglas analysis to determine whether acs engaged in intentional race discrimination in its decisions about ledbetter.see mcdonnell douglas green,d kincaid city of omaha,cir.the district court found that ledbetter had established a prima facie case of intentional race discrimination,because he is an who,while consistently receiving positive performance reviews,was denied reclassification and a raise for months,while caucasian managers did not face similar obstacles.see generally davis,cir.although acs articulated reasons for delaying the reclassification,such as uncertainty about the future of the document services department and the need to cut costs following the reorganization,the district court found these reasons unpersuasive.specifically,it found that other caucasian employees at acs were treated more favorably in the alltel reorganization,and that acs failed to follow its own reclassification procedures in keeping ledbetter at grade for nearly two years after he had assumed managerial duties.
on appeal,acs asserts the same arguments as raised to the district court in order to justify its refusal to reclassify ledbetter position until january.first,acs relies on kavanaugh testimony that he did not seek additional compensation for ledbetter in march,because the future of the document services department was uncertain at that time.the district court rejected this argument,finding that alltel compensation management guide required a different result.see floyd state of.dep t of soc,cir an employer failure to follow its own policies may support an inference of pretext.the guide specifies that reclassifications usually occur during reorganizations or when an employ
