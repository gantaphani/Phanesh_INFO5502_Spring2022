petitioners,providers of voice over internet protocol services voip,challenge a federal communications commission order requiring them to contribute to the universal service fund.specifically,they claim that,in requiring such contributions,the commission exceeded its authority under the telecommunications act of and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by analogizing voip to wireline toll service for the purposes of setting the presumptive percentage of voip revenues generated interstate or internationally,requiring for traffic studies submitted by voip providers but not for those submitted by wireless providers,and suspending the carrier carrier rule with respect to voip.we conclude that the commission has statutory authority to require voip providers to make usf contributions and that it acted reasonably in analogizing voip to wireline toll service for purposes of setting the presumptive percentage of voip revenues generated interstate and internationally.but finding the commission explanation wanting as to the of traffic studies and the suspension of the carrier carrier rule,we vacate those portions of the order.
in march,the federal communications commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking calling for comments on how best to regulate a range of internet services,including voice over internet protocol,an service offering multidirectional voice functionality,including,but not limited to,services that mimic traditional telephony.in re services,see also.pub.utils.comm fcc,wl,at cir,describing the difference between and communications.perhaps most significantly for voip future,the commission asked whether it should classify voip as a telecommunications service or an information service.if classified as a telecommunications service,voip would be subject to mandatory title ii common carrier regulations,but as an information service it would not.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.the commission also requested comment on a range of narrower questions,relevant to this voip providers should be required to contribute to the universal service fund usf.see services,at calling for comment on whether voip providers should contribute to the usf but stating that the question would be addressed in the separately docketed universal service contribution methodology proceeding.
the usf is a funding stream the commission uses to subsidize telecommunications and information services in rural and areas,as well as for schools,libraries,and households.b,h b.the usf receives its funding from businesses in the telecommunications sector some businesses are required by statute to contribute while others must contribute only when the commission has,in its discretion,required them to do so.specifically,the act mandates contributions from e very telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services.id.d.moreover,under its permissive contribution authority,the commission may demand usf contributions from a ny other provider of interstate telecommunications if the public interest so requires.id.
two years later and following public comment,the commission issued an order requiring providers of interconnected voip services to contribute to the usf.in re universal service contribution methodology,hereinafter order.interconnected voip services enable,voice communications require a broadband connection from the user location require customer premises equipment and permit users to receive calls from and terminate calls to the pstn public switched telephone network.id.at see also.
deferring a decision on whether to classify voip as a telecommunications service or an information service,the commission grounded its order in its permissive contribution authority and,alternatively,its title i ancillary jurisdiction.see am.library ass fcc,holding that the commission may regulate under its ancillary jurisdiction when the subject of the regulation is both covered by the commission general grant of jurisdiction under title i of the communications act and reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the commission various responsibilities citation omitted.the commission gave three reasons for taking this discretionary step.first,usf contributions have declined in recent years,while interconnected voip services have experienced dramatic growth.order at.thus,requiring contributions from interconnected voip providers would preserve and advance universal service.id.at.second,interconnected voip providers ought to contribute to the usf because much of the appeal of their services to consumers derives from the ability to place calls to and receive calls from the pstn,which is supported by universal service mechanisms.id.at.third,competitive principle that requires advantaging no one technology over making voip providers contribute because they increasingly compete with analog voice service providers,who contribute to the usf.id.at.
having decided to require voip providers to contribute,the commission turned to the issue of how to calculate the level of such contributions.the commission assesses usf contributions only on revenues generated from interstate or international calls.see.office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir.for companies connecting landline customers,determining the percentage of interstate or international calls is relatively simple.but for wireless and voip customers may use their services from many locations and often have area codes that do not correspond to their true the percentage of interstate and international traffic is more difficult.given those difficulties,the commission it has since for safe harbor that approximates the percentage of voip revenues generated from interstate and international calls.the safe harbor ensures that voip providers will not have to make usf contributions on more than a certain percentage of their revenues.as its name suggests,the safe harbor is only a ceiling voip providers may reduce their usf contributions if,through traffic studies,they can show that their actual percentage of interstate and international revenues falls below the safe harbor percentage.
to set the safe harbor level,the commission sought to identify the appropriate analogue for voip service.order at.the commission considered two possibilities wireline toll service colloquially referred to as landline long distance,which the commission presumes to be interstate and international,and wireless service,presumed to be interstate and international.the commission selected wireline toll service as the better analogue,giving two reasons for its decision.first,it cited two industry reports,one estimating that of voip traffic is interstate or international and a second putting the figure at both figures higher than the safe harbor level for wireline toll service.second,the commission cited advertisements demonstrating that voip providers frequently market their service as a substitute for wireline toll service,noting that many customers purchase such plans in order to place a high volume of interstate and international calls and consequently benefit from the pricing plans the providers offer for such services.id.at.
the commission then ruled that interconnected voip providers wishing to contribute less than the safe harbor level may do so only after the commission has approved their traffic studies.this rule differs from the rule applicable to wireless providers,who may contribute according to the findings of their traffic studies even before commission approval.having identified concerns in the wireless context with the use of traffic studies,the commission feared that allowing voip providers to rely on traffic studies without would risk extending the problems we have identified with the use of traffic studies to a new technology.id.at.addressing the inconsistent treatment of wireless and voip providers,the commission explained that imposing a requirement on both groups would be disruptive to wireless contributors who,unlike interconnected voip providers,are already relying on the current regime.id.
finally,the commission suspended the carrier carrier rule,which prevents duplicative usf contributions at the wholesale and retail levels.the rule accomplishes this by basing contributions only on telecommunications revenues.b.the commission suspended the rule with respect to voip for two quarters following issuance of the order,explaining that if carriers are permitted to invoke the carrier carrier rule immediately to exclude revenues from interconnected voip providers,the result could be a net decrease in the fund in the short term,a result inconsistent with its obligation to preserve and advance universal service.order at.
the computer and communications industry association ccia,a trade group with at least one interconnected voip provider among its members,and vonage holdings corporation vonage,a provider of interconnected voip,now petition for review.the ccia challenges the commission assertion of both section d and its title i ancillary require voip providers to contribute to the usf.vonage does not contest the commission authority to require usf contributions,challenging instead three other aspects of the order the safe harbor level,the requirement for traffic studies,and the suspension of the carrier carrier rule.
section d of title states that 
every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute,on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis,to the specific,predictable,and sufficient mechanisms established by the commission to preserve and advance universal service any other provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service if the public interest so requires.
d.according to the commission,section d permissive portion the final sentence authorizes it to require voip providers to contribute to the usf,regardless of whether voip is ultimately classified as a telecommunications service or an information service.understanding this position requires a brief detour through the regulatory classification decision the commission has yet to make and the statutory text and case law governing it.
the act defines both telecommunications service and information service as offerings.see defining t elecommunications service as the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public id.defining i nformation service as the offering of a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications.in an order issued several years ago,the commission advanced a narrow definition of the verb offer,explaining that cable modem service,even though it contains telecommunications as a component,is not a telecommunications service because an offering of telecommunications can only be something perceived as telecommunications by the end user viewing the integrated,finished product.in re inquiry concerning access to the internet over cable and other facilities,hereinafter cable modem order.because cable modem customers use the service to access the world wide web rather than transparently to transmit and receive messages without computer processing,the commission concluded that cable modem service is not a,transparent offering of telecommunications.brand x,at.citing cable modem order at.in brand x,the supreme court upheld the commission interpretation of the word offer as reasonable,explaining 
it is common usage to describe what a company offers to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the integrated finished product,even to the exclusion of discrete components that compose the product one might well say that a car dealership offers cars,but does not offer the integrated major inputs that make purchasing the car valuable,such as the engine or the chassis.it would,in fact,be odd to describe a car dealership as offering consumers the car components in addition to the car itself.
brand x,at.
were the commission to conclude that voip is an offering of telecommunications and therefore to classify it as a telecommunications service,voip providers would fall under section d mandatory contribution language the first sentence.the scope of the commission permissive contribution authority,however,does not depend on whether voip is considered an offering of either telecommunications or information.rather,the commission permissive contribution authority extends to provider s of interstate telecommunications.d emphasis added.the verb provide,the commission explained,is a different and more inclusive term than offer.order at.black law dictionary,upon which the commission relied,defines provide as t o make,procure or furnish for future use,prepare.to supply to afford to contribute.id.alteration in original quoting black law dictionary ed.under this definition,the commission explained,the verb provide is broad enough to include the act of supplying a good or service as a component of a larger,integrated product.for instance,under the commission interpretation,mcdonald provides beef,as well as hamburgers,and the washington post provides ink,as well as newspapers.
after concluding that a provider of telecommunications need only supply telecommunications as a component of its finished product,the commission explained that voip does in fact include telecommunications as a component.the act defines t elecommunications as the transmission,between or among points specified by the user,of information of the user choosing,without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.the commission explained that interconnected voip services provide such transmission by virtue of their interconnection with the pstn 
b y definition,interconnected voip services are those permitting users to receive calls from and terminate calls to the pstn w e find interconnected voip providers to be providing telecommunications regardless of whether they own or operate their own transmission facilities or they obtain transmission from third parties.in contrast to services that merely use the pstn to supply a finished product to end users,interconnected voip supplies pstn transmission itself to end users.
order at footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at distinguishing a contrary result in in re petition for declaratory ruling that free world dialup is neither telecommunications nor a telecommunications service,on the grounds that the voip provider in that order did not supply connectivity to any pstn user.
with this background in mind,we turn to the issues before us.
where,as here,congress has delegated interpretive authority to an agency,we review the agency interpretation of a statute under the familiar test set forth in chevron natural resources defense council,d.we first inquire whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.in this case,the commission does not contend that the statute unambiguously places voip providers within the phrase providers of telecommunications.nor has petitioner ccia given us any reason to conclude that either the phrase providers of telecommunications or the act definition of telecommunications unambiguously exempts voip providers from the commission permissive contribution authority.thus,we proceed to chevron step two,where we need not determine that the agency reading is the best possible reading,only that it was reasonable.am.fed of gov t employees,local nicholson.
the commission application of section d to interconnected voip providers involved two discrete decisions that,unlike the verb offer,the verb provide may apply to the act of supplying a component of an integrated product,and that voip providers supply telecommunications as a component of their service.
provide offer 
recall that in brand x the supreme court upheld the narrow definition of offer advanced by the commission.thus,we now face only two issues has the commission reasonably interpreted the word provide,and was it reasonable for the commission to give the word provide a different meaning than the word
