sbc communications,sbc brings this petition for review challenging a million forfeiture levied against it by the federal communications commission fcc.the fcc issued the fine because,it claims,sbc flagrantly violated the terms of an merger agreement to which sbc is a party.sbc primary complaint is that the forfeiture order violates the fifth amendment due process clause,because sbc was not on fair notice of the duties under the merger agreement that the fcc accuses it of shirking.sbc also argues that the order is arbitrary and capricious.because both of these challenges are without merit,we deny the petition for review.
background 
unbundling under the telecommunications act 
sbc petition concerns its obligations as an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec under the telecommunications act.ilecs are companies that own the local wires that connect telephone subscribers phones to local phone company exchanges.ilecs also own the local exchanges.those exchanges centrally route calls,using switches,among the local phone wires and the trunks that connect various exchanges,obviating the need for each phone to be connected to one other.to prevent ilecs from monopolizing these facilities,the telecommunications act the act,as amended in,requires ilecs to allow competing carriers,known as competitive local exchange carriers clecs,to use their networks,a practice known as unbundling.in particular,the act requires ilecs to allow clecs to lease unbundled network elements unes so that clecs can offer service in competition with ilecs.see c.
the task of determining those network elements that must be unbundled is delegated to the fcc.in determining whether a network element should be unbundled,the act requires the fcc to consider at a minimum whether access to such network elements as are proprietary in nature is necessary and whether the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.id.d.the fcc has issued a series of orders addressing the scope of ilecs obligation to unbundle their network elements 
network element s that must be unbundled include the functions and capabilities provided by ilecs network facilities.id.one such capability is the service of transporting telephone calls on an ilec network it seems fairly clear that this service is therefore a network element.see bell.fcc,cir per curiam.such transportation is accomplished using transport lines that connect the exchanges and switches in the network.ilecs networks transport calls either by dedicating those transport facilities to a single carrier,which are referred to as dedicated transport facilities,or by allowing several carriers to share the facilities,referred to as shared transport facilities.sbc petition for review involves its obligation to provide clecs with unbundled access to its shared transport facilities.
b.the merger order 
for purposes of the present petition,the fcc does not claim that sbc obligation to provide shared transport arises directly from the unbundling provisions of the act.the fcc claims instead that the obligation arises from an order it issued that conditionally approved a merger between sbc and ameritech,another ilec.see in re applications of ameritech and sbc communications,fcc rcd,vacated in part on other grounds,ass of communications entrs.fcc,merger order.as both ameritech and sbc held fcc licenses,the fcc was authorized to approve the merger only if it found that the public interest,convenience and necessity would have been served by it.d.on that question,the fcc took the position that the merger would have anticompetitive effects not outweighed by its benefits and therefore was not in the public interest.accordingly,the parties engaged in extensive negotiations so that they could explore the possibility of sbc and ameritech strengthening their application by agreeing to certain voluntary public interest commitments.merger order.
those negotiations resulted in a series of conditions on the merger of the two companies,issued by the fcc on october.one of the conditions required the merged entity which,for convenience,we simply call sbc unless the context shows otherwise to provide shared transport to clecs in the states formerly served by ameritech.that condition specifically provided 
within months of the merger closing date but subject to state commission approval and the terms of any future commission orders regarding the obligation to provide unbundled local switching and shared transport,shall offer shared transport in the service area within the ameritech states under terms and conditions,other than rate structure and price,that are substantially similar to or more favorable than the most favorable terms offers to telecommunications carriers in texas as of august.subject to state commission approval and the terms of any future commission orders regarding the obligation to provide unbundled local switching and shared transport,shall continue to make this offer,at a minimum,until the earlier of i the date the commission issues a final order in its une remand proceeding finding that shared transport is not required to be provided by in the relevant geographic area,or ii the date of a final,nonappealable judicial decision providing that shared transport is not required to be provided by in the relevant geographical area.
merger order,app.c.the fcc explained that paragraph obligates ameritech to provide shared transport until a final order of the commission or a final and nonappealable judicial decision determines that is not required to provide shared transport in all or a portion of its operating territory.merger order.shared transport,the conditions defined,meant the function of shared transport as defined in a previous fcc order.id.app.c.
the apparent reason for imposing this obligation to provide shared transport in the former ameritech,indiana,michigan,ohio,and to address ameritech prior reluctance to offer unbundled access to shared transport services.sbc,in contrast,had previously provided clecs with access to such service,for example,in texas hence,the merger agreement defined the merged entity obligation to provide such service by reference to a state sbc already had served.
c.the une remand proceeding and the clarification order 
two references in paragraph of the merger conditions warrant further explanation.first,paragraph refers to the une remand proceeding,which was an ongoing fcc proceeding that was reconsidering,among other things,its unbundling rules.the fcc commenced that proceeding in response to the supreme court january decision that had held unlawful in substantial part those initial rules.see iowa utils,d.the initial rules had broadly ordered ilecs to provide clecs with unbundled access to network elements,including shared transport,local competition order,fcc rcd.but the rules,the court had held,rested on an unreasonable and overly broad construction of when not having access to network elements would impair clecs.iowa utils,at.
in response to iowa utilities board,the fcc issued its order in the une remand proceeding on november,about a month after the merger order issued.that proceeding concluded that an ilec should,as a general matter,provide a clec with services if the ilec provides the clec with unbundled switching.une remand order.the order also concluded that as a general matter ilecs were required to unbundle local circuit switching.id.several ilecs and clecs petitioned for clarification of the une remand order.the fcc issued a clarification in response.clarification order,fcc rcd,petitions for review denied,competitive telecomms.ass fcc.
as relevant to the present case,the clarification addressed the proper methodology for analyzing whether an ilec must unbundle service,assuming it was also required to unbundle service.id.service is the process of originating and terminating calls on the ilec network,providing access to the users physically connected to the ilec local loops and switches,so that they may send and receive calls to and from other networks.service,in contrast,is simply the practice of providing local telephone service to customers using the ilec local network.
the core of the methodology the fcc outlined was that each of these services,even though they both employ the same physical facilities owned by the ilec,needed to be analyzed separately,service by service,for purposes of determining whether the ilec had to unbundle each of them.the fcc noted that the act explicitly distinguishes the markets for the two services.id.again,under the act,whether a given network element must be unbundled depends,in part,on whether the clec would be impair ed absent access to the network element.d.therefore,the commission reasoned,a finding that clecs would be impaired absent access to one of these markets did not mean for that reason alone,and without further inquiry that the clec would be impaired absent access to another of these markets,even though both service and service use the same physical facilities.clarification.in other words,unbundling service did not necessarily mean that service should also be unbundled.the commission task,it explained,instead should be to resolve whether the markets for local exchange service and special access are so closely interrelated from an economic and technological perspective that a showing of impairment with respect to the former market would by itself tend to suggest,as a practical matter,that the impair standard is satisfied with respect to the latter market.id.the commission did not in the clarification,however,resolve whether unbundling should be tied to unbundling it merely stated its intention to do so in a future rulemaking using the methodology it had described.
the commission also noted,more generally,that this impairment analysis outlined in the clarification was a departure from the analysis it had employed in its initial set of unbundling rules.before the supreme court issued its decision in iowa utility board,the commission explained,we sometimes approached an incumbent obligation to unbundle network elements as though it were an proposition,suggesting that,if a competitor were entitled to obtain access to an element for one purpose,it was generally also entitled to obtain access to that element for wholly different purposes as well.id.now that the supreme court has rejected our previous interpretation of that provision as insufficiently rigorous,it continued,it is appropriate for us to revisit the issue.id.the new methodology described by the commission was the result of that revisiting.on petition for review,this court held that the commission new methodology was a reasonable interpretation of the act.competitive telecomms.ass fcc.
service in texas as of august,
the second reference in paragraph that requires additional explanation is its allusion to the service that was offer ing in texas as of august.again,that paragraph required sbc to offer shared transport in the service area within the ameritech states under terms and conditions that are substantially similar to or more favorable than the most favorable terms offers to telecommunications carriers in texas as of august.merger order,app.c.
the scope of sbc offer ings as of that date is complicated by a dispute in which it was embroiled at the time with the texas public utility commission.the dispute was over the scope of sbc contractual obligation to provide shared transport to two clecs,sage telecom and birch telecom of texas.see notice of apparent liability for forfeiture,fcc rcd nal.in particular,the disagreement concerned sbc contractual duty to provide the two clecs service for access and transport area lata toll calls.latas are service areas within which,but not beyond,the bell operating of the operating companies divested from in the early as a result of antitrust authorized to provide telephone service under the decree that the litigation produced.at the beginning of,sbc had been providing such service to sage and birch under agreements with those companies.id.however,sbc interpreted its agreement with sage and birch to authorize sbc to stop providing such service for reasons not relevant here,and announced that it intended to do so.
sage and birch disagreed with sbc and in april complained to the texas public utility commission.that same month,a panel of texas puc arbiters temporarily enjoined sbc from carrying out its plan to stop providing service for intralata toll calls to sage and birch,pending its resolution of the dispute.this injunction was upheld in november about a month after the issuance of the merger order when the arbitration panel ruled that sbc agreements with sage and birch required sbc to provide them with service for intralata toll calls.nal.the full texas puc affirmed the arbitration panel decision the next month.id.
e.the administrative proceedings below 
after the october merger order issued,sbc decided to offer shared transport in the states that ameritech had formerly,indiana,michigan,ohio,and for service,not for intralata toll service.sbc,both in its submissions below and in its briefs,sees a significant difference between providing intralata toll service and providing local service.the market for intralata toll service,unlike the market for local phone service,sbc claims,is competitive,though it does not state precisely how competitive it believes that market is,much less whether that degree of competition is in the public interest.as ilecs generally lack significant market power,the ability to price above cost in that market,the argument goes,there is no warrant for a regulatory requirement for them to provide service in the markets to clecs.
the fcc,however,took the position that paragraph of the merger conditions required sbc to offer such service in the five former ameritech states.because sbc had been providing,pursuant to the interim order of the texas puc arbitration panel,intralata toll service in texas as of august,the fcc concluded that sbc failure to provide such service in the former ameritech states violated paragraph of the merger conditions and issued a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture to that effect in january.see nal.the commission is authorized to impose such forfeitures under b for willful or repeated failures to comply substantially with the terms and conditions of any license or other instrument issued by the commission.the notice proposed a forfeiture amount of million.id.for substantially the same reasons outlined in the notice of apparent liability,the commission in october issued an order assessing a million forfeiture on sbc,the statutory maximum million fine per each continuing violation of paragraph,see b b,one for each former ameritech state.forfeiture order,fcc rcd.
in april,sbc paid the million forfeiture and petitioned this court for review of the fcc forfeiture order.we have jurisdiction over the petition pursuant to a.see at t fcc.
ii.analysis 
sbc raises two challenges to the forfeiture order.sbc first argues that it was not on fair notice that paragraph of the merger conditions obligated it to provide service for intralata toll calls in the former ameritech states,and therefore that the forfeiture infringed its due process rights.sbc second argument is that the fcc imposed the fine in fashion.both arguments fail.
the first issue we address is whether the merger conditions allowed sbc to identify,with ascertainable certainty,the standards with which the agency expect ed sbc to conform,trinity broad.fcc,quoting general electric epa,internal quotation marks omitted,and therefore gave sbc the process it was due under the fifth amendment.more specifically,the question is whether paragraph of the merger conditions clearly placed sbc on notice that it was required to provide service for intralata toll calls in the five former ameritech states.the answer is yes.
paragraph plainly says that sbc was required to provide such service.paragraph required sbc to 
offer shared transport in the service area within the ameritech states under terms and conditions,other than rate structure and price,that are substantially similar to or more favorable than the most favorable terms offers to telecommunications carriers in texas as of august.
merger order,app.c.the parties agree that as of august,sbc was providing service to two clecs for intralata toll calls.from this fact,one might think it fairly straightforward to conclude that sbc was required to provide that same service throughout the ameritech states.the condition directs the parties to look at the terms sbc was offer ing in texas on a date certain.on that date,sbc was providing shared transport service for intralata toll calls.it seems to follow that sbc would be required to provide that same service in the former ameritech states.indeed,it is difficult to imagine how the parties could have more clearly specified the precise terms of providing service the same,or more favorable,terms that were in effect on a date certain between a company and its customers in a single state.
sbc vigorous attempts to create ambiguity in these words are not persuasive.sbc argues that it was not clear that it was offer ing such service to those clecs,because it was providing such service involuntarily,pursuant to an injunction entered by an arbitration panel of the texas puc.this argument is a.sbc concedes that the term offer means t o present for acceptance or rejection,or t o put forward for consideration.sbc reply br.at quoting american heritage dictionary ed.sbc did exactly that by providing two clecs with service for intralata toll calls.it does not matter whether sbc was providing the service involuntarily.even involuntary offers to contract are still offers in the ordinary sense of that word.they are offers because the this case,the the option of voluntarily either accepting or rejecting it.this core feature of an offer does not depend on why the offeror present s it.
another condition confirms this plain meaning of the word offer.paragraph of the conditions is headed offering of unes.that condition provides that shall continue to make available such unes that were made available in the state under sbc current interconnection agreements.merger order,app.c.the merger conditions call this an offering even though the conditions require sbc to make available such unes.if sbc reading of the term offer were correct,that heading would make no sense.
sbc argument that the term shared transport in the conditions was defined to include service only for local calls is also unpersuasive.sbc correctly points out that paragraph of the conditions defined the function of shared transport as defined in the shared transport order,fcc rcd subsequent history omitted,and argues that this definition only encompassed service for local calls.the definition of shared transport in that order,however,did not exclude toll service.the order dealt with shared transport as defined by the commission.id.at the time of the shared transport order,the commission defined shared transport as the transmission facilities shared by more than one carrier,including the incumbent lec,between end office switches,between end office switches and tandem switches,and between tandem switches,in the incumbent lec network.d ii see also merger order defining shared transport the same way.that definition includes intralata toll service,as intralata toll service uses ilecs end office switches,tandem switches.it is irrelevant that scattered passages in the shared transport order referred to shared transport in the context of discussing the provision of local telephone service.see fcc rcd.regardless,it remains true that the definition of shared transport in that order included intralata toll service.for the same reason,it is also irrelevant that the commission stated in that order that shared transport is particularly important for stimulating initial competitive entry into the local exchange market.id.paragraph of the conditions establishes that the definition of shared transport in the order is what matters,not the purpose for which the commission believed shared transport particularly important.
sbc also points to paragraph reference to unbundled local switching,and claims that because the switching at issue in paragraph was limited to local switching sbc reasonably understood that the shared transport necessarily connected to that switching was likewise limited to local.sbc br.at.to the contrary,this understanding is not reasonable.paragraph did not tie sbc obligation to provide shared transport,as sbc brief suggests,to that shared transport that was necessarily connected to local switching.it tied that obligation to sbc again,as defined in the shared transport order offerings in texas as of august.as discussed,service for intralata toll service was one such offering.
equally unavailing are sbc attempts to overcome the clear meaning of paragraph by citing affidavits from several sbc employees and a former employee of the law firm of kellogg,huber,hansen,todd,and evans,the firm representing sbc in this matter,who were all involved in negotiating the merger conditions.sbc claims that these affidavits show that the intent of the parties in drafting paragraph was to obligate sbc only to provide service for local,not toll,service.as it is impossible for the individuals involved in multilateral negotiations to speak to the collective intent of all parties involved in those negotiations,however,such statements throw little light on the meaning of the actual document to which those parties collectively agreed.the best objective evidence of the collective intent of the parties in such circumstances is the ordinary meaning of that document,and that meaning,as we have stated,is plain.the affidavits therefore fall far short of creating the ambiguity sbc seeks.
sbc further argues that subsequent fcc orders have altered its obligation in paragraph to provide for intralata toll service,but this argument too is incorrect.sbc claim relies on paragraph statement that sbc obligations under the merger conditions were s ubject to the terms of any future commission orders regarding the obligation to provide unbundled local switching and shared transport.merger order,app.c.the major premise of sbc argument is that this language means that subsequent commission decisions regarding ilecs unbundling duties under the act govern sbc obligations under paragraph of the merger conditions.the minor premise is that two subsequent commission une remand order and a commission clarification of that implicitly found that ilecs are not generally obligated to unbundle service to complete intralata toll calls.as those orders govern the merger conditions,sbc contends,sbc is not obligated to provide service for intralata toll calls,regardless of whether the merger conditions originally imposed that obligation on it.
the major premise of this argument is incorrect.the dictionary definition of subject to,in the sense apparently meant here,is contingent on or under the influence of some later action.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.as the subject to phrase does not specify in what particular sense paragraph is contingent on those future orders,it is natural to read the subject to phrase simply to adopt anything in those future orders that,by the terms of such orders,contravened or altered anything in paragraph.for example,if the fcc issued a future order stating that shared transport,as we defined in the merger order,excludes service for intralata toll service,then the definition of shared transport would be so modified.the future orders condition the merger conditions in exactly the sense any future order would condition an old order anything in the old order that is contradicted or modified by the new order is void.
sbc,nevertheless,reads into the subject to language the notion that future commission orders concerning ilecs general unbundling obligations govern the scope of its obligation.sbc reply br.at.although sbc reply brief denies it,this inference hinges on the assumption that subject to means superseded by or governed by,that is,that those subsequent particular,the une remand order and the resulting specified sbc duties under paragraph of the merger conditions,regardless of what that paragraph originally required.this way of speaking defies linguistic convention.superseded by means to displace in favor of another,merriam webster co
