the board of regents of the university of texas system board of regents appeals a final judgment by the united states district court for the western district of texas.bd.of regents of the of.benq am.may.the district court entered final judgment after the parties stipulated that benq america,et collectively benq did not infringe patent patent,owned by the board of regents.the parties stipulated to judgment based on the district court construction of the claim term syllabic element and its subsequent decision to grant summary judgment of to motorola motorola based,in part,on that construction.the board of regents appeals both the district court claim construction and its grant of summary judgment.for the reasons explained below,we affirm.
background 
the patent,entitled character pattern recognition and communications apparatus,describes an apparatus and method designed to enable entry and transmission of a word or words using a standard,telephone.patent,abstract.for each letter of the word to be transmitted,a user depresses a single key on a telephone keypad,the key is selected for the letter a.id.because each key available on the standard telephone keypad represents more than one letter,the user input will be inherently ambiguous.id.as an example,to enter the word help on the keypad,a user depresses a sequence of four keys,one key for each letter of the word,ll.while this sequence corresponds to different alphabetic character strings only one of these corresponds to an english word help.id.thus,in order to resolve the ambiguity and correctly identify the inputted word,the method compares this sequence against a vocabulary,a directory of possible entries,abstract.the specification of the patent states that the vocabulary may include either words or syllabic elements that can be combined to form a word.while it is easier for the system to compare the inputted word to a vocabulary of words,the system can minimize memory requirements and enable an expanded word recognition capability by using a vocabulary of syllabic elements instead,abstract see,describing method for employing syllabic element vocabulary.
during the application short prosecution history,the examiner rejected the claims as anticipated by an article written by lawrence rabiner and ronald schafer rabiner,digital techniques for computer voice response implementations and applications,proceedings of the ieee,vol.the examiner noted that rabiner taught a system described by the claims,in which a single key is depressed for each letter of a word to be transmitted even though each key corresponds to multiple different letters.in response to the rejection,the board of regents amended the claims and explained,in contrast to rabiner,the present invention employs a data base of syllabic elements letter groups which are combined to form a word of standard english text emphasis omitted.following this amendment,the examiner and the attorney for the board of regents participated in interviews.the interview summary indicates that they agreed that the invention was patentable over rabiner for the reasons argued in the amendment,the claims would be allowable if made definite,and the examiner was authorized to amend the independent claims for this purpose.the examiner then mailed a notice of allowability containing an examiner amendment that made various changes to the claims,which resulted in the issuance of the patent.claim the only independent claim asserted by the board of regents recites 
a method of communicating,utilizing a keyboard where at least some of the keys represent two or more alphabetic characters,comprising the steps of 
inputting a word into said keyboard by depressing a single key for each alphabetic character of said word 
transmitting signals generated by the key depressions 
receiving said transmitted signals and decoding the signals into binary code 
matching said binary code with one or more codes,each code being representative of a syllabic element 
f orming a representation of the word from the one or more syllabic elements represented by the matched one or more codes and 
outputting the word representation in a form perceptible to the user.
patent,emphasis added.
in march and may of,the board of regents filed three separate lawsuits in the western district of texas alleging infringement of claim and its dependent claim of the patent by an extensive list of defendants in october of that year,the district court consolidated these three cases into the instant suit.the district court then designated a special master,who conducted a markman hearing and recommended constructions for the claim terms and phrases that the parties disputed.the district court adopted the special master recommendations with a slight clarification and issued a claim construction order.bd.of regents of the of.benq am.july,claim construction order.
in the claim construction order,the district court addressed eleven disputed claim terms and phrases,only two of which are relevant to this appeal.first,the district court concluded that the claim term syllabic element means a letter group that either comprises a word or can be combined with other letter groups to form a word,slip op.at.second,the district court concluded that the claim term one or more codes did not require construction.while benq argued that the term meant a database of codes in which each of the codes represents a syllabic element,wherein the database can not include more than a few complete words,the district court found that the term meaning was clear and benq construction was both unhelpful to a jury and possibly incorrect,slip op.at.
on november,motorola filed a motion for summary judgment of,which argued that its accused devices did not infringe the matching limitation of claim,matching said binary code with one or more codes,each code being representative of a syllabic element.the district court granted motorola motion.bd.of regents of the of.benq am,summary judgment order.while the district court had only construed one term within this limitation,syllabic element,it determined that the plain language of claim and the prosecution history require that each time a binary code is matched,it must be matched against a syllabic element,slip op.at.moreover,the district court reasoned that if it were to adopt the board of regents argument that the accused devices intermittently infringe when they do match against a syllabic element,rabiner would anticipate because the rabiner database of complete words,some of which were words,would intermittently match against a syllabic element,slip op.at.ultimately,the district court concluded that the accused devices do not infringe the matching limitation because none of the accused devices relies upon a vocabulary of only syllabic elements,even if certain entries in those vocabularies happen to be one syllable long,slip op.at.
based upon the district court construction of the term syllabic element and its grant of summary judgment to motorola,the parties stipulated to judgment of for all remaining defendants.on may,the district court entered final judgment,and the board of regents appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
the board of regents challenges both factors underlying the stipulated claim construction of syllabic element and the district court grant of summary judgment.the board of regents arguments regarding summary judgment are divisible into two separate categories.first,the board of regents alleges that the district court failed to resolve all factual inquires in favor of the.this argument challenges whether summary judgment was properly granted under the second step of our infringement comparison between a claim and the accused device.see cook biotech acell,determining infringement generally requires two steps.first,the claim must be properly construed to determine its scope and meaning.second,the claim as properly construed must be compared to the accused device or process.quoting carroll touch,electro mech.
second,the board of regents argues that the district court improperly rejected its intermittent infringement argument and erroneously determined that the accused devices fell outside the scope of the claims.because this second argument in effect challenges the proper scope of the asserted claims,it appears to us to fall more appropriately under the first step of our infringement construction.see id.specifically,it appears that the district court summary judgment order effectively construed the claim phrase each code being representative of a syllabic element to require that the vocabulary include only syllabic elements.thus,we will evaluate the proper construction of both the claim term syllabic element and the claim phrase each code being representative of a syllabic element and then compare the claim to the accused devices to determine whether summary judgment of was proper.
benq,for its part,defends both the district court grant of summary judgment and its construction of syllabic element.benq also provides two alternative grounds for affirming the judgment the claim term syllabic element is indefinite and,thus,the asserted claims are invalid and the district court should have granted summary judgment of because the accused devices do not decod e the signals into binary code,as is required by all asserted claims.
this court reviews claim construction de novo.cybor fas,en banc.while infringement is a question of fact,bai l l wings,we review a district court grant of summary judgment without deference,innogenetics,abbott.a summary judgment motion is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact,while viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the party.see.c.
claim construction 
syllabic element 
the district court construed the term syllabic element as 
a letter group that either comprises a word or can be combined with other letter groups to form a word.a syllabic element may be as small as a single letter.
bd.of regents of the of.benq am.july,summarizing the rulings of the claim construction order.the board of regents asserts that this construction incorrectly requires a syllabic element to be and proposes that syllabic element be construed as a word or a part of a word that can be combined with other words or parts of words to form a word.benq,on the other hand,argues that the term syllabic element either has the definition provided by the district court or is indefinite.after reviewing the intrinsic record,we conclude that the district court correctly construed the term syllabic element.
while we begin our inquiry with the language of the claims,vitronics conceptronic,that language,by itself,provides little guidance in this case.claim does specify that each code is representative of a syllabic element and that a representation of the word is formed from the one or more syllabic elements.patent,ll.from this,however,we can simply conclude that a word is comprised of one or more syllabic elements.
we next turn to the specification,which repeatedly distinguishes between a word and a syllabic element and indicates that a word is comprised of syllabic elements,confirming our understanding of the claim language and explaining that the terms word and syllabic element are not coextensive in scope.see,patent,abstract s yllabic elements are used to reconstruct the word,t he apparatus recognizes a particular word in terms of syllabic elements,identifying an alphabetic character string,such as a word or syllabic element.the specification also notes that t he syllabic elements can comprise any number of alphabetic characters for example,from to alphabetic characters,see,explaining that the preferred embodiment has a vocabulary table that accommodates syllabic elements ranging from one to nine characters in size.as explained by the district court,the most logical rationale for the only example having a maximum is that the longest single syllables in the english language are nine letters in length.claim construction order,slip op.at identifying seven,words screeched,scratched,scrounged,scrunched,stretched,straights,and strengths.
finally,the specification provides a short description of the term syllabic element 
in the preferred embodiment,syllabic elements are stored in memory and combined to create the words.for example,the con letter group in contest,silicon,conference,contact,is such a stored syllabic element.thus,the vocabulary stored in the preferred embodiment includes common,suffixes,prefixes,single letters,and a few complete words,genericly sic referred to as syllabic elements.
this passage provides the specification only example of a syllabic element con and it is a letter group that is both a word and able to be combined to form other words.this passage even compares this letter group the example syllabic element to words,contest,silicon,conference,contact,implying that a syllabic element is limited to a single syllable.
the board of regents,on the other hand,argues that this passage in fact implies the a syllabic element may be more than one syllable.it reasons that because common,suffixes,and prefixes are referred to as syllabic elements,the term syllabic element must include every common,suffix,or prefix.according to the board of regents,because some suffixes and prefixes include more than one syllable,hypo,hyper,ation,phyllic,this passage compels a construction that allows syllabic elements to be more than one syllable.we are not persuaded.just because a syllabic element may be a prefix or a suffix does not mean that all prefixes and suffixes are syllabic elements.similarly,this portion of the specification includes common as possible syllabic elements,but even the board of regents does not contend that all common letter groups are syllabic elements.
with the background provided by the claims and the specification,we examine the patent prosecution history.t he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution,making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.phillips awh,en banc citing vitronics,at.while there are times that the prosecution history lacks the clarity of other intrinsic sources,the prosecution history may be given substantial weight in construing a term where that term was added by amendment.see jansen rexall sundown,in this case,the claim phrases at issue were added to gain allowance of the claims we must therefore give them weight,for the patentability of the claims hinged upon their presence in the claim language.
the board of regents added the term syllabic element to claim during prosecution of the patent.originally,claim recited matching said binary code with a code,said code being representative of an alphabetic character string.emphasis added.two of its dependent claims further defined the claimed alphabetic character first specified that the alphabetic character string comprised one or more syllabic elements which combine to form a word,while the second specified that it comprised a word.the examiner,however,rejected all three claims as anticipated by rabiner,which describes processing a received signal to identify the word or words of a request.moreover,the examiner noted that any recognized word input,as in rabiner,necessarily comprises one or more syllabic elements as claimed by the dependent claim.in response,the board of regents amended claim,replacing an alphabetic character string with one or more syllabic elements,and canceled the two dependent claims the latter of which specified that the character string comprised a word,as noted above.when describing the differences between its claims and rabiner disclosure,the board of regents equated syllabic elements to letter groups.
this prosecution history,like the specification,consistently distinguishes between a syllabic element and a word.moreover,like the district court,we find illuminating the explanation that syllabic elements are letter groups.see claim construction order,slip op.at relying on this phrase despite the fact that,a t first glance,it may appear to have accomplished little more than the trading of one obscure term of art for another.something is when it shares a syllable essential recognizable rhythmic beat of a spoke
