introduction 
these petitions arise from the federal communications commission fcc report and order changing its interpretation of a provision of the telecommunications act of,stat.in,the fcc adopted a new rule replacing its interpretation of i with an interpretation.petitioners in various circuits challenged the new rule,and the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the petitions in this court we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a.we conclude that i is ambiguous and that the fcc interpretation is reasonable.we also conclude that the fcc did not abuse its discretion by adopting new rule.accordingly,we deny the petitions for review.
ii.background 
in passing the telecommunications act of,congress fundamentally restructured local telephone markets to promote competition states can no longer enforce laws that impede competition,and incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs which had been monopolies,are subject to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.ilecs must make their networks available to new entrants to the market,referred to as competitive local exchange carriers clecs.ilecs must also attempt in good faith to negotiate interconnection agreements with the clecs 
title provides procedures for negotiation,arbitration,and approval of interconnection agreements between ilecs and clecs.section i provides 
a local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under an agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.
the meaning of this provision lies at the heart of this dispute.
in august,the fcc first interpreted i,adopting the rule under,a requesting clec could adopt individual provisions from any approved interconnection agreement to which the ilec was already a party 
clecs ability to pick and choose individual provisions from existing interconnection agreements was not unrestricted.ilecs were only required to make individual provisions of an agreement available to clecs for a reasonable period of time,and ilecs could avoid the rule where hardship would result in addition,ilecs could require a requesting clec to agree to terms and conditions that were legitimately related to the service or element requested 
soon after the fcc released the local competition order,many ilecs and some state utility commissions filed petitions challenging various aspects of the order these cases were consolidated in the eighth circuit the petitioners argued,among other things,that the rule was an unreasonable interpretation of i the eighth circuit agreed with the petitioners,held that the text of i was ambiguous and concluded that was an unreasonable interpretation 
the supreme court reversed.the court held that the fcc interpretation was not only reasonable but the most readily apparent.it also observed that whether would in practice impede or promote voluntary negotiations between ilecs and clecs was a matter eminently within the fcc expertise 
after using for seven years,the fcc decided to revisit the rule.in,it sought comment on whether the commission should alter its interpretation of section i to promote more meaningful commercial negotiations.in response,many clecs,some state utility commissions,and a consumer advocacy association submitted statements in favor of.ilecs,other state utility commissions,and two clecs submitted statements in favor of eliminating.
on july,the fcc adopted the new rule under,if a requesting clec is interested in a service or network element provided by an ilec,it may adopt in its entirety any approved agreement that includes that service or element to which the ilec is already a party 
as a threshold matter,the fcc determined that it had the authority to reinterpret i because the plain meaning of the section text gives rise to two different,reasonable interpretations,and because the supreme court expressly recognized that the commission has leeway to reinterpret section i.in particular,congress use of the phrase upon the same terms and conditions created ambiguity regarding whether clecs could adopt individual provisions of existing approved agreements,or whether they had to adopt the entire agreement an agency has discretion to change its interpretation of an ambiguous statute and is not subject to estoppel for changing its view,the fcc noted 
as to why it believed reinterpretation of i was necessary,the fcc observed that,when it first adopted the rule,it had no practical experience with the actual mechanics of interconnection agreements and had made inaccurate presumptions.however,after e ight years of experience with the rule,it was clear to the fcc that the rule impeded negotiations and resulted in the adoption of largely standardized agreements with little creative bargaining to meet the needs of both the i lec s and the clecs.ilecs seldom made significant concessions in negotiations for fear that third parties would obtain equivalent benefits without making any trade off at all,the fcc explained furthermore,clecs often chose to adopt existing approved agreements in their entirety,in contrast to the fcc initial prediction finally,the fcc found that the provision under allowing an ilec to require inclusion of legitimately related agreement terms ha d become an obstacle to negotiations rather than an incentive.
the fcc concluded that,unlike the rule,an rule would better serve the goals of sections and because it would encourage i lecs to make in negotiations that they we re reluctant to accept under the rule.the fcc codified the rule at 
iii.discussion 
we review the fcc adoption of the rule under the framework established in chevron,natural resources defense council,first,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,then we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
we also review the fcc adoption of the rule for an abuse of discretion under the administrative procedure act apa 
chevron step one section i is ambiguous 
in the first step of the chevron analysis,we determine whether i is ambiguous that is,whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.the issue in this case is whether i requires the rule that is whether it requires ilecs to make individual provisions of their existing,approved interconnection agreements available to clecs.we conclude that the statute does not require the rule,it only permits it.congress simply has not spoken to the precise question before us.
nothing in i unambiguously requires an ilec to make available to clecs individual agreement provisions.with the disputed phrases in italics,here,again,is the text of i 
a local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under an agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.
the phrase any interconnection,service,or network element indicates that congress intended to require ilecs to make their services and network elements available to clecs on an individual,unbundled basis it does not unambiguously require that ilec make individual provisions of existing agreements available to clecs.the phrase upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement expresses congress intent to require ilecs to deal with clecs on a nondiscriminatory basis but,again,this phrase does not unambiguously require that ilecs make individual provisions of existing agreements available to clecs.it could mean that,once an ilec negotiates an interconnection agreement with a clec,the ilec can not deny another clec access to services and network elements under all of the same terms and conditions.
we are not persuaded by the petitioners arguments that i is u
