we have on appeal a decision of the florida public service commission concerning regulatory assessment fees on the gross operating revenues of level communications,llc.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we affirm the decision of the public service commission for the reasons expressed below.
background 
on may,level communications,llc level pursuant to section,florida statutes,and rule,florida administrative code,filed a petition for declaratory statement requesting a determination from the florida public service commission psc concerning items to be included in gross operating revenues from intrastate commerce.level maintained that its collocation revenues should not be included as gross operating revenues derived from intrastate business as contemplated by rule,florida administrative code,and sections b and,florida statutes,for purposes of calculating the regulatory assessment fee for calendar year.level filed its petition for a declaratory statement after the psc audited level regulatory assessment filing fee and concluded that the company should include revenues from collocation in in the amount of,as part of its gross operating revenues derived from intrastate business to calculate the regulatory assessment fee due.level asked the psc to declare that the revenue an alec generates from collocation should be excluded from the fee calculation.
in its petition,level argued that collocation revenues were lease payments made by new alecs for occupying space in level gateway facilities so collocation should be considered as a simple real property transaction.level further argued that because collocation does not involve the provision of telecommunication services,it should not be included as part of the company gross operating revenues.in support of its position,level cited to the declaratory statement issued by the psc in order no.verizon order.there,the psc determined that verizon was required to pay regulatory assessment fees on directory publishing revenues.level contended that the verizon order makes it clear that sections b and,florida statues,were never intended to impose a regulatory assessment fee on the revenues of a regulated telecommunications company that are not derived from a required component of that telecommunications company communications service.according to level,the psc position would subject optional,nontelecommunications services and revenues such as collocation or the sale of customer premises equipment to the regulatory assessment fee.level argued that because collocation is neither a telecommunications service nor a service required in conjunction with the provision of a telecommunications service,its collocation revenues should be excluded from its gross operating revenues for regulatory fee calculations.
the psc disagreed,finding that level was required to include revenues derived from collocation in its regulatory assessment fee calculation.the psc found that level collocation revenues were gross operating revenues derived from intrastate commerce,and the regulatory fee statutes did not contemplate the exclusion of those revenues from the fee calculation.the psc reasoned that the statutes only permitted two specific exclusions from gross operating revenues for regulatory assessment fee purposes interstate revenues,and a deduction for amounts paid to other telecommunications companies for the use of the facilities.the psc noted that the regulatory statutes do not tie the fees to services of any particular kind at all,but to a regulated company intrastate business,a term that is clearly more inclusive than what level proposes.since level collocation revenues did not fall under the specific exclusions,the psc found that the revenues should be included 
an agency interpretation of the statute that it is charged with enforcing is entitled to great deference.see bellsouth telecommunications,johnson,so d.this court will not depart from the contemporaneous construction of a statute by a state agency charged with its enforcement unless the construction is clearly unauthorized or erroneous.see ventures,nichols,so d.the party seeking to challenge the psc order has the burden of overcoming these presumptions by showing departure from the essential requirements of law.florida interexchange carriers ass clark,so d.however,this court will not give deference to an agency determination when the agency exceeds its authority.see tampa garcia,so d.thus,unless this court finds that the psc acted outside the scope of its powers and jurisdiction by imposing regulatory assessment fees on level collocation revenues or its decision was clearly unauthorized or erroneous,the psc decision will be afforded deference.
at issue is whether the psc has the authority to collect regulatory assessment fees on the collocation revenues of level.the psc has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate telecommunications of florida.see.stat.florida interexchange carriers ass beard,so d.sections and,florida statutes,establish the formula by which the psc calculates its costs and collects fees needed to cover those costs from telecommunications companies.section creates the florida public service regulatory trust fund and provides the formula for the calculation of the psc regulatory costs and the maximum fee rate that the psc can assess.the statute provides in relevant part 
there is hereby created in the state treasury a special fund to be designated as the florida public service regulatory trust fund which shall be used in the operation of the commission in the performance of the various functions and duties required of it by law.
each regulated company under the jurisdiction of the commission,which company was in operation for the preceding period,shall pay to the commission within days following the end of each period,commencing june,a fee based upon the gross operating revenues for such period subject to the limitations of this subsection.the fees shall,to the extent practicable,be related to the cost of regulating such type of regulated company and shall in no event be greater than 
b for each telephone company licensed or operating under chapter,of percent of its gross operating revenues derived from intrastate business.
differences,if any,between the amount paid in any period and the amount actually determined by the commission to be due shall,upon notification by the commission,be immediately paid or refunded.each regulated company which is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,but which did not operate under the commission jurisdiction during the entire preceding period,shall,within days after the close of the first period during which it commenced operations under,or became subject to,the jurisdiction of the commission,pay to the commission the prescribed fee based upon its gross operating revenues derived from intrastate business during those months or parts of months in which the regulated company did operate during such period.in no event shall payments under this section be less than annually.
section provides the fee rate for telecommunications companies.this section provides 
notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary,each telecommunications company licensed or operating under this chapter,for any part of the preceding period,shall pay to the commission,within days following the end of each period,a fee that may not exceed percent annually of its gross operating revenues derived from intrastate business,except,for purposes of this section and the fee specified in,any amount paid to another telecommunications company for the use of any telecommunications network shall be deducted from the gross operating revenue for purposes of computing the fee due.
level advances several arguments in support of its assertion that its collocation activities are not intrastate business.first,level argues that its collocation product is predominantly interstate,as opposed to intrastate it asserts that its collocation product is akin to a real property transaction.level claims that most of the equipment placed in its gateway facilities are used for the provision of service however,level concedes that it does not know if all the space that i
