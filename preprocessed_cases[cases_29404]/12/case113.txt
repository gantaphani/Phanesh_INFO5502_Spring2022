plaintiff pat gross plaintiff or appellant filed suit against the defendant british broadcasting corporation bbc in which she alleges that without her permission the bbc used her idea for a documentary film about militant animal rights activists.her complaint raises a number of legal theories,but at its core it alleges unjust enrichment and misappropriation of ideas.the bbc is a corporation existing under english law and established by royal charter with its principal office in london,england.the documentary about which gross complains aired only in the united kingdom.she lives in new york city and chose to file the suit in her home forum,the united states district court for the southern district of new york where the case came before judge alvin hellerstein.the bbc has a presence in new york,and is unquestionably subject to personal jurisdiction in the southern district.the district court nevertheless decided that courts in great britain were a more appropriate forum for the trial of this action.accordingly,in a judgment entered february,it granted the bbc motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens.plaintiff timely appeals the dismissal of her suit.
it is not uncommon for more than one forum to have jurisdiction to hear a case.under our legal system,plaintiffs make the initial selection of their preferred venue by filing the suit in a particular forum.we have consistently held that when the plaintiff is a citizen and she selects her home forum,that choice is ordinarily entitled to substantial deference from the courts,especially when there is no challenge regarding the legitimacy of the plaintiff motives for choosing her home forum.
the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens permits a court to decline to exercise jurisdiction when the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice indicate a foreign forum would be the more appropriate forum.but,because of the substantial deference to a citizen choice of her home forum,the balance of interests must strongly favor the defendant to justify dismissal of plaintiff complaint on such grounds.district courts have discretion to determine whether the interests of justice favor dismissal for forum non conveniens,yet that discretion is not unfettered.in this case,we think the district court dismissal of plaintiff suit was manifestly unreasonable and thus an abuse of discretion.we therefore vacate the order dismissing plaintiff suit and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
facts alleged in the complaint 
when we review a case dismissed at the pleading stage,we accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the plaintiff complaint.pat gross is an american citizen who has lived and worked in new york city for years.she has years experience in the television industry as a documentary filmmaker and has researched and produced numerous documentaries that have been broadcast by,among others,cbs,court tv,and the public broadcasting system.she has worked in the industry as a producer,director,researcher and screenwriter.in she conceived the idea for a tv series on the history of the modern animal rights movement and the extremist activities of some of its members in america and europe.in november of that year she approached the bbc with her research and ideas,having already produced several documentaries for defendant earlier.according to her affidavit,plaintiff entitled the series beastly business.plaintiff planned to focus on exposing extremist activities and demonstrating how powerful international organizations have exploited animal welfare for profit.
the bbc is a major television broadcaster based in london and is a corporation organized under english law.the bbc broadcasts a broad array of programming to the british public and its services are publicly funded by the british government.thus gross traveled to london in november to present her proposal to the bbc.she spoke to several executives there who expressed interest in her project.
while in london,gross was referred to an executive producer at defendant twenty twenty television,twenty twenty,an independent production company,organized under english law,and with its principal place of business in england.twenty twenty produces documentaries that have been broadcast in both england and the united states.plaintiff discussed her proposal with that company executives,and they jointly agreed that twenty twenty would the documentary,although gross would continue to be responsible for selling the proposal to the bbc.her agreement with twenty twenty provided that she would retain proprietary rights in the series,receive producer credits,produce and direct at least one episode,and participate at least as an assistant director on others.if the series were accepted by the bbc,twenty twenty would pay percent of the production costs,and receive production credit and compensation in return.
together,plaintiff and twenty twenty developed a treatment essentially a summary and written pitch for the present to the bbc.the treatment referred to some of the research gross had already completed on the project.she thought her proposal contained newsworthy information,and that some of the information she submitted was and volatile.because of this gross was anxious for the bbc to make a decision quickly.
in december plaintiff expressed some dissatisfaction over twenty twenty work related to the treatment and the bbc commission.she thought the work lacked professionalism and that there were defects in the presentation.nevertheless,the bbc once more expressed interest in the project,and in january,plaintiff again traveled from new york to london to meet with bbc executives.
during the first half of,gross unsuccessfully sought a commitment from the bbc.in march she was informed that one of the bbc channels had declined to commission the series,and that plaintiff and twenty twenty should revise the treatment and resubmit it.they revised the treatment,and twenty twenty then resubmitted it in april,though gross asserts she did not give permission for the resubmission.further delays arose,due in part to funding constraints at the bbc.by june plaintiff was concerned that the series was becoming untimely.
on june,she states she formally withdrew the treatment from both the bbc and from twenty twenty.she did this by sending several emails and faxes to executives of both defendants declaring that she was withdrawing the series effective immediately.twenty twenty responded that it could not force the bbc to make a quick decision,and that it would not accept her withdrawal.plaintiff began shopping the series to broadcasters.
on july,a twenty twenty executive informed her that a bbc channel had commissioned the series.she reminded both twenty twenty and the bbc that she had withdrawn the series,but was told that the bbc was going ahead with the production.a bbc executive contacted gross and asked her to reconsider her withdrawal,to which she responded she would reconsider only if twenty twenty was replaced as.
communication between plaintiff and both the defendants ceased shortly thereafter.the bbc went on to produce the series without gross,and eventually broadcast the documentary as a production entitled beastly business.the series aired in late and early,and was shown only on a bbc channel in the,not in the plaintiff contends this production relied on her research and ideas.
proceedings below 
plaintiff filed her suit against the bbc and twenty twenty on july,in the southern district of new york,and her amended complaint raises causes of action.as the district court noted,her complaint is based primarily on theories of misappropriation of ideas and unjust enrichment.twenty twenty moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,and on december,plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her claims against that defendant.shortly thereafter she also voluntarily dismissed her cause of action for violations of the lanham act.
the bbc filed a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens,on which the district court held a hearing.it first ruled that twenty twenty was not an indispensable party,and that the action could proceed against the bbc alone.the trial court noted that twenty twenty could voluntarily defend itself if it felt its interests were being prejudiced,and that the bbc in any event retained the right to sue twenty twenty,if it chose to do so.
with respect to the forum non conveniens motion,the district court recognized plaintiff was entitled,on a prima facie basis,to vindicate her rights in her home forum.but,it went on to point out that british law would apply to this action,and that the relevant witnesses,aside from plaintiff,resided in britain.the trial court conducted an oral analysis of the appropriate factors relating to a forum non conveniens motion,and determined that the balance of overall interests favored dismissal of the case.
gross declared that if she were forced to sue in britain,her action would in reality be barred because she could not afford the litigation expenses,since the british system does not permit contingent fee arrangements for such actions.the bbc countered that comparable arrangements were indeed available in some circumstances,and that any difficulty plaintiff would face obtaining counsel was due to the weakness of her causes of action.the district court expressed concern regarding gross ability to obtain counsel in the.it addressed this concern by conditioning its dismissal on the bbc acceptance of certain conditions designed to alleviate her difficulty in retaining british counsel.it suggested,for example,that the parties agree to waive arrangements that award attorneys fees to the prevailing party,so that plaintiff would not face an oppressive financial burden if she lost.
in a written memorandum,the district court memorialized its earlier analysis and dismissed plaintiff suit on the ground of forum non conveniens.it did so after the bbc willingly consented to three conditions the district court imposed refraining from seeking security for costs and attorneys fees from gross waiving any right it might have under british law as a prevailing party to seek costs and attorneys fees from plaintiff and refraining from interference with plaintiff efforts to obtain an attorney on a contingent fee basis.the trial court also ruled that the waiver of prevailing party costs and attorneys fees should be mutual,so that gross would have to waive her right to seek such fees from the bbc if she prevailed.the court contemporaneous order dismissing plaintiff complaint explicitly incorporated those conditions.we proceed to an analysis of the law.
discussion 
the doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a district court to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of a case even when jurisdiction is authorized by the letter of a general venue statute.gulf oil gilbert.a trial court may decline jurisdiction when doing so would best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.koster american lumbermens mut.cas.the change of venue statute,a,is ordinarily used as the vehicle to transfer a case when the preferred forum is another district court.but,if the preferred venue is a foreign court,a federal trial court may dismiss under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.
the decision to dismiss a case for forum non conveniens is confided to the sound discretion of the district court,to which we accord substantial deference.piper aircraft reyno,d dirienzo philip servs,cir.we reverse that court decision only if we determine it clearly has abused its discretion.pollux holding chase manhattan bank,cir.in the context of a forum non conveniens ruling,a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests either on an error of law,or on a clearly erroneous finding of fact,or if the court fails to consider all the relevant factors or unreasonably balances those factors.see piper aircraft,at.pollux,at.
in a recent en banc decision,we set out the analysis a district court must perform to evaluate a forum non conveniens motion.see iragorri united techs,cir en banc.the initial inquiry is to determine the degree of deference to which the plaintiff choice of forum is entitled.id.at.once that determination is made,the court must conduct the analysis set out in gulf oil gilbert.under gilbert,step two is to determine whether an adequate alternative forum exists.if the answer is yes,then the final,or third step,is to balance the private and public interests to decide whether the case should be adjudicated in the plaintiff choice of forum or in the alternative forum proposed by defendant.gilbert,at.
i deference to plaintiff choice of forum 
as we explained in iragorri,a plaintiff choice of forum is presumptively entitled to substantial deference.at.indeed,our legal system has traditionally deferred to the plaintiff choice of forum,and unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant,the plaintiff choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.gilbert,at.
however,the degree of deference to the plaintiff forum depends in part on a number of considerations,such as the plaintiff own connection to that forum.the supreme court in piper aircraft explained that a plaintiff choice of her home forum is ordinarily entitled to great deference because it is presumed to be convenient.at.by contrast,if a foreign plaintiff selects a forum,that presumption of convenience is less plausible.in such a circumstance,the defendant may be able to demonstrate that the location was selected by plaintiff for reasons,such as the belief that local liability rules or damage awards will be favorable to it.
in iragorri we confronted an intermediate proposition,one of a plaintiff suing in a forum that was not her home.we reconciled that situation with the strong deference for plaintiffs suing in their home forum and the weaker deference for foreign plaintiffs by applying a sliding scale 
the more it appears that a domestic or foreign plaintiff choice of forum has been dictated by reasons that the law recognizes as valid,the greater the deference that will be given to the plaintiff forum choice.stated differently,the greater the plaintiff or the lawsuit bona fide connection to the united states and to the forum of choice and the more it appears that considerations of convenience favor the conduct of the lawsuit in the united states,the more difficult it will be for the defendant to gain dismissal for forum non conveniens.
at.thus,while the initial presumption is to defer to the plaintiff choice,the iragorri scale is a tool to assess whether there are reasons to doubt the presumption of convenience.
here there are somewhat conflicting considerations.appellant flew to england in hopes of making a deal with the companies located there.she should not be surprised therefore that most of the witnesses and relevant documents are there.by seeking out business in that country,gross could reasonably expect that disputes arising from those contacts might be litigated in the courts of great britain.conversely,the bbc knew gross was an american who lived in new york,and that much of her research on the project had been performed in the united states.the bbc own presence in new york is reason for the bbc to expect that circumstances may arise that would require it to litigate here.
we think it significant that plaintiff has sued in her home forum,and that forum is one in which the bbc is amenable to process.we took iragorri en banc to consider the deference due to a plaintiff suing outside her home forum.nothing in our sliding scale approach calls into question the very strong deference traditionally given a plaintiff suing in her home forum.importantly,the district court did not mention anything to suggest that appellant chose the forum for illegitimate reasons,nor do we find such evidence in the record.this case therefore presents a situation in which courts should initially be at their most deferential a plaintiff suing at home for valid reasons.this conclusion does not foreclose a dismissal for forum non conveniens,since the forum may prove to be excessively burdensome to the defendant,see piper aircraft,at,but the starting point will be one that substantially favors the plaintiff.
the district court recognized this by noting that appellant is entitled to the prot
