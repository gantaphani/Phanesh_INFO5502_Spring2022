in this second interlocutory appeal pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure,biopay,biopay challenges the district court grant of gene gene,gene motion to a class.as in the first interlocutory appeal,gene gene llc biopay llc,cir biopay i,we reverse and remand.
background 
the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa,et,prohibits sending unsolicited advertisements from one fax machine to another.id.at b c.between and,biopay used a contractor to send over fax messages advertising its services to potential clients in louisiana.gene is the owner of marcello wine market,a business that allegedly received a single,unsolicited fax from biopay.gene filed this suit against biopay alleging that biopay violated the tcpa by sending unsolicited faxes to gene and an unidentified number of class members.after discovery,gene moved for class certification,proposing to define the class as 
all recipients of unsolicited telefacsimile messages advertisements within the state of louisiana which were transmitted initiated by or on behalf of biopay,between the dates of january,and through the present.
the named class shall not include any recipients from whom the defendant has received the prior express invitation or permission to receive the telefacsimile advertisements.
biopay i,at.the district court certified the class,determining that it met the requirements of rules a and b of the federal rules of civil procedure.gene gene,llc biopay,llc.biopay brought an interlocutory appeal under rule f and we reverse d the district court certification of the class and remand ed this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion,holding that the determinative question of whether consent can be established via proof must,given the particular facts of this case,be answered in the negative.biopay i,at.
on remand,gene immediately moved to reopen discovery.biopay opposed the motion.the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,who reopened discovery on the limited issue of class certification biopay appealed the magistrate judge order to the district judge biopay also alternatively requested that the district court stay the proceedings and certify the question of whether biopay i intended to allow plaintiff a second bite at the apple for immediate appeal to this court under b.the district court affirmed the magistrate judge decision and declined to certify the question for interlocutory appeal.gene gene,biopay,dist.lexis,at.
gene then issued additional discovery requests.specifically,gene requested the electronic production of a filemaker pro database in its native format and biopay complied.biopay had previously produced a microsoft excel report exported by the filemaker pro program,but not the database itself.the filemaker pro database included a field not contained in the excel report entitled sales notes.gene gene,llc biopay,llc,dist.lexis,at.notably,the district court found that although the excel report did not include the sales notes field,it did contain the fax permission field,a field that appears every bit as important as the neglected field.id.at.in addition to the excel report,biopay had previously produced selected printed screenshots from the filemaker pro program.the screenshots include the filemaker pro report for marcello wine market and show the sales notes field and its associated comments.after obtaining the filemaker pro database,gene found it now had the ability to easily generate a list of all biopay contacts who do not have the fax permission box checked,have no comments or entries in the sales notes field,and whose information was obtained solely from a purchased list,among other search criteria or source information.
in biopay i,we framed the critical substantive issue as whether biopay fax advertisements were transmitted without the prior express invitation or permission of each recipient.biopay i,at.in its decision to the class,the district court agreed with gene that the filemaker pro database creates a common method of establishing the issue of consent.gene gene,dist.lexis,at.finding that the unique facts of the database create common questions of consent,the district court held that common issues predominated individual questions under rule b and ultimately the class as contacts that biopay obtained from purchased lists,but only including those contacts that biopay has no record of communicating with before transmitting a facsimile advertisement.id.at.in the same order,the district court declined to impose sanctions on biopay for its failure to disclose the filemaker pro database in its native format during the original class certification litigation,finding it appears that biopay attempted to comply with its discovery obligations in good faith.id.at.biopay timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
whether biopay i left open the possibility of on remand 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court interpretation of our remand order,including whether the doctrine or mandate rule forecloses any of the district court actions on remand.united states elizondo,cir.this case,however,is before the court pursuant to a rule f interlocutory appeal.the version of rule f in effect at the relevant time stated that a court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.f.the text of the rule makes plain that the sole order that may be appealed is the class certification no other issues may be raised.regents of the of cal.credit suisse first boston usa,cir quotations omitted.in regents,however,the court also noted that review of the factual and legal analysis supporting the district court decision is appropriate on review of class certification id.at.because the district court analysis of our mandate in biopay i was a predicate for class,we consider its interpretation of the mandate.
the law of the case doctrine provides that an issue of law or fact decided on appeal may not be reexamined either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal.fuhrman dretke,cir quotations omitted.exceptions to the doctrine allow reexamination of issues decided on appeal only if i the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different,ii controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues,or iii the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.id.at.the law of the case doctrine applies to matters decided on interlocutory appeals.royal ins.capital,cir.the doctrine is based upon sound policy that when an issue is once litigated and decided,that should be the end of the matter.united states smelting refining mining,see also fontainebleau hotel crossman,cir quoting smelting.the principles surrounding the law of the case doctrine apply equally to the mandate rule,which is but a specific application of the general doctrine of law of the case.united states lee,cir quotations omitted.absent exceptional circumstances,the mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.id.
biopay first argues that biopay i is the law of the case and that it forecloses further discovery on remand and class.gene,as it did in its motion to reopen discovery below,relies heavily upon the continuing duty of district judges to assess class certification orders under rule c c to justify the reopening of discovery and its second attempt at class certification.rule c c provides that a n order that grants or denies the class certification decision may be altered or amended before final judgment.while this rule vests significant discretion in the district court,the district court discretion in managing trials only extends on remand to all areas not covered by the higher court mandate.martin herend imports,diamond gem trading of am,cir quotations omitted.rule f is not an interlocutory tool to clarify issues and provide a roadmap for litigants to reformulate their arguments it is,rather,a tool
