this case involves a facial challenge to north dakota century code chapter the act,which prohibits certain telephone solicitations of north dakota residents who register with the state list.plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations who rely on professional charitable solicitors for their fundraising.
the act exempts telephone solicitations made by charitable organizations if the telephone call is made by a volunteer or employee of the charitable organization and the caller makes specified disclosures.the act thus distinguishes between charitable solicitors and professional charitable solicitors.further,the act restrictions apply only to telephone solicitation.see id.under the act,a charity may hire an outside agency to call registrants to advocate the charity message,but that agency may not solicit the registrant to donate funds.
the district court invalidated a portion of the act as a regulation that failed strict scrutiny.the district court also awarded attorney fees under.north dakota appeals from the invalidation of the act,and the parties the award of attorney fees.we reverse.
we review de novo the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings as to the unconstitutionality of the act.potthoff morin,cir.because professional charitable solicitation is fully protected speech,see riley fed of the blind of north carolina,d,we begin our analysis by determining whether the north dakota regulation is content neutral or content based.
the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message the speech conveys.ward rock against racism,d.a regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral,even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.id.regulation of expressive activity is content neutral if it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.id.
applying these principles to north dakota statute,it is evident that the act is content neutral.first,north dakota has not distinguished between professional and charitable solicitors because of any disagreement with the message that would be conveyed,for the message would be identical regardless of who conveyed it.second,the regulation can be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,for north dakota interest is in protecting residential privacy.
although the act appears to make a subject matter distinction between advocacy and solicitation,a regulation that distinguishes between speech activities likely to produce the consequences that it seeks to prevent and speech activities unlikely to have to those consequences can not be struck down for failure to maintain content neutrality.hill colorado,d.as the tenth circuit observed in reviewing the commercial solicitation restrictions of the national registry,the interest in residential privacy is not limited to the ringing of the phone rather,how invasive a phone call may be is also influenced by the manner and substance of the call.mainstream mktg,cir per curiam.because solicitation may reasonably be viewed as more invasive than advocacy,we conclude that the act is a regulation.see united states kokinda,d plurality of the court upholding postal service regulation distinguishing between solicitation and advocacy fed of the blind of arkansas,pryor,cir.rejecting the charity argument that the regulation was content based because it regulated only speech that solicits charitable contribution or commercial sales.
the test appropriate for regulation of professional charitable solicitation is derived from village of schaumburg citizens for a better environment,d.although the supreme court has not specified whether the schaumburg test is an intermediate scrutiny review of a regulation,we have interpreted it as such.see pryor,at.
we observed in pryor that the schaumburg test is obviously very similar to the time,place,and manner test enunciated in ward.id.at.we then considered a whether the state had a sufficient or legitimate interest b whether the interest identified was significantly furthered by a narrowly tailored regulation and c whether the regulation substantially limited charitable solicitations.id.at.
the first question under pryor is whether the state has a sufficient or legitimate interest.we have held that residential privacy is a significant government interest,particularly when telemarketing calls are flourishing,and becoming a recurring nuisance by virtue of their quantity.van bergen minnesota,cir.see also frisby schultz,d the state interest in protecting the,tranquility,and privacy of the home is certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society.the rationale underlying the north dakota regulation falls within this significant interest.
we next consider whether north dakota regulation is narrowly tailored.the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation and the means chosen does not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the state interest.krantz city of fort smith,cir citations omitted ward,at.when a regulation does not entirely foreclose any means of communication,it may satisfy the tailoring requirement even though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving the statutory goal.hill,at.
north dakota goal of ensuring residential privacy would be achieved less effectively if the legislature exempted professional charitable solicitors from the act.seeking to balance the interest of callers against the privacy rights of subscribers,the legislature distinguished between and professional charitable solicitors.north dakota contends that the distinction is based upon the sheer volume of calls because a charity using paid professional telemarketers is typically able to dial substantially more residential telephone numbers than if the charity used its own volunteers and employees.appellant brief at.in this facial challenge,we are reluctant to the north dakota legislature judgment that professional charitable solicitors intrude more regularly on residents privacy than volunteers or employees and that the act is a necessary means of enabling its citizens to halt these intrusions.see pryor,at giving deference to the state in a facial challenge to the state telephone solicitation regulations.
the fourth circuit recently upheld the federal trade commission ftc provision.fed of the blind,cir.like the statute at issue here,the ftc regulation applied to professional charitable solicitors and exempted or volunteer solicitors.the court held that the regulations struck an appropriate balance between t he rights of charities and telefunders to communicate with potential donors and the right of those donors to enjoy residential peace.id.at.accordingly,the court held that the provision was a permissible governmental response to a legitimate and substantial public concern.id.at.we find the fourth circuit analysis persuasive,and we join in it in upholding the distinction between professional charitable solicitors and charitable solicitors.
the appellees argue that this distinction renders the act underinclusive because a ringing phone disrupts residential privacy whether the caller is a volunteer or a professional.they claim that the exemption of charitable fundraisers demonstrates that the act is not related to residential privacy.although exceptions from an otherwise legitimate regulation of speech may undermine the government reasons for the regulation,city of ladue gilleo,d,we do not perceive that to be the case here.north dakota statute does not give one side of a debate an advantage over the other,but rather it reduces the total number of unwelcome telephone calls to private residences.t he validity of the regulation depends on the relation it bears to the overall problem the government seeks to correct,not on the extent to which it furthers the government interest in an individual case.ward,at.in the case before us,the overall problem is the intrusion on residential pri
