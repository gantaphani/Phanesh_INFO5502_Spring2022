oregon governor theodore kulongoski appeals from the district court order denying his motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity,who are former employees of the state accident insurance fund,brought this action pursuant to,alleging,among other claims,that governor kulongoski violated their fourteenth amendment due process rights by making stigmatizing statements about them in two press releases without providing them hearings.
because the relevant parameters of a fourteenth amendment right to a hearing were not clear at the time of the allegedly stigmatizing statements,we conclude that a reasonable official in the governor position would not have been aware of his alleged obligation to provide plaintiffs hearings.we therefore reverse the district court and hold that governor kulongoski is entitled to qualified immunity in this suit.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs cecil tibbetts and david thurber together,plaintiffs are former managerial employees of defendant state accident insurance fund corporation saif.saif is a part of the executive branch of the state of oregon but is organized to function as a public corporation.the oregon legislature created saif for the purpose of transacting workers compensation insurance and reinsurance business with oregon employers.saif is governed by a board of directors board whose members are appointed by the governor of oregon.and,and who serve at the governor pleasure,id.the board appoints a manager to run saif,who serves at the pleasure of the board of directors.id.governor kulongoski was governor of oregon at all times material to this dispute.
in the time period leading up to the events that are the subject of this appeal,saif was the subject of extensive media attention because of alleged scandals regarding the practices of its,katherine keene.charges of ethics violations had been filed against saif for its alleged failure to report its lobbying expenditures accurately,and a lawsuit had been filed alleging a willful failure to produce documents in violation of public records laws.see oregonians for sound econ.policy,saif,hereinafter,osep litigation.in december,keene resigned from her position as saif.
after keene resignation,plaintiff cecil tibbetts,who had served as vice president for human resources at saif since november,was appointed to act as saif interim by saif board.in april,the saif board responded to governor kulongoski public demand for a report regarding some of saif controversial policies and practices.in a letter to governor kulongoski,the board questioned,among other things,saif relationship with associated oregon industries,a business advocacy group,with which plaintiff david thurber,vice president for policy services at saif,was closely associated.the letter noted that the relationship has been particularly controversial to some,and it therefore merits special attention.some oregon senators called for an independent review of spending,and the media reported that the oregon government standards and practices commission had voted to initiate an investigation into whether saif had the money it spent to lobby the legislature.
in june,mark cohen,a former saif employee,filed an affidavit in the ongoing osep litigation which,among other things,accused tibbetts of twice having ordered the destruction of certain records to avoid producing them in the osep litigation.cohen further alleged that tibbetts was concealing documents in his office and at his home to avoid disclosing them.the contents of the affidavit were covered by the media.saif officials called the allegations erroneous,misleading and untrue and described cohen as a disgruntled former employee who destroyed the documents without their knowledge.tibbetts told a legislative committee that he never told anyone to destroy documents that should have been retained.governor kulongoski thereafter issued a prepared statement to the media,reading 
unauthorized destruction of public records is against the law and can not be tolerated by any public official.these allegations are very serious,and i believe they require immediate investigation.i am asking the attorney general to ensure there is a thorough investigation.
at the same time,governor kulongoski spokeswoman stated to the press that the governor is not taking a position on the allegations.
on august,governor kulongoski issued a press release announcing his intention to appoint brenda rocklin to replace tibbetts as interim of saif.preceding the issuance of that press release,governor kulongoski had explained to board members that he thought rocklin was an appropriate replacement because of her credibility as a person that could fix things.he further told board members that he thought that,given its problems,saif required some housecleaning and that rocklin was the person who could make that happen.during this conversation,some board members reminded governor kulongoski that they alone had the statutory authority to appoint the president of saif.nevertheless,after discussing the replacement,the board voted unanimously on august,to appoint rocklin as interim president and ceo.
in a press release following rocklin appointment,governor kulongoski stated that f or months now,i have been very concerned about management decisions at saif,and i have asked brenda to conduct a review of saif to make sure it is accountable to the public.the governor further stated that t o preserve saif future,the public needs to know that saif is being run in an ethical and accountable the person to lead this effort is brenda rocklin.according to rocklin deposition testimony,in her discussions with governor kulongoski prior to accepting the position as interim president,the governor indicated that he hoped there would be some role for tibbetts at saif corporation,after he was no longer acting president,but that ultimately rocklin would have to make that decision.
according to board member jon egge deposition testimony,in november,after rocklin interim appointment,governor kulongoski contacted the saif board and asked it to call off the search for a permanent ceo for saif,and to appoint rocklin as permanent ceo.another board member,mathew chapman,testified that the governor told the board members that if they did not do so asap,the governor intended to remove them from their positions.at the board november meeting,board member chapman tendered his resignation,explaining that he opposed the governor efforts to install rocklin as the permanent ceo.the board took no action at the november meeting to appoint rocklin to the permanent position.at or about this time,board member egge testified,governor kulongoski also informed saif board members i told rocklin to fire cecil tibbetts if he gets in her way or in any way impeded what she trying to do here,and that goes for anybody else that gets in her way.
on january,rocklin asked tibbetts to resign.tibbetts refused,and rocklin terminated him.on the same day,rocklin met with plaintiff dave thurber and asked him to resign.thurber agreed.the media contacted rocklin and saif about the terminations.saif declined to elaborate on the terminations other than to confirm that tibbetts and thurber were terminated without severance media coverage noted that it was unclear what motivated the firings,but that they appeared to be a part of the housecleaning that the governor that some oregon lawmakers demanded.one article reported that plaintiff tibbetts was a figure who,according to his critics,had a hand in some of the consultant contracts that brought saif under fire.another article mentioned that when governor kulongoski appointed rocklin to conduct a review of saif,t he governor said that several controversies at saif prompted him to take action,including complaints about saif spending on lobbyists and allegations that saif officials destroyed public records.the axing of tibbetts and thurber trims saif management team to six members.
nineteen days after plaintiffs terminations,saif issued its initial report to the governor review of saif corporation.a section of the report dealt with operational deficiencies in properly maintaining public records.this section stated 
prior to our arrival at saif,a former saif employee,mark cohen,had alleged in an affidavit filed in marion county circuit court that he had been instructed to destroy and conceal saif records.specifically,he alleged that,on two occasions,his supervisor,cecil tibbetts,instructed him to delete documents from his computer to avoid having to turn them over in response to a public records request.
the report noted that the investigation is still pending.the report attached a complete copy of the cohen affidavit.
in response to the report,the governor office issued a february,press release the release,which in relevant part stated 
the state accident insurance fund remains a key part of oregon future because it one of the principal competitive advantages we have in growing the economy and providing jobs to oregonians,said governor kulongoski.if we are to preserve that future,the public needs to know that saif is being run in an ethical and accountable manner,and the initial report delivered to me today demonstrates a significant move in that direction.
the initial report focuses on administrative operations and documents findings and recommendations for actions in four key areas board oversight and transparency work place diversity public records and contracting.the report also finds that saif is an efficient agency with highly qualified staff and management teams.
i appreciate the candor of this report and the work of the board of directors,interim president brenda rocklin,and the more than employees who help saif carry out its mission everyday,said the governor.this report identifies the need for some significant changes in how saif conducts business on behalf of the citizens of oregon and i look forward to working with the board,brenda and the legislature to make those changes so we can continue to make progress in strengthening accountability and transparency in this important state agency.
the initial report to the governor is available on the saif website at www.saif.com.
in june,the marion county district attorney office reported on the results of the investigation into the misconduct alleged in the cohen affidavit.the district attorney office reported to the media that the state police conducted an extensive investigation into the allegations but did not find credible evidence that any individuals,or saif as an entity,intentionally withheld or destroyed public records.the report also stated that the investigation had uncovered some serious issues regarding the credibility of cohen.in response to this report,on june,the governor office issued a press release the release,which stated 
i am grateful to the oregon police and the marion county da for answering my request for a through investigation of this case.the saif corporation is critical to oregon economy,because it provides affordable worker compensation coverage to our state employers,benefitting businesses and their employees.
soon after i asked for the investigation,i made a change in leadership at saif.when i appointed brenda rocklin as interim ceo,i asked her to take strong measures to restore full accountability and transparency to the agency,and to put systems in place to protect public records.she has responded admirably.over the next several months,i also appointed new members to the board of directors,and charged them to support rocklin in her efforts.
as the result of these corrective actions,and thanks to hard work by many people in saif,the agency is now fully accountable to the public and the customers it serves.i want to assure oregonians that even though the da report identified some troubling behavior,a new culture exists among saif senior management and culture of honesty,openness,and a commitment to serving the people of oregon.
since these events transpired,tibbetts has been unable to find employment.thurber has not been able to find comparable employment.
plaintiffs brought this action pursuant to.they allege that defendants saif,brenda rocklin,and theodore kulongoski each violated plaintiffs fourteenth amendment rights by making stigmatizing statements in the release and the release collectively,the releases without providing them with hearings.defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.rocklin and governor kulongoski asserted that they are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the claim.the district court disagreed,concluding that rocklin and governor kulongoski violated plaintiffs fourteenth amendment rights by making stigmatizing statements without providing them with hearings and that plaintiffs rights to these name clearing hearings were clearly established at the times rocklin and governor kulongoski made their allegedly defamatory statements.this is an interlocutory appeal of the district court order denying governor kulongoski motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity

discussion 
qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity balances the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment,distraction,and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.pearson callahan,d.
we analyze governor kulongoski claim of qualified immunity under the guidance recently provided by the supreme court in pearson.id.pearson held that while the previously required sequence set forth in saucier katz,d is often appropriate,it should no longer be regarded as mandatory.id.at.accordingly,t he judges of the courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.id.under the circumstances of this case,we adopt pearson more flexible approach and proceed directly to an analysis of saucier second prong,to determine whether the right asserted in this case was clearly established when the alleged stigmatizing statements were made.
