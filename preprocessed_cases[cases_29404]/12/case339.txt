people make mistakes.even administrators of erisa plans.conkright frommert.this introduction was fitting in conkright,which dealt with a single honest mistake in the interpretation of an erisa plan.it is perhaps an understatement in this case,which involves a devastating drafting error in the plan administered by verizon communications,verizon.
verizon pension plan contains erroneous language that,if enforced literally,would give verizon pensioners like plaintiff cynthia young greater benefits than they expected.young nonetheless seeks these additional benefits based on erisa strict rules for enforcing plan terms as written.although young raises some forceful arguments,we conclude that erisa rules are not so strict as to deny an employer equitable relief from the type of scrivener error that occurred here.we will accordingly affirm the district court judgment granting verizon equitable reformation of its plan to correct the scrivener error.
background 
bell atlantic pension plans 
bell atlantic,the predecessor of verizon,operated the bell atlantic management pension plan bampp until.the bampp expressed an employee retirement benefit as a defined annuity,but employees also had the option of receiving a lump sum if they retired during specified cashout windows.for certain employees who retired during the cashout window,the bampp provided a lump sum equal to the actuarial equivalent present value of the employee pension benefit,but calculated using an enhanced discount rate.specifically,section of the bampp required the use of a discount rate of of the applicable pbgc public benefit guarantee corporation interest rate in effect at the time of severance.
in,bell atlantic adopted the bell atlantic cash balance plan to replace the bampp.the new plan expressed an employee benefit as a cash balance that grew steadily with the employee age and years of service.under the cash balance plan,employees still had the option of receiving their retirement benefit as either an annuity or a lump sum.
key to this transition to the cash balance plan was converting the value of employees benefits under the old bampp to cash balances under the new plan.the plan used transition factors,a series of multipliers that increased with employees age and years of service,to make the conversion.the plan language describing this conversion is critical,so we reproduce it in some detail the emphasis is ours 
opening balance 
pension conversions as of the transition date 
where a present value must be determined under this section sic,should read section,the present value shall be determined as follows a using the pbgc interest rates which were in effect for september of 
a active participants and former active participants 
the opening balance of the participant cash balance account on january,shall be the amount described in subsection or below,as applicable 
a if eligible for service pension 
a not eligible for service pension 
in the case of a participant who is not eligible for a service pension under the bampp plan as of the transition date,the amount described in this paragraph is the product of multiplying a the participant applicable transition factor described in table of this section,times b the cashout value of the accrued benefit payable at age under the bampp plan,determined as if the participant had a severance from service date on december,based on compensation paid through december,multiplied by the applicable transition factor described in table of this section 
young administrative claim 
cynthia young worked for bell atlantic from to.when the cash balance plan took effect in,young was not eligible for a service pension under the is,her age and service level did not qualify her for full retirement her opening cash balance was calculated using a,for a resulting balance of.by the time young retired in,her cash balance had grown to the point that she received a benefit of.
several years later,in,young filed a claim with the claims review unit of verizon which by then had taken over plan administration as bell atlantic successor.young claimed that bell atlantic made two errors in calculating her opening cash balance,and hence her ultimate pension benefit,under the cash balance plan.first,young read the language of a to require that the applicable transition factor be multiplied twice to convert her cashout under the bampp to her opening cash balance under the new plan.bell atlantic,however,multiplied the transition factor only once when making the conversion.second,young claimed that bell atlantic improperly applied the pbgc discount rate used in the bampp to determine the cashout value under a.young contended that bell atlantic should have used a discount rate of simply of the pbgc rate.
verizon claims review unit denied young claims,and on appeal,verizon claims review committee affirmed.the committee concluded that the intended meaning of a was to use only a single transition factor to calculate opening cash balances the section second reference to the applicable transition factor was a drafting mistake.as for young discount rate claim,the committee concluded that a incorporated the pbgc rate used in the bampp by referring to the cashout value under the bampp plan.
young federal court class action 
in,young brought a federal court action under erisa a,a,against verizon and its cash balance plan collectively verizon.young asserted the same claims she raised in verizon administrative process,arguing that verizon improperly applied only a single transition factor and the pbgc discount rate to calculate her opening cash balance.the parties agreed to treat the case as a class action,and the district court certified a class of some bell pensioners similarly situated to young.
young class action presented the district court,acting through magistrate judge denlow,with a challenge.the court was confronted with a convoluted erisa plan that seemed to contain a costly drafting error,but an uncertain state of law on the scope of the court review of such an error.so the court decided to bifurcate the trial into two phases and apply alternative standards of review.in the first phase,the court assumed that it was limited to examining the administrative record and reviewing the verizon review committee denial of benefits under a deferential standard.the cash balance plan granted verizon,as plan administrator,broad discretion to interpret the plan,so judicial review was constrained to an arbitrary and capricious standard.black long term disability,cir.under this standard,the district court upheld the committee denial of young discount rate claim.conversely,on young transition factor claim,the court concluded that the committee abused its discretion in unilaterally disregarding the second reference to the transition factor in a as a drafting mistake.if verizon wished to avoid that mistake,it would have to seek a court order for equitable reformation of the plan.
taking the district court cue,verizon counterclaimed for equitable reformation of the plan to remove the second transition factor in a as a scrivener error.the court took up verizon counterclaim in the second phase of the trial,in which the court conducted a de novo review of the plan and allowed the parties to introduce extrinsic evidence on the intended meaning of a.and that evidence overwhelmingly showed that the inclusion of the second transition factor was indeed a scrivener error.
the drafting history of the plan revealed how the second,erroneous transition factor came to be.six drafts of the plan were prepared prior to the final version.the first three drafts were prepared by mercer human resources consulting,an outside firm hired by bell atlantic,and contained no mention of a second transition factor.it was not until one of bell atlantic attorneys,barry peters,took over drafting responsibility that the second transition factor appeared.in working on the fourth draft,peters restructured the conversion formula under a into a more readable a times b format,but in doing so,neglected to delete a trailing clause from the previous draft that referred to the applicable transition factor.testifying in the district court,peters admitted that he made this mistake in failing to delete the trailing clause in a,thereby duplicating the transition factor.peters mistake survived unnoticed in the fifth,sixth,and final drafts of the plan.
in addition to the drafting history,the correspondence between bell atlantic and plan participants showed an expectation that only a single transition factor would be used to calculate opening cash balances.in october,bell atlantic sent participants a brochure entitled,introducing your cash balance plan,which clearly depicted opening cash balances as the product of an employee value under the bampp and a single transition factor.in november,bell atlantic sent participants personalized statements of their estimated opening account balances,which also illustrated the use of a single transition factor.following the implementation of the plan,bell atlantic sent participants personalized statements of their actual opening balances,and thereafter quarterly cash balance statements,which,again,reflected the use of only one transition factor.notably,though,these communications contained plan trumps provisions cautioning that,in the event of discrepancies between those communications and the plan,the plan would govern.
also convincing was the course of dealing between bell and plan participants.bell atlantic consistently calculated opening cash balances using a single transition factor and paid benefits accordingly.taking young case as an example,her transition factor was.the estimated opening balance statement that young received illustrated the multiplication of this transition factor by her bampp cashout value of,for an estimated opening balance of x.the actual opening balance statement that young received in applied the same,formula to slightly different numbers x.prior to young lawsuit,no employee complained that opening balances should have been increased by an additional transition factor.for her part,young admitted that she never relied on the transition factor language in a prior to this litigation.
based on this evidence of the intended meaning of the plan,the district court found that the second transition factor in a was a scrivener error and granted verizon counterclaim for equitable reformation.the court also resolved a host of other arguments raised by the parties,many of which we discuss below.but suffice it to say,the district court treatment of the issues presented by this case was exhaustive.over the course of a,litigation,the court built a complete record,fully explored alternative bases of decision,and sharply honed the issues for appellate review.these commendable efforts by the district court,as well as the fine advocacy by both sides,have greatly assisted this court in deciding this complex erisa case.
ii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
before reaching the merits,we must address each side argument that the other claims are barred by the statute of limitations.erisa does not provide a limitations period for actions brought under,so we borrow the most analogous statute of limitations from state law.berger axa network llc,cir.we do not automatically borrow the forum state limitations period if another state has a significant connection to the dispute and its limitations period is more consistent with federal erisa policies,that state limitations period should apply.id.at.for actions such as this one to enforce erisa plans under a,we have previously borrowed state limitations periods for suits on written contracts.leister dovetail,cir daill sheet metal workers local pension fund,cir.
the parties agree that pennsylvania statute of limitations for breach of contract actions,should apply to this erisa case.pennsylvania has the most significant connection to this dispute,since bell atlantic was headquartered and drafted the cash balance plan there.also,more class members currently live in pennsylvania than any other state,and while a few class members live in the forum state of illinois,young has never lived or worked there.we further note that the plan contains a choice of law provision stating that pennsylvania law will fill any gaps left by federal erisa law.see berger,at considering choice of law clause as a but relevant factor in selecting a limitations period.
the real point of contention is the accrual date of the parties claims,that is,when pennsylvania limitations period started to run.although federal courts borrow state limitations periods for certain erisa claims,the accrual of those claims is governed by federal common law.daill,at.
beginning with young erisa claim,we have held that a claim to recover benefits under a accrues upon a clear and unequivocal repudiation of rights under the pension plan which has been made known to the beneficiary.id.at.in this case,young did not receive a clear repudiation of her claim for additional benefits until,when verizon review committee resolved her administrative appeal.actually,the committee denied young claim with respect to the discount rate issue in but took until to deny her claim with respect to the transition factor issue.since it is obvious that young entire federal court action,filed in,would be timely using a accrual date,this distinction is immaterial.prior to denying young administrative claim,verizon did not inform young that it rejected her interpretation of the plan calling for two transition factors and a pbgc discount rate.id.at claim accrued upon correspondence from plan disagreeing with participant understanding of benefits.
verizon argues that young claim accrued in february,when she received her benefit computed under verizon interpretation of the cash balance plan.at that time,however,the parties dispute over the correct interpretation of the plan had not developed.and nothing suggests that the payment that young received should have been a red flag that she was underpaid.redmon.ret.plan for union employees,cir finding a clear repudiation when the plan stopped making payments entirely,but not earlier when the payment amount was merely inconsistent with the plaintiff understanding of benefits.the payment that young received was not so inconsistent with her current claim for additional benefits as to serve as a clear repudiation.
moving to verizon counterclaim,seventh circuit precedent provides less guidance on the accrual of a claim for equitable reformation under erisa a understandably so,since the cognizance of such a claim is an issue of first impression for this court.the general federal common law rule is that an erisa claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or should know of conduct that interferes with the plaintiff erisa rights.see berger,f d at accrual when beneficiaries learned of change in employer method for determining benefit eligibility teumer motors,cir once an unlawful action is taken,a claim accrues when the putative plaintiff discovers the injury that results.applying this rule to verizon reformation action,we consider when verizon should have known that the scrivener error in the cash balance plan,if left unreformed,would impede its rights under the plan.
the district court found,and verizon does not dispute,that verizon predecessor bell atlantic learned of the scrivener error in.indeed,bell atlantic removed the second,erroneous transition factor from the plan that it adopted to replace the version of the cash balance plan.still,we conclude that this discovery did not give verizon notice of the need to reform the scrivener error,given a course of dealing consistent with verizon interpretation of the plan.
verizon always treated the plan second transition factor as a drafting mistake,and through correspondence with plan participants,it communicated that only a single transition factor would be used to calculate opening cash balances.verizon consistently paid benefits using this formula,and prior to young administrative claim,no employee communicated a contrary understanding that plan benefits should be calculated using two transition factors.tolle carroll touch,cir employee erisa unlawful discharge claim accrued when employer communicated discharge decision bowes travelers ins,d,applying pennsylvania law,claim for reformation of written contract accrued when conflicting oral statements underlying the dispute were made.under these circumstances,although verizon discovered the drafting mistake in,it did not then know that this mistake would give rise to a controversy requiring it to raise an equitable reformation claim.see int l union murata erie,cir erisa claim did not accrue when plan sponsor amended plan absent evidence that participants knew of any potential controversy over amended language.instead,it was not before young put the transition factor language at issue in her federal court action that verizon counterclaim for equitable reformation accrued.
none of the parties claims accrued before when young brought her federal court erisa action,so these claims are timely under the applicable pennsylvania limitations period.we may proceed to the merits of verizon claim for equitable reformation and young claim for additional benefits under erisa a.
equitable reformation due to scrivener error 
erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to uniformly regulate employee benefit plans.aetna health davila.to achieve uniformity,erisa contains numerous requirements for adopting and administering plans.plans must be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.a.the plan terms must be communicated to participants through an easily understood summary plan description,as well as a summary of any material modification to the plan.id.a.these writings are given primary effect and strictly enforced,and plan administrators must adhere to the requirement to follow plan documents in distributing benefits.kennedy plan adm r for dupont sav.inv.plan.
while erisa strict requirements ensure fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan,congress was careful not to make those requirements so onerous that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering plans in the first place.conkright frommert,quotations omitted.so erisa also allows some flexibility in plan administration and enforcement to achieve fair,equitable results.in particular,employers may grant plan administrators broad discretion in interpreting plan terms.id.deference promotes efficiency by encouraging resolution of benefits disputes through internal administrative proceedings rather than costly litigation.id.
another erisa provision that promotes equitable plan the statute important a,which allows a plan participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to bring a civil action for appropriate equitable relief.a b.the supreme court has explained that the statute authorizes those categories of relief that were typically available in equity during the days when common law courts were divided as courts of law or of equity.mertens hewitt,see also kenseth dean health plan,wl,at cir.june,describing categories of equitable relief available under a.the issue in this case,then,is whether verizon claim for equitable reformation of its cash balance plan is the type of equitable relief authorized by a.
we have never considered whether a authorizes equitable reformation of an erisa plan due to a scrivener error,but our case law addressing the related problem of ambiguous plan language suggests that such relief may be appropriate.
in mathews sears pension plan,cir,we put the parties reasonable expectations ahead of the literal text of an erisa plan.although the plain language of the plan suggested a benefits formula more favorable to employees,the employer offered objective,extrinsic evidence showing an extrinsic ambiguity in this language.id.at.the summary plan documents and the parties course of dealing were consistent with the employer reading of the plan,so we declined to adopt the employees contrary reading under rigid and archaic rules of contract interpretation.id.at.
we reached a different result in grun pneumo abex,cir,refusing to set aside unambiguous plan language based on an employer claim of mutual mistake.still,we acknowledged that such relief would be available in the rare case where literal application of a text would lead to absurd results or thwart the obvious intentions of its drafters.id.at quotation omitted.reformation was inappropriate in grun because the employee relied on the literal plan language to predict his right to severance compensation.id.at mathews,at noting absence of claim that any beneficiary actually relied on plan language.
other circuits have directly addressed claims for equitable reformation of an erisa plan.using reasoning similar to that in mathews and grun,these courts have either concluded that erisa authorizes such relief or does not foreclose the possibility.
verizon strongest case is int l union murata erie,cir,in which the third circuit recognized an employer a claim to correct a scrivener error in a plan provision on the distribution of excess funds.the court found equitable reformation appropriate because holding the employer to the scrivener error would produce what is admittedly a windfall an excess remaining in the plans that the plaintiffs could not have reasonably expected.id.the eighth circuit applied a similar rationale in wilson moog.pension plan,cir,to conclude that an erisa plan failure to provide a minimum age for retirement benefits was a reformable mistake.reformation was possible because extrinsic evidence showed that none of the plaintiffs actually relied on the erroneous plan language or believed that they would be eligible for early retirement.id.at.
the ninth circuit distinguished murata in cinelli sec.pac,cir,rejecting an employee claim that the absence of a plan provision entitling him to vested life insurance benefits was a mistake.although reformation of a scrivener error was appropriate in murata to avoid a windfall and uphold employees reasonable expectations of benefits,those factors were lacking in cinelli.id.at.likewise,in blackshear reliance standard life ins,cir,abrogated on other grounds as stated in williams metro.life ins,wl,at cir.june,the fourth circuit declined to equitably reform an erisa plan under the circumstances,where the plan language was clear and neither the summary plan description nor other plan documents supported the employer claim of a scrivener error.
from this authority,we conclude that erisa a authorizes equitable reformation of a plan that is shown,by clear and convincing evidence,to contain a scrivener error that does not reflect participants reasonable expectations of benefits.though complex in design,erisa maintains the basic goal of protecting employees justified expectations of receiving the benefits their employers promise them.cent.laborers pension fund heinz.it would thwart this goal to enforce erroneous plan terms contrary to those expectations,even if doing so would increase employees benefits.the appropriate equitable relief authorized by a allows a court to reform an erisa plan to avoid such an unfair result.see cent.teamsters pension fund mccormick dray line,cir i n circumstances where a court can establish that no plan participants were likely to have relied upon the scrivener error in question allowing reformation of the scrivener error does not thwart erisa statutory purpose murata,at t he alleged error relates to what is admittedly a windfall that neither side could have reasonably expected.mathews,at we can not see how erisa beneficiaries or anyone else would be benefited by the adoption of principles of contractual interpretation so rigid and archaic as to permit the class to reap the pure windfall here sought to the potential prejudice of other beneficiaries.
we acknowledge,like the third circuit in murata,at,that equitable reformation of an erisa plan creates some tension with the written instrument requirement of a,also known as the plan documents rule,kennedy.at.this rule ensures that every employee may,on examining the plan documents,determine exactly what his rights and obligations are under the plan,murata,at,without complicated enquiries into nice expressions of intent behind plan language,kennedy.at.young cautions that allowing equitable reformation of erisa plans will undermine the efficient,easily enforceable plan documents rule and encourage protracted,litiga
