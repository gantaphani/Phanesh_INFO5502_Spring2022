philip charvat has not been shy in taking on the role of a private attorney general under the telephone consumer protection act.since,he has filed claims against at least twelve defendants in at least thirteen lawsuits under the act.see charvat gvn,cir charvat nmp,llc,d state ex rel.charvat frye,ohio charvat ryan,ohio table opinion charvat dispatch consumer,ohio charvat gvn,wl ohio.july,charvat credit found.of,wl ohio,charvat farmers ins.columbus,ohio charvat telelytics,llc,wl ohio,charvat crawford,ohio charvat.prime,wl ohio charvat atw,ohio charvat cont l mortg,wl ohio.com.pl.june.
in his most recent lawsuit,charvat sued echostar satellite under the act as well as under several regulations promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc and ohio law.the district court dismissed four of charvat claims and granted echostar motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims.in considering charvat appeal,we invited the fcc,the agency that administers the act,to express its views on several issues presented by the case.the fcc answered several questions,demurred on others and suggested we refer the matter to the agency under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.for reasons elaborated below,we will refer the matter to the agency.
echostar delivers dish network brand satellite television products.between june and august,charvat received thirty calls from telemarketers attempting to sell dish network brand satellite television programming.most of the calls consisted of messages.on several occasions,charvat asked to be placed on the list.
charvat tracked the calls to several companies,including dish tv now,marrik dish,marketing guru,dba,jsr enterprises and dish pronto.all of the companies have signed retailer agreements with echostar,authorizing them to advertise,promote and solicit orders for dish network programming and to install and activate the equipment.
claiming several violations per phone call,charvat sued echostar for violations of the telephone act and its accompanying regulations.he also brought claims under the ohio consumer protection statute,ohio ann,and ohio common law.the district court dismissed several of the claims under the telephone act on the ground that charvat could not recover damages for the first call,and it granted summary judgment on the remaining claims.charvat appealed,challenging the court disposition of his claims under the telephone act and the ohio consumer protection statute.
a word about jurisdiction is in order.the district court held that it had diversity jurisdiction over the case because the parties came from different states and because charvat causes of action each requested between and in damages,well over the requirement.see.that would make sense,save for another part of the court decision.the court also held that charvat could recover statutory damages only on a basis,not on a basis,meaning charvat could recover between and for each of the calls that violated federal or state law,not between and for each of the violations that allegedly occurred in the calls.
although courts gauge jurisdiction over a complaint from the time of filing,paul mercury indem.red cab,the l ack of the jurisdictional amount from the not recognized until not a subsequent change that can be ignored.gvn,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted affirming determination that charvat did not satisfy requirement once district court determined he could recover on rather than basis.at the time charvat filed his complaint,he did not satisfy the requirement because the act did not allow him to recover the amount he claimed.see also jones knox exploration,cir.in light of the district court unchallenged ruling,it was a legal certainty at the time charvat filed his complaint that he could recover at most for the statutory and regulatory claims.see paul mercury indem,at.
that is not the end of the matter.charvat also requested punitive damages in connection with his claims.and punitive damages may be aggregated with other damages to satisfy the requirement.hayes equitable energy res,cir.but as the party invoking federal jurisdiction,charvat bore the burden of satisfying the requirements of federal jurisdiction,see cleveland hous.renewal project deutsche bank trust,cir,including as here where punitive damages account for a significant portion of the requirement,lm ins.spaulding enters,cir.under ohio tort law,claimants may obtain punitive damages only when they have suffered actual harm and actual damages,see,moskovitz sinai med,ohio,and t he actions or omissions of the defendant demonstrate malice or aggravated or egregious fraud,ohio ann.c.charvat pleadings leave it unclear whether he has plausibl y made sufficient allegations to satisfy these requirements with respect to his common law,as opposed to his statutory,claims.ashcroft iqbal.
we need not resolve the point,however,because the district court had jurisdiction over the claims under the telephone act and pendent jurisdiction over the rest of the claims.see id.in,amazing tickets,wl cir,we realize,this court took a different view,as had several other courts of appeals at the time,see,foxhall realty law offices,telecomm.premium,cir int l sci.tech,inacom commc ns,cir.but is an unpublished,unsigned order,and it like the other courts of appeals decisions predates the supreme court decision in grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing.
grable resolved a dispute then percolating in the courts of appeals over whether jurisdiction exists when the underlying statute does not contain a private right of action.the court clarified that the existence of a private right of action in a federal statute,while sufficient to establish jurisdiction,is not indispensable.instead,grable explained,the issue turns on whether the claim depends on a substantial federal issue that is in dispute and whether exercising jurisdiction would not disturb the congressionally approved balance of federal and state court jurisdiction.id.at.
the first three grable factors favor jurisdiction.charvat claim depends on the interpretation of federal law,because it turns on a violation of a federal statute.the issue at hand,whether echostar violated several provisions of federal law,is substantial.see empire health choice assurance,mcveigh,mikulski centerior energy,cir en banc.and the issue is disputed charvat says that echostar violated the telephone act,while echostar says it did not.
that leaves the fourth consideration,whether exercising jurisdiction comports with the roles of the state and federal courts in interpreting this statute.strange as it may seem,this federal statute explicitly provides for a private right of action only in state court.section b says 
a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state 
a an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater,or 
c both such actions.
if the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection,the court may,in its discretion,increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than times the amount available under subparagraph b of this paragraph.
b.section c provides for a similar cause of action in state court.the act does not contain a provision expressly authorizing a private right of action in federal court.
these provisions may suggest that congress anticipated that the act would be privately enforced primarily in state court.but they do not establish that such claims may proceed only in state state court jurisdiction is exclusive.otherwise,the act would preclude even jurisdiction,see,and no court of appeals to our knowledge has reached that conclusion,and several have rejected it,see,fax law ctr,ihire,cir gottlieb carnival,cir sotomayor,brill countrywide home loans,cir.
when congress enacted this legislation,the possibility of creating exclusive jurisdi
