facts and procedural history 
while appellant was going through a divorce,he moved in with the victim,and her mother,deborah,whom appellant had known for eight or nine years.he lived in an extra bedroom in deborah home for close to a year.after appellant moved out,deborah became suspicious that appellant and were communicating without her knowledge,so she attached to the phone jack in her garage a recording device that would record all incoming and outgoing calls on her home telephone.over two weeks,deborah recorded almost twenty hours of conversation between appellant and,neither of whom knew that they were being recorded.deborah did not suspect that appellant and were having a sexual relationship until she heard the recording of their conversations.deborah took the audiotape to the police,and appellant was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child.
prior to his trial,appellant filed a motion to suppress the audiotapes.he claimed that it was an offense under penal code section to intentionally intercept a wire communication without consent,so the audiotape was inadmissible under code of criminal procedure article.the trial judge found that deborah could vicariously consent to the recording of phone conversations,so the audiotape was admissible.
after appellant was convicted,he appealed the trial court decision to admit the audiotape and a transcript of the recording.he also appealed the trial court cumulation of the two sentences imposed by the jury,arguing that the jury should decide whether the sentences were cumulated rather than the trial judge.because there are no texas cases on this issue,the court of appeals looked at other state courts,as well as at how federal courts have interpreted the federal wiretap law,which is similar to the texas law.the court of appeals considered the factors outlined in pollock pollock,cir,which held that a parent may give to record a child telephone conversations if the parent has a basis for believing that recording is in the best interest of the child.although is not listed as an exception to the texas wiretap law,the court of appeals held that,in order to protect a child,a parent may record her child telephone conversations if the recording meets the standards in pollock.alameda,at.the court of appeals agreed with the trial court determination that deborah had a,objectively reasonable belief that recording the phone conversations was in the best interest of and therefore upheld the trial court denial of appellant motion to suppress.id.at.because the court held that the audiotape was properly admitted,and appellant conceded that the transcript was admissible if the audiotape was admissible,the court of appeals did not address the admissibility of the transcript.id.the court of appeals also rejected appellant claim regarding the cumulation of his sentences,stating that it was not improper for the trial judge,rather than the jury,to determine whether the sentences would be cumulated.id.at.because the cumulating of the sentences does not exceed the statutory maximum for the offense,the court held that the cumulated sentence does not violate apprendi new jersey,d.alameda,at.
appellant filed a petition for discretionary review,asking us to consider whether the court of appeals erred in grafting an exception into the relevant statute in order to conclude that the audiotape was properly admitted.appellant argues that because the court of appeals improperly held that the audiotape was admissible,the court erred in failing to address the merits of his claim that the transcript of the audiotape was improperly admitted.finally,appellant asks us to consider whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the trial court cumulation of his sentences does not violate apprendi.
discussion 
admissibility of the audiotape 
article a of the texas code of criminal procedure states,no evidence obtained by an officer or other person in violation of any provisions of the constitution or laws of the state of texas,or of the constitution or laws of the united states of america,shall be admitted in evidence against the accused on the trial of any criminal case.therefore,because section b states that a person commits an offense if he intentionally intercepts a wire communication,the audiotapes are inadmissible unless the given by deborah meets the consent exception to this statute or the interception was legal for some other reason.appellant argues that the exception does not apply to the wiretap laws.he bases this argument on duffy state,paso,no pet,and kent state,pet.ref,in which both courts stated that section must be applied in all circumstances that are not specifically excepted.however,as the court of appeals noted,duffy and kent are distinguishable from appellant case because those cases addressed whether one spouse can vicariously consent to the recording of the other spouse conversation,rather than the issue of whether a parent can vicariously consent to the recording of her child conversations.alameda,at.the fact that there is no interspousal consent exception to the wiretap statute does not preclude us from recognizing a exception.
appellant also cites cases related to a minor child right to seek an abortion or to purchase contraceptives without parental consent for the proposition that a child has the right to privacy,and this general right to privacy should not be taken from the child unless there is a significant state interest.appellant further argues that,because the texas family code lists the circumstances under which a parent has the right to consent on behalf of a child and does not mention the right to consent to the recording of a child conversations,we should assume that the legislature intended that no such right exist.
we disagree.we dealt with both the right to privacy and a mother ability to consent for her child in sorensen state.even though the child in sorensen was not a minor,we held that a child has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his room when the parent routinely enters the room,and that a parent can vicariously consent to a search of her child room.id.at.therefore,we reject appellant contentions that the exception unlawfully violates a minor right to privacy and that a parent has the right to consent only in the circumstances listed in the family code.
because no texas cases have addressed a parent ability to vicariously consent to the recording of a child telephone conversations,and the federal wiretap statute is substantively the same as the texas statute,we look to the sixth circuit decision in pollock pollock,cir,which is the leading case regarding the doctrine in the context of the federal wiretap statute in pollock,the plaintiff was the child stepmother and the defendant was the child mother.the stepmother appealed the trial court determination that the mother had not violated title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act,when she recorded conversations between her daughter and the plaintiff.in upholding the trial court decision,the court of appeals looked to federal and state case law in which the doctrine had been applied to both federal and state wiretap statutes pollock,at.the court adopted the rule set out in thompson dulaney,and held that 
as long as the guardian has a good faith,objectively reasonable basis for believing that it is necessary and in the best interest of the child to consent on behalf of his or her minor child to the taping of telephone conversations,the guardian may vicariously consent on behalf of the child to the recording.
pollock at.unlike adults,minors do not have the legal ability to consent in most situations.as the thompson court noted,the doctrine was necessary because children lack both the capacity to consent and the ability to give actual consent.at.
appellant argues that,in this case,did have the ability to consent because she was thirteen years old at the time the conversations were recorded,whereas the children in thompson were only three and five years old.however,the doctrine has also been applied to older children,including a in pollock.a minor actual ability to consent does not preclude her mother ability to vicariously consent on her behalf.thus the standard set out in pollock is that is acceptable if the parent had an objectively reasonable,belief that consenting for the child was in the child best interest.
we agree with the court of appeals that deborah had an objectively reasonable,basis for believing that recording the conversations was in best interest.because the recording of the conversations meets the standards set out in pollock,the given by deborah satisfies the exception to the texas wiretap statute.and,since it is not a violation of penal code section to intentionally intercept an oral communication if one party consented,no law was broken,and article does not render the evidence inadmissible.
appellant states that this case may illustrate why a exception should be added to the statute,but he argues that it should be added by the legislature and not the courts.however,by holding that a parent can give for a child,we are not adding a new exception to the wiretap statute.rather,we are saying that,which is a type of consent recognized in many contexts in the law regarding the relationship,also applies to the existing consent exception to the wiretap statute.
admissibility of the transcript 
appellant concedes that if the audiotape were admissible,his complaint regarding the admissibility of the transcript of the recorded conversations would be moot.therefore,because the audiotape was properly admitted,the transcript was also admissible,and we do not need to address appellant second ground for review.the court of appeals did not err in failing to consider the merits of this claim.
cumulation of sentences 
appellant argues that the trial judge erred in cumulating the two sentences imposed by the jury.he claims that this cumulation order was improper because it violated apprendi by assessing a punishment greater than what was authorized by the jury who determined the sentence,and the jury,rather than the judge,should determine whether sentences should be cumulated.we dealt with each of these issues in barrow state,holding that it was within the trial court discretion to cumulate the sentences,and that the cumulated sentence did not violate apprendi.as we stated in barrow,the apprendi line of cases does not apply to a trial court decision to cumulate sentences.barrow,at.while the opinion of the court of appeals inaccurately implies that apprendi is violated only when the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum for the offense,the court was correct that the sentence in this case did not violate apprendi and its progeny alameda,at.
in barrow,we also determined that the decision to cumulate sentences does not turn on a finding of fact,so even if the jury assessed the sentences,a trial judge may order that the sentences run consecutively.barrow,at.although the court of appeals did not have the benefit of our decision in barrow at the time of its decision,the court properly held that the trial court did not err in cumulating the sentences imposed by the jury.
conclusion 
we hold that the doctrine of applies to the consent exception of the wiretapping statute.because the victim mother provided the consent necessary for the affirmative defense to the statute prohibiting wire tapping,it was not a violation of penal code section to record the conversations.therefore,the audiotape was legally obtained and was not rendered inadmissible by article.since the audiotape was properly admitted,the admissibility of the transcript of the recorded conversations is not at issue,and the court of appeals did not err in failing to consider the merits of this claim.although the jury imposed the two sentences,it was within the trial judge discretion to decide whether to order that the sentences be served consecutively.the court of appeals properly rejected appellant arguments regarding the cumulation of his sentences and upheld the trial court cumulation order.the decision of the court of appeals is affirmed.
three salient facts bear on the admissibility of the tape recording in this case one of the parties to the recorded conversations was the minor child of a parent conducting the recording,the recording was conducted by the parent as part of caring for the child welfare,and the recording occurred through a telephone jack located in the parent home.because of these three facts,i would hold that the recording did not constitute interception under the texas wiretap statute.
for a crime to occur under the wiretap statute,there must be an interception or an intended interception of a wire,oral or electronic communication the statute provides that intercept has the same meaning as defined under article of the code of criminal procedure,governing wiretaps under article,intercept means the aural or other acquisition of the contents of a wire,oral,or electronic communication through the use of an electronic,mechanical,or other device.this definition in turn relies upon the definition of electronic,mechanical,or other device,which explicitly excludes certain types of instruments or equipment among other things,the wiretap statute excludes from its reach a telephone or telegraph instrument,or equipment used for the transmission of electronic communications,if the instrument or equipment is furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communications service in the ordinary course of the provider business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business.
all of this language is virtually identical to language in the federal wiretap statute.in reviewing the legislative history of the federal counterpart to this provision what has become known as the extension phone exception,the second circuit explained that the exception originally contained no ordinary course of business limitation this limitation was added after professor herman schwartz,testifying on behalf of the,complained that the unqualified language would allow policemen and private intruders to enter others homes and listen in on extension phones without penalty but,declining to recommend that the entire exception be deleted,professor schwartz commented,i take it nobody wants to make it a crime for a father to listen in on his teenage daughter or some such related problem.
several federal appeals courts have applied the extension phone exception to recording by a parent of a minor child conversations because the recording was done within the ordinary course of the parent business of caring for the child the supreme court of new hampshire followed suit in interpreting the same language in its own wiretap statute i would follow these cases and hold that a parent recording of a minor child conversations from a telephone jack within the home for the purpose of caring for the child constitutes a use that is exempt from the wiretap statute.
with these comments,i join the opinion of the court.
i join the judgment of the court and the portions of its opinion that are headed admissibility of the transcript and cumulation of sentences.
for the reasons given in the presiding judge opinion,ante,i agree that the tape recording was admissible.
i respectfully dissent from the majority holding that it was within the trial judge discretion to order cumulation of the two sentences determined by the jury in this case.
in making this determination,the majority relies on our recent decision in barrow state,and goes so far as to hold that the apprendi new jersey,d line of cases does not even apply to a trial court decision to cumulate sentences.i respectfully disagree.indeed,for the reasons discussed below,i believe that barrow itself might have been wrongly decided 
applicability of the apprendi line of cases 
in barrow,this court stated that 
these cases apprendi and its progeny hold that a trial court is prohibited from unilaterally increasing individual sentences on the basis of facts that were not resolved by the jury.thus,apprendi and its progeny clearly deal with the extension of individual sentences,when that extension is contingent upon findings of fact that were never submitted to the jury.these decisions do not,however,speak to a trial court authority to cumulate sentences when that authority is provided by statute and is not based upon discrete,but is wholly discretionary.
barrow,at emphasis in original.
in other words,barrow dictates that the apprendi line of decisions is applicable only in cases where a trial court has unilaterally increased individual sentences on the basis of facts that were not resolved by the jury but that it is not applicable in cases where the trial court authority to cumulate sentences is provided by a statute,is not based upon discrete,but is wholly discretionary.i respectfully disagree with such a narrow reading of apprendi and its progeny.
it is true that in the apprendi line of cases,the trial court had unilaterally increased individual sentences on the basis of facts not found by the jury.see,apprendi,supra trial court imposed enhanced sentence on its separate finding that the crime had been motivated by racial bias ring arizona,d trial court entered special verdict,increasing ring sentence from life to death,based on its separate finding of aggravating factors justifying the imposition of death under the arizona statute blakely washington,d trial court imposed an exceptional sentence after making a judicial determination that the defendant had acted with deliberate cruelty and united states booker,d trial court required by the federal sentencing guidelines to impose an enhanced sentence based on judicial determination of facts not submitted to the jury.however,the united states supreme court did not restrict its decision to these particular circumstances.as that court clearly articulated,the relevant inquiry is one not of form,but of the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury guilty verdict apprendi,at emphasis added.see also ring,at.the relevant inquiry is one not of form,but of effect emphasis added.
the use of the words required finding in apprendi might tempt the majority in the present case to reiterate the aforementioned barrow holding that the apprendi line of cases only deal s with the extension of individual sentences,when that extension is contingent upon findings of fact that were never submitted to the jury,but that t hese decisions do not speak to a trial court authority to cumulate sentences when that authority is provided by statute and is not based upon discrete,but is wholly discretionary.barrow,at.but in so doing,the majority in this case would be emphasizing form over effect,the very practice that the apprendi line of cases discouraged,as shown in the quote.moreover,the prohibited effect is quite clear in both barrow and the present case.thus,in barrow,the jury had assessed the defendant punishment at years imprisonment for count one and years imprisonment for count two.since under the prevailing statute,article of the texas code of criminal procedure the jury is not required to indicate whether it expected those sentences to run concurrently or consecutively,there is no way to know whether it intended the defendant to spend a total of years if the sentences ran concurrently or years if the sentences ran consecutively in prison.thus,if the jury had in fact determined that the appropriate punishment for barrow was a total of years imprisonment,the judge decision to cumulate the two sentences,resulting in a total of years imprisonment,in effect increased the sentence by fifteen years.and the fact that the judge based this decision without any additional,or any input from the jury on this question,makes such just the kind of arbitrary that apprendi and its progeny condemned.see,booker,at.the framers of the constitution understood the threat of judicial despotism that could arise from arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions without the benefit of a jury in criminal cases.emphasis added.
similarly,in the present case,the jury assessed punishment at years for each of the two counts on which appellant was convicted and,without any additional nor input from the jury,the trial court cumulated that punishment to years.thus,again,if the jury,in assessing punishment,had in fact intended those sentences to run concurrently,the trial court in effect doubled the intended punishment,simply and solely because it was empowered to do so under article in other words,the judge decision to cumulate,which barrow called wholly discretionary,is in fact wholly arbitrary,violating the constitutional mandate of apprendi and its progeny,as well as all the sources cited therein.
finally,the fact that the trial court authority to cumulate sentences is provided by statute is of no constitutional significance,considering the united states supreme court did not hesitate to invalidate statutes providing similar authority to trial courts,in the apprendi line of cases.see,apprendi,at.the new jersey hate crime statute challenged in this case is an unacceptable departure from the jury tradition that is an indispensable part of our criminal justice system ring,supra,invalidating the arizona statutory scheme allowing the judge to sentence the defendant to death,upon the judge independent determination of one or more aggravating factors enumerated in the statute blakely,supra invalidating the washington statute that authorized the trial court to impose an exceptional sentence,after making a judicial determination that the defendant had acted with deliberate cruelty.
the jury assessment of punishment 
as this court stated in barrow 
it is well established that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not encompass the right to have the jury assess punishment.texas is one of the few states that allow defendants the privilege,by statute,of opting for jury assessment of punishment.even so,it is left to the trial court to determine whether multiple sentences will run consecutively or concurrently.as the court of appeals pointed out,the texas legislature has assigned the decision to cumulate,vel non,in section of the penal code and article of the code of criminal procedure,to the trial court.it is also clear from these provisions that the decision whether to cumulate does not turn on any discrete or particular findings of fact on the judge part.instead,cumulating is purely a normative decision,much like the decision of what particular sentence to impose within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict.as such,it does not infringe upon the sixth amendment guarantee of a jury trial.
i do not dispute whether i t is well established that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not encompass the right to have the jury assess punishment.id.it should be noted,however,that barrow cited no authority to support its proposition that texas allows defendants only a privilege,not a right,to opt for jury assessment of punishment.on the contrary,in the section just preceding the one cited by barrow to show that texas is one of the few states that allow defendants to opt for punishment,id.at citing dix dawson,texas practice criminal practice and procedure at ed,clearly states that texas in fact provides the defendant with a right,not just a privilege,to such option.see dix dawson,supra,at texas law provides the defendant with a right to jury sentencing.the right is purely statutory.emphasis added.having made the decision to vest the defendant with such a right,texas should have also ensured that the right would be absolute.yet,by simultaneously vesting the trial judge with the authority to decide whether to cumulate the sentences,without any input from the jury on this critical decision,thwarts its own laudab
