we consider here the constitutionality of a pair of oregon statutes intended to stop child sexual abuse in its early stages.the statutes broadly take aim at practices of luring and grooming that expose minors to sexually explicit materials in the hopes of lowering their inhibitions against engaging in sexual conduct.the furnishing statute,oregon revised statutes section,criminalizes providing children under the age of thirteen with sexually explicit material.the luring statute,section,criminalizes providing minors under the age of eighteen with visual,verbal,or narrative descriptions of sexual conduct for the purpose of sexually arousing the minor or the furnisher,or inducing the minor to engage in sexual conduct.
appellants,a broad of booksellers literary,legal,and health organizations and a concerned grandmother together,powell books,argue that these statutes violate the first amendment.in particular,powell books claims,among other things,that the statutes are facially overbroad and criminalize a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.we agree.
although the state argues that the statutes may be construed to narrowly focus on the sharing of hardcore pornography or material that is obscene to minors alone,its position is contradicted by the statutory text.repeated reliance on the legislature efforts to combat hardcore pornography can not change the text of the statute.the legislative goal does not match the text of the statutes the statutes undoing is their overbreadth.in their current form,the statutes sweep up a host of material entitled to constitutional protection,ranging from standard sexual education materials to novels for children and young adults by judy blume.despite the legislature laudable goals,we can not rewrite the statute to conform to constitutional limitations 
background 
we begin with a review of the statutory scheme.the statutes follow a series of related abuse laws that the oregon courts invalidated under the state constitution speech clause in.see state maynard,discussing previous cases.in,the legislature went back to the drawing board and enacted the current statutes in an effort to address the perceived gap in oregon child abuse prevention scheme.
section,the furnishing statute,criminalizes the act of intentionally furnish ing a child under the age of thirteen,or intentionally permit ting a child to view,sexually explicit material where the person knows that the material is sexually explicit material.or.stat.furnishing is a class a misdemeanor.this section includes several exemptions,including immunity for acts of furnishing material whose sexually explicit portions form merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole and serve some purpose other than titillation.id.b section also includes a number of affirmative defenses 
section criminalizes luring,which is defined as f urnish ing to,or us ing with,a minor a visual representation or explicit verbal description or narrative account of sexual conduct for the purpose of a rousing or satisfying the sexual desires of the person or the minor or i nducing the minor to engage in sexual conduct.id.luring is a class c felony.like section,section exempts the furnishing or use of a representation,description or account of sexual conduct that forms merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole and serves some purpose other than titillation.id.the section also includes similar affirmative defenses 
powell books brought suit seeking a declaration of the unconstitutionality of,and injunction against enforcement of,sections and under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.the district court denied powell books motions for preliminary and permanent injunctions,finding the statutes neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor void for vagueness.powell books,myers,d.the district court also rejected powell books,challenges on grounds that the plaintiffs were too diverse and that the works that allegedly fell within the reach of the statutes were too dissimilar.id.at.
we address powell books overbreadth challenge alone as it suffices to dispose of this case in examining an overbreadth challenge,we follow a familiar sequential analysis.first,we construe the reach of the statutory provisions.united states williams.second,we inquire whether the statute criminalizes a substantial amount of expressive activity.id.at.finally,we consider whether the statute is readily susceptible to a limiting construction that would render it constitutional.virginia am.booksellers ass n,internal quotation marks omitted.
the statutes can not survive this inquiry.contrary to the state position,the statutes reach the distribution of far more material than hardcore pornography or material that is obscene to minors,and they implicate a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.in addition,the statutes are not subject to a limiting construction that would make them constitutional.for this reason,we conclude that oregon revised statutes and except the inducing prong,which is not at issue here are unconstitutionally overbroad and must be invalidated.
i.the scope of sections and 
we begin with the scope of the statutes.in construing the reach of sections and,our role is to interpret the law as would the oregon supreme court.planned parenthood of idaho,wasden,cir.this process is a different undertaking than construing a federal statute.under oregon rules of construction,we first consider text and context together.state gaines,or.we may also consider legislative history proffered by a party to the extent that it is useful.id.if the scope of the statute remains ambiguous at that point in the analysis,we may then turn to general maxims of statutory construction to resolve our uncertainty.id.the oregon approach contrasts with the standard federal statutory construction,which looks first to the text and then,in the case of ambiguity,employs the canons of construction and,in light of the debate over its significance,may or may not involve a reference to legislative history.see clark martinez,exxon mobil allapattah.
on their face,the liability provisions of sections and cover a range of material.section criminalizes furnishing sexually explicit material to children.the definitions provision of the statute,specifically defines sexually explicit material as material containing visual images of 
a human masturbation or sexual intercourse 
b,or oralanal contact,whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals or 
c penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object other than as part of a personal hygiene practice.
section criminalizes furnishing a minor or us ing a visual representation or explicit verbal description or narrative account of sexual conduct with a minor sexual conduct is defined as the same acts depicted in sexually explicit material,except it adds the t ouching of the genitals,pubic areas or buttocks of the human male or female or of the breasts of the human female.id.the definition of sexual conduct is also narrower in that it excludes p enetration of the vagina or rectum by any object where part of a medical diagnosis or as part of a personal hygiene practice,whereas the definition of sexually explicit material only excludes such penetration when part of a personal hygiene practice.compare or.stat.c with or.stat.c.
the state chiefly seeks to limit the breadth of sections and based on the exemption from liability that appears in both is,the exemption for materials whose sexual content form s merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole and serves some purpose other than titillation.see or.stat.b see also id.in the state view,this exemption narrows the statutes to bar the dissemination only of hardcore pornography to children and minors.
this argument is unavailing.the text and context show that the statutes cover far more than what might qualify as hardcore pornography.the statutory text makes no mention of hardcore pornography,but rather refers to sexually explicit material and a visual representation or explicit verbal description or narrative account of sexual conduct.or.stat,a.as the materials in the record show,whatever the precise boundaries of hardcore pornography may be,the statutes clearly extend beyond them.powell books submitted a wide array of books to illustrate its argument.consider,for example,the drawings of sex acts in the joy of sex the cartoon depictions of sexual intercourse in the children book,mommy laid an egg,or where do babies come from by babette cole or the fantastical sex scene between charlotte and lord griffin in kentaro miura manga,berserk.all are visual depictions of sexual intercourse under section,yet they hardly count as hardcore pornography.
similarly,the references to the visual representation and explicit verbal depictions of sexual conduct in section are not synonymous with hardcore pornography.section reaches representations of activity,including the touching of breasts or buttocks,that are commonly seen or read outside of pornographic materials,hardcore or otherwise.examples include the books listed above,along with the scenes of sexual conduct that appear in a work like margaret atwood classic and novel,the handmaid tale.
to be sure,the exemption constrains the statutes reach to a certain extent.it does not,however,limit their application to materials that fall outside constitutional protection.again the text and context make this clear.as a preliminary matter,we note that the requirement of a non titillating purpose refers to the explicit portion of the materials,and not the work as a whole.in section,the word serve agrees grammatically with sexually explicit portions,not with the nonoffending whole.see or.stat.b referring to material the sexually explicit portions of which form merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole and serve some purpose other than titillation.similarly,in section,the word serves agrees with representation,description or account of sexual conduct.see id.referring to a representation,description or account of sexual conduct that forms merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole and serves some purpose other than titillation.thus,the exemption considers whether the explicit portion of the material,and not the work as such or as a whole,serves some purpose other than arousal.
the state bases its hardcore pornography argument on a disjunctive reading of the exemption.in the state view,a work may provide the basis for prosecution unless its explicit portions form merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole or serve some purpose other than titillation.to put this the other way around,the exemption ostensibly protects a work from giving rise to liability unless its sexually explicit portions form more than an incidental portion of the work as a whole and solely intend to titillate.thus,the state argues,the statutes only cover hardcore pornography 
the problem,however,is that the statute does not say or it says and.the two conditions for exemption from prosecution are plainly written in the conjunctive a defendant must satisfy both conditions in order to avoid prosecution.thus,a work might still give rise to liability if its sexually explicit portions solely intend to titillate but are only an incidental part of the work as a whole,arguably,some of the sex scenes in berserk.likewise,a work might give rise to liability if its sexually explicit portions are more than an incidental part of the work,but do not solely intend to titillate,the handmaid tale.neither work,on the state definition,constitutes hardcore pornography,yet they still potentially run afoul of the statutes 
the state makes two related arguments that we decline to embrace.first,the state relies heavily on state maynard,a decision by the oregon court of appeals construing the predecessor provision to the exemption.in maynard,the court addressed a statute that criminalized furnishing minors any visual representation of a person or portion of the human body that depicts nudity,sadomasochistic abuse,sexual conduct or sexual excitement.or.stat.a repealed.the statute provided an affirmative defense that is essentially identical to the exemption in sections and namely,a defense for contraband that was merely an incidental part of an otherwise nonoffending whole,and serving some purpose therein other than titillation.or.stat.amended reading these provisions together,the court in maynard construed the statute as seek ing to prevent harm to children by prohibiting attempts to titillate them by means of sexually explicit materials and to protect children from the harmful effects of viewing hardcore pornography.maynard,at,internal quotation marks omitted.the court especially based its interpretation on the defense in former,which plainly applie d to those materials not primarily intended to titillate the victim.id.at.
the state argues that maynard requires construing sections and as limited to hardcore materials.maynard,however,is of limited relevance and does not authorize reading the exemption in the state expansive manner.in holding that the statute was aimed at the effects of exposure to hardcore pornography,maynard did not construe the scope of the statute,but rather addressed the threshold issue,under oregon free speech doctrine,of whether the statute sufficiently identified the harmful effects it sought to prevent.id.at indeed,upon turning to the scope of the material covered,the court went on to strike down the statute as overbroad.see id.at thus,even assuming that,under maynard,sections and similarly aim at effects the legislature deemed harmful,that does not determine what materials actually fall within their reach.
as a second line of defense,the state cites legislative history that likewise reflects the legislature concerns about minors exposure to hardcore pornography.in the state view,the legislature was highly cognizant of state court decisions striking down previous laws on sharing explicit materials with minors as overbroad and endeavored to draft a statute focused narrowly on hardcore pornography however,w hen the text of a statute is truly capable of having only one meaning,no weight can be given to legislative history that even legislators intended something different.gaines,at.regardless of any contrary suggestions in the legislative history,the statutory text is plainly not limited to offending pornographic materials that the state hoped to target.in short,good intentions can not trump the language of the statute.
ii.the criminalization of a substantial amount of expressive activity 
having delimited the reach of the statutes,we consider whether they criminalize a substantial amount of expressive activity states may restrict the access of minors to obscene material so long as the legislature has a rational basis to find that exposure to material condemned by the statute is harmful to minors.ginsberg new york.a state may impose such restrictions even if the material at issue is not obscene to adults.am.booksellers found.dean,cir.however,s peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription can not be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.erznoznik jacksonville.
in ginsberg,the court upheld a new york statute that criminalized the sale of girlie magazines to persons under the age of seventeen.at.this statute incorporated the obscenity test previously articulated in memoirs massachusetts,namely,that a work is obscene if 
a the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex b the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters and c the material is utterly without redeeming social value.
five years after ginsberg,the court revisited the question of the appropriate obscenity standard for adults in miller california.the court explicitly rejected the lack of redeeming social value prong set forth in memoirs,holding that a state could criminalize the distribution of only those materials that taken as a whole,do not have serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value.id.at 
the supreme court has never exp
