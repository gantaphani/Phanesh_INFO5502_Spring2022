in a terabyte generation in which even olds carry wireless phones the payphone industry may seem like a technicolor afterthought.nonetheless payphones still fill an important,though decreasing,role in communications,and congress has sought to keep them around.
two types of calls may be placed from a payphone.the first and most common type is the coin call,in which the caller inserts a coin directly into the payphone before making the call the rates for coin calls are set by state commissions.sprint fcc.increasingly common,however,is the second type of call coinless calls which a caller places by using a service such as directory assistance,operator service,an access code,or a subscriber number.id.the rules governing this second category of calls are at issue here.
to ensure payphone service providers psps are compensated for these calls to numbers or numbers that the caller uses to reach the carrier of his choice,and thus to encourage the availability of payphones,congress enacted of the telecommunications act of.pub.telecomm.ass fcc,citing.the fcc must establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call using their payphone b a.
the concept is simple telecommunications carriers must compensate psps for calls made from payphones with calling cards.application,alas,is complicated,because calls often involve multiple carriers.for instance,a local exchange carrier lec initially might receive a call,and then route it to a typically an interexchange carrier ixc such as sprint,at t,and worldcom that then transmits the call to yet another carrier.sprint,at.if the recipient of the call is a customer of the ixc,the ixc will simply transmit the call to the lec that serves the customer,but i f the call recipient is not a customer of the ixc,the ixc transfers the call to a reseller of the ixc services.id.
we have noted that t wo types of resellers exist.the first,known as switchless resellers,do not possess their own switching facilities and must rely on an ixc to perform the switching and transmission functions that are required to complete a call.id.by contrast,the second type,resellers sbrs,possess their own switching capacities id.i n some instances the sbr transfers the call to another sbr,which in turn routes the call to yet another sbr,and so on.id.
in its first payphone order,the fcc said carriers fbcs should pay the compensation for the calls received by their reseller customers.implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,report and order.later that year,in its first payphone reconsideration order,the fcc said an fbc maintains its own switching capability,regardless if the switching equipment is owned or leased by the carrier.implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,order on reconsideration.after two unsuccessful attempts to set a per call rate,see.pub.telecomm.ass n,remanding rate mci telecomms.fcc,remanding rate,the fcc established per call as the applicable rate,implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,third report and order,which we upheld on review,am.pub.commc ns council fcc.
net,headquartered in texas,is a telecommunications carrier that owns switches.using an innovative web interface,net empowered various other carriers to develop prepaid calling cards.traditionally,carriers were obligated to purchase or lease their own switches in order to fully control functions.net developed a new technology that it says allowed its customers to control switches as if they possessed them,thus severing the technologically link between switching and physical possession of switches.net customers could modify,in real time,the key economic parameters vital to the prepaid business,such as how to set up accounts,how much to charge,which domestic or foreign destinations could be reached with the cards,and by which methods.pet r br.net likewise instructed its customers that they alone were responsible for compensating psps,and often language to that effect was included in its contracts.between october and november,the relevant period for our purposes,upwards of eleven million calls were placed with calling cards distributed by net customers,using net switches.
in,a group of psps including apcc services,apcc,a billing clearinghouse for psps,filed an informal complaint with the fcc against net a formal complaint followed in.there were two proceedings,one for liability,and the other for damages.ultimately,the fcc ordered net to pay,plus interest at.net has petitioned for review of both the liability and damages orders,and our review has been consolidated.apcc intervened,filing a motion to dismiss because of an alleged jurisdictional defect in net petition for review of the damages order this motion has since been withdrawn 
we first consider jurisdiction,though it is no longer contested.it is axiomatic that subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived,and that courts may raise the issue sua sponte.athens cmty,schweiker.indeed,we must raise it,because while arguments in favor of subject matter jurisdiction can be waived by inattention or deliberate choice,we are a court of limited acting beyond our authority,and no action of the parties can confer jurisdiction upon a federal court.akinseye district of columbia,see also wilks marshals,wl,at per curiam.
at first blush,jurisdiction seems euclidean.by statute,federal appellate courts have exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of final fcc orders.we are called upon to determine the validity of a pair of fcc final orders,so we have jurisdiction.qed.but the existence of parallel to challenge final agency action and the other to enforce this otherwise straightforward equation,particularly in light of a supreme court precedent attempting to harmonize a superficially similar statutory scheme.icc atlantic coast line,d.
apcc initially complained that this court jurisdiction to hear net challenge to the orders should not trump apcc right to seek enforcement under.the language of the enforcement statute at issue in atlantic coast,was for all relevant purposes identical to.like does,allowed any person for whose benefit an agency order was made an party to file a suit against a party who d id not comply with an order for the repayment of money an party.in a situation somewhat similar to that here,the atlantic coast court construed this language to mean that a n party may obtain review of the commission order only in the court where the party commences its enforcement where the party seeks review of the commission order.at.
the similarities between this case and atlantic coast are obvious,but we decline to extend atlantic coast,even assuming that case was jurisdictional and not merely.unlike the review provision in atlantic coast,places jurisdiction exclusive ly in the courts of appeal in atlantic coast,both were district courts.there are institutional differences between trial and appellate courts,and when congress has spoken so explicitly as to the particular type of court it wants to review agency action,as it has in,that explicit statement should not be set aside lightly.likewise,the court in atlantic coast put weight on the possibility of a in a action.at.but in the fcc context,a in a district court is impossible.
although there is some potential for vitiating congressional policy enhancing the injured party ability to choose its forum and encouraging prompt payment of reparation awards,we think the fcc context is distinct enough to justify the exercise of jurisdiction here.what finally tips the scale in favor of our having jurisdiction is a statute enacted in,b.as happened here,agencies can bifurcate a single grievance into separate proceedings for liability and damages.under b,an party can in some instances seek federal appellate review of an fcc liability order even before a damages order has been issued.see verizon.fcc.thus,in our harmonizing of competing statutes,we have a new input b.consequently,an party already may have to forego its favorite forum if it wants to defend a liability order,it may have to intervene in the action.this scenario undercuts much of the reasoning in atlantic coast.we therefore conclude we have jurisdiction 
we now address the liability order.net appears to concede the fcc interpretation of the first payphone reconsideration order,including its emphasis on some kind of possessory interest,is reasonable.pet r br.for these reasons,net interpretation certainly is as reasonable as the fcc.this is no act of charity.final agency orders are upheld unless arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or not supported by substantial evidence.the fcc interpretation of its own orders and rules is entitled to substantial deference,at t fcc,just as an agency interpretation of one of its own regulations commands substantial judicial deference.drake faa.
in this case,even without substantial deference,the fcc interpretation of its earlier payphone orders was appropriate because a challenge to the appropriateness of the liability order itself is unavailing,net stronger argument does not go to the reasonableness of the fcc construction of the first payphone reconsideration order,but instead to whether net was fairly warned and thus should not have to pay damages.
preliminarily,we confront the fcc contention that the fair notice issue was not presented to the agency.we can not review questions of fact or law upon which the commission,or designated authority within the commission,has been afforded no opportunity to pass.a.if a petitioner could have called a question of law or fact to the agency attention,but did not,the issue is waived.freeman eng g assocs.fcc.however,an issue need not be raised explicitly it is sufficient if the issue was necessarily implicated in agency proceedings.time warner entm t fcc.
here,net adequately raised the fair notice issue.before the fcc,net argued the enforcement bureau disregarded the plain language of the commission payphone compensation rules,and ignored net business,which net structured in reliance on the rules.application for review at,apcc services,et networkip,llc,et fcc,no.net also averred the enforcement bureau determination is in conflict with the commission regulations,decisions,and established policy,and that it brushed aside the fcc prior statements.id.at.net even quoted one of our cases for the proposition that there is a need for a clear and definitive interpretation of all agency rules so that the parties upon whom the rules will have an impact will have adequate and proper notice concerning the agency intentions.id.at quoting ftc atlantic richfield.the enforcement bureau addressed net contention,apcc services,memorandum opinion and order bureau liability order,and the commission affirm ed the bureau liability order liability order,at.this is sufficient to preserve the issue.
though agencies are entitled to deference,they may not retroactively change the rules at will.indeed,that e lementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly has been for centuries.landgraf usi film products,d.anything less ought not to be dignified with the title of law these t raditional concepts of due process incorporated into administrative law preclude an agency from penalizing a private party for violating a rule without first providing adequate notice of the substance of the rule.satellite broad.fcc.
at the same time,however,agencies are authorized to make policy choices through adjudication,and giving a decision retroactive effect is not necessarily fatal to its validity.sec chenery.after all,e very case of first impression has a retroactive effect,whether the new principle is announced by a court or by an administrative agency.id.and,as is common with comprehensive regulatory schemes,often every loss that retroactive application would inflict on one party is matched by an equal and opposite loss that would inflict on another.qwest servs.fcc.this case potentially stands at the pivot point between these competing principles.
there are two conflicting modes of judicial review to agency interpretations,with o ne longstanding line of our cases allow ing agencies to apply new interpretations of regulations retroactively,while another requires revers ing agency action where regulated parties do not have fair warning of the agency interpretation of its regulations.kieran ringgenberg,comment,united states chrysler the conflict between fair warning and adjudicative retroactivity in circuit administrative law.net attacks with fair notice cases like united states chrysler,the fcc parries with retroactivity cases like qwest.
when to apply which line of cases has not been resolved definitively by our precedents.we too leave for another day the question of how these two lines interplay,because under either one,net loses.that net has an unwinnable case under the retroactivity line is obvious the correctness of net interpretation was anything but settled,and many psps will be harmed if net escapes liability.qwest,at.net,however,also loses under the fair notice line,because its interpretation of the first payphone reconsideration order is less plausible than the fcc.the fcc,in fact,is the most reasonable interpretation.we have never applied the fair notice doctrine in a case where the agency interpretation is the most natural one 
consider the language of the first payphone reconsideration order.the operative phrase reads,we clarify that a carrier is required to pay compensation and provide tracking for the calls originated by payphones if the carrier maintains its own switching capability,regardless if the switching equipment is owned or leased by the carrier.at.net focuses on the words maintain and capability.quoting webster dictionary,net defines maintain as to provide for,to continue,to keep in existence to sustain,and to preserve or keep in a given existing condition,as of efficiency or good repair,and capability is defined as the quality or state of being capable,or the capacity to be used,treated or developed for a particular purpose pet r br.quoting webster ii new college dictionary.net argues these words are satisfied provided a carrier has the ability to control switches,which its customers did.it then interprets the words regardless if the equipment is owned or leased as it does not matter whether a switching capability is maintained via an ownership or lease or some other means.id.
net is not an impossible interpretation,but it is not the most natural one.when the words maintains its own switching capability are read in light of the phrase regardless if the switching equipment is owned or leased by the carrier,then maintains its own switching capability is best understood as shorthand for either owning or leasing,but nothing else.indeed,even net proffered definitions suggest the need for a physical connection or possession of some sort one usually keep s in existence or preserve s something in good repair by means of physical access.thus,though the language can be read the way net does,we agree with the fcc enforcement bureau that rather than rejecting a possessory interest requirement,the sentence simply clarifies the kinds of possessory interests that will suffice.bureau liability order,at.
net also turns to other sources of potential ambiguity.for instance,it points to additional language from the first order on reconsideration that arguably permits a carrier to maintain its own switching capability by contract.from this,net asserts the fcc insistence on a possessory interest in switches is oceans apart from what net reasonably perceived as the earlier,more flexible rule.again,we are unpersuaded.
the critical language reads if a carrier with a switching capability has technical difficulty in tracking calls from origination to termination,it may fulfill its tracking and payment obligations by contracting out this duty to another entity first order on reconsideration,at.if tracking is synonymous with switching capability,the sentence borders on carrier with the capability to track calls is technically unable to track calls thus,defining switching capability as the mere technical ability to track calls is not the most reasonable approach.instead switching capability and tracking capability are separate,and a tracking and payment obligation does not lodge until after a carrier is already an fbc.a carrier can have the ability to track without being an fbc,and a carrier can be an fbc without having the ability to track.but if a carrier is an fbc,it has a legal duty to track,either directly or by means of contract.
as net suggests,the fcc has not always insisted a possessory interest is a necessary attribute of the phrase facilities based.in the narrow context of unbundled network elements,the fcc has taken a approach to ownership.see joint bd.on universal.the fcc reasonably responds,however,that as the plain words connotes some sort of possessory interest,and the commonly understood meaning of the term among those regulated requires a possessory interest of some sort.liability order,at,the interpretation of the phrase facilities based in the unbundled network elements context is noteworthy,but it was unreasonable for net to assume that an idiosyncratic exception should define the rule.because the fcc interpretation of its first order on reconsideration is the most natural,we hold the fair notice doctrine has been satisfied 
congress has set a statute of limitations for a ll complaints against carriers for the recovery of damages not based on overcharges b.the fcc recognizes both formal and informal complaints.informal complaints are forwarded to the appropriate carrier for investigation,and the carrier must,within such time as may be prescribed,advise the commission in writing,with a copy to the complainant,of its satisfaction of the complaint or of its refusal or inability to do so.id.if the process proves ineffective,the complainant may file a formal complaint,and s uch filing will be deemed to relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint if,inter alia,it i s filed within months from the date of the carrier report but i f no formal complaint is filed within the period,the complainant will be deemed to have abandoned the unsatisfied informal complaint.id.however,a ny provision of the fcc rules may be waived by the commission on its own motion or on petition if good cause therefor is shown.id.
in the fall of,apcc filed an informal complaint with the fcc against net.on the absolutely last day it could be timely,may,apcc unsuccessfully attempted to file a formal complaint.the filing was deficient in two respects apcc submitted a single check rather than a check for each of the two defendants in the formal complaint,and the filing fee proffered for each defendant was short.apcc explained to the enforcement bureau it submitted the wrong filing fee and missed the deadline under rule because its counsel consulted only the version of the code of federal regulations cfr,dated october,which contained a filing fee amount per had been superseded by the time apcc filed its formal complaint in may.apcc services,bureau waiver order.
about two weeks later,on june,apcc finally filed its formal complaint.the enforcement bureau accepted it,pursuant to the good cause exception to its rules,notwithstanding the errors by apcc counsel were difficult to excuse,given that they were easily avoidable,and apcc law firm is highly experienced,resourceful,and knowledgeable in communications law id.at.if the fcc had enforced the deadline,much of the damages order would be invalid 
in affirming the enforcement bureau,the commission considered it inappropriate to permit a fee error by apcc negligent as it may have been to stand in the way of fair compensation for psps,especially when the formal complaint was otherwise submitted and served on time and in good faith,with advance notice to net.damages order,at.thus,under these specific circumstances,strict enforcement of the deadline would unduly conflict with the public interest in ensuring the payment of compensation necessary to promote the widespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit of the general public id.quoting b.
net insists the fcc decision to allow the formal complaint to relate back was erroneous for two reasons.first,it claims the fcc unlawfully extended the statute of limitations under section b of the act.in response,the fcc avers that it reasonably found that an informal complaint constitutes a complaint within the meaning of section id.at.we need not resolve this specific issue because,as discussed below,we find net alternate argument persuasive.
net also argues that even if the fcc did not violate b,it nonetheless acted arbitrarily and capriciously in excusing apcc sloppiness,because under the adamantine standard set forth in the fcc heritage strategic partners,deadlines can only be waived under unusual or compelling circumstances involving a calamity of a widespread nature that even the best of planning could not have avoided,such as an earthquake or a power outage which brings transportation to a halt,id.at.apcc can not even begin to meet that standard.the fcc rejoins that meredith only applies to filing deadlines for pleadings that initiate adjudicatory proceedings,which does not include formal complaints when an informal complaint has already been filed,and meredith likewise only applies to late filings,not to pleadings that are timely offered but technically defective.damages order,at,quoting meredith,at.
whether meredith applies is not essential to our analysis in any event,the commission has implied that the meredith standard might not materially differ from the fcc general waiver standard.id.at.we have repeatedly discourage d the commission from entertaining pleadings in the absence of extremely unusual circumstances.bdpcs,fcc,quoting century telesis joint venture fcc.consistent with this applies to any fcc decision to accept late pleadings,even in hold the fcc failure to apply its filing deadline was arbitrary and capricious.we do so reluctantly given the deference we afford to an agency decision whether to waive one of its own procedural rules.see at t fcc.but even deference has limits.
as we explained in northeast cellular telephone fcc,before the fcc can invoke its good cause exception,it both must explain why deviation better serves the public interest,and articulate the nature of the special circumstances to prevent discriminatory application and to put future parties on notice as to its operation,id.at.the reason for this test flows from the principle that an agency must adhere to its own rules and regulations,and a d hoc departures from those rules,even to achieve laudable aims,can not be sanctioned,for therein lie the seeds of destruction of the orderliness and predictability which are the hallmarks of lawful administrative action.reuters fcc.this basic tenet is especially appropriate in the context of filings.when an agency imposes a strict deadline for filings,as the fcc has done,many meritorious claims are not considered that is the nature of a strict deadline.the power to waive that strict deadline is substantial,because it allows an agency to decide which meritorious claims get considered.the inverse is true power to waive allows an agency to decide which otherwise liable parties are off the hook.
the criteria used to make waiver determinations are essential.if they are opaque,the danger of arbitrariness or worse is increased.complainants the agency likes can be excused,while difficult defendants can find themselves
