in,the federal communications commission fcc or the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that sought proposals to reassign a portion of the mhz of spectrum used by mobile satellite services mss.see review of the spectrum sharing plan among satellite orbit mobile satellite service systems in the ghz bands,notice of proposed rulemaking,nprm.in,in the context of this same rulemaking proceeding,the commission initially ordered petitioner globalstar,globalstar and intervenor iridium satellite llc iridium,companies that use different technologies to provide voice and data communications,to share a block of spectrum that was previously reserved for globalstar use.see review of the spectrum sharing plan among satellite orbit mobile satellite service systems in the ghz bands,report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking,order.globalstar sought reconsideration of the order,claiming that sharing the spectrum would generate harmful interference between the two communications systems.the commission then revisited the rulemaking and,following reconsideration,agreed with globalstar that spectrum sharing was technologically infeasible.in,the commission issued an order that reassigned a block of electromagnetic spectrum to iridium.see review of the spectrum sharing plan among satellite orbit mobile satellite service systems in the.ghz bands,second order on reconsideration and second report and order,reconsideration order.globalstar now seeks review of the reconsideration order,claiming that it was promulgated in violation of the requirements of the administrative procedure act apa,see,and is also arbitrary and capricious,see id.a.
we deny the petition for review.first,we hold that globalstar waived its inadequate notice claim by failing to raise it with the commission.globalstar ex parte letter did not give the commission an opportunity to pass on this issue as required by a.therefore,globalstar inadequate notice claim is not properly before us.second,we reject globalstar argument that the commission reassignment of the disputed spectrum to iridium was arbitrary and capricious.the commission properly revisited the rulemaking pursuant to globalstar petition for reconsideration of the order.the reconsideration order was an outgrowth of the ongoing rulemaking that began with a notice of proposed rulemaking in.we find that the commission final order is based on the extensive record compiled during this lengthy rulemaking and that the record supports the commission decision.we also find that the reconsideration order is a product of reasoned decisionmaking that survives the narrow scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
background 
among its many duties,the commission licenses commercial entities to use the electromagnetic spectrum.see.the commission has designated mhz of spectrum for use by mobile satellite services,a technology that provides email and phone services to remote locations across the globe and is often used by military and public safety officials during wars and national disasters.see amendment of the commission rules to establish rules and policies pertaining to a mobile satellite service in the mhz frequency bands,report and order,order.this spectrum,the big low earth orbit band big leo band,consists of two segments that are commonly referred to as the l band mhz through mhz and the s band mhz through mhz.see order,at.mss providers employ one of two technologies code division multiple access cdma or time division multiple access tdma.see id.at nn.cdma and tdma systems differ in at least one critical respect.in cdma systems,the l band is used for uplink operations from an earth terminal,a user phone handset to a satellite,while downlink operations are carried on the s band.in tdma systems,both uplink and downlink operations are carried on the l band.see id.this case concerns the commission assignment and reassignment of blocks of the big leo band to competing providers of cdma and tdma satellite services.
in the early,as mss technology was first emerging,several companies seeking to deploy mss systems applied to the fcc for licenses to use the big leo band.all but one proposed a cdma system.see order,at.in,the fcc adopted an initial licensing scheme for mss providers in the big leo band.id.at.because the cdma applicants outnumbered the lone tdma applicant,the commission divided the mhz of big leo spectrum into two unequal but roughly proportionate parts.the commission assigned the tdma provider exclusive access to mhz of spectrum in the l band and assigned the cdma providers shared access to mhz of spectrum mhz in the l band and the entire s band.id.the commission also considered the possibility that only one of the cdma systems would be launched,but it rejected a proposal that would have automatically reassigned mhz of spectrum in the l band to the tdma provider upon a showing of need or,if this demonstration could not be made,to a new entrant.id.at.instead,the commission stated that it would make the decision with respect to the mhz,if necessary,in the context of a rulemaking,based upon the circumstances that have developed at that time.id.
by,only two mss providers had begun commercial operations the cdma system now run by globalstar and the tdma system now run by iridium.in light of this development,iridium petitioned the fcc to undertake the reassignment rulemaking contemplated in the order.petition for rulemaking at i july,reprinted in joint appendix.iridium advised the agency that it was experiencing significant spectrum constraints from operating in the mhz block of l band spectrum and that it required additional spectrum to meet the current and future needs of its customers.id.at.iridium urged the fcc to reassign it mhz of spectrum currently allocated to cdma systems.id.at.
the commission responded with a notice of proposed rulemaking in that sought proposals to reassign a portion of the big leo spectrum.nprm,at.the commission recognized that because only one cdma big leo system has deployed,it is now appropriate to consider making at least megahertz of additional spectrum available to iridium.id.at.though the commission tentatively conclude d that the new developments in the mss market necessitated a reallocation of the big leo spectrum,it noted that it would base its final judgment on the record established in this proceeding.id.to this end,the commission directed both globalstar and iridium to submit detailed data on their current and projected spectrum needs.id.at.
the fcc received extensive comments from both globalstar and iridium,among other industry players.iridium explained that it was experiencing a spectrum shortage and recounted how recent strains on its network due to the use of its services by the military in the middle east had caused the commission to grant it temporary access to a portion of globalstar spectrum.comments of iridium satellite,llc at i,july.to relieve these strains and to meet the growing demand for its services,iridium proposed a spectrum parity plan that would divide the mhz of big leo spectrum into three roughly equal blocks,with just over mhz for iridium in the l band,just over mhz for globalstar in the l and s bands,and mhz in the s band reclaimed for other uses.id.at.globalstar strongly opposed any change to the existing spectrum plan because it was using its entire spectrum assignment.joint comments of licensee,globalstar,and globalstar usa,at i july.globalstar also urged that if the fcc was inclined to reallocate spectrum in the big leo band,it should give the two companies an opportunity to devise a joint band plan.joint reply comments of licensee,globalstar,and globalstar usa,at july.
in,the fcc issued a report and order directing globalstar and iridium to share mhz of spectrum in the l band between mhz and mhz.order,at.the commission began by explaining that the deployment of only one cdma system justif ied a reassessment of the existing band plan.id.at.though the commission found that both globalstar and iridium had set forth compelling arguments for utilizing the spectrum,it determined that sharing the spectrum would be the most equitable solution at this time because iridium need for spectrum appears to be more sporadic and.id.at.the commission further rejected iridium spectrum parity proposal because dividing the spectrum on a pure basis would ignore the significant encumbrances that exist in the lower portion of the from other satellite systems in that band and in adjacent bandwidths.id.at.finally,the commission explained that it had limited the amount of shared l band spectrum to mhz because of these same encumbrances and in order to remain consistent with the spectrum reallotment originally proposed in the order.id.in the same order,however,the commission issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether globalstar and iridium could share an additional mhz of spectrum in the lower portion of the l band between and mhz.id.at.
globalstar sought reconsideration of the order.petition for reconsideration of globalstar llc.globalstar requested that the fcc reverse its decision because cdma and tdma systems could not both utilize spectrum at the same time without generating interference,and it submitted technical data on the harmful effects of spectrum sharing.id.at,see also globalstar llc technical appendix,commc ns comm.within the european conference of postal and telecomms,draft ecc report on sharing between mss systems using tdma and mss systems using cdma in the bandd mhz concluding that both iridium and globalstar would suffer interference when operating in shared spectrum.in the alternative,globalstar asked the commission to establish rules to permit the two companies to coordinate their usage of the spectrum to prevent such interference.see petition for reconsideration of globalstar llc at.iridium maintained that sharing was in fact possible and urged the commission to permit further sharing in the l band because demand for its services had continued to grow.comments of iridium satellite,llc at ii.in addition,iridium noted that the commission had again granted it temporary access to globalstar spectrum following hurricane katrina and that it had seen a spike in customer demand following the hurricane.ex parte letter from donna,vice president,regulatory engineering,iridium satellite,llc,to marlene dortch,secretary,federal communications commission at.
in october,while the fcc was weighing globalstar reconsideration petition and the comments received in response to the further notice of proposed rulemaking,the trade press reported that the commission was poised to reassign a block of big leo spectrum to iridium.see satellite,comm.daily.on november,globalstar submitted an ex parte letter to the commission claiming that such a spectrum reassignment was beyond the scope of the rulemaking and would violate the apa requirements.a copy of the letter was emailed to the commissioners and their legal advisors.see ex parte letter from william lake,counsel to globalstar,to marlene dortch,secretary,federal communications commission,see also petitioner reply br.at.
on the day globalstar submitted its ex parte letter,the commission adopted an order assigning equal amounts of l band spectrum to iridium and globalstar.see reconsideration order,at.upon reconsideration of the order,the commission agreed with globalstar that spectrum sharing would cause harmful interference between fully loaded cdma and tdma systems and would place generally undesirable operational limitations on both systems.id.at.moreover,although neither globalstar nor iridium was fully loaded at present,the commission found that both companies state that their business has grown,and confidently predict that their business will continue to grow.id.the commission found that iridium had made a case demonstrating its need for more spectrum,noting that its communications traffic has increased substantially and that it desired more spectrum to provide voice channels and higher speed data transmissions,as well as to accommodate peak demand.id.concluding that the reassignment of spectrum to iridium was necessary to provide certainty and stability in the big leo market and to avoid harmful interference,the commission thus divided the l band into two equal parts,assigning each company exclusive access to mhz of spectrum in that band.id.at.in addition,the commission retained a mhz portion of shared spectrum in the center of the l band to safeguard one of globalstar channels,finding that this small segment of big leo spectrum could be effectively shared while both systems are relatively lightly loaded.id.at.the net effect of the new spectrum plan was thus to reassign mhz of l band spectrum to iridium,subject to the minimal mhz sharing requirement.
ii.analysis 
globalstar challenges the reconsideration order on two grounds.first,it argues that the commission decision to reassign spectrum to iridium was not a logical outgrowth of the decision ordering spectrum sharing and thus violated the apa requirements.see.second,it argues that the commission decision is arbitrary and capricious because it lacks record support and because the commission rationale for ordering spectrum reassignment is inconsistent with certain policies adopted in the earlier order.see id.a.

globalstar inadequate notice claim is barred by a 
as an initial matter,the commission contends that our consideration of globalstar inadequate notice claim is barred by a of the communications act.section a provides that filing a petition for reconsideration before the commission is a condition precedent to judicial review where the party seeking such review relies on questions of fact or law upon which the commission has been afforded no opportunity to pass.a.we have strictly construed a,holding that we generally lack jurisdiction to review arguments that have not first been presented to the commission.qwest fcc,quoting in re core commc ns.thus,even when a petitioner has no reason to raise an argument until the fcc issues an order that makes the issue relevant,the petitioner must file a petition for reconsideration with the commission before it may seek judicial review.in re core commc ns,at quoting a.
