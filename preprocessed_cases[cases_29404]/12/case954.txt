real party in interest county of san diego civil service commission csc adopted rules providing that if a peace officer does not request the public be admitted to his or her disciplinary appeal hearing held pursuant to government code section,subdivision b the appeal hearing,the csc will close the appeal hearing to the public and conceal the identity of the appealing police officer.petitioner the copley press,copley challenges the validity of the appeal hearing closure rules.copley also contends its postappeal proceeding request to the csc for the identity of the officer involved in the proceeding,transcripts of the appeal proceedings,and the evidence introduced and documents created in connection with the appeal was improperly rejected.the closed appeal hearing rules and denial of copley request for information were based on the decision of this court in san diego police officers city of san diego civil service com.th,d sdpoa,which addressed a narrow question of the applicability of penal code section section in peace officer disciplinary appeal hearings 
factual and procedural background 
in early copley learned that a disciplinary appeal by a peace officer was scheduled for hearing before the csc as case.however,the csc agenda stated that the identity of the peace officer is held confidential per penal code section citing sdpoa.copley learned the peace officer had requested a closed hearing under the csc interim rules,which provided that if the peace officer requested a closed appeal hearing the csc would close the hearing and conceal the identity of the appealing peace officer.the csc interim rules were adopted after and in response to the sdpoa decision.
copley appeared before the csc and moved for access to the appeal hearing but the motion was denied.in march,after the conclusion of the disciplinary appeal,copley made a series of requests to real parties in interest county of san diego county and the csc,pursuant to the california public records act cpra,seeking materials related to the appeal in case.copley cpra request sought documents filed with or submitted to the csc in connection with case,including documents concerning the officer termination or discipline documents created by the csc in connection with case,including its findings and decision any documents containing its findings or decision and any tape recordings made of the appeal hearing.the csc denied the requests under section,subdivisions c and k.copley filed a writ petition in superior court,and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,seeking disclosure of the documents and other information sought by copley cpra requests and a declaration that the practice of closing appeal hearings was unlawful.on may,the trial court,relying on sdpoa,denied copley any relief.the trial court minute order provided the court finds this matter is controlled by the holdings of sdpoa and penal code sections and.
on may,copley made a cpra request to the county and the csc seeking documents concerning case that may have been received or created by the csc after copley original requests,including the csc findings and decision in case.the csc thereafter provided various documents to copley,including the order for termination citing the grounds for discipline and an outline of the facts supporting each ground,the hearing officer recommendation that the csc accept a stipulated agreement regarding disposition of the appeal,and the minutes of the csc proceedings approving the recommended disposition.the involved peace officer and the sheriff department stipulated the peace officer would withdraw his appeal,voluntarily resign his position,and admit to the factual validity of six of the seven causes underlying the basis for discipline and the sheriff department would withdraw its termination action against the peace officer and change his exit status to by mutual consent.however,the peace officer identity was redacted from each of the disclosed documents.copley then filed this petition for writ of mandate to review the trial court may,order denying copley any relief we issued an order to show cause and held oral argument.
analysisa.sdpoa and section appeal hearings 
in sdpoa,this court considered whether the employer routine practice of introducing a peace officer personnel records at an appeal hearing open to the public was inconsistent with section confidentiality provisions sdpoa,supra,th at,d.we concluded section made peace officer personnel records confidential regardless of the context in which the employer proposed to disclose those records,and therefore held employing agencies may not freely disclose these records at public disciplinary appeal hearings if the affected officer asserts an objection.id.at,d.however,sdpoa expressly cautioned that its decision was limited to the relief sought in the petition,which,in this case,is a declaration that penal code section personnel records are confidential in the context of disciplinary appeal hearings.sdpoa,supra,at,d.other issues raised in the appellate briefs,including whether disciplinary appeal hearings must be closed to the public,were determined to be beyond the scope of the sdpoa decision.
copley contends the issue left open by sdpoa is presented here because the csc has apparently adopted rules providing for closure of an appeal hearing on request of the peace officer,and copley asserts appeal hearings may not be closed absent individualized hearings and findings under nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,nbc.under nbc,the public has a presumptive right to attend civil and criminal proceedings,and that right of access may be denied only if the trial court,after notice and hearing,expressly finds i there exists an overriding interest supporting closure sealing ii there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure sealing iii the proposed closure sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and iv there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.nbc,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.california rules of court also make court records presumptively open cal.rules of court,rule c,although a court may order these records sealed if it finds there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access and supports sealing of the record there is a substantial probability the overriding interest will be prejudiced absent sealing the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.cal.rules of court,rules d.from this predicate,copley argues,the csc rules permitting closure of the appeal hearing when demanded by the peace officer are invalid.the courts have held that the first amendment embraces a right of public access to criminal trials see,globe newspaper superior court,d finding unconstitutional state statute mandating closure of courtrooms during testimony of minor victims in criminal trials,to civil trials nbc,supra,cal th,d,recognizing right of access and applying it to civil proceedings,and to proceedings related to civil and criminal trials copley argues we should hold this right of access extends to any administrative proceeding,and an appeal hearing is a proceeding because the involved peace officer is entitled to limited due process protections at that hearing.sdpoa,supra,th at,d.
in this proceeding,the hearing officer apparently recognized closure would be unnecessary to the extent nonconfidential evidence was introduced but,as an administrative reality,the nature of the hearing necessitated the introduction of confidential materials.the hearing officer,rejecting copley request to attend the hearing,noted the hearing would involve argument,discussion and the presentation of evidence concerning peace officer personnel records.this hearing officer finds that argument,testimony and documents involving peace officer personnel records or information obtained from such records would be intermingled during the hearing.such information may not,standing alone,constitute peace officer personnel records,but it would be administratively impracticable to open and close portions of the hearing dependent upon whether at any given moment the question,discussion or testimony involves or does not involve information from peace officer personnel records.
after outlining the rights accorded to officers when disciplinary action is taken,sdpoa evaluated the impact of section confidentiality provisions on appeal hearings.sdpoa first compared the interpretation of the scope of section adopted by bradshaw city of los angeles d.bradshaw with the divergent interpretation adopted by city of richmond superior court th,d richmond and city of hemet superior court th,d hemet.sdpoa,supra,th at,d.in bradshaw,the court interpreted section to have limited operational import and concluded it applied only to preclude the employer from disclosing peace officer personnel records when those records were sought by a third party in connection with a civil or criminal proceeding.under this construction,bradshaw concluded section did not prohibit the employer dissemination of a transcript of an appeal hearing because section did not apply to disclosures outside the context of third party requests for records in connection with a civil or criminal proceeding.bradshaw,supra,d at.
however,the courts in richmond and hemet disagreed with bradshaw holding that section applied only to regulate disclosures by the employer in response to third party discovery motions in criminal or civil actions,and instead interpreted section to make peace officer personnel records confidential regardless of the context in which the documents were sought.the court in richmond held a city properly denied a newspaper request under the cpra for personnel records pertaining to an investigation of a peace officer because the cpra,although not specifically exempting those records,provided that a public entity need not disclose records exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law,subd.k,and richmond held section was a state law that prohibited disclosure of peace officer personnel records within the meaning of subdivision k.richmond,supra,th at,d.in hemet,the court similarly engrafted section onto the cpra to hold that a newspaper was not entitled to compel the city to disclose records of an internal police investigation of a peace officer actions,reasoning that l ogic does not permit the conclusion that information may be confidential for one purpose,yet freely disclosable for another.hemet,supra,th at,d.
sdpoa,agreeing with the rationale of richmond and hemet,concluded it would be unreasonable to construe the various statutes in a fashion that strictly limited the discovery of peace officer personnel records when sought by litigants while simultaneously permitting any member of the public to obtain those same records without any showing of good cause merely because the employer chose to reveal those records at a public appeal hearing to support its disciplinary action.sdpoa reasoned 
section protection would be wholly illusory unless that statute is read to establish confidentiality status for personnel records in the context of public disciplinary hearings.personnel records include all complaints and investigations of complaints,and information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.if a law enforcement agency the consent of the affected evidence at a public hearing regarding all past complaints and investigations of the complaints to assist in proving a particular personnel action,even if those complaints were later determined to be unfounded,criminal and civil litigants would then have full access to later wade through those records in an attempt to prove their current allegations against the officer.this is precisely what the legislature sought to avoid by codifying the pitchess procedures and recognizing these restrictions in section.sdpoa,supra,th at,d.
in davis city of san diego th,d,this court evaluated whether the city could voluntarily release to the media an investigative report,prepared by the citizens review board on police practices,concerning a shooting.after concluding the report was a personnel record within the meaning of penal code section,this court affirmed its adherence to the sdpoa analysis that section declared the records to be confidential regardless of the context of the proposed disclosure,and therefore the report could not be voluntarily released to the media.id.at,d.
copley suggests that,in other contexts,litigants who might otherwise have privacy interests in certain records are deemed to have waived those privacy rights when they tender a claim that necessitates examination of those records,and therefore a peace officer who appeals a disciplinary action should be deemed to have waived his or her privacy rights in the record.however,this argument presents a peace officer with a hobson choice the peace officer may retain privacy rights at the cost of foregoing appeal rights,or may pursue appeal rights at the cost of sacrificing privacy interests.
here,the csc,the hearing officer and trial court all considered that sdpoa and its analysis required appeal hearings be closed to the public unless the peace officer requested an open hearing,even though we cautioned in sdpoa that the closed hearing issue was beyond the scope of that decision.sdpoa,supra,th at,d.copley contends that issue is now before us.however,here there was no appeal hearing the disciplinary appeal was settled and an agreed disposition entered.therefore,it is not appropriate to decide whether an appeal hearing may be closed to the public if the peace officer does not request an open hearing because that issue is not before us on this record and we are not inclined to issue an advisory opinion on that issue.people slayton cal th,d.that issue should be decided in a case in which the peace officer does not request an open appeal hearing and the appeal hearing is closed to the public.sdpoa did not address the issue of closed appeal hearings and we decline to address that issue on this record.
sdpoa and peace officer personnel records 
although no appeal hearing was held in csc case,there were disciplinary proceedings in which charges were made,discussions took place,findings were made and a disposition of the charges finalized.copley was provided in response to its cpra requests some but not all of these materials and from these materials the peace officer identity was redacted.the denial of materials to copley was based on sdpoa and section,subdivisions c and k,and the trial court denied copley petition for writ of mandate based on sdpoa.
in this case it is appropriate to decide whether the record of the appeal separately qualifies as a public record within the meaning of the cpra see,subds.b,e f california state university,fresno,superior court th,d must be disclosed pursuant to a cpra request.
the cpra was intended to safeguard the accountability of government to the public san gabriel tribune superior court d,and because the cpra serves this important public interest by securing public access to government records,the cpra is construed broadly in favor of access,and exemptions from disclosure are construed narrowly.rogers superior court th,d.however,the legislature expressly declared the cpra was also enacted mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,a right expressly recognized by the california constitution as an inalienable right of the citizens of this state.cal,art.i.in cbs,block cal d,the supreme court acknowledged the competing interests of personal privacy and access to public records,stating that implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions.in order to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.however,a narrower but no less important interest is the privacy of individuals whose personal affairs are recorded in government files.id.at,fns.omitted.
under the cpra,when a public agency is presented with an otherwise proper request,the agency must disclose a record unless the record in question is exempt under ex
