daiwa securities america,daiwa,mtc electronic technologies,mtc and robert farr,peter jensen,thomas lenagh,edilberto pozon,goodwin wang,and david wong collectively the individual defendants appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york john gleeson,district judge approving partial settlements between and bdo dunwoody bdo,and hsbc bank canada hsbc and ron driol,an hsbc executive.
appellants collectively the defendants contend that the district court erred in approving the partial settlements without ensuring that their settlement judgment credit would be at least the total amount paid by the settling defendants and by deferring determination of the exact amount of the credit until trial.they also take issue with the district court approval of a settlement bar order extinguishing any claims against bdo relating to or arising from the allegations of this litigation.according to the defendants,any bar order should be narrowed to include only indemnity and contribution claims,and should also impose a reciprocal bar on claims by bdo.alternatively,the defendants argue that at least with respect to the settlement of the claims of those plaintiffs added by amendment to the complaint after the effective date of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,the bar order must be mutual.
we affirm the district court orders in part.we hold that the court deferral of the allocation of particular settlement amounts to various elements of damages for purposes of calculation of the defendants judgment credit was not erroneous,and conclude that,in light of the concessions made by plaintiffs on appeal,the defendants will receive a credit that is at least the settlement amount for common damages.we also affirm,with a slight modification,the district court bar order extinguishing the claims of the defendants for indemnity and contribution,and any other claims where the damage to the party is measured by its liability to the plaintiffs for claims relating to this action.we vacate and remand that part of the district court order relating to the mutuality of the bar order because we find that the magistrate judge,whose recommended ruling the district court adopted,did not fully consider the competing equities involved in the mutual and rules.finally,we agree with the district court that the pslra does not apply to any of the added plaintiffs in this action,which was commenced prior to that statute effective date.
background 
i.the litigation 
mtc was a company based in british columbia that purportedly had binding joint ventures regarding the operation,manufacture and sale of telecommunications equipment in china.plaintiffs are a group of investors who purchased shares of mtc common stock between and.mtc allegedly raised over million in a secondary offering in,which was underwritten by defendant daiwa.defendant bdo dunwoody bdo was mtc auditor during the time period at issue.plaintiffs allege that mtc purported telecommunications joint ventures were fraudulent and materially misrepresented.as a result,plaintiffs claim to have incurred trading losses in mtc stock of more than million.
nine of the named plaintiffs filed suit against mtc,its principals miko leung and sit wa leung,various mtc officers and directors the individual defendants,daiwa and bdo in the central district of california on january,alleging securities fraud,rico violations and state law claims of fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty the kayne action.because plaintiffs allegations were similar to those of two class actions then pending against mtc in the eastern district of new york,the kayne action was transferred to judge gleeson by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for coordinated proceedings.plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add seventeen additional plaintiffs in april,and two more in march.the individual defendants and bdo filed claims against hsbc and ron driol,an hsbc officer,alleging that they assisted in the misappropriation of mtc stock by the leungs.plaintiffs then sought leave to add hsbc and driol as defendants.that motion was denied,and the plaintiffs filed a state court action in california asserting federal rico and state common law fraud claims against hsbc and driol.these claims were consolidated with a california state court action that had previously been filed by the seventeen plaintiffs who were added to the federal action in april,and both state court actions were stayed pending the outcome of the proceedings before judge gleeson.the two original mtc class actions settled this action remains pending in the eastern district of new york before judge gleeson.
ii.the settlements 
in late,plaintiffs reached an million settlement with bdo purporting to allocate to damages and to interest.plaintiffs also reached a settlement with hsbc and driol,allocating to damages,to prejudgment interest,and to attorneys fees which are recoverable under rico.in exchange,plaintiffs agreed to release bdo,hsbc and driol for all claims they might have against the settling defendants in any forum,related in any way to the mtc litigation.
these settlements were submitted to the district court for approval,and were referred to magistrate judge chrein for a recommended ruling.the settling parties sought an order finding that the settlements were good faith settlements under california and federal law,barring claims by the defendants while preserving the claims of the settling defendants,dismissing the claims pending in the eastern district of new york,and approving the allocation of damages while leaving the determination of any judgment credit for the defendants until after trial.although plaintiffs had made settlement contingent on the district court adoption of their specific allocations,they subsequently agreed to finalize the settlements if the propriety of the allocations within the settlement figure was left to the trial judge.
iii.rulings below 
in a recommended ruling,magistrate judge chrein held that a capped proportionate share rule would determine the amount of the judgment credit to which the defendants are entitled on the state and federal claims.under such a rule,the credit is the greater of the settlement amount for common damages or the settling defendants share of liability as proven at trial.the magistrate judge observed that this rule ensures that no matter how the settlement funds are distributed as between damages and other elements,the defendants will never be required to pay more than their proportionate share of an award as determined by the trier of fact.
the magistrate judge also rejected the defendants argument that the pslra applied to the claims of the nineteen plaintiffs who joined the suit by amendment after the statute effective date.the magistrate judge found that the pslra did not apply to those plaintiffs because the kayne action was commenced on the date they filed the original complaint,not the date the plaintiffs were added.
finally,the magistrate judge held that a bar order extinguishing any claims arising out of or reasonably flowing from the claims and allegations in the kayne action was proper because the defendants would be adequately protected by the judgment credit.with respect to whether the bar order should also bar the settling defendants from asserting contribution or indemnity claims against the defendants,the magistrate judge noted that a district court in this circuit had previously held that settling defendants should be allowed to seek contribution from defendants to achieve equitable apportionment of damages among defendants.see in re fin.sec.while expressing concern that a rule which allows settling defendants,who are buying peace of mind and avoiding the costs and risks of litigation,to seek contribution from the defendants who bore the risk of litigation seems unfair,the magistrate judge stated that he fe lt obliged to follow the only precedent in this circuit especially given that the defendants were on the receiving end of this benefit in the prior class settlement.the magistrate judge then approved those portions of the bar orders preserving the settling defendants claims against the defendants.
the parties filed objections and requests for clarification,which were considered by the district court.judge gleeson adopted the magistrate judge recommendations in their entirety with one modification,holding that if a judgment is obtained against a nonsettling defendant,the judgment reduction shall not necessarily be calculated by using the full amounts of the settlements.rather,allocations of amounts within those gross figures to damages,prejudgment interest and attorneys fees shall be subject to the discretion of the trial court.
mtc,the individual defendants,and daiwa have appealed.plaintiffs have responded to the appeal on the question of the calculation of the judgment credit,the district court deferral of that calculation,and the applicability of the pslra.bdo has responded on the issue of the scope and of the bar order and the applicability of the pslra 
discussion 
standard of review 
a court can endorse a settlement only if the compromise is fair,reasonable and adequate.in re masters mates pilots pension plan irap,cir quoting weinberger kendrick,cir.this court has also observed that where the rights of one who is not a party to a settlement are at stake,the fairness of the settlement to the settling parties is not enough to earn the judicial stamp of approval.id.although the district court normally has discretion to approve a settlement,we may review the district court decision de novo where an appellant challenge to the authority of the district court to approve the settlement raises novel issues of law.id.
ii.the judgment credit 
we begin by noting the first of several issues that are not in dispute in this appeal.no party challenges the magistrate judge determination that the defendants judgment credit will be calculated using a capped proportionate share formula.under this rule,the credit given for the settlements will be the greater of the settlement amount for common damages a pro tanto rule or the proportionate share of the settling defendants fault as proven at trial.although we do not hold that such a formula is required,we agree with the magistrate judge conclusion that the cap,which ensures that a judgment credit is at least the amount of the settlement for common damages,complies with this circuit one satisfaction rule,which prohibits a plaintiff from recovering more than one satisfaction for each injury.singer olympia brewing,cir see also masters,at w here a settlement and a judgment compensate a plaintiff for the same injury,a nonsettling defendant is entitled to a judgment reduction at least in the amount of a prior settlement.by awarding a credit that is at least the settling defendants proven share of liability,the defendants rights are protected even without a determination of the fairness of the settlement.see id.at because the credit determination under a proportionate fault method is made after a determination of liability,the proportionate method is always consistent with fault.
despite the parties agreement on the method of calculation of the credit,the defendants argue that the district court orders create a possibility that they will receive less than the full amount of the settlement as a judgment credit,allegedly in violation of the one satisfaction rule.they also contend that they are entitled to know the amount of their credit,not merely the method of calculation,before trial.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
the settling parties here attempted to allocate the settlements to three elements of damages purportedly suffered by the plaintiffs damages,prejudgment interest,and attorneys fees on appeal,plaintiffs have conceded that in any of three possible scenarios,the judgment credit will be at least the full amount of the settlement for common damages.first,if plaintiffs prevail at trial on claims that entitle them to prejudgment interest the state law claims,and,at the discretion of the trial court,the federal securities claims or attorneys fees the rico claims,they do not disagree that the defendants may use any amounts the district court allocates to these elements of damages to set off their liability on those elements respectively.further,plaintiffs have also agreed that if the settlement money allocated to prejudgment interest exceeds the jury award on this element,any remaining portions can be used to offset damages.brief for at.the plaintiffs presumably would concede the same with respect to the portion of the settlement allocated to attorneys fees.finally,plaintiffs have acknowledged that they can not allocate any of the settlement to attorneys fees or prejudgment interest if plaintiffs do not prevail on claims entitling them to these types of damages 
if it is determined that plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest,all portions of the settlements allocated to prejudgment interest could be used as an offset against any award of damages.the same holds true for the attorneys fees portion of plaintiffs settlement with the bank if plaintiffs do not prevail at trial on their rico claims against the defendants.
id.emphasis added.as plaintiffs have conceded that the judgment credit will be at least the full amount of the settlement,regardless of how these various elements of damages are allocated at trial,the defendants fears that they will receive less than their full settlement credit or that the one satisfaction rule will be violated are unfounded 
despite these concessions,the defendants express concern that the district court held that if a judgment is obtained against a nonsettling defendant,the judgment reduction shall not necessarily be calculated by using the full amounts of the settlements.the district court order is accurate,however,insofar as only the portion of the settlement attributable to common damages will be credited.see masters,at absent a showing that damages are not common,a nonsettling defendant whose rights against settling defendants are to be barred is entitled to judgment reduction at least in the amount paid by all settling parties.singer,at w hen a plaintiff receives a settlement from one defendant,a nonsettling defendant is entitled to a credit of the settlement amount against any judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the nonsettling defendant as long as both the settlement and judgment represent common damages.
we also conclude that the defendants are not entitled to any greater degree of certainty about the amount of their judgment credit than they already have.consistent with in re jiffy lube securities litigation,cir,relied upon by the defendants,the district court orders informed the parties well before trial of the method that will be utilized to calculate the.the defendants know that they will get a credit amounting to the greater of the settlement attributed to common damages,or the settling defendants proportionate share of the total damages.they therefore know that the settling defendants wrongdoing is relevant,and can develop their trial strategy accordingly.we find no error in the district court decision to leave the determination of the actual amount of the judgment credit for calculation at trial because the defendants will get at least the full settlement amount as a credit,unless the settlement damages are not common,an issue which is obviously contingent on the outcome of the trial 
accordingly,we construe the bar orders approved by the district court,consistent with plaintiffs concessions on appeal and with singer,as indicating that the defendants judgment credit will be the greater of the settling defendants proportionate share of liability or the amount of the settlements attributable to common damages,regardless of how the settlement amounts are ultimately allocated or among damages,prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.so construed,the orders are affirmed as they relate to the calculation of the judgment credit.
iii.scope of the bar order 
with respect to the scope of the bar order entered by the district court,the parties disagreement is again quite limited.the defendants do not dispute that the district court properly barred their contribution and indemnification claims.see masters,at approving settlement bars of claims for indemnity and contribution if the defendant received a judgment credit of at least the amount paid by settling defendants toward damages for which the nonsettling defendant would be jointly and severally liable.they also clarified at oral argument that a disguised contribution or indemnity claim,such as a negligence claim where the injury to the defendants was their liability to the plaintiffs,could be barred.instead,the defendants argue that the district court bar order is too broad in that it extinguished independent claims,including claims arising from comfort letters issued by bdo to daiwa in connection with underwriting of the secondary offering.the settling defendants,in turn,claim that they seek to bar only those claims where damages are calculated based on the defendants liability to the plaintiffs.in a potentially contradictory position,however,bdo also maintains that it is entitled to a broader bar of any claims related to the transaction giving rise to its involvement in this litigation,namely,the certification of mtc financial statements 
in masters,we addressed the extinguishment of indemnity and contribution claims under a pro tanto recovery rule,and required a hearing on the fairness of the settlement to protect the due process rights of third parties in recognition of the possibility of collusion between the settling parties.at.under the capped proportionate share rule adopted by the courts below,however,no such fairness hearing is necessary because the defendants credit will be the greater of the proportionate fault or the settlement amount.by ensuring that,at the end of the day,the defendants are not held responsible for any damages for which the settling defendants are proven liable,the judgment credit adequately compensates the defendants for their indemnity and contribution claims,as well as for any other claims where the harm to the defendants is based on their liability to the plaintiffs.see id.at.
daiwa argues that the bar order impermissibly extinguishes independent claims that do not relate to any duty owed by bdo to plaintiffs,but rather involve a relationship between bdo and daiwa based on the issuance of the comfort letters by bdo to daiwa.if,however,daiwa proves at trial that it acted as it did in reasonable reliance on bdo comfort letters,the jury apportionment of liability to bdo,and the judgment credit that results from that apportionment,will adequately protect daiwa for any damages it owes to plaintiffs.to the extent that daiwa and the other defendants were injured by their reliance on the comfort letters only inasmuch as they owe damages to plaintiffs as a result of that reliance,those claims were properly extinguished.
this resolution of the scope of the bar order corresponds with bdo position that those claims where damages are calculated based on the defendants liability to the plaintiffs should be barred.more problematic is bdo alternative position that it is entitled to peace of mind on all claims arising out of the duties it may have breached with respect to the certification of the mtc financial statements,without regard for whether daiwa might have a claim for damages that goes beyond its liability to the plaintiffs.it may well be,as bdo argues,that the defendants are only damaged to the extent they are liable to the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation.if,however,daiwa were to prove that it sustained independent reputational damages or losses relating to the cost of defense arising out of a breached contractual or fiduciary relationship with bdo,it has not been compensated for those losses by the judgment credit,and any such claims should not be extinguished.see tbg,bendis,cir courts that have allowed bar orders have only barred claims in which the damages are measured by the defendant liability to the plaintiff.besides contribution and indemnity claims,these include any claims in which the injury is the nonsettling defendant liability to the plaintiff.no court has authorized barring claims with independent damages.citations omitted in re oil gas,cir holding that the district court properly barred fraud and negligence claims against the settling defendants because those claims were simply another theory for recovering the damages the defendant had to pay to the plaintiff.the issue,in other words,is less one of independent claims than independent damages.
we express no view on the likely merit of any claims for independent damages that the defendants may assert.we also recognize that the orders reference to claims arising out of or reasonably flowing from the claims or allegations in the kayne action may have been intended to encompass only claims where damages are based on liability owed by the defendants to the kayne plaintiffs.in light of the position taken by bdo in this appeal,and in the absence of any finding from the courts below that no such claims exist,however,a modification to the bar orders is necessary to ensure that the only claims that are extinguished are claims where the injury is the defendants liability to the plaintiffs accordingly,the bdo settlement order approved by the district court is modified as follows 
each of the defendants is hereby permanently barred,enjoined and restrained from commencing,prosecuting,or asserting any claim for indemnity or contribution against bdo or any other claim against bdo where the injury to the defendant is the defendant liability to the plaintiffs,arising out of or reasonably flowing from the claims or allegations in the kayne action,whether arising under state,federal or foreign law as claims,counterclaims,or claims,in the kayne action,in this court,in any federal or state court,or in any other court,arbitration proceeding,administrative agency,or other forum in the united states,canada or elsewhere collectively,the barred claims.these barred claims include,but are not limited to,any and all claims arising out of or reasonably flowing from comfort letters issued to defendant daiwa by bdo in connection with mtc,to the extent that the injury to the defendant under any such claim is its liability to the kayne plaintiffs 
iv.of the bar order 
the defendants also object to the fact that the bar orders are,in that they bar the defendants from bringing contribution and indemnity claims against settling defendants without imposing a reciprocal bar on the settling defendants,which remain free to seek indemnity or contribution from the parties.according to the defendants,if the settling defendants overpaid for the privilege of avoiding the risks and expenses of further litigation in this case,they should not be able to recover from defendants who undertook those risks and expenses by choosing to defend rather than accede to plaintiffs demands.
in approving the entry of the bar orders here,the magistrate judge cited in re fin.sec,in noting that o ne court in this circuit has considered the issue and determined that settling defendants should be allowed to seek contribution from defendants,reasoning that reduction by the capped proportionate share rule adheres to the rule while permitting settling defendants to seek contribution fosters equitable apportionment of damages among defendants.the magistrate judge then expressed concern that such a rule seem ed unfair because it allowed the settling defendants,who are buying peace of mind and avoiding the costs and risks of litigation,to seek contribution from other defendants who bore the risk in the event they settled for too much.the magistrate judge,however,then stated that he fe lt obliged to follow the only precedent in this circuit especially given that the defendants were on the receiving end of this benefit in the class settlement,and recommended approval of a bar.
the magistrate judge expressed view that he was obliged to follow a district court decision,notwithstanding his concern that such a rule seem ed unfair,convinces us that a remand for further consideration of the issue is warranted.before approving a bar order,the magistrate judge should have balanced the competing eq
