the american association of paging carriers aapc,a trade association representing paging signal carrier companies,seeks review of the september memorandum opinion and order of the federal communications commission fcc or commission in amendment of part of the commission rules and policies for applications and licensing of low power operations in the private land mobile radio mhz band,wl,reprinted at joint appendix ja denial order.in the denial order,the fcc denied aapc petition to reconsider parts of an earlier rulemaking that revised the channeling plan in the mhz band of the radio spectrum,designating eight frequencies in the mhz band for low power communications operations.see report and order,wl low power order.aapc claims that by allocating for low power use eight frequencies located at an unacceptably close distance of only khz from existing frequencies already designated for use by aapc members,the fcc violated the requirement set out in the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra,stat,mandating that the commission make necessary and practical modifications to ensure that technical requirements applicable to licensees such as aapc members are comparable to those applicable to licensees providing substantially similar services.obra d b.specifically,aapc claims that the low power order failed to carry out the unambiguous congressional intent expressed in obra that like communications services be treated alike.because we find the denial order unreviewable,however,we dismiss aapc petition.
regulation of commercial paging signal licensing 
paging services allow both commercial subscribers and internal or private networks of users to receive messages broadcast by radio waves over dedicated frequencies.historically,the fcc allocated frequencies for paging operations under two parts of its rules.part covered the traditional common carrier paging services available to the public known as public mobile services part systems,see,while part covered the private paging carrier services known as private land mobile radio services part systems,including private radio services tailored to the needs of particular user groups for internal not subject to common carrier as safety operations,roadside assistance and volunteer fire departments,systems used by school bus drivers or for disaster relief and businesses requiring specialized internal paging services like private ambulance companies.see.with a growing demand for private service,however,the commission began authorizing licensees to provide private carrier service,service to users on a basis,under part see inquiry relative to the future use of the frequency band mhz,second report and order,wl implementations of sections n and of the communications act,second report and order,wl.as private carrier service was offered to third parties for profit,and as the fcc permitted private land mobile service operators to interconnect with the public telephone network and thereby provide the same service traditionally offered by common carriers only,private carriers became indistinguishable from common carriers.nevertheless the two remained subject to separate regulatory schemes.see,at.common carriers were subject to rate regulation on both state and federal levels,for example,while private carriers were not.id.at.
in august,the congress enacted the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra,stat.seeking to establish a single regulatory framework for all mobile radio licensees offering services to the public and a different framework for private licensees,obra amended section of the communications act of.obra section b modified the regulation of all mobile radio services,including paging services,by creating two statutorily defined categories of mobile services commercial mobile radio services cmrs and private mobile radio services pmrs.it defined cmrs as any mobile service that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available a to the public or b to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public.see d.in response to this congressional mandate,the fcc concluded that all existing common carrier mobile radio services operating under part of its rules,including common carrier paging services,and a number of the radio services operating under part of its rules,including private carrier paging services provided by aapc members,would now be subject to the new cmrs classification implementations of sections n and of the communications act,second report and order,at,wl.through obra the congress also sought to ensure that part licensees receive substantially similar regulatory treatment as the part licensees with which they now share the cmrs classification by providing that the commission,in the regulations that will,after such date of enactment,apply to a service that was a private land mobile service and that becomes a commercial mobile service as a consequence of such amendments,shall make such other modifications or terminations as may be necessary and practical to assure that licensees in such service are subjected to technical requirements that are comparable to the technical requirements that apply to licensees that are providers of substantially similar common carrier services.obra d b.
procedural history 
aapc challenges the fcc revision of existing policies governing low power operations in the mhz land mobile radio frequency bands regular channels employing transmissions in these bands are normally spaced khz apart recognizing the need for low power operations while at the same time encouraging efficient spectrum use however,the fcc in march made certain offset channels frequencies only khz removed from the khz for low power operations amendment of part of the commission rules and policies for applications and licensing of low power operations in the private land mobile radio mhz band,report and order,wl.the new offset channels,referred to as group c channels in the low power order,were intended for small business use,particularly by individuals like plumbers and electricians who move among fixed job locations and need communications capacity on an itinerant basis id.at.
after the low power order issued,aapc petitioned for reconsideration,requesting the fcc to eliminate the licensing and use of the offset frequencies that are only khz removed from eight frequencies used by a number of its members to provide mobile paging services in the mhz band.aapc petition for reconsideration,wt docket,may,at.in its petition,aapc noted that it was a newly organized national trade association formed after the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking that led to the low power order had closed.id.at.aapc based its petition for reconsideration on two related grounds relying on chevron natural resources defense council,d,it claimed that the allocation of the offset frequencies was fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory requirement that part cmrs licensees be subjected to technical requirements that apply to licensees that are providers of substantially similar common carrier services and it maintained the offset frequencies would necessarily subject its members to unreasonable interference,degrading the quality of service provided by part carriers as compared to part carriers.id.at.
the fcc rejected both grounds it first disagreed with aapc claim that it was statutorily required to ensure that part paging operations now subject to cmrs regulatory treatment meet the same technical requirements as common carrier paging operations subject to part of the rules.denial order,at.the commission noted that obra section d required it to modify its rules,to the extent necessary and practical,to ensure that substantially similar services are subject to comparable technical requirements not identical that the statute confers substantial discretion on the commission to determine how this objective should be accomplished.id.citing further notice of proposed rulemaking,implementations of sections n and of the communications act,second report and order,wl.the commission concluded that it was not required by obra to modify existing rules if such modification
