this consolidated appeal calls on us to consider,a statute that governs the federal bureau of investigation fbi issuance of national security letters nsls to wire or electronic communication service providers.an nsl is an administrative subpoena that allows the fbi to gain access to,inter alia,subscriber information or electronic communication transactional records held by internet service providers when this information is relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities a b.john does i and ii are internet service providers who received nsls and commenced proceedings in the southern district of new york and the district of connecticut respectively challenging the constitutionality of.
section was originally enacted as part of title ii of the electronic communication privacy act of ecpa,stat,and was amended in and.see generally fbi access to telephone records,stat,intelligence authorization act for fiscal year,a,stat.shortly after the terrorist attacks of september,however,congress again amended by means of title v,section of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act,stat.
both the southern district of new york in doe ashcroft doe i,d,and the district of connecticut in doe gonzales doe ii,d,ruled on the constitutionality of as amended by the usa patriot act.however,while this appeal was pending,congress passed the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of,stat,the reauthorization act or the act.this act dramatically altered,and added several new procedures codified at,which now govern judicial review of the fbi requests for information through nsls.in light of the significant changes to in the reauthorization act,this court issued an order on march,requesting supplemental letter briefs from the parties on the impact of the reauthorization act on this case.
having reviewed the government letter brief dated march,gov t ltr.br,the plaintiffs letter brief dated april,and the government reply letter brief dated april,gov t reply ltr.br,we dispose of doe i and doe ii as follows.
in doe i,on for summary judgment,the southern district of new york held that the version of was unconstitutional as applied to john doe i under the fourth amendment because it was denied judicial review.doe i,d at.the southern district of new york also held that the permanent nondisclosure requirement also known as the gag order provision of the version of c was unconstitutional on its face under the first amendment because it operated as a prior restraint on speech that was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.doe i,d at.
the reauthorization act has substantially shifted the legal footing on which doe i stands.the parties agree that the reauthorization act provisions apply retroactively to nsls issued before the reauthorization act.see gov t ltr.br.at pls.ltr.br.at.because the reauthorization act added provisions permitting nsl recipients to challenge the issuance of nsls in court,see a,john doe i no longer presses fourth amendment claims on this appeal,see pls.ltr.br.at see also gov t reply ltr.br.at.therefore,we deem them abandoned,rendering this portion of the appeal moot.accordingly,we vacate the fourth amendment portion of the southern district of new york opinion in doe see russman bd.of,cir in general,where the appellee has caused the case to become moot,we vacate the district court judgment to prevent the appellee from insulating a favorable decision from appellate review.
the new c now explicitly allows an nsl recipient to talk with an attorney to obtain legal advice or legal assistance with respect to the request.c see gov t ltr.br.at.the reauthorization act also added procedures for the judicial review of the terms and conditions of nondisclosure imposed on a recipient of an nsl.see b.however,plaintiffs argue that the revised version of c,as amended and supplemented by the reauthorization act,still violates john doe i first amendment rights.see pls.ltr.br.at.the government responds that the reauthorization act and the new procedures found in solve the purported first amendment problems that the nondisclosure provisions of the prior version of c had raised.see gov t ltr.br.at.
we do not believe that it would be prudent to resolve these novel first amendment issues as a part of this appeal.therefore,we also vacate the first amendment portion of doe i,and we remand this case so that the southern district of new york,in the first instance,can address the first amendment issues presented by the revised version of c,and the reauthorization act new procedures and standards for judicial review found at.on remand,the district court will,as appropriate,have the opportunity to receive amended pleadings,request new briefs,conduct oral argument,and,in due course,furnish its views on the constitutionality of the revised version of c and the reauthorization act.see,lewis cont l bank,d i n instances where mootness is attributable to a change in the legal framework governing the case,and where the plaintiff may have some residual claim under the new framework that was understandably not asserted previously,our practice is to vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings in which the parties may,if necessary,amend their pleadings or develop the record more fully.
ii.gonzales doe ii,
in doe ii,on a motion for preliminary injunction,the district of connecticut enjoined the government from enforcing the gag order imposed on john doe ii under c insofar as it prevented john doe ii from revealing its identity as a recipient of an nsl.in granting its motion for a preliminary injunction,the district of connecticut held that john doe ii had demonstrated irreparable harm from the suppression of its speech,and a likelihood of success on the merits that c violated john doe ii first amendment rights as a,prior restraint on speech.see doe ii,d at.
in light of the reauthorization act,the government now asserts that john doe ii should move in the district of connecticut,under the new procedures in b,for a modification of the terms of its c requirements so that it can reveal its identity.see gov t ltr.br.at.the government has represented to us that it will not oppose such a motion.see id.the government also contends that once the district of connecticut allows disclosure of john doe ii identity,this appeal will become moot.the government argues that,at that point,we should then dismiss the appeal in doe ii,and vacate the district of connecticut preliminary injunction opinion rather than leave it unreviewed on appeal.see id.citing united states munsingwear.the government proposals for the handling of doe ii are flawed for two reasons.
first,the district of connecticut can not entertain a motion under the reauthorization act and b before this court issues its mandate.in other words,we must act first and return this case to the district of connecticut,which could then entertain motions from john doe ii,if necessary or appropriate.see ostrer united states,cir the effect of the mandate is to bring the proceedings in a case on appeal in our court to a close and to remove it from the jurisdiction of this court,returning it to the forum whence it came.see also united states rivera,cir simply put,jurisdiction follows the mandate.
second,it is the government burden,as the party seeking relief from the status quo of the judgment below,to demonstrate equitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of vacatur.bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,d.in considering whether or not vacatur of a lower court opinion is warranted when a case becomes moot on appeal,we look to the the nature and character of the conditions which have caused the case to become moot.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.if the case has become moot due to circumstances unattributable to any of the parties or from the unilateral action of the party who prevailed in the district court,vacatur is usually warranted.see id.at.however,when the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the mootnes
