section c of the telecommunications act of requires incumbent local exchange carriers to provide competitive local exchange carriers with space for the physical collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at their premises.responding to our opinion in gte service corporation fcc,which vacated the federal communication commission first order implementing section c insofar as it embrace d unduly broad definitions of necessary and physical collocation,the commission issued a new order,which petitioners now challenge.they argue that the commission standard for collocatable equipment remains overly broad because it permits collocation of any equipment necessary for interconnection or access whether or not it is necessary to place such equipment at the premises the commission unlawfully allowed the placement of switching and routing equipment,as well as equipment containing multiple functions only some of which are necessary for interconnection or access to network elements the commission lacks authority to order incumbents to physically connect collocating competitive local exchange carriers to each other and the commission space assignment rules are unlawful.finding petitioners claims either meritless or waived,we deny the petitions.
in order to foster competition for local telephone services,congress,in the telecommunications act of,authorized competitive local exchange carriers clecs to place certain equipment within the premises of incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs so that clecs could gain access to ilecs networks.specifically,section c requires ilecs to provide,on rates,terms,and conditions that are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,for physical collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the local exchange carrier.c.the statute provides certain exceptions not here relevant for instances where an ilec can demonstrate to a state commission that physical collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations.id.
based on this statutory authorization,the commission issued an order entitled deployment of wireline services offering advanced telecommunications capability,rcd,wl,collocation order,in which it outlined the types of equipment that may be collocated,established standards for the assignment of space within the ilec facilities,and fashioned rules allocating the initial costs of preparing collocation space.a detailed summary of this collocation order appears in our decision in gte service corporation fcc.in that case,although we affirmed the commission cost allocation rule,we found defective its standards for the types of equipment collocatable and its space assignment rules.the flaws in the commission prior ruling fell into three categories,which we outline below together with the commission responses on remand.see deployment of wireline services offering advanced telecommunications capability,rcd,wl remand order.
equipment necessary for interconnection or access 
in gte,we found impermissibly broad,at,the commission interpretation of the phrase necessary for interconnection or access,which allowed collocation of any equipment used or useful for either interconnection or access to unbundled network elements,regardless of other functionalities inherent in such equipment,collocation order.the commission interpretation,we observed,appear ed to permit competitors to collocate equipment that may do more than what is required to achieve interconnection or access.gte,at.
responding to this criticism,the commission now deems equipment necessary for purposes of section c only if an inability to deploy that equipment would,as a practical,economic,or operational matter,preclude the requesting carrier from obtaining interconnection or access to unbundled network elements.remand order.in crafting this new standard,the commission rejected verizon argument that necessary modifies the phrase physical collocation,reasoning that such a reading would wrongly place the focus on whether collocation of the equipment is necessary,as opposed to whether the equipment itself,regardless of its location in the network,is necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements.remand order emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
in light of its new standard,the commission also reexamined its treatment of switching and routing equipment.in the collocation order,the commission expressly declined to require incumbents to collocate equipment used exclusively for switching,finding insufficient support in the record for such a requirement.collocation order.at the same time,however,the commission warned that it might explore requiring such collocation in the future,what it did on remand from gte.benefitting from a greatly expanded record reflect ing parties several years of experience with the unbundled network access regime,the commission reversed course,remand order,concluding that smaller,more modern switching and routing equipment may be entitled to collocation because it was necessary to access an unbundled local loop theoretical capability of providing a telecommunications service,id.the commission declined to allow collocation of older,traditional circuit switches,finding them unnecessary in light of the availability of smaller,more modern switches.
with regard to,equipment that combines functions that meet the equipment standard with functions that would not meet that standard as functions,remand order commission now allows collocation if the primary purpose and function as the carrier seeks to deploy the equipment are to provide interconnection or access to unbundled network elements any additional functions have a logical nexus to that purpose and the additional functions do not affect the demand on the incumbent space and other resources so significantly as to increase the relative burden on the incumbent property interests,id.
requirement 
in gte,we vacated the commission decision to allow clecs to connect their equipment directly to that of other collocating carriers subject only to the same reasonable safety requirements that the ilec imposes on its own equipment.collocation order.the obvious problem with this requirement,we thought,was that it impose d an obligation on i lecs that ha d no apparent basis in a statute that focuse s solely on connecting new competitors to i lecs networks.gte,at.in its remand order,the commission elected to maintain the requirement,but in a modified form.instead of allowing clecs to provision,install and maintain their own,the commission now requires ilecs to provision upon request.remand order.the commission imposed that requirement because i f an incumbent refuses to provision between clecs collocated at the incumbent premises,the incumbent would be the only lec that could interconnect with all or even any of the clecs collocated at a common,centralized central office.id.in contrast,for two clecs to exchange traffic without a cross connect,
each clec would have to carry its own telecommunications traffic into its collocation space and then have the incumbent lec transport that traffic over facilities to an interconnection point outside the incumbent premises.from there,the other clec would likely then carry the traffic back to its own collocation space in the same central office to be transported through the clec network.
id.such back hauling,the commission found,would impose significant wasteful economic costs on clecs that incumbent lecs themselves do not face and that would severely restrict the viability of competitive transport.id.
according to the commission,three separate provisions of the communications act support the new requirement.first,the commission found the requirement authorized under section a,which requires a common carrier 
to furnish such communication service upon reasonable request therefor and,in accordance with the orders of the commission,in cases where the commission,after opportunity for hearing,finds such action necessary or desirable in the public interest,to establish physical connections with other carriers 
second,an incumbent refusal to provision,the commission concluded,was an unjust and unreasonable practice in connection with existing services,remand order,thus violating section b requirement that all c harges,practices,classifications,and regulations for and in connection with such communication service be just and reasonable.b.finally,because it felt ilecs would be operating in an unreasonable and discriminatory manner if they refused to provide between collocators,remand order,the commission found the new requirement authorized by section c requirement of collocation on such terms and conditions as are just,reasonable,and nondiscriminatory,c.arguing that gte does not foreclose this result,the commission pointed out that gte merely rejects the notion that were collocatable equipment and never addresses whether the commission could require incumbent provisioned crossconnects pursuant to the rates,terms,and conditions clause of section c.remand order.
space assignment rules 
third and finally,in gte,we vacated the commission space assignment rules.by banning ilecs from requiring competitors to use separate entrances,or isolated rooms or floors,those rules left competitors free to pick and choose preferred space on the lecs premises,subject only to technical feasibility.gte,at.modifying the space assignment rules in response to gte,the commission gave ilecs ultimate responsibility for placement of equipment.remand order.an ilec may also provide for the physical segregation of collocated equipment if the proposed separated space is a available in the same or a shorter time frame as space b at a cost not materially higher than the cost of space and c is comparable,from a technical and engineering standpoint,to space.remand order.under the remand order,moreover,incumbents may require segregated spaces only where legitimate security concerns,or operational constraints unrelated to the incumbent competitive concerns,warrant them.id.the commission adopted this final requirement after finding based on the record that there was simply insufficient evidence to support a finding that incumbent security concerns require physical separation of collocated equipment in every instance.id.it also held that ilecs could require separate entrances where construction of such entrance s is technically feasible,and will neither artificially delay collocation provisioning nor materially increase the requesting carrier costs and where an incumbent has legitimate security concerns.id.
claiming the commission failed to heed this court mandate in gte,pet rs opening br.at,petitioner verizon communications,together with bellsouth corporation and sbc communications,throughout this opinion we shall refer to petitioners as verizon now petition for review.verizon argues that the commission new reading of section c is overly broad because it allows for the collocation of equipment at the premises of ilecs even if interconnection or access could be obtained through the use of equipment,id.at internal quotation marks omitted the commission acted unlawfully by allowing clecs to collocate switching or routing equipment and by permitting clecs to collocate multifunctional equipment without demonstrating that each function is necessary for interconnection or access,id.at the commission has no authority to order and the new space assignment rules grant competitors unwarranted rights to control the specific location of their equipment within the incumbent premises,id.at.intervening in support of the commission are fourteen other telecommunications companies,led by corporation.
the familiar standard established by chevron,natural resources defense council,d,governs our review of the commission interpretation of a statute it administers.under this standard,we first determine whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue,and if not,we defer to any permissible agency interpretation.id.at.at.we do not understand verizon to be arguing that the commission interpretation fails chevron first step,nor could such an argument succeed with respect to the agency interpretation of section c in light of our express holding that the relevant statutory terms are ambiguous.see gte,at holding that the disputed terms at issue necessary,physical collocation,and premises are ambiguous in their meanings.consequently,we defer to the commission interpretations if they are reasonable and consistent with the statutory purpose.id.our deference is particularly great where,as here,the issues involve a high level of technical expertise in an area of rapidly changing technological and competitive circumstances.sprint comms.fcc.with this highly deferential standard in mind,we consider each of verizon arguments.
we begin with verizon claim that the phrase equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the local exchange carrier,c,means that clecs may not place equipment on an ilec premises unless an location is infeasible.according to verizon,the commission interpretation,which focuses on whether the equipment is necessary for interconnection or access regardless of its location in the network,remand order,ignore s the pivotal phrase at the end of the sentence,which makes clear that equipment must be necessary at the premises of the local exchange carrier,pet rs opening br.at.the only sensible interpretation of this language,verizon argues,is that the adjective necessary relates to both components of the compound prepositional phrase for interconnection or access at the premises of the local exchange carrier.pet rs reply br.at.otherwise,the premises clause does no work at all it is simply a redundant appendage.pet rs opening br.at.
as the commission points out,on remand from gte,verizon made an entirely different textual argument,namely,that the word necessary modifies physical collocation,not equipment.see comments of the verizon telephone companies,at requesting the commission to find that the term necessary modifies the phrase physical collocation of equipment,so that any physical collocation can be ordered only where that collocation is necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements.the commission rejected that argument,finding that the most natural reading of the statutory language,as dictated by simple grammar,is that the term necessary modifies equipment,not physical collocation.remand order.seizing upon this variation,the commission insists that verizon has waived its at the premises argument.see high plains wireless,lp fcc,citing a.we agree.
conceding that it never presented to the commission the precise textual argument it raises now,verizon argues that every facet of an argument need not be presented to the commission as long as the basic challenge to a commission policy was reasonably flagged.pet rs reply br.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the case verizon relies upon,time warner entertainment fcc,however,establishes a slightly more demanding test.there,we held that if a petitioner makes a basic challenge to a commission policy,but the formulation of the issue presented to us was not precisely as presented to the commission,we ask whether a reasonable commission necessarily would have seen the question raised before us as part of the case presented to it.here,verizon made a quite specific textual argument before the the word necessary modifies the phrase physical collocation.in responding to this argument,the commission had no occasion to consider the different textual argument made the word necessary relates to the phrase at the premises as well as to the phrase physical collocation.the textual argument verizon made before the commission does not logically implicate the one it makes now,as would have been the case if,for example,the commission,in order to arrive at its decision,would necessarily have had to determine the effect of the at the premises language.in short,we do not believe that a reasonable commission necessarily would have seen the argument verizon now raises.
we have expressed our concern about the effect on federal agencies rightful role in statutory construction under the chevron
