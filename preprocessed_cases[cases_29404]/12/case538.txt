this case requires us to determine whether sections of the electronic communications privacy act ecpa,and,provide for a private cause of action against those who aid and abet,or conspire with,electronic communications service providers in unlawfully disseminating the contents of electronic communications.the language of and identifies unambiguously who is subject to liability.furthermore,the legislative history and case law is in accord with these sections clear directive.accordingly,we decline to read into the text of these code sections claims for secondary liability.rather,we interpret the code to mean what it plainly says.
directv is a provider of satellite digital television.to protect its service and prevent the unauthorized viewing of its television programing,directv encrypts its satellite transmissions.directv actively pursues legal action against those individuals involved in the unauthorized use,or in more common parlance,the pirating,of its encrypted transmissions.
on june,directv filed a lawsuit in canada against daryl gray.gray operated a number of web sites from his home in british columbia,canada.the web sites allegedly offered information relating to the pirating of the directv signal.directv complaint asserted that the web sites provided information regarding all forms of piracy technology such as the use of equipment,software,and programming codes,as well as smart cards specifically used to access the directv signal without paying for it.directv alleged also that one of the web pirate den run by gray server located in his british columbia home provided an online meeting place for participants to discuss,exchange,and post piracy technology information.
concerned with pirating activity,directv applied to the supreme court of british columbia for an injunction and order entitling directv to seize gray computers and the data contained therein.on june,the court granted directv request,issuing what is referred to in canada as an anton piller order.an anton piller order operates as both an injunction and a civil writ of seizure.per this order,gray was enjoined from operating two web sites and.directv was also able to enjoin gray from a number of other activities relating to the accessing or facilitating of piracy technology or information.
in addition,the order granted directv the right to enter gray offices to search for,examine,and remove or copy evidence of activities including the web sites,databases contained therein,electronic storage media and computer equipment.the order entitled directv to remove or copy any document,record,article,notes,information,instructions,correspondence,sent and received,electronic mail,howsoever stored,fixed,expressed or embodied the order also allowed directv to designate an entity to be responsible for accessing,recording,and processing the data.directv designated icg,the other,as that entity.
the order provided that evidence seized from gray was to be held in the custody of directv solicitors pending the trial of this action,or until such time this court orders otherwise.the order also provided for the appointment of an independent solicitor to carry out the terms of the seizure and to take custody of the evidence.however,the independent solicitor and directv agreed independently that when the order was executed,the evidence seized would be taken into custody by the independent solicitor,not by directv lawyers.finally,the order allowed for any and all evidence seized or delivered up pursuant to the order to be used in subsequent civil proceedings commenced by directv against any third party,including,but not limited to proceedings against gray customers,suppliers,members,and subscribers.
on june,the anton piller order was executed at gray residence in british columbia,canada.gray computer servers and hard drives containing electronic communications of individuals that had accessed gray web sites were seized and placed in the independent solicitor custody.
ultimately,the lawsuit between directv and gray was resolved.in a separate agreement between gray and directv,the evidence held by the independent solicitor was released to directv.earlier in,directv filed a lawsuit in the united states against lawrence freeman,for engaging in the distribution of illegal signal theft devices.during the litigation against freeman,in response to initial discovery requests,directv produced portions of the information gathered at gray residence.this information included the content of communications posted on electronic message boards accessed through gray web sites.on march,directv and freeman settled the lawsuit and entered into a settlement agreement and release.
on april,appellants,freeman and michael scherer,filed the underlying class action.in an amended complaint,scherer claimed that he,like freeman,was a participant on the message boards and web sites run by gray.freeman and scherer asserted that the sharing of data from gray to directv was not authorized by the anton piller order because directv had agreed that the evidence would be in custody of the independent solicitor instead of directv solicitors and that it was only released pursuant to the agreement between gray and directv.freeman and scherer claimed further that because there was a subsequent agreement between gray and directv that allowed directv to receive the data from the independent solicitor,directv conspired with and aided and abetted gray in the disclosure of the stored communications in violation of.
on june,directv and icg moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim and in the alternative for summary judgment.directv and icg argued that freeman and scherer claims should be dismissed for three reasons does not provide for secondary liability claims of conspiracy or aiding and abetting freeman and scherer secondary claims were not properly pled and the claims were barred under the doctrine.
on july,the district court granted the motion to dismiss and ruled that the motion for summary judgment was,therefore,moot.the district court granted the motion on the basis of directv and icg first does not provide a basis for asserting conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims.freeman and scherer timely appealed that determination.
a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b is reviewed de novo.see decker advantage fund,cir.thus,we review the matter anew,the same as if it had not been heard before,and as if no decision previously had been rendered.ness commissioner,cir.
appellants,freeman and scherer,contend that the district court erred in its determination that and of the ecpa do not create a cause of action for two secondary liability and abetting,or conspiring with an electronic communication service to disclose information.appellees,directv and icg,assert that the district court did not err,and even if the court did err there are additional independent grounds upon which we can affirm the dismissal.directv and icg argue also that if dismissal is inappropriate,we should grant its summary judgment motion that was also before the district court.directv and icg alternative arguments are not necessary.the district court was correct and should not be interpreted to include secondary liability claims.thus,dismissal was proper and there is no reason for us to address directv and icg alternative arguments.
the language of a and a is straightforward.section a prohibits a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public from knowingly divulg ing to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service.section a imposes civil liability for violating that prohibition

here,because it is uncontroverted that neither directv nor icg was a provider of the elect
