gould,circuit judge 
this is a consumer protection case arising from text messages about a gym membership.the parties dispute the scope of the consumer consent to being contacted after he gave his cell phone number while signing up for a gym membership,and whether he revoked his consent when he cancelled the membership.for purposes of the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa,we hold that the scope of a consumer consent depends on the transactional context in which it is given.the call or text message must be based on the circumstance in which the consumer gave his or her number.the consumer may revoke his or her consent but in that case must clearly express that he or she does not want to receive the messages or calls.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that bradley van patten gave prior express consent to receive the text messages at issue,and did not effectively revoke his consent,hence dooming his tcpa claim.also,as for his claims under california law asserting violations of california business and professions code and,van patten did not establish economic standing.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of vertical fitness group,llc and advecor.
on march,bradley van patten visited a gold gym franchise in green bay,wisconsin to obtain information about a gym membership.during the visit,van patten submitted a desk courtesy card to the gym,wherein he wrote his demographic,financial,and contact information to determine whether he was to become a member.in this data van patten listed his cell phone number as his contact number.
van patten then met with the gym manager,an employee of vertical fitness group,llc,to discuss the possibility of a membership.during this conversation,the manager filled out a gold gym membership agreement on behalf of van patten,which van patten signed.the manager wrote van patten cell phone number in the phone number field.within three days of opening his gym membership,van patten called gold gym to cancel his membership.van patten moved to california in the summer of,but he kept his wisconsin cell phone number.
vertical fitness owned or managed several of the gold gym franchises.although vertical fitness did not own the gym van patten joined,it operated and managed the gym.in the spring of,many of the gold gym franchises in wisconsin and minnesota,including the gym that van patten had joined,ended their franchise relationships with gold gym and became xperience fitness gyms.vertical fitness owned the xperience fitness brand and trademark.
after the brand change,vertical fitness turned to its marketing partner,advecor,to help announce the gym brand change to current and former gym members and invite members to return.one such announcement was made via text messages.vertical fitness gave the phone numbers of former or inactive gym members to advecor,and advecor sent the text messages.van patten received his first text message on may.the message read 
golds sic gym is now xperience fitness.come back for mo,no commitment.enter for a chance to win a nissan xterra visit giveaway 
he received a similar text on june.
van patten filed a putative class action lawsuit arising out of the text messages on june.he alleged that the unauthorized text messages defendants sent caused consumers actual harm,including the aggravation that necessarily accompanies wireless spam and that consumers pay their cell phone service providers for the receipt of such wireless spam.van patten asserted three causes of action violation of the telephone consumer protection act of,violation of california business and professions code and violation of california business and professions code.the district court granted van patten leave to file a first amended complaint,in which he added advecor as a defendant and added the allegation that he received two text messages.the district court granted van patten motion for class certification but on may,the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of van patten claims.
on appeal,van patten argues that the district court erred by granting defendants motions for summary judgment on all three of his claims.we have jurisdiction under.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see satterfield simon schuster,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.
we address each of van patten claims in turn.
a.the telephone consumer protection act of 
the tcpa makes it unlawful for any person within the united states to use any telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send,to a telephone facsimile machine,an unsolicited advertisement b c.the tcpa generally prohibits making nonemergency,unsolicited calls advertising property,goods,or services using automatic dialing systems and prerecorded messages to telephones and cellular phones.id.a id.b a iii.although the tcpa does not define a call,the federal communications commission fcc,the agency implementing the tcpa,has interpreted the tcpa to encompass both voice calls and text calls to wireless numbers including,for example,short message service sms calls,which are generally referred to as text messages.in re rules regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,rcd,july,the order see also satterfield,at holding that the fcc interpretation that a text message is a call under the tcpa is reasonable.a call or text is not unsolicited,however,where the recipient gave the sender prior express consent.b a.
article iii standing 
before turning to the merits of van patten tcpa claim,we first address whether van patten has standing under article iii of the constitution.article iii limits federal judicial power to cases and controversies,const.art.iii,and standing to sue limits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek redress for a legal wrong,spokeo,robins.to satisfy article iii standing,t he plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant,and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.id.applying the traditional standing test from lujan defenders of wildlife.a plaintiff establishes injury in fact,if he or she suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at quoting lujan,at.
the supreme court most recently addressed the concrete injury requirement of standing in spokeo robins.the court reiterated that article iii standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation,and that a plaintiff does not automatically satisf y the requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.id.at.in spokeo,the plaintiff alleged violations of the fair credit reporting act fcra,based on a website publication of inaccurate consumer information regarding the plaintiff age,martial status,educational background,and other demographic information.id.at.the fcra sets procedural requirements for consumer reporting agencies to ensure that credit reporting is fair and accurate.see.on appeal,the ninth circuit had held that the relevant interests protected by the fcra were sufficiently concrete and particularized to satisfy the requirements of article iii standing.id.at.the supreme court,however,vacated the judgment and remanded the case,holding that the standing analysis was incomplete because we had not distinguished between concreteness and particularization.id.at.the supreme court did not determine whether the plaintiff had suffered an injury sufficient to confer standing to sue,but emphasized that a plaintiff can not allege a bare procedural violation,divorced from any concrete harm,and satisfy the requirement of article iii.id.at.the court also observed that intangible harms a plaintiff alleges can satisfy the requirement.see id.w e have confirmed in many of our previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.
here,defendants argue that van patten did not establish a concrete necessary to pursue his tcpa claim in light of spokeo we disagree.
as the supreme court explained in spokeo,both history and the judgment of congress play important roles in supporting our conclusion that a violation of the tcpa is a concrete,de facto injury.id.actions to remedy defendants invasions of privacy,intrusion upon seclusion,and nuisance have long been heard by american courts,and the right of privacy is recognized by most states.see restatement second of torts b am.law inst.and in enacting the tcpa,congress made specific findings that unrestricted telemarketing can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and are a nuisance.telephone consumer protection act of,pub,stat.see also mims arrow fin,llc.congress sought to protect consumers from the unwanted intrusion and nuisance of unsolicited telemarketing phone calls and fax advertisements.see pub.the session law for the tcpa itself stated banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home,except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer,is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.id.we also have recognized this congressional purpose.satterfield,at.
the tcpa establishes the substantive right to be free from certain types of phone calls and texts absent consumer consent.congress identified unsolicited contact as a concrete harm,and gave consumers a means to redress this harm.we recognize that congress has some permissible role in elevating concrete,de facto injuries previously inadequate in law to the status of legally cognizable injuries.spokeo,at quoting lujan,at.we defer in part to congress judgment,because congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum article iii requirements.id.we also recognize that congress role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.id.
congress aimed to curb telemarketing calls to which consumers did not consent by prohibiting such conduct and creating a statutory scheme giving damages if that prohibition was violated.unlike in spokeo,where a violation of a procedural requirement minimizing reporting inaccuracy may not cause actual harm or present any material risk of harm,see id.at,the telemarketing text messages at issue here,absent consent,present the precise harm and infringe the same privacy interests congress sought to protect in enacting the tcpa.unsolicited telemarketing phone calls or text messages,by their nature,invade the privacy and disturb the solitude of their recipients.a plaintiff alleging a violation under the tcpa need not allege any additional harm beyond the one congress has identified.id.at emphasis in original.gomez,affirming that the district court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate gomez tcpa complaint.
we hold that van patten alleged a concrete injury in fact sufficient to confer article iii standing.
prior express consent 
the parties do not dispute that defendants sent van patten text messages using an automatic telephone dialing system we need only assess whether van patten gave prior express consent.van patten contends that the district court erred by granting defendants motion for summary judgment on his tcpa claim because he never gave prior express consent to receive text messages from defendants,and even if he had,he revoked that consent by cancelling his gym membership.we address those contentions in turn,but disagree and conclude that van patten based on the context in which he gave his phone number consented to receiving the text messages.also,van patten did not expressly revoke his consent.
express consent is not an element of a plaintiff prima facie case but is an affirmative defense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof see in the matter of rules regulations implementing the.consumer prot.act of,rcd,the order w e conclude that the creditor should be responsible for demonstrating that the consumer provided prior express consent should a question arise as to whether express consent was provided,the burden will be on the creditor to show it obtained the necessary prior express consent.see also grant capital mgmt,app x,cir.e xpress consent is not an element of a tcpa plaintiff prima facie case,but rather is an affirmative defense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.the district court correctly stated that prior express consent is a complete defense to van patten tcpa claim.van patten vertical fitness,llc,supp,cal.we agree and next address whether there was prior express consent that was effective here as a defense to the text messages that were sent.
because the tcpa does not define the phrase prior express consent,we turn to the fcc orders and rulings,which interpret and clarify the term.defendants rely on in re rules regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,rcd,the order and stress one sentence in particular p ersons who knowingly release their phone numbers have in effect given their invitation or permission to be called at the number which they have given,absent instructions to the contrary.rcd.at.emphasizing this language,defendants argue that van patten gave prior express consent to being contacted at his cellular telephone number by providing that number in connection with his application for a gym membership.
we do not question,in this appeal from an order of the district court,the validity of the fcc interpretation of prior express consent.see mais gulf coast collection bureau,cir.us commc ns,jennings,cir.we read the order in a way that harmonizes with the tcpa text and purpose,as well as the fcc other orders and rulings.in our view,an effective consent is one that relates to the same subject matter as is covered by the challenged calls or text messages.
the tcpa was created in response to the ever increasing consumer complaints regarding telemarketing calls.the purpose and history of the tcpa indicate that congress was trying to prohibit the use of automatic dialing to communicate with others by telephone in a manner that would be an invasion of privacy.satterfield,at.taking into account the statutory language that prior consent must be express and the tcpa legislative history,we do not read the order to mean that the fcc has determined that providing a phone number in itself means that the consumer has expressly consented to contact for any purpose whatsoever.instead,the consent must be considered to relate to the type of transaction that evoked it.
to aid the fcc interpretation of prior express consent in its order,the fcc cited a house of representatives report on the tcpa,which stated t
