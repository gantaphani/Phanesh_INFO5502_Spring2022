background 
tci is a cable operator with a franchise area in south central connecticut.like other cable operators,tci distributes cable programming to residents in its franchise area for a monthly fee that varies depending upon the extent of programming the subscriber purchases.tci offers basic and expanded basic packages and,for an additional monthly fee,access to premium channels,such as home box office hbo,cinemax,and showtime.tci also offers programming,which allows subscribers to pay for access to a particular film,sporting event,or music concert.
tci receives programming for premium channels and special events by means of satellite.tci gathers the programming through a cluster of antennas referred to as a head end.tci then develops a channel by using modulators to tune the signals to particular frequencies.the programming is sent to tci customers by means of a coaxial ground cable.
the principal means by which tci prevents unauthorized viewing of its cable programming is to transmit the programming to its customers by means of electronically coded scrambled signals.when individuals subscribe for cable services,tci provides them with electronic decoding equipment,referred to as addressable converters,which attach to their television monitors.tci controls the addressable converters from its central offices to permit viewing in descrambled form of only the programming for which subscribers have paid.
in july,the fbi seized the computer of robert radil,who operated a business involving the manufacture,assembly,sale,and installation of illicit cable descramblers.radil devices descramble cable programming,enabling those who install the devices to have free and unlimited access to premium channels and movies and special events.the devices are,meaning that tci can not detect the unauthorized viewing from its central offices.
radil recorded on his computer files the details of the orders and delivery of the descrambler devices he sold.culling the names of customers from radil computer files and checking with the telephone company and the department of motor vehicles,the fbi compiled a master list of names,addresses,and telephone numbers of radil customers fbi list.
tci obtained the fbi list and in july,commenced this action,requesting injunctive and monetary relief under a and a against alleged purchasers of radil descramblers.as to all but seven defendants,the claims were disposed of by settlement,default judgment,or dismissal.

discussion 
i.the applicable statutory provision 
the appellants contend that judge thompson erred in holding them liable under.they assert that the applicable statutory provision is.section a provides 
no person not being entitled thereto shall receive or assist in receiving any interstate or foreign communication by radio and use such communication or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto.
section a provides 
no person shall intercept or receive or assist in intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a cable system,unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.
the appellants contend that because section concerns radio communication and section more specifically concerns cable system s,the latter provision,with its arguably more lenient consequences for violators should apply.
this court has previously ruled that section applies in cases involving the sale of descrambling devices as long as the head end of the cable system at issue receives at least some radio transmissions.international cablevision,sykes sykes ii,cir.two circuits have disagreed with this view,see tkr cable cable city,cir united states norris,cir,but we are bound by sykes ii.judge thompson determined that tci cable service involves radio and satellite transmissions.caruso,d at.although section could be applied as an alternative to section,the district court was entitled to assess damages under the latter provision.sykes ii,at international cablevision,sykes sykes i,cir.
ii.the amount of damages 
the appellants allege that the district court erred in assessing against each of them the maximum damages a
