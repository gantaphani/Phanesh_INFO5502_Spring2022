background 
the telecommunications act of the act fundamentally restructure d local telephone markets.states may no longer enforce laws that impede competition,and incumbent lecs are subject to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.iowa utilities,d.one such duty is the lec obligation to share its network with competitors.id.a competitor can access an lec network by purchasing the lec services at wholesale rates leasing particular elements of the lec network,such as the local loop,switch,or transport trunk or interconnect ing its own facilities with the incumbent network.id.another duty imposed upon lecs is that of providing number portability.lecs are required to provide to the extent technically feasible,number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the commission.b.
number portability is the ability of users of telecommunications services to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality,reliability,or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.id.number portability is essential to meaningful competition in the provision of local exchange services.first report and order.however,as the commission observes in its brief,t he need to port numbers does not arise in all forms of competitive entry.if a new entrant does not operate its own separate local exchange switch for example,if a new entrant merely resells the telephone services of an incumbent,a customer can change providers without changing its phone number.resp.br.at.thus,an lec is required to port numbers only when a customer switches service to a new telecommunications service provider that operates its own switch.
in accordance with b,the commission required a ll lecs to provide a database method for number portability in the largest msas by december,in accordance with the deployment schedule,in switches for which another carrier has made a specific request for the provision of number portability.b accord first report and order.after december,lecs are required to deploy number portability in switches in the largest msas for which no request was previously made and in all other msas which we refer to as smaller msas upon request b iv,c accord first report and order first reconsideration order.until the deployment of number portability,a ll lecs shall provide transitional number portability measures as soon as reasonably possible upon receipt of a specific request from another telecommunications carrier a accord first report and order.
the act also requires that t he cost of number portability be borne by all telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral basis as determined by the commission.e.the commission did not actually make such a determination.rather,the commission first defined the phrase competitively neutral,to mean that the cost of number portability borne by each carrier should not affect significantly any carrier ability to compete with other carriers for customers in the marketplace.first report and order.the commission then set forth two criteria that a state cost recovery mechanisms must satisfy to ensure competitively neutral cost allocation.first,the mechanism must not g ive one telecommunications carrier an appreciable,incremental cost advantage over another telecommunications carrier,when competing for a specific subscriber.a accord first report and order.second,the mechanism must not h ave a disparate effect on the ability of competing telecommunications carriers to earn a normal return on their investment.b accord first report and order.in setting forth these criteria,however,the commission left to the states the determination of the exact cost recovery mechanism to be utilized.fourth reconsideration order accord.
the commission did,however,articulate four cost recovery mechanisms that,if adopted by a state regulatory body,would ensure competitively neutral allocation of interim number portability costs.three of these mechanisms,some of which various states had already adopted,allocated costs according to each carrier market share as determined by the carrier number of ported numbers,telephone numbers or lines,or gross revenue.first report and order.the fourth mechanism,and the one with which qwest particularly takes issue,require d each carrier to pay for its own costs of currently available number portability measures accord fourth report and order.
in its petition for review of the orders,qwest argues that the commission failure to create a federal recovery mechanism for costs associated with the provision of interim number portability violated e,and constituted an unconstitutional taking by the federal government.because qwest lacks standing to challenge the orders as they pertain to msas in which qwest has deployed number portability,and because qwest petition is not ripe as it pertains to msas in which qwest has not deployed portability,we do not reach the merits of qwest petition.
discussion 
msas in which qwest has deployed number portability standing 
although subsequent to briefing the commission has withdrawn its argument that qwest lacks standing to bring its petition,we consider the issue sua sponte in examining our own jurisdiction.skrzypczak kauger,cir we are obliged to address standing sua sponte because it involves a constitutional limitation on a federal court jurisdiction,and federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction.internal quotations and citations omitted.to establish standing under article iii of the constitution,a plaintiff must demonstrate among other things an injury in harm that is both concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,d internal quotations and citation omitted.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing th is element.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.standing must exist throughout the litigation.in re yellow cab.ass n,cir.
qwest has not established that it has suffered injury in fact in any of the msas in which it has deployed number portability because qwest has failed to demonstrate that a state required qwest to port any telephone numbers in those msas.in fact,some seven months after number portability mechanisms were to be deployed in the largest msas in which a request for number portability had been made,the commission found that petitioners including qwest have not shown the actual impact of the guidelines based on state orders and that there was no rate order under which the impact of the cost recovery guidelines could be evaluated fourth report and order accord pet.br.at including qwest within the class of petitioners that asserted the takings claim before the commission.one district court has upheld the oregon public utility commission decision to require qwest to bear its own costs in oregon,but that court also noted that there was n o evidence presented to show that worldcom has purchased any services pursuant to this agreement,nor is there any assurance that it ever will.us west communications,worldcom technologies,d,hereinafter us west.absent any evidence that qwest was required to port telephone numbers in msas in which it has deployed number portability,we decline to consider whether the orders as they pertain to the provision of interim number portability in thos
