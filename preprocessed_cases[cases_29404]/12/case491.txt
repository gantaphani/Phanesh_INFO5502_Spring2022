factual and procedural background 
the facts in this case,spanning ten years of european business transactions and litigation,could be difficult to follow.therefore,we relate here only those facts essential to the disposition of this appeal 
i.the battle for control of polska telefonia 
in,both deutschland and vivendi took an interest in the polish wireless telephone company,polska telefonia cyfrowa sp.z polska telefonia.at the time,polish law precluded foreign investors from holding more than of the shares of any polish telecommunications company the german company deutschland,which at the time held a interest in polska telefonia,acquired an additional interest from other shareholders,for a total of.
while deutschland was buying up shares,so was vivendi,a french corporation.to facilitate its intended takeover of polska telefonia,vivendi partnered with a polish company,elektrim vivendi and elektrim established a joint venture that operated through a holding company called telco.over time,vivendi invested billion to acquire a interest in telco.pursuant to the joint venture agreement,elektrim transferred its interest in polska telefonia to telco,along with an additional interest it acquired from other shareholders,for a total of of the polska telefonia stock.
on december,deutschland initiated arbitration against elektrim in vienna.deutschland claimed that elektrim transfer of its shares to telco materially breached polska telefonia shareholder agreement the shareholder agreement bound all polska telefonia shareholders and provided certain shareholders,including deutschland,the option to buy the shares of any shareholder who materially breached the agreement.
in,while the arbitration was pending,solorz purchased a controlling interest in elektrim,which at the time held a joint venturer interest in telco polska telefonia shares.vivendi alleges that solorz secretly agreed to help deutschland gain control of polska telefonia.to this end,elektrim terminated its joint venture agreement with vivendi vivendi and elektrim,however,retained their joint ownership of telco.
on november,the vienna arbitration panel held that elektrim transfer of its shares to telco was ineffective because elektrim transferred its shares to telco without the consent of all of the members of polska telefonia board of directors,as required by the polska telefonia shareholder agreement.the panel further held that,if elektrim did not recover its shares from telco within two months,elektrim would be in material breach of the shareholder agreement,thus triggering deutschland options to buy elektrim shares.a warsaw regional court granted elektrim petition for recognition of the arbitral award.
relying on this recognition order,deutschland and elektrim took over the polska telefonia management board.elektrim and deutschland then secured an order from the warsaw regional court changing the polish government official share register to show elektrim alone,and not vivendi,as the owner of the telco shares.
in february,everest,a company,purchased elektrim bonds.by this time,however,vivendi alleged solorz used his controlling interest in elektrim to begin stripping elektrim of its assets.elektrim failed to make required payments on the bonds,and the trustee for the bonds filed a petition in polish court to put elektrim into bankruptcy to prevent solorz from further reducing elektrim assets.the bankruptcy court issued an injunction barring any transfer of elektrim polska telefonia shares 
by may,elektrim had failed to recover its polska telefonia shares from telco,so deutschland again initiated arbitration in vienna.this time,deutschland sought a declaration that it was entitled to exercise its option to buy elektrim shares.while the arbitration was pending,deutsche telekom approached vivendi,offering to negotiate an agreement that would allow vivendi to recoup much of its billion investment in polska telefonia before any agreement was reached,the vienna arbitration panel held that deutschland could exercise its option to buy elektrim shares.
on august,despite the polish bankruptcy court injunction barring elektrim from transferring its polska telefonia shares,elektrim transferred its shares to deutschland for over million euros.in light of the influx of cash to elektrim,the trustee for the bonds withdrew the bankruptcy petition.this allowed solorz to resume stripping elektrim assets,which prevented everest from maximizing the value of the bonds 
vivendi has initiated at least twenty litigation and arbitration actions across europe to recover its investment in polska telefonia.
ii.the instant litigation 
on october,vivendi filed a complaint against and solorz in the district court for the western district of washington.filed a motion to dismiss based on,among other grounds,forum non conveniens on may.
less than two weeks after filed its motion to dismiss,vivendi holding acquired from everest its elektrim bonds and all claims relating to the bonds.vivendi then sought leave to amend its complaint to add vivendi holding as a plaintiff.the district court granted vivendi motion to amend its complaint,and vivendi filed its third amended complaint on august.again filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,as did solorz.the district court held a hearing on the motions,and,on june,the district court dismissed vivendi complaint on forum non conveniens grounds,concluding that poland was an adequate alternative forum vivendi timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review claims of error in a trial court forum non conveniens dismissal for clear abuse of discretion.ravelo monegro rosa,cir.a district court may abuse its discretion by relying on an erroneous view of the law,by relying on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or by striking an unreasonable balance of relevant factors.id.
to grant a motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,a district court must determine whether an adequate alternative forum exists,and whether the balance of private and public interest factors favors dismissal.lueck sundstrand,cir citing piper aircraft reyno,d.vivendi contends the district court abused its discretion by affording insufficient deference to vivendi choice of forum and by unreasonably balancing the public and private interest factors.
i.the district court did not err by granting little deference to vivendi choice of forum.
vivendi contends the district court gave insufficient deference to its choice of forum.under our law,foreign plaintiffs are entitled to less deference than are plaintiffs who file suit in their home forums.see piper,at.vivendi,a french company,filed this action related to european transactions in a forum far from its home.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it afforded vivendi choice of forum little deference.
moreover,this court review of a district court forum non conveniens determination is highly deferential.see id.at.it may be reversed only where there has been a clear abuse of discretion.in
