laci satterfield,individually and on behalf of those similarly situated,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of simon schuster,and ipsh satterfield alleges a violation of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa,arising after satterfield received an unsolicited text message.we hold that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the equipment used by simon schuster has the capacity to both store or produce numbers to be called using a random or sequential number generator and to dial such numbers.giving deference to the federal communications commission fcc,see chevron natural res.def.council,d,we hold that it is reasonable to interpret call under the tcpa to include both voice calls and text messages.we also conclude that simon schuster is not an affiliate or brand of nextones and therefore satterfield did not expressly consent to receive this text message from simon schuster.accordingly,we reverse the district court and remand.

simon schuster sent the text message as part of its promotional campaign for the steven king novel cell.simon schuster outsourced the promotional campaign to ipsh,who obtained a list of individuals cell phone numbers from mobile information access company mia.mia was nextones exclusive agent for licensing the numbers of nextones subscribers.

ii.discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine and disputed issues of material fact remain,and when,viewing the evidence most favorably to the nonmoving party,the movant is clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law.
the tcpa provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person within the united states,or any person outside the united states if the recipient is within the united states 
a to make any call other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice 
iii to any telephone number assigned to a paging service,cellular telephone service,specialized mobile radio service,or other radio common carrier service,or any service for which the called party is charged for the call 
a definitions 
as used in this section 
the term automatic telephone dialing system means equipment which has the capacity 
a to store or produce telephone numbers to be called,using a random or sequential number generator and 
b to dial such numbers 
reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,nolan heald college,cir,we hold that the district court erred,because a there was a disputed issue of material fact as to whether the system simon schuster used was an atds b the text message was a call within the meaning of the tcpa and c satterfield did not consent to the receipt of such a message,because simon schuster is not an affiliate or brand of nextones.
a.the atds 
the district court erred in holding that there was no genuine and disputed issue of material fact as to whether the system simon schuster used was an atds.the district court focused its analysis on whether the equipment used by simon schuster stored,produced,or called numbers using a random or sequential number generator.the district court even noted that the parties dispute centers on the phrase using a random or sequential number generator.with this as its focus,the district court held that the equipment here does not store,produce or call randomly or sequentially generated telephone numbers,the court grants summary judgment in the defendants favor the equipment at issue is not an automatic telephone dialing system under the tcpa.we find that the district court focused its analysis on the wrong issue in its determination of what constitutes an atds.
in construing the provisions of a statute,we first look to the language of the statute to determine whether it has a plain meaning.mcdonald sun oil,cir.the preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.thus,our inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.id.quoting bedroc,llc united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.reviewing this statute,we conclude that the statutory text is clear and unambiguous.
when evaluating the issue of whether equipment is an atds,the statute clear language mandates that the focus must be on whether the equipment has the capacity to store or produce telephone numbers to be called,using a random or sequential number generator.accordingly,a system need not actually store,produce,or call randomly or sequentially generated telephone numbers,it need only have the capacity to do it.since the district court did not focus its decision on this issue,we must then review the record to determine if summary judgment may issue.at the hearing,counsel for the parties suggested that the record was not clear regarding that issue.we agree.
reviewing the record,we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether this equipment has the requisite capacity.satterfield expert,randall snyder,opined that this telephone system stored telephone numbers to be called and subsequently dialed those numbers automatically and without human interventi
