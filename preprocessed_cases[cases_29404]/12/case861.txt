qualcomm incorporated qualcomm appeals from a jury determination that qualcomm infringed patents the patent,the patent,and the patent,owned by broadcom corporation broadcom.qualcomm also appeals from the district court issuance of a permanent injunction against qualcomm.because the district court erred in its construction of claim of the patent,we reverse the jury determination of infringement of that patent and conclude that claim,as properly construed,is invalid.because the district court did not err in construing the claims of the patent,and because substantial evidence supports the jury determinations of infringement and validity of the and patents,we affirm the judgment of infringement of the and patents,and the injunction as it pertains to those patents.
background 
broadcom and qualcomm compete in the market for chipsets used in mobile radio devices such as cell phone handsets.the technology at issue in this appeal relates to wireless voice and data communications on cellular telephone networks.the relevant technology is currently found in baseband processor chips.baseband processor chips enable a cell phone basic communication functions,along with other features such as graphics,multimedia,data transfer,and custom applications.the chips sold by broadcom,qualcomm,and others replace older and less capable chips,which include code division multiple access cdma chips and global system for mobile communications gsm chips.the cdma replacement is known as,while the gsm replacement is known as wideband cdma wcdma.these technologies are generally incompatible with each other,and thus both cell phone handsets and cell phone service provider networks are designed to work with only one of these two competing standards.both standards,however,provide enhanced functionality over their predecessors,particularly in the area of multimedia and multiple network products.
the products accused of infringing broadcom patents include baseband chips designed to work in cell phones in conjunction with networks,including both and wcdma,although this appeal primarily relates to chips.also at issue is qualcomm software,which qualcomm has licensed exclusively to sprint.qchat allows the use of ptt technology much like a on networks.although broadcom markets chips,it does not currently sell any chips,it has not sold any wcdma chips for use in united states cell phones,and it does not offer a chip implementing a ptt feature.
broadcom patent relates to video compression technology on cell phone devices.claim,the only claim at issue,depends from claim,and is directed to a digital signal processor dsp.broadcom accused qualcomm wcdma and baseband processor chips of infringing this claim.the patent relates to technology allowing cell phones to simultaneously participate on multiple wireless networks using a single transceiver.the relevant claims on appeal are directed to radio units having transceivers capable of simultaneous participation on multiple rf networks.broadcom asserted that qualcomm chips infringed these claims by interfacing with both the network for traditional voice communications and the network for data and related applications including ptt functionality in qchat.finally,the patent claims a telephone having circuitry allowing it to selectively couple to two networks having different bandwidth characteristics.broadcom asserted the several claims of the patent against qualcomm chips implementing the qchat ptt feature.broadcom argued that that traditional voice calls couple to the telephone network,while calls initiated with the qchat feature are routed through the internet,a distinct network.
the district court issued a claim construction order prior to trial in which it construed the contested terms of broadcom patents pursuant to markman westview instruments,d.broadcom qualcomm,claim construction order.following a trial,the jury found that qualcomm directly infringed and induced infringement of claim of the patent and claims,and of the patent,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents that qualcomm directly infringed,induced infringement of,and contributed to the infringement of claims,and of the patent,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents and that all of these claims were not invalid.the jury further found that qualcomm had willfully infringed all three patents in suit.it awarded damages of approximately million.qualcomm filed motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure or a new trial under rule a.the district court denied relief,denying qualcomm motions in their entirety.broadcom qualcomm,wl,jmol opinion.
ten days after the district court denial of qualcomm motions,this court released its decision in in re seagate technology,llc,en banc.given the potential impact of seagate on the willfulness determination previously made by the jury,the district court sua sponte invited a motion for reconsideration of its denial of qualcomm request for a new trial on willfulness and of its award of enhanced damages.upon considering the arguments presented,the district court vacated the willfulness verdict and directed broadcom to file an election indicating whether it wishe d to accept the liability and damages verdicts or proceed to a new trial on all issues,including willfulness.broadcom qualcomm,slip op.at.broadcom elected to accept the liability and damage verdicts rather than proceed to a new trial on all issues.
the district court then held a bench trial on the topic of injunctive relief and subsequently entered a permanent injunction against qualcomm on all three patents,although it provided sunset provisions allowing continued sales pursuant to a mandatory royalty through january.broadcom qualcomm,injunction opinion.on february,the district court issued an amended injunction,broadcom qualcomm,first amended injunction,and on march,it again amended and the injunction,broadcom qualcomm,second amended injunction.finally,on march,the district court entered judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.broadcom qualcomm.
qualcomm appealed from the first amended injunction,the second amended injunction,and the rule b judgment entering the jury infringement verdicts.we granted unopposed motions to consolidate these three appeals on april,and april.we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the rule b judgment pursuant to a,and we have jurisdiction over the appeals from the interlocutory injunctions pursuant to c.
ii.discussion 
qualcomm presents numerous arguments regarding claim construction,infringement,and validity,as well as various contentions regarding the necessity of a new trial and the propriety of the district court permanent injunction.we address each in turn.
a.the patent 
claim,the only asserted claim of the patent,depends from claim,the patent only independent claim,which recites 
a digital signal processor for processing a multiple frame video digital signal,comprising 
a dsp controller,
a plurality of processing units connected to said dsp controller for processing said multiple frame video digital signal and at least one storage unit,wherein each of said processing units is connected to at least one of said at least one storage units,said dsp controller controlling said plurality of processing units,wherein said dsp controller,said plurality of processing units,and said at least one storage unit are on a single chip.
dependent claim additionally recites t he digital signal processor according to claim wherein each of said processing units operates according to a different program command.although the claims make no reference to a global controller,the district court construed the claim term dsp controller controlling said plurality of processing units as follows the dsp controller,either independently or under the direction of a global controller,distributes control instructions to be executed by the plurality of processing units.a global controller is required.at emphasis added.it is undisputed that the texas instruments chip and its documentation chip would invalidate claim as an anticipatory reference if the claim is construed not to include a global controller limitation.
qualcomm contends that the district court improperly imported the global controller limitation into claim and,thus,claim of the patent and that the chip anticipates this claim.qualcomm argues that the claim language is directed solely to dsps,and that the specification and figures of the patent clearly distinguish between dsps and global controllers.qualcomm had argued that the dsp controller term should be construed as u nder the direction of a global controller,the dsp controller controls units that process data.at.broadcom responds that the district court merely construed the claim terms in light of the specification,which discusses how the g lobal controller controls and schedules the digital signal processor,patent,and that to ignore the global controller would render claim invalid even with respect to generic prior art discussed in the specification.claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo.cybor fas,en banc.
we agree with qualcomm.there is no basis for importing the global controller limitation into claim.the claims make no reference to an external global controller,and we find no justification for adding limitations related to the more general video encoding device discussed in the specification when the claims are written to encompass only a specific element of that device.the claims recite only three dsp elements,including a dsp controller,a plurality of processing units,and at least one storage unit.patent.the specification similarly provides that the dsp includes only these three components,id.the digital signal processor includes a dsp controller,a plurality of processing units,and at least one storage unit the dsp controller controls the plurality of processing units.the illustrations provided in the specification further bolster our conclusion that the global controller is separate and distinct from the dsp.for example,figure,reproduced below,places the global controller outside of the lines defining the dsp.
figure similarly illustrates the global controller as lying outside the bounds of the dsp.figures and also identify the global controller and the digital signal processor as discrete and separate components.
while the specification does contemplate the possibility of a global controller,the claims of the patent are directed solely to the dsp.as this court has noted,each claim does not necessarily cover every feature disclosed in the specification.when the claim addresses only some of the features disclosed in the specification,it is improper to limit the claim to other,unclaimed features.ventana med,biogenex.while the patent claims only the dsp,it is a continuation of another the same issued as patent the patent.the patent has two independent claims.one claims a video encoding system including a video encoding device the video encoding device comprising a global controller and a digital signal processor,connected to said global controller.patent claim.the other claims a video camera comprising a video encoding device comprising a global controller and a digital signal processor,connected to said global controller.id.claim.while the global controller limitation influences the scope of the patent claims,we find no basis for importing it to the dsp claims of the patent.
broadcom also contends that the claim can not be construed without the global controller limitation because claim otherwise would be based on generic prior art disclosed in the specification.broadcom points to figure of the prior art to support this argument.
a patent is invalid as anticipated if every limitation in a claim is found in a single prior art reference.nystrom trex.because broadcom has not demonstrated that every limitation of claim is found in this reference,its argument must fail.for example,broadcom does not even allege that the generic prior art dsp referenced in the patent is implemented on a single chip as required by the claims.moreover,w hile we have acknowledged the maxim that claims should be construed to preserve their validity,we have not applied that principle broadly instead,we have limited the maxim to cases in which the court concludes,after applying all the available tools of claim construction,that the claim is still ambiguous.phillips awh,en banc internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also tate access floors,interface architectural,noting that where claim language is clear we must accord it full breadth even if the result is a claim that is clearly invalid.
accordingly,we modify the district court claim construction to remove the requirement of a global controller,reverse the jury verdict of infringement as to the patent,and hold claim invalid as anticipated by the chip.see akamai,cable wireless internet.
b.the patent 
the jury found that qualcomm infringed claims,and of the patent.these claims do not meaningfully differ for purposes of this appeal.claim recites,with disputed terms emphasized 
a radio unit for operation in a communication system having a plurality of rf communication networks comprising 
a transceiver capable of participating on the plurality of rf communication networks 
a memory device which stores a plurality of communication protocols,each communication protocol governing radio operation on one of the plurality of rf communication networks 
a control processor coupled to the transceiver and the memory device,the control processor selecting from the memory device ones of the plurality of communication protocols to enable the transceiver to simultaneously participate on corresponding ones of the plurality of rf communication networks and 
the control processor managing the simultaneous use by the transceiver of the selected ones of the plurality of communication protocols.
qualcomm argues that the district court improperly construed the simultaneously participate limitation in all of the relevant claims of the patent,that there is no evidence of infringement under a correct construction,and that the patent is invalid under the district court claim construction.it also argues that the district court erred in not construing the networks limitation,and that substantial evidence does not support the jury infringement verdict under a correct construction.
simultaneously participate 
claims,and of the patent all require a radio unit with a transceiver that can simultaneously participate on two or more wireless networks.the district court construed this claim term as t aking part in communications with two or more networks either actively or in during the same period of time.claim construction order at emphasis added.qualcomm argues,as it did to the district court,that simultaneously participate requires the claimed transceiver to be capable of communicating on multiple networks at the same instant in time.broadcom defends the district court claim construction as supported by the specification,which it contends distinguishes between simultaneous and fully simultaneous.
the district court reasoned that because the patent claims a radio unit with a single transceiver,and because a single transceiver can not achieve full communication with two networks at the same time,qualcomm construction could mean that the patent would not perform its stated function.accordingly,the court agree d with broadcom that the construction during the same period of time most accurately construes the meaning of the term simultaneous.claim construction order at see cordis medtronic ave,noting that a construction that renders the claimed invention inoperable should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
the claim language itself provides little insight as to the meaning of simultaneous,and each party argues that the specification supports its own interpretation.qualcomm contends that the specification distinguishes between simultaneous participation,for communications taking place at the same instant in time,and multiple participation,for interleaved communications taking place over the same period of time.see,patent although the use of a plurality of radio transceivers could be used so as to permit simultaneous participation by a single device,factors of cost,size,power and weight make it desirable to only a single radio transceiver capable of multiple participation.broadcom argues that the specification distinguishes between simultaneous or multiple participation and fully simultaneous participation,and that only the latter denotes communications taking place at the same instant in time.see,id.in communication environments wherein fully simultaneous participation does not exist or is not desired,transmitter circuitry might be shared for participation in both networks.we do not find these arguments to be helpful because the use of these terms in the specification is inconsistent at best.
we turn then to figure of the patent,as reproduced below,which has been at the center of much debate,both at the district court and on appeal.
the block labeled represents an instance of two networks,represented as timelines and,seeking to communicate with the same device at the same time.the specification discussion pertaining to block provides the following block illustrates a situation where the master encounters a communication conflict if the master has two radio transceivers,the master can service both networks.if,however,the master only has one radio transceiver,the master chooses to service one network based on network priority considerations.id.while this language indicates that multiple transceivers may be used to avoid such conflict and the attendant interleaving process,the specification as a whole repeatedly clarifies that the invention is directed to wireless communications solutions utilizing a single transceiver.for example,in the section labeled technical field,the specification states that t he present invention relates generally to local area networks used for transmitting and receiving information and more particularly to a singular radio using multiple communication protocols for servicing corresponding multiple radio local area networks.id.emphasis added.moreover,as the district court noted,both parties concede that the patent discloses a device with one transceiver.claim construction order at.based on this context,we agree with the district court that the claim term simultaneous participation refers to interleaved communications.
because qualcomm only argues that there can be no infringement under its proposed construction,but does not argue under the district court construction,we affirm the jury infringement verdict.
qualcomm further argues,however,that even under the district court construction of simultaneously participate,it introduced a prior art reference that anticipates the relevant claims of the patent.that reference,patent burson,discloses a system allowing a telephone to operate in both cordless and cellular networks.while the parties dispute whether or not this reference discloses simultaneous participation in these different networks,broadcom additionally argued at trial that it could antedate the burson reference,and thus that burson is not prior art capable of anticipating the patent.specifically,broadcom argued that the september lab notebook of a deceased inventor,ronald mahany,demonstrated conception of the claimed invention,and that this invention was constructively reduced to practice in may and november patent applications.if true,these facts permit broadcom to antedate the burson reference,which was filed in december to both the lab notebook and the patent applications.see generally mahurkar bard.having been presented with the deceased inventor lab notebook,the patent applications,and the testimony of a,a coworker,and broadcom expert,the jury rejected qualcomm invalidity contentions.
qualcomm argues that neither the lab notebook nor the patent applications disclose every limitation of the asserted claims.qualcomm relies on our recent holding in poweroasis,usa,holding that once a defendant established prior art anticipating the asserted claims,the burden was on the patentee to come forward with evidence to the contrary,and argues that broadcom failed to carry its burden at trial in demonstrating entitlement to a filing date prior to that of the burson reference.we disagree.the record shows that broadcom expert provided detailed testimony at trial explaining his basis for concluding that each limitation of the accused claims was present in the lab notebook,and that he had gone through the same analysis with respect to the patent applications.see at.although qualcomm focuses on the patent applications on appeal,it failed to ask broadcom expert any questions about these applications at trial,and its own expert did not testify on the subject.indeed,in rejecting qualcomm motions,the district court noted that broadcom witnesses presented an unrebutted picture of mahany conception at least as early as september based on mahany notebooks and constructive reductions to practice in may.jmol opinion at emphasis added.therefore,based on the unrebutted evidence of record,we affirm the jury verdict that the burson reference does not invalidate the patent as an anticipatory reference.see johnston ivac,noting that a ttorneys argument is no substitute for evidence.
qualcomm further argues that the district court erroneously failed to construe the term networks and thus left an issue of claim construction to the jury.see micro int l beyond innovation tech,when the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a claim term,it is the court duty to resolve it.qualcomm contends that network should be construed as a plurality of network devices,rather than protocols,and that no substantial evidence supports a finding of infringement because and are not separate networks,but merely distinct protocols.broadcom responds that qualcomm waived this argument by not presenting it to the district court until after the jury had returned a verdict.qualcomm first raised this argument in its motions,and the district court held that qualcomm waived any claimed error by virtue of its failure to offer a proposed construction at or prior to trial.jmol opinion at citing abbott labs.syntron bioresearch.
we agree that qualcomm can not be allowed to create a new claim construction dispute following the close of the jury trial.a party may not introduce new claim construction arguments on appeal or alter the scope of the claim construction positions it took below.moreover,litigants waive their right to present new claim construction disputes if they are raised for the first time after trial.conoco,energy envtl.int l,internal citations omitted.qualcomm attempt to litigate a newly minted claim construction controversy falls squarely within our holding in eli lilly company aradigm corporation,where a party never requested that the district court construe any terms in the relevant claim and never offered a construction of that claim,but rather o nly after the presentation of all of the evidence to the jury even suggest ed that claim construction might be helpful to determine the proper scope of the claimed invention.as in eli lilly,we hold that qualcomm has waived its right to request a construction of networks and that qualcomm has thereby implicitly conceded that the meanings of networks is clear and not in need of construction.id.qualcomm reliance on our recent holding in micro is misplaced.unlike in micro,where the parties disputed the proper construction of a term at a markman hearing,at,qualcomm here has failed to offer its proposed construction of networks at or prior to trial,and we reject such arguments raised for the first time after the jury verdict.
c.the patent 
qualcomm also argues that substantial evidence does not support the jury verdict of infringement with respect to the patent.the jury found that qualcomm directly infringed,induced infringement of,and contributed to the infringement of claims,and of the patent.claim is representative and recites,with the relevant portion emphasized 
a telephone for use with a first network having a predetermined allocated bandwidth and a second network having a variable bandwidth,the telephone comprising an interface circuit that selectively couples to the first and second networks,the first and second networks operating substantially independent of one another 
a user interface 
processing circuitry,coupled to the user interface and the interface circuit,that directs the interface circuit to select one of the first and second networks 
a microphone capable of being selectively coupled to the first and second networks via the interface circuit and 
an analog to digital converter that is coupled by the interface circuit between the microphone and the second network under the control of the processing circuitry when the second network is selected 
wherein the processing circuitry responds to the user interface to determine which of the first and second networks to select.
the accused products include cell phones with the qchat ptt feature.using this technology,cell phone users can choose to either place a regular voice call,which is routed to the public switched telephone network pstn through the network,or they may use the,which routes calls through the internet using the network when the user pushes a separate qchat button on the phone.this qchat ptt feature allows the cell phone to be used like a.at trial,broadcom successfully argued that these facts demonstrate that users of these phones selectively couple to the pstn and the first and second networks for purposes of this patent.
on appeal,qualcomm argues that allegedly infringing cell phones using the qchat software do not selectively couple to either the pstn or to the internet because these phones do not couple to any network through a physical electrical connection,but rather communicate wirelessly and exclusively with the infrastructure through either the or protocols.according to qualcomm,it is then the network equipment that selectively couples with either the pstn or the internet.it contends that because the claims require an interface circuit that selectively couples to both networks,and because the circuits inside the cell phones only prepare data and voice packets for transmission,there can be no infringement.
broadcom responds that the circuitry in the phone is the beginning of the electrical pathway to either network the pstn or the internet and that the presence of intermediaries between the cell phone and the destination networks should not affect infringement because the patent does not require a direct connection.it further notes that the patent itself explicitly contemplates the use of wireless networks.see,patent noting that this invention relates to the intelligent routing of packetized voice communication between telephones and radio terminals through wireless and hardwired channels in a data processing network emphasis added id.an object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus wherein seamless voice and data communication is provided among both roaming devices within wireless portions of a communication network and stationary devices within hardwired portions of the network.emphasis added.even if the claims required a direct or physical connection,however,broadcom also argues that it presented substantial evidence of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
the term selectively couples was not construed by the district court because the parties agreed to let the ordinary meaning control.infringement was presented to a jury,whose verdict we review for substantial evidence.see dawn equip.farms.in reviewing factual issues for substantial evidence,the inquiry is whether a reasonable jury,given the record before it viewed as a whole,could have arrived at the conclusion it did.id.here,the jury was presented with more than adequate evidence upon which it could have concluded that phones incorporating qualcomm qchat software included an interface circuit that selectively couples to either the pstn or the internet.undisputed testimony at trial established that phones using the qchat software distinguish between digitalized voice data being sent to the pstn and to the internet by packaging data into voice frames for traditional phone calls over the pstn or by packing this data into voice packets for transmission over the internet,at.it is further undisputed that the chip differentiates between voice frames and voice packets in determining which network to communicate with.jmol opinion at.qualcomm own expert admitted that t here is an interface circuit inside the phone,so the interface circuit inside the phone itself does this framing or packetizing,and sends it out over a single air interface using two different protocols.at.broadcom expert explained to the jury that s elective coupling does mean that it has to be directly connected it just means that the coupling is electrically prepared within that interface circuit so that by the time the work of the network begins they can go to a proper destination.id.at.
although broadcom expert stated that selectively couple means connected electrically,that is,that t here is an electrical pathway to either the first or the second network,id at,he also testified that the coupling does mean that it has to attach the sic connect physically right next to each other,id.at.he further testified that the interface circuit is within the phone and that it is electrically coupled to the first and the second network where these networks are the pstn and the internet.id.taken as a whole,this record provides substantial evidence to support a reasonable jury conclusion that qualcomm infringed the patent.
in so holding,we reject qualcomm additional contentions that broadcom has presented a claim construction in contravention of our holding in company mustek systems,incorporated.as we discussed in connection with the network limitation of the patent,supra,we agree that where the parties and the district court elect to provide the jury only with the claim language itself,and do not provide an interpretation of the language in the light of the specification and the prosecution history,it is too late at the jmol stage to argue for or adopt a new and more detailed interpretation of the claim language and test the jury verdict by that new and more detailed interpretation,at.unlike the patentee in,however,broadcom has not argued for a new claim interpretation.the evidence shows that users of the qchat feature press a specific button for the express purpose of establishing a ptt connection with another user.in doing so,qchat users expressly choose whether to connect through the internet using the ptt feature,or to place traditional voice calls through the pstn.qualcomm has not provided convincing evidence that the ordinary meaning of selectively couples requires a direct or physical connection,and the jury was entitled to credit the substantial evidence discussed above,as general as it may be,in rendering a verdict in favor of broadcom.
qualcomm argues that the jury instructions,which prompted the district court to set aside the willfulness verdict based essentially on qualcomm not having obtained opinion letters,also require us to overturn the indirect infringement verdicts predicated on specific intent necessary to find inducement under dsu medical corporation jms company,en banc in relevant part.qualcomm contends that it did not obtain opinions because it had procured invalidity opinions for each relevant patent,although it elected not to waive privilege and rely on those opinions.qualcomm also argues that the indirect infringement verdicts are unsupported by substantial evidence.in the event we accept these contentions,qualcomm further asserts that we must vacate the damages awards related to the and patents because the damages were based solely on indirect infringement activities.finally,it argues that because damages and infringement issues have interwoven factual underpinnings,retrial should be permitted with respect to all issues.
broadcom responds that the district court emphasized the same dsu specific intent standard on which qualcomm relies,and that the disputed instructions regarding letters properly identified such evidence as one factor to consider within the totality of the circumstances.broadcom contends that letters remain relevant to the intent inquiry of our inducement precedent,and that seagate addressed neither the admissibility of evidence concerning an alleged infringer failure to obtain opinions,nor the standard for establishing intent to induce infringement.broadcom further argues that circumstantial evidence in the record provides substantial evidence to support the jury verdict of induced infringement.
legal standards given to the jury are reviewed without deference to the trial court,whereas the jury resolution of factual disputes are reviewed to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support them.dawn,at.this court reviews the legal sufficiency of jury instructions on an issue of patent law without deference to the district court.this court reviews jury instructions in their entirety and only orders a new trial when errors in the instructions as a whole clearly mislead the jury.dsu,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we turn first to the legal standard.
in order to prevail on an inducement claim,the patentee must establish first that there has been direct infringement,and second that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage another infringement.acco brands,aba locks mfr,quoting.mining chemque.the relevant standard for establishing the intent element of inducement was clarified by this court in dsu,at en banc in relevant part.in dsu,we upheld a jury instruction providing that t he defendant must have intended to cause the acts that constitute the direct infringement and must have known or should have known tha t its action would cause the direct infringement.id.at.in so doing,we held that inducement requires evidence of culpable conduct,directed to encouraging another infringement,not merely that the inducer had knowledge of the direct infringer activities.id.at citing studios,grokster,d.we further noted that t he plaintiff has the burden of showing that the alleged infringer actions induced infringing acts and that he knew or should have known his actions would induce actual infringements.dsu,at quoting manville sales paramount.
in this case,the district court instructed the jury,inter alia,as follows 
in order to establish active inducement of infringement,it is not sufficient that the company that is allegedly induced to infringe itself directly infringes the claim.nor is it sufficient that qualcomm was aware of the act s that allegedly constitute the direct infringement.rather you must find that qualcomm specifically intended to cause direct infringement of the,patents,in order to find inducement of infringement.that is,you must find qualcomm is aware of the patent,knows or should have known that the encouraged acts constitute infringement of the patent,and has an intent to cause the encouraged acts.
at emphases added.this instruction is entirely consistent with our guidance in dsu.qualcomm objects,however,to the instruction that followed it 
when considering whether qualcomm knew of should have known that the induced actions would constitute infringement,in the totality of the circumstances,you may consider all of the circumstances,including whether or not qualcomm obtained the advice of a competent lawyer.i will explain the significance of advice of counsel in more detail in a moment.
id.at emphasis added.following this instruction,the district court instructed the jury as to contributory infringement,and then,in the context of instructions pertaining to willfulness,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
in considering whether qualcomm acted in good faith,you should consider all the circumstances,including whether or not qualcomm obtained and followed the advice of a competent lawyer with regard to infringement.the absence of a lawyer opinion,by itself,is insufficient to support a finding of willfulness,and you may not assume that merely because a party did not obtain an opinion of counsel,the opinion would have been unfavorable.however,you may consider whether qualcomm sought a legal opinion as one factor in assessing whether,under the totality of the circumstances,any infringement by qualcomm was willful.
id.at emphasis added.this instruction comports with our holding in systeme fuer nutzfahrzeuge,gmbh dana,where we held that there is not a legal duty upon a potential infringer to consult with counsel,such that failure to do so will provide an inference or evidentiary presumption that such opinion would have been negative,en banc.
qualcomm argues,however,that the district court erred in allowing the inducement verdicts to stand in light of its instruction to consider failure to obtain an opinion of counsel as a factor in determining whether qualcomm had the requisite level of intent to induce infringement of broadcom patents.qualcomm argument essentially rests on the proposition that seagate altered the standard for establishing the intent element of inducement.qualcomm contends that because in seagate we abandon ed the affirmative duty of due care to avoid infringement and reemphasize d that there is no affirmative obligation to obtain opinion of counsel,at,and because specific intent is a stricter standard than the objective recklessness standard adopted in seagate,evidence not probative of willful infringement can not be probative of specific intent to induce infringement.that is,qualcomm argues that evidence is no longer relevant in determining the intent of an alleged infringer in the inducement context.we disagree.
although qualcomm is correct that there is no affirmative duty to seek opinion of counsel regarding infringement,and that it is improper to allow an adverse inference or evidentiary presumption that such an opinion would have been unfavorable,at,it is incorrect in arguing that seagate altered the state of mind requirement for inducement.our en banc holding in dsu remains the relevant authority on that point.despite qualcomm assertion that the intent standard for inducement is higher than that for willful infringement,a lack of culpability for willful infringement does not compel a finding of under an inducement theory.qualcomm argument reflects a misunderstanding of our holding in dsu.
while inducement requires more than just intent to cause the acts that produce direct infringement,and also requires that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage another infringement,dsu,at,this intent may be established through circumstantial evidence,see id.moreover,t he requisite intent to induce infringement may be inferred from all of the circumstances.water techs.calco.additionally,we noted in dsu that this intent may be established where an alleged infringer who knew or should have known his actions would induce actual infringements,is shown to have induced infringing acts through his actions.at emphasis added adopting the same test articulated in manville,at.that is,the affirmative intent to cause direct infringement,required by dsu may be as the jury was instructed in dsu establishing first that the defendant intended to cause the acts that constitute the direct infringement,and second that the defendant kn ew or should have known that its action would cause the direct infringement,dsu,at.because evidence,along with other factors,may reflect whether the accused infringer knew or should have known that its actions would cause another to directly infringe,we hold that such evidence remains relevant to the second prong of the intent analysis.moreover,we disagree with qualcomm argument and further hold that the failure to procure such an opinion may be probative of intent in this context.it would be manifestly unfair to allow evidence to serve an exculpatory function,as was the case in dsu itself,see at,and yet not permit patentees to identify failures to procure such advice as circumstantial evidence of intent to infringe.accordingly,we find no legal error in the district court jury instructions as they relate to inducement.
thus,the district court did not err in instructing the jury to consider all of the circumstances,nor in instructing the jury to one qualcomm sought the advice of counsel as to.to the extent that qualcomm argues that the district court should have stressed other factors relevant to qualcomm intent to induce infringement,it should have s
