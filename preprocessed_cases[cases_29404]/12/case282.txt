the issues in this case are whether a telecommunications carrier is barred by the eleventh amendment from bringing suit in federal district court against a state public service commission under section e of the telecommunications act of,et act or act,for judicial review of whether the commission arbitration determination with respect to an interconnection agreement meets the requirements of of the act and applicable fcc regulations and whether the carrier may bring an action under the ex parte young doctrine in federal court against the individual members of a state public service commission in their official capacities for prospective relief from their arbitration determination contrary to the requirements of of the act and its implementing regulations the district court held that the plaintiff telecommunications carriers were barred by eleventh amendment immunity from bringing such actions and dismissed their suits.we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with the act and the ex parte young doctrine.
in the act congress the states in the regulation of local telecommunications competition with regard to all matters addressed by the act.the act offers state public service commissions the option,however,of approving or rejecting,pursuant to and of the act,any interconnection agreement between carriers adopted by negotiation or arbitration.if the state public service commission declines such offer in any proceeding under the act,the fcc is required to assume the responsibility of acting upon that matter.in a case in which the state public service commission accepts the responsibility offered and makes a determination under the act,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement meets the requirements of and.the act provides that no state court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under the act.
when the louisiana public service commission lpsc accepted congress offer to function as an arbitrator under the act in determining and approving the interconnection agreement in the present case,the regulation of local telecommunications competition and related interconnection agreements was no longer a permissible or lawful activity within the states own powers.when congress bestows a gift or gratuity upon a state of a benefit which can not be obtained by the state own power,congress may attach to the gratuity the condition of a voluntary waiver by the state of its eleventh amendment immunity.consequently,the lpsc voluntarily waived its state immunity when it accepted the congressional offer of a gratuity that was clearly conditioned upon the lpsc amenability to federal suits by private parties under the act and arbitrated the interconnection dispute in the present case 
the lpsc commissioners allegedly determined and approved an interconnection agreement that violates the requirements of the act,and the aggrieved carriers bound by the determination seek prospective injunctive relief against the commissioners in their official capacities to terminate further operation of the agreement against them therefore,the doctrine of ex parte young permits the suit to proceed against the commissioners.
i.the telecommunications act of 
background preemption of state regulatory jurisdiction 
in iowa utilities board,d,the supreme court succinctly described the context and content of the act 
until the,local phone service was thought to be a natural monopoly.states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local service area to a local exchange carrier lec,which owned,among other things,the local loops wires connecting telephones to switches,the switches equipment directing calls to their destinations,and the transport trunks wires carrying calls between switches that constitute a local exchange network.technological advances,however,have made competition among multiple providers of local service seem possible,and congress recently ended the longstanding regime of monopolies.
the act fundamentally restructures local telephone markets.states may no longer enforce laws that impede competition,and incumbent lecs are subject to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.foremost among these duties is the lec obligation under c,supp.ii to share its network with competitors.under this provision,a requesting carrier can obtain access to an incumbent network in three ways it can purchase local telephone services at wholesale rates for resale to end users it can lease elements of the incumbent network on an unbundled basis and it can interconnect its own facilities with the incumbent network.when an entrant seeks access through any of these routes,the incumbent can negotiate an agreement without regard to the duties it would otherwise have under b or c.see a.but if private negotiation fails,either party can petition the state commission that regulates local phone service to arbitrate open issues,which arbitration is subject to and the fcc regulations promulgated thereunder.

the supreme court in iowa utilities reversed on the main point,holding that the fcc has general jurisdiction to implement the act provisions.the court concluded that since congress expressly directed that the act be inserted into the communications act of,and since the act already provides that the fcc may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this act,b,the fcc rulemaking authority extends to implementation of and.we think that the grant in b means what it says the fcc has rulemaking authority to carry out the provisions of this act,which include and,added by the telecommunications act of.id.at.furthermore,the court held that section b of the communications act of,which provides that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply or to give the fcc jurisdiction with respect to intrastate communications service does not change this conclusion because the act clearly applies to intrastate matters.id.at.
significantly for purposes of deciding the eleventh amendment issues in the present case,the court in iowa utilities,in answer to arguments of the dissenters relying on the presumption against preemption of state regulatory power,responded that the act clearly manifested congress intent to supplant traditional state police power regulation of local telecommunications competition 
but the question in this case is not whether the federal government has taken the regulation of local telecommunications competition away from the states.with regard to matters addressed by the act,it unquestionably has.the question is whether the state commissions participation in the administration of the new federal regime is to be guided by regulations.if there is any presumption applicable to this question,it should arise from the fact that a federal program administered by independent state agencies is surpassing strange.the appeals by both justice thomas and justice breyer to what might loosely be called states rights are most peculiar,since there is no doubt,even under their view,that if the federal courts believe a state commission is not regulating in accordance with federal policy they may bring it to heel.this is,at bottom,a debate not about whether the states will be allowed to do their own thing,but about whether it will be the fcc or the federal courts that draw the lines to which they must hew.to be sure,the fcc lines can be even more restrictive than those drawn by the it is hard to spark a passionate states rights debate over that detail.

state sovereign immunity generally 
the eleventh amendment to the constitution of the united states provides the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.further,as long construed by the supreme court,federal judicial power does not extend to suits brought against a state or its agencies by its own citizens.see,puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d edelman jordan,d hans louisiana.the eleventh amendment also bars federal jurisdiction over suits against state officials acting in their official capacities when the state is the real party in interest.see,pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d.
eleventh amendment immunity from suit is not absolute.college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d.congress may authorize a private party to bring a federal court suit against unconsenting states in the exercise of its power to enforce the fourteenth amendment.kimel florida bd.of regents,d college savings,at.citing fitzpatrick bitzer,d.a state may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit.college savings,at.citing clark barnard.additionally,the supreme court has for nearly a century allowed suits against state officials for prospective injunctive relief to end a continuing violation of federal law under the doctrine of ex parte young.
in seminole tribe florida,d,the supreme court held that congress can not abrogate eleventh amendment immunity through the exercise of its article i powers.even when the constitution vests in congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area,the eleventh amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting states.id.at.see college savings,at.consequently,correctly does not contend that congress abrogated the states eleventh amendment immunity by enactment of the act under its article i power to regulate interstate commerce.instead,this case turns on waiver and ex parte young.
the supreme court has long recognized that a state sovereign immunity is a personal privilege which it may waive at its pleasure.college savings,at.quoting clark,at.the decision to waive that immunity,however,is altogether voluntary on the part of the sovereignty.id.quoting beers arkansas,how.generally,the court will find a waiver either if the state voluntarily invokes its jurisdiction,gunter atlantic coast line,or if the state makes a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to the court jurisdiction.college savings,at.quoting great northern life ins.read.
in college savings,the court held that the eleventh amendment immunity of the state education expense board the board,an arm of the state of florida,had not been voluntarily waived by the board alleged false advertising in interstate commerce.at.the petitioner,a new jersey bank,had brought suit against the board alleging unfair competition under the lanham act based on the board alleged false advertising of its tuition savings plans in its brochures and annual reports.the pertinent federal statutes,the trademark remedy clarification act and the lanham act,expressly subjected the states to suits brought under them for false and misleading advertising.
the new jersey bank relied upon parden terminal railway of alabama state docks department,d,in which the supreme court had recognized a not altogether volitional theory,when it permitted employees of a railroad owned and operated by alabama to bring an action under the fela against the state as their employer.although the fela did not refer to the states,the parden court held that,under the facts of that case,the act authorized the fela action against alabama as a common carrier by railroad engaging in commerce between the several states,ed.see college savings,at.even though alabama law expressly disavowed any such waiver,the parden majority held that b y enacting the fela congress conditioned the right to operate a railroad in interstate commerce upon amenability to suit in federal court as provided by the act by thereafter operating a railroad in interstate commerce,alabama must be taken to have accepted that condition and thus to have consented to suit.parden,at.
the supreme court in college savings,however,expressly overruled parden and its experiment as ill conceived.at.the court stated that there is little reason to assume actual consent based upon the state mere presence in a field subject to congressional regulation the most that can be said is that the state has been put on notice that congress intends to subject it to suits brought by individuals,and t hat is very far from concluding that the state made an altogether voluntary decision to waive its immunity.id.at.quoting beers,at.more is required as a reasonable basis for inferring that the state,by engaging in a activity,voluntarily consented to being sued by individuals in federal court based on the federal law.see id.
consequently,the college savings court concluded that a state voluntarily waives its eleventh amendment immunity by engaging in activity subject to congressional regulation only if the state has been put on notice clearly and unambiguously by the federal statute that the state particular conduct or transaction will subject it to federal court suits brought by individuals the state may refrain from engaging in the particular actions without excluding itself from activities otherwise lawfully within its powers and the state elects to engage in the conduct or transaction after such legal notice has been given.see at.these waiver requirements are most clearly illustrated by the court discussion of the fundamental differences between college savings and two prior cases involving constitutionally permissible conditions attached to gratuities offered to the states by congress.
in petty bridge commission,d,the court had held that a bistate commission which had been created pursuant to an interstate compact and which we assumed partook of state sovereign immunity had consented to suit by reason of a suability provision attached to the congressional approval of the compact.college savings,at.and in such cases as south dakota dole,d,the court had held that congress may,in the exercise of its spending power,condition its grant of funds to the states upon their taking certain actions that congress could not require them to take,and that acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the action.college savings,at.
the fundamental difference between the college savings case and the petty and dole cases,as the court cogently pointed out,lies in the distinction between the types of congressional acts involved.in the statutes involved in the latter cases,congress had obtained the states voluntary consent to conditions attached to voluntary waiver of sovereign immunity for an interstate compact in petty,and an increase in the drinking age for federal highway funds in dole.neither gratuity was attainable by the state through lawful activities within the state own powers.in contrast,college savings involved federal statutes that forced a state not altogether voluntary waiver by threat of exclusion from otherwise lawful activity within its power.the court explained 
these cases seem to us fundamentally different from the present one.under the compact clause,art.i,cl,states can not form an interstate compact without first obtaining the express consent of congress the granting of such consent is a gratuity.so also,congress has no obligation to use its spending clause power to disburse funds to the states such funds are gifts.in the present case,however,what congress threatens if the state refuses to agree to its condition is not the denial of a gift or gratuity,but a sanction exclusion of the state from otherwise permissible activity.justice breyer dissent acknowledges the intuitive difference between the two,but asserts that it disappears when the gift that is threatened to be withheld is substantial enough.perhaps so,which is why,in cases involving conditions attached to federal funding,we have acknowledged that the financial inducement offered by congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.dole,supra,at.quoting from chas steward machine davis.in any event,we think where the constitutionally guaranteed protection of the states sovereign immunity is involved,the point of coercion is automatically the voluntariness of waiver what is attached to the refusal to waive is the exclusion of the state from otherwise lawful activity.
for these reasons,we agree with the tenth and seventh circuits conclusion that,after college savings,congress may still obtain a voluntary waiver of a state eleventh amendment immunity,if the waiver can be inferred from the state conduct in accepting a gratuity after being given clear and unambiguous statutory notice that it was conditioned on waiver of immunity.see mci telecommunications illinois bell,cir in college savings,at,the court simply held that states can not constructively waive their immunity by being forced by congress to choose between preserving their sovereign immunity and engaging in an otherwise lawful activity.mci telecommunications pub.serv.comm of utah,cir a constructive waiver is voluntary only where congress threatens a state with the denial of a gift or gratuity if the state refuses to consent to suit in federal court.where congress threatens a state with a sanction if it refuses to consent to suit,then the waiver is no longer freely given.citation omitted.a state voluntary waiver of immunity,inferred from the state acceptance of a congressional gratuity that it was free to decline without loss of any sovereign prerogative,was distinguished by the supreme court in college savings from the type of forced waiver exacted by congress under parden,whereby the state is threatened with the sanction of waiving its immunity if it engages in a regulated enterprise,as really an abrogation of the state immunity prohibited by seminole tribe.illinois bell,at citing college savings,at.as noting that forced waiver and abrogation are the same side of the same coin citing also chavez arte publico press,cir college savings expressly overruled parden and its implied waiver theory.that theory is no longer available to support an article i abrogation of eleventh amendment immunity.
we also join the seventh and tenth circuits in concluding that the act does not potentiate the exaction of a forced waiver of eleventh amendment immunity from the states.see illinois bell,at pub.serv.comm n,at.the act only establishes a basis for a voluntary gratuity induced waiver that states may accept or reject,and it does not require the states as a condition of accepting the gratuity to abandon any lawful activity currently within their powers.illinois bell,at pub.serv.comm n,at.
after passage of the act,regulation of competition among providers of local phone service is no longer within the province of states inherent authority.congress,by enacting the act pursuant to its commerce power,validly preempted the states power to regulate local telecommunications competition.iowa utilities,d with regard to the matters addressed by the act,the federal government unquestionably has taken the regulation of local telecommunications competition away from the states.see also ferc mississippi,d t he commerce power permits congress to the states entirely in the regulation of private utilities.accordingly,congress established a federal system headed by the fcc to regulate local telecommunications competition.the act permissibly offers state regulatory agencies a limited mission,which they may accept or decline to apply federal law and regulations as arbitrators and ancillary regulators within the federal system and on behalf of congress.hodel virginia surface mining reclamation,d thus,congress could constitutionally have enacted a statute prohibiting any state regulation of surface coal mining.we fail to see why the surface mining act should become constitutionally suspect simply because congress chose to allow the states a regulatory role.
section e of the act plainly states that any party aggrieved by a state commission determination,which necessarily will include private individuals,may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court,and e provides that no state court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a state commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.we agree with the seventh circuit that congress has expressed unmistakably that,under the act,states could participate in the federal regulatory function delegated to them by the federal government on the condition that their participation be reviewed in federal court and that the act satisfies the requirement that congress clearly state that participation by the state in the regulatory scheme entails a waiver of immunity from suit in federal court.illinois bell,at see also pub.serv.comm n,at.
when the lpsc accepted congress offer under the act to delegate federal authority to the state commission to act as an arbitrator in the present case,the regulation of interconnection agreements covered by the act was no longer a permissible or lawful activity within the power of the states.as in petty and dole,congress was under no obligation to offer states something they could not obtain on their own,participation in the act federal regulation of local telecommunications competition.also,as in those cases,the state was free to accept or reject such participation as a gratuity without abstaining from any lawful activity within its power.college savings made clear that when congress bestows a gift or gratuity,it may attach the condition of a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity to a state acceptance.at.consequently,the lpsc voluntarily waived its state immunity when it accepted the congressional offer of a gratuity and arbitrated the interconnection dispute in this case.
application of ex parte young 
we agree with the sixth,seventh,and tenth circuits that a suit such as this one,brought by communications for injunctive relief against the individual members of the lpsc because a determination made by the commissioners is allegedly contrary to the act,is a straight forward ex parte young case.illinois bell,at pub.serv.comm n,at michigan bell.climax,cir,cert.denied,d.therefore,even if plaintiffs suit against the lpsc were barred by the eleventh amendment,the suit for prospective injunctive relief could proceed against the individual commissioners in their official capacities.
under the ex parte young doctrine,a private party may sue individual state officers in federal court to obtain prospective relief from an ongoing violation of federal law.see ex parte young.idaho coeur tribe,d,concurring id.at.souter,dissenting ysleta del sur pueblo laney,cir,cert.denied,d earles state bd.of certified public accountants of louisiana,cir.the purpose of the doctrine is to enable federal courts to vindicate federal rights and hold state officials responsible to the supreme authority of the united states.pennhurst,at.quoting ex parte young,at.in the present case,communications filed suit against the individual lpsc commissioners in their official,rather than personal,capacities.communications alleges that the arbitral determination of the interconnection agreement by the commissioners violates the act,a federal law.as the interconnection agreement determination binds present and future relations between communications and bellsouth,the alleged violation of federal law is.finally,an order preventing the commissioners from enforcing provisions of the agreement which fail to meet the requirements of the act will be purely prospective.
the lpsc commissioners counter that the present case fits within the exception to ex parte young recognized by the supreme court in seminole tribe of florida florida,d.the court in seminole tribe held that suits against individual state officers in their official capacities for violations of federal law are not available when congress has enacted a comprehensive remedial scheme intended to be the sole remedy for violations of federal law.id.at.because the remedial scheme prescribed by congress under the act is significantly different from the congressional plan considered by the court in seminole tribe,and does not manifest an intent to exclude ex parte young suits,we disagree with the commissioners contention that seminole tribe precludes application of the ex parte young exception in this case.
in seminole tribe,the supreme court noted that the indian gaming regulatory act igra provided that the sole judicial remedy available under the act upon failed negotiations between the state and the plaintiffs was a court order requiring mediation between the parties.id.if such mediation failed,the result under igra elaborate remedial scheme was preemption of any proposed agreement between the parties by regulations issued by the secretary of the interior.id.at.the court thus noted that the powers of the federal district court under igra were limited significantly,id.at.in comparison,the court recognized that an action brought against a state official under ex parte young would expose that official to the full remedial powers of a federal court,including,presumably,contempt sanctions.id.at.the court stated that the fact that congress under igra chose to impose upon the state a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under ex parte young strongly indicates that congress had no wish to create the latter under igra.seminole tribe,at.
the act,however,does not severely limit relief available to an aggrieved party as does the igra.section e of the act simply provides that,if the state commission makes a determination under that section,any aggrieved party may bring suit in federal court to determine whether the determination meets the act requirements.the act does not limit jurisdiction of federal courts to entertain suits in law or equity for prospective relief from violations of federal law by state officials acting in their official capacities.it thus can not be said that congress intended in the act to limit significantly the federal judicial remedies available to an aggrieved party authorized to bring suit in an appropriate federal court see illinois bell,at the power of the court under subsection e stands in stark contrast with the court powers to impose what the supreme court called a modest set of sanctions under the statute at issue in seminole tribe.citing seminole tribe,at.
appellees also argue that the supreme court decision in idaho coeur tribe,d,precludes applicability of ex parte young to the present case.however,this circuit has rejected the idea that coeur affects the traditional application of ex parte young 
we concur with the consensus among other courts that although the principal opinion in coeur suggests a rather than approach to the application of ex parte young,see coeur.at,d opinion of kennedy,this part of the opinion did not muster a majority,and a majority of the court would continue to apply the rule of ex parte young as it has been traditionally understood,see id.at.at,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment joined by scalia and thomas,jj.id.at.at souter,dissenting joined by stevens,ginsburg,and breyer,jj.

accordingly,the application of ex parte young to suits against state commissioners under section e of the act remains unaffected by either seminole tribe or coeur.see illinois bell,cir pub.serv.comm n,cir and michigan bell.climax,cir.
iv.conclusion 
because the lpsc voluntarily waived the state eleventh amendment immunity in the present case,we reverse the decision of the district court dismissing communication suit against lpsc.because the ex parte young doctrine applies,we also reverse the decision of the district court dismissing communication suit against the individual commissioners.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent and would affirm the dismissal.the district court correctly opined that defendants are immune under the eleventh amendment.
when a state commission elects to arbitrate an interconnection agreement or approve a statement of generally available terms sgat,the telecommunications act of the act or the act vests jurisdiction in the federal courts for any aggrieved party to challenge state actions inconsistent with the requirements of the act that jurisdiction is exclusive pursuant to the eleventh amendment,however,federal courts may not entertain suits by citizens against states arising out of congressional legislation,such as the act,enacted under the commerce clause 
under the eleventh amendment,states enjoy broad sovereign immunity from suit in federal court 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
const.amend.xi.though the amendment text most reasonably applies only to suits in diversity,the supreme court has consistently looked to the principle underlying the amendment to bar suits on federal causes of action as well thus,individuals may not sue states in federal court on causes of action arising out of article i legislation such as the act 
this immunity extends not only to states but to their agencies,as well the eleventh amendment thus immunizes the louisiana commission from suit in federal court.under certain,limited circumstances,however,state the be subjected to suit,notwithstanding the eleventh amendment,under ex parte young.
whether the act violates the eleventh amendment is res nova in this circuit on appeal,the telephone carriers present three unconvincing theories to avoid sovereign immunity.
first,the carriers assert the application of the doctrine announced in young to allow suit against the commissioners.second,they assert that the commission effectively waived its state sovereign immunity by electing to arbitrate the interconnection agreement and approve bellsouth sgat under powers granted by the act.third,claims that the act contemplates only judicial review and thus does not fall within the eleventh amendment prohibition of suit s in law or equity.
the supreme court recently addressed the young and waiver issues in,respectively,seminole tribe and college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d,recognizing a broad eleventh amendment immunity sufficiently capacious to bar suit here under the act.in seeking reversal,the telephone carriers urge,and the majority adopts,an unduly narrow interpretation of those rulings.they would look to the facts,circumstances,and rationales of each holding as somehow exhaustive of the proper scope of the eleventh amendment jurisdictional bar,rather than merely illustrative of the immunity states enjoy from suit in federal court.
in seminole tribe,the court breathed new life into eleventh amendment immunity.that holding not only expanded the scope of the amendment to cover all federal causes of action arising out congress article i thereby barring suit under the act against a state also narrowed the fictional exception to state sovereign immunity first established in barring suit under the act against state commissioners as well the majority therefore errs in accepting the telephone carriers argument that suit should be permitted to proceed against the member commissioners under young.
in young,the court fashioned a judicial remedy to provide prospective relief against state officials to redress ongoing violations of federal law,as a special exception to the eleventh amendment bar to suit.under seminole tribe,however,judicial relief pursuant to young is not available to redress violations of the act,because the act provides a limited statutory remedial scheme that supplants the relief otherwise alternatively available under young.
it is not enough that the eleventh amendment permits judicial application of young to the act.under seminole tribe,courts additionally must determine whether,in enacting that bill,congress acted to supplant that judicial remedy by substituting a remedial scheme.see seminole tribe,at.
as a exception to the eleventh amendment,the young doctrine is not a fiction in which courts ought to engage lightly it was created in young to give relief against state officials to vindicate constitutional rights young since has been extended to vindicate federal statutory rights 
nevertheless,it is congress that creates federal statutory rights,so it is also congress that dictates the remedies available to enforce statutory violations thus,where congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a state of a statutorily created right,a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an action against a state officer based upon ex parte young.seminole tribe,at.
the question,then,is whether the judicial review provisions of the act establish a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement of a statutorily created right,sufficient under seminole tribe to supplant the young remedy that otherwise would be alternatively available to.see seminole tribe,at.in other words,we must determine whether may pursue relief exclusively through the act or whether,alternatively,young is also available.
in concluding that an indian gaming act supplanted young,the seminole tribe court explained 
here,congress intended the rights conferred by the act to be enforced against the state in an action brought under d the intricate procedures set forth in that provision show that congress intended therein not only to define,but also to limit significantly,the duty imposed by d.for example,where the court finds that the state has failed to negotiate in good faith,the only remedy prescribed is an order directing the state and the indian tribe to conclude a compact within days.and if the parties disregard the court order and fail to conclude a compact within the period,the only sanction is that each party then must submit a proposed compact to a mediator who selects the one which best embodies the terms of the act.finally,if the state fails to accept the compact selected by the mediator,the only sanction against it is that the mediator shall notify the secretary of the interior who then must prescribe regulations governing class iii gaming on the tribal lands at issue.by contrast with this quite modest set of sanctions,an action brought against a state official under ex parte young would expose that official to the full remedial powers of a federal court,including,presumably,contempt sanctions.if d could be enforced in a suit under ex parte young,d would have been superfluous it is difficult to see why an indian tribe would suffer through the intricate scheme of d when more complete and more immediate relief would be available under ex parte young.
id.at.footnote omitted.
in other words,to supplant young,a statute must provide a detailed and limited remedial legislative scheme,narrower in scope than what would be available under young.otherwise,to invoke young would be to render the judicial review provisions of a statute superfluous.
under the act,an aggrieved party may seek judicial review only under certain conditions in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section e emphasis added.the act thus limits the timing of access to federal courts,the scope of commission conduct subject to judicial review,and the defendants vulnerable to suit.
first,with respect to access to suit and the scope of reviewable commission conduct,aggrieved parties have a right to judicial relief under the act,but only after the state commission has made a determination this is not unlike the requirement of a final agency action to trigger administrative procedure act judicial review,see,and it is available only to review the validity of a commission agreement or statement under the act and not its process.the act thus imposes a number of statutory duties on state commissions that are either not effectively or only partially effectively reviewable under this judicial review provision,including the duty to arbitrate open issues brought to the commission,see a the duty to provide an opportunity to respond to the party against whom another party has petitioned for arbitration,see id.b the duty to arbitrate only those issues raised by a petition,see id.b a the duty to conclude the resolution of unresolved issues within nine months of the initial request,see id.b c and,with respect to sgat,the duty to complete review within sixty days of submission,see id.f.
to delay judicial review until the state commission actually makes a determination rather than before,and then to limit that review only to ensuring that any agreement or statement as opposed to the arbitration process itself complies with the act,is to limit significantly the dut ies imposed by the act and thus to supplant relief under young.a plaintiff might prefer to seek the immediate injunctive relief offered by young to redress ongoing violations of the act but the act requires the aggrieved party to wait for a determination by the state commission before filing suit,even if it means that some violations,such as compliance with the statutory deadlines,might never be redressed.the act therefore provides a remedial scheme that supplants relief otherwise offered by young.
second,the act refers only to cases involving a state commission.id.e.no reference is made to state commissioners.as seminole tribe teaches,courts should not lightly construe congressional intent to expose a state official to the full remedial powers of a federal court,including,presumably,contempt sanctions,where the statute seems to suggest otherwise by providing alternative remedies.seminole tribe,at.given that only parties aggrieved by such determination may bring an action and that such actions are limited to determin ing whether the agreement or statement complies with the act,e,the most reasonable construction is to limit the scope of judicial review to the only parties able to trigger commissions 
notwithstanding the availability of injunctive relief,the judicial review provisions are sufficiently limited to supplant relief under young.that the limited statutory remedy under the act against state commissions is actually not available because it is unconstitutional under the eleventh amendment does not alter the determination that the act supplants young relief against state commissioners.the supreme court directly confronted this issue in seminole tribe,concluding that the court could consider the alternative remedy provided by congress sufficient to supplant relief under young,notwithstanding the fact that that remedy was unconstitutional.this result struck some commentators as absurd but the court unhesitatingly concluded that it is for congress,and not the courts,to rewrite defective statutes 
the telephone carriers and the majority would apply a narrower reading of seminole tribe,however,limiting its scope to the particular federal statute that decision construed.the carriers argue that the act does not limit relief nearly as dramatically as does the statute in seminole tribe and that seminole tribe held only that that enactment was sufficient to supplant young.after all,the same kind of injunctive relief to redress ongoing violations is available under the act as is available under young that was not so in seminole tribe.all an aggrieved party need do under the act is to satisfy the administrative conditions of the act judicial review provision,as was done here.
but that is precisely the problem under seminole tribe.section e limits the scope of commission conduct subject to scrutiny by federal courts and thus supplants young.under seminole tribe,at,young relief is unavailable when,by enacting the statute,congress intended therein not only to define,but also to limit significantly,the duty imposed by the statute through a limited remedial scheme.
this is the carriers strongest argument against applying seminole tribe,which is silent on the question,because seminole tribe does not expressly state that a federal statute limiting defendants and commission duties subject to judicial review,but not remedies such as injunctive relief,is sufficient to supplant young.nonetheless,the carriers attempt to distinguish between limits on available remedies as in seminole tribe and limits on defendants and duties as in the instant case finds no support in seminole tribe,which,after all,describes young relief as a narrow exception to the eleventh amendment.id.at.therefore,in the face of ambiguity in seminole tribe as to whether it precludes young relief only where a statute prohibits certain judicial remedies,or also where a statute limits only defendants and duties,the majority errs in resolving that ambiguity against state sovereign immunity.
because the act confers exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts and,as i have shown,an action in federal court is barred under the eleventh amendment,no review to enforce the commission or a commissioner compliance with the act is available in state or federal court.this there is neither a state nor a federal forum to vindicate federal rights created by the not alone sufficient to trigger relief under young.such a rule was suggested in idaho coeur tribe,d,as a mere factor to support application of young,but even that minimal suggestion was endorsed by only two and expressly repudiated by three the governing rule remains the same relief under young is available where prospective relief is necessary to redress violations of federal law but only if congress has not supplanted that relief with an alternative,limited remedial scheme.see seminole tribe,at.
it is not enough to say that the eleventh amendment applies and that the narrow exception of young has been supplanted by congress,for a state might be found to have waived such immunity.there is no actual waiver in this case,and,even if constructive waiver is still available as a matter of law,the state defendants did not waive its immunity voluntarily.they therefore have retained their immunity under the eleventh amendment.
as the majority seems to acknowledge,there was no express waiver louisiana did not enact a law or otherwise express its consent to suit in federal court under the act.instead,the majority reasons that louisiana effected a voluntary gratuity induced waiver by participating in the regulatory scheme.
in college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d,the court overruled parden terminal railway of alabama state docks department,d,and rejected the theory that a state might constructively waive sovereign immunity in its place,the court adopted t he classic description of an effective waiver of a constitutional right that is,the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.college sav.bank,at.the test is a stringent one.id.at.in any event,the majority correctly acknowledges that a theory of constructive waiver is no longer viable.
for a waiver to be effective,it must be completely voluntary and not coerced or based on an unconstitutional condition.the majority errs in concluding that the supposed waiver here meets that requirement.
w here the constitutionally guaranteed protection of the states sovereign immunity is involved,the point of coercion is automatically the voluntariness of waiver what is attached to the refusal to waive is the exclusion of the state from otherwise lawful activity.college sav.bank,at.emphasis added.the protection of college savings bank is not limited only to states that were previously engaging in activity as distinguished from states that were merely participating in a federal program,as mistakenly urged by the carriers,but instead extends to any otherwise lawful activity.for example,the court rejected,out of hand,any exception whatsoever for states acting as market participants.id.at.
the act does not force states to waive their sovereign immunity,but it unconstitutionally subjects to suit in federal court any state commission that elects to arbitrate interconnection agreements between competitors operating in local telephone service markets within their jurisdiction or to approve sgat of bell operating companies providing service to their jurisdiction.the telephone carriers emphasize that the act gives clear notice that state commissions choosing to regulate will subject themselves to suit in federal court after college savings bank,however,clear notice,though still necessary,is no longer sufficient to induce waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.
under college savings bank,even a waiver is ineffective if arbitration of interconnection agreements or approval of sgat by a state commission constitutes otherwise lawful activity.id.at.the question,therefore,is whether arbitration of interconnection agreements or approval of sgat by a state commission constitutes otherwise lawful activity for which congress can not condition a waiver of sovereign immunity,or whether,instead,the grant of such power to the states is a gift or gratuity,which congress may so condition.id.at.
before the act,state commissions regulated local telephone service markets within their jurisdiction.the act takes that local regulatory power from the states as the telephone carriers themselves appear to concede.granted,the act does not keep such authority exclusively in the hands of congress or the fcc,but allows it back to the state commissions.that delegation back to the states is permitted under the statute,however,only if the states subject themselves to suit in federal court.
congress was not merely conditioning a gift or a gratuity,as the carriers insist and the majority concludes.rather,the act imposes conditions on states wishing to continue to regulate local telephone markets as they once did.this congress can not do.
in essence,the act requires state commissions to sacrifice either policy preference or sovereign immunity.a state commission may wish to intervene and make its policy preferences known,but doing so subjects it to federal jurisdiction.to avoid federal jurisdiction,a state commission must abdicate its regulatory goals and hope that the private parties and the fcc will come to a solution it would endorse.this hardly rises to a voluntary waiver of a state constitutional right to sovereign immunity in federal court.
the telephone carriers would state commission powers under the act as federal regulatory authority,and thus the kind of activity in which a state may not lawfully engage without congressional authorization.they and the panel majority would analogize the act to congressional exercises of its powers under the compact and spending clauses,under which congress is constitutionally authorized under college savings bank to require waiver.
the regulatory powers enjoyed by state commissions under the act are indeed federal in the sense that congress,and not a particular state,has articulated the governing standards.but the underlying subject matter nevertheless remains within the indisputable if domain of the states.like other matters of commerce,local telephone is a matter both within the jurisdiction of state regulators and subject to federal preemption.as the majority observes,t he question in this case is not whether the federal government has taken the regulation of local telecommunications competition away from the states.with regard to the matters addressed by the act,it unquestionably has.iowa utils,at.
to be sure,congress could have preempted state regulation of all telephone and congress may give the states the option of providing their own regulations or facing preemption by federal law but the greater does not always include the lesser,and it certainly does not when state opposed to mere policy at issue.
in pursuit of legitimate ends such as telephone regulation,congress may not offend state sovereignty.this was so in the commandeering and is no less so here with respect to the eleventh amendment.congress may ask states to choose either to regulate or to stand back and let federal law take over.but just as it can not commandeer states to conduct federal regulation on behalf of the united states,it can not condition,on submission to suits in federal court,state participation in those regulatory affairs in which states once freely engaged.
thus,the telephone carriers argument that state commissions enjoy the option whether to regulate may solve tenth amendment problems raised in printz or new york but does not address the concern of coerced waiver of state sovereignty under the eleventh amendment.giving states the choice whether to be preempted by federal law represents a permissible form of cooperative federalism,hodel,at,but the conscription of state officials to execute federal regulatory programs or the subjection of state officers to suit in federal court diminishes the accountability of state and federal officials and thereby violates constitutional principles of federalism,printz,at.
the eleventh amendment bars from suing the state defendants but not from suing bellsouth.thus argues that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed the entire case,even as to bellsouth 
authority to dismiss an entire case because of the unavailability of one particular party is governed by,which requires that if,as a matter of equity the court finds that the lawsuit can not proceed without the absent party,then that party be considered indispensable and the case dismissed.shelton,at emphasis added we review the district court exercise of its equitable powers for abuse of discretion.see in re nikoloutsos,at.
to determine whether a party is indispensable,courts look to rule b,which states 
t he court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.the factors to be considered by the court include first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
the determination of whether a party is indispensable is thus a pragmatic one the distilled essence of the four factors is the attempt to balance the rights of all concerned.schutten,at.in other words,
t he plaintiff has the right to control his own litigation and to choose his own forum.this right is,however,like all other rights,defined by the rights of others.thus the defendant has the right to be safe from needless multiple litigation and from incurring avoidable inconsistent obligations.likewise the interests of the outsider who can not be joined must be considered.finally there is the public interest and the interest the court has in seeing that insofar as possible the litigation will be both effective and expeditious.
the district court did not abuse its equitable powers,under rule,to dismiss the entire case.it fairly reasoned that it lacks the power under seminole tribe to create a remedy under the act.the congressional choice of remedy must be respected.therefore,the plaintiffs can no longer obtain the relief that they requested in their complaints against the public service commission.communications,d at.
imagine if it were otherwise the act can not constitutionally subject state commissions to suit.for a federal court then
