richard oberdorfer and his company,western radio services collectively,western,brought an action against the united states forest service and six of its officers under bivens six unknown named agents of the bureau of narcotics,d and the administrative procedure act apa,stat.the district court dismissed the apa claims as moot and granted the government motion for summary judgment on the bivens claims,holding that the apa provided an adequate alternative remedy which foreclosed a remedy under bivens.western appeals only the dismissal of the bivens claims.we agree with the district court that the apa provides western an adequate alternative remedy,and we affirm.
because this appeal comes to us from the grant of a motion for summary judgment,we relate the facts in the light most favorable to western.see nolan heald,cir.
gray butte is an area within the ochoco national forest in central oregon.the forest service leases various sites in the area to electronic communications companies,including western and two other companies,slater communications and electronics and day wireless systems.each lease agreement incorporates by reference the terms of the forest service gray butte electronic site management plan,which establish es a guide for the land manager to base decisions concerning the development of the site in conformance with ten stated environmental objectives.
western first constructed radio towers on gray butte in,and it maintained good relations with the forest service for the first five years of its operations there.in,western began bringing administrative appeals of various forest service decisions.in,western filed several lawsuits challenging forest service permit and leasing decisions.after western began challenging forest service decisions,it experienced unfavorable treatment from the forest service,including unexplained delays in processing its applications and rejections of its applications.on january,western applied to the forest service for permission to place additional antennae on gray butte.slater communications objected,and western submitted a revised application.years later,in,the forest service denied western application.western appealed this denial,and in the forest service withdrew its denial and took western application back under consideration.more years passed,and in and,western pressed forest service officials to take action on its application.between and,there were communications between western and various forest service officers,with the forest service continuing to request additional documents and clarifications and adding new procedural requirements to western application.
while western was attempting to secure permission to install its antennae,western also complained to the forest service regarding problems it was having with other gray butte lessees.in august,western informed a forest service officer that slater communications was not in compliance with the site plan,and that slater communications would not allow inspection by western.although western believed other lessees operated equipment that did not meet the technical standards required by the applicable regulations and the site plan,western was unable to specify the nature of the lessees noncompliance because western was unable to conduct its own inspection of the lessees sites.
in august,the forest service began the process of scheduling an inspection of gray butte.in response,western again raised complaints about other lessees noncompliance with the site plan.western also asked the forest service to appoint representatives of other gray butte lessees,including western,to the inspection team.in september,the forest service inspected all three facilities at gray butte,but did not include lessees on its inspection team.the forest service found only minor deficiencies at slater communications and day wireless.following this inspection,western continued to send emails to the forest service accusing other lessees of noncompliance and demanding enforcement of the site plan.
on september,western brought claims against the forest service and the individual defendants under bivens and the apa,alleging that the defendants failed to stop other lessees noncompliance with the site plan,failed to allow western to conduct site inspections of other lessees facilities,and delayed taking action on western application to install the two additional antennae on gray butte.western claimed that these delays and inactions violated the first amendment by treating western unfavorably in retaliation for its prior litigation against the forest service,the fifth amendment by treating western less favorably than the other lessees without a rational basis,and the apa by unlawfully withholding or unreasonably delaying administrative action.
in january,western submitted a revised application seeking permission to construct four additional microwave antennae on the locations.the forest service prepared an environmental assessment for the proposal,and,on september,issued an administrative decision allowing western to build two of the four proposed antennae.the district court then dismissed western apa inaction claims as moot because the agency had acted.the court also granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on western bivens claims,holding that the apa provided an adequate alternative remedy to a bivens action.
western appeals only the grant of summary judgment on his bivens claims.our review is de novo.see nolan,at.
at the outset,we note that the supreme court has held that no bivens remedy is available against a federal agency,see fdic meyer,d,and on that ground we affirm the district court dismissal of western bivens claims against the forest service itself.we therefore turn to whether the circumstances of this case require us to recognize an implied right of action under bivens against the individual forest service officers for their alleged violations of western constitutional rights.
in bivens,the supreme court recognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen constitutional rights.ashcroft iqbal,d.specifically,the court in bivens allowed a plaintiff to bring a damages action in federal court against individual federal officials for violating the fourth amendment,despite the absence of any federal statute authorizing such an action.see bivens,at.within the next few years,the supreme court extended bivens in two additional cases where the court concluded an implied right of action for money damages was consistent with congressional intent.in davis passman,the court permitted a political appointee to bring a claim against a congressman,despite the absence of such a remedy in title vii of the civil rights act of,because there was no evidence that congress intended to prevent political appointees from seeking relief under a judicially created remedy,d.similarly,in carlson green,the court allowed a prisoner action against prison officials for failure to provide proper medical attention in violation of the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,notwithstanding the availability of a remedy under the federal tort claims act ftca,because there was evidence that congress did not intend the ftca to be a substitute for recovery under bivens,d.
since carlson,however,the supreme court has consistently refused to extend bivens liability to any new context or new category of defendants.corr.servs.malesko,d.the court has focused increased scrutiny on whether congress intended the courts to devise a new bivens remedy,and in every decision since carlson,across a variety of factual and legal contexts,the answer has been no.see,chappell wallace,d declining to allow an implied right of action for military personnel who allegedly suffered racial discrimination at the hands of their superior officers bush lucas,d declining to allow an implied right of action for a federal employee who allegedly suffered unconstitutional employment actions schweiker chilicky,d declining to allow an implied right of action for disabled persons who were allegedly denied social security disability benefits in violation of their due process rights wilkie robbins,d declining to allow an implied right of action for a landowner who allegedly suffered harassment and intimidation by federal officials in violation of his rights under the fourth and fifth amendments.
in wilkie,the court distilled its history of bivens jurisprudence into a analysis for determining congressional intent as to the appropriateness of a bivens remedy.see id.at.first,the court determines whether there is any alternative,existing process for protecting the plaintiff interests.id.such an alternative remedy would raise the inference that congress expected the judiciary to stay its bivens hand and refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.id.at.the court has explained that,w hen the design of a government program suggests that congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration,we have not created additional bivens remedies.chilicky,at.see also castaneda united states,cir.accordingly,the court has refrained from creating a judicially implied remedy even when the available statutory remedies do not provide complete relief for a plaintiff that has suffered a constitutional violation.corr.servs,at.quoting bush,at.so long as the plaintiff ha s an avenue for some redress,bedrock principles of separation of powers foreclose s judicial imposition of a new substantive liability.id.
we have interpreted these cases as holding that,s o long as congress failure to provide money damages,or other significant relief,has not been inadvertent,courts should defer to its judgment.berry hollander,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord adams johnson,cir explaining that the adequate alternative remedy need not be perfectly comprehensive.in chilicky,for example,the court declined to create a bivens action for recovery of money damages for emotional distress and for loss of food,shelter and other necessities caused by the wrongful denial of social security benefits.at.the court reasoned that the existence of a comprehensive and elaborate remedial scheme for wrongly withheld social security disability benefits evinced a congressional unwillingness to provide consequential damages for unconstitutional deprivations of those benefits.because congress provide d meaningful safeguards or remedies for the plaintiffs,and because personal liability for official acts would undoubtedly lead to new difficulties and expense in recruiting administrators for the programs congress has established,the court held that congress had implicitly foreclosed a bivens remedy even though it had not provided complete relief to the plaintiffs.id.at.
second,if the court can not infer that congress intended a statutory remedial scheme to take the place of a remedy,the court next asks whether there nevertheless are factors counseling hesitation before devising such an implied right of action.wilkie,at.even where congress has given plaintiffs no damages remedy for a constitutional violation,the court has declined to create a right of action under bivens when doing so would be plainly inconsistent with congress authority in this field.chappell,at.in chappell,for example,enlisted military personnel had no damages remedy of any kind against their superiors for constitutional violations,but the court nevertheless declined to create a damages remedy under bivens.at.the court explained that the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and congress activity in the field constitute special factors which dictate that it would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel a remedy against their superior officers.id.at.
the court also found special factors counselling hesitation in wilkie,and accordingly declined to create a bivens remedy.at.in wilkie,a ranch owner claimed that officers of the bureau of land management tried to coerce him into granting the federal government an easement over his land.the ranch owner alleged that bureau officials trespassed on his property broke into his lodge and left trash inside videotaped his vacationing clients from a hilltop while they sought privacy to relieve themselves revoked the grazing permit and permit that allowed him to run guest cattle drives levied fines against him for trespassing on federal land convinced the local united states attorney office to bring a meritless criminal prosecution against him and tried to convince the local sheriff to impound his cattle.id.at.the ranch owner therefore brought bivens claims against the officers,alleging that they violated his fourth and fifth amendment rights by retaliating against the exercise of his ownership rights.id.at.
in the first step of its bivens analysis,the court examined whether there was any alternative,existing process available to the ranch owner,and broke his claims into four main groups torts or injuries inflicted on him,charges brought against him,unfavorable agency actions,and offensive behavior by bureau employees falling outside those three categories.id.at.addressing the criminal charges,the court concluded that,f or each charge,the plaintiff had some procedure to defend and make good on his position although he had mixed success,he had the means to be heard.id.at.addressing the unfavorable agency actions,the court concluded that,f or each claim,administrative review was available,subject to ultimate judicial review under the apa.id.the court further concluded that the plaintiff had some type of remedy in tort for the alleged trespasses and vandalism,though noting some uncertainty as to whether a remedy was available against the officers videotaping of his guests.id.at.in sum,the court concluded that the plaintiff had an administrative,and ultimately a judicial,process for vindicating virtually all of his complaints.id.
nonetheless,the court held that the case could not be disposed of at step one of its bivens analysis because the forums of defense and redress were a patchwork,an assemblage of state and federal,administrative and judicial benches applying regulations,statutes and common law rules.id.at.thus,the court stated,i t would be hard to infer that congress expected the judiciary to stay its bivens hand,but equally hard to extract any clear lesson that bivens ought to spawn a new claim.id.the court therefore concluded that wilkie was a case for bivens step two,for weighing reasons for and against the creation of a new cause of action,the way common law judges have always done.id.the court explained that it must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a tribunal,paying particular heed,however,to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.id.at.quoting bush,at.
in the second step of this analysis,the court noted that the plaintiff allegation amounted to the claim that the officers had pushed too hard on the government behalf,and the court reasoned that it would be too difficult to draw a line between legitimately hard bargaining and illegitimate pressure.id.at.in light of the serious difficulty of devising a workable cause of action,the court concluded that a general bivens cure would be worse than the disease,and therefore held that the plaintiffs had no implied right of action for damages under bivens.id.at.
applying wilkie analysis to this case,we begin by asking whether the existence of any alternative,existing process available to western,or other indication of congressional intent,raises the inference that congress expected the judiciary to stay its bivens hand.id.at.
at the outset,we note that wilkie itself gave us a strong indication that the apa constitutes an alternative,existing process for western damages claims based on agency actions and inactions.the court in wilkie observed that the ranch owner had an adequate remedy for the unfavorable agency actions,because,f or each such claim,administrative review was available,subject to ultimate judicial review under the apa.id.at.wilkie moved on to step two because the plaintiff had only a patchwork of different remedies for addressing the other
