plaintiff,norman rowell,filed suit against bellsouth corporation bellsouth pursuant to the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,contending that due to his age,bellsouth forced him to retire during a reduction in force.the district court found that rowell claim was meritless because he could not show that bellsouth constructively discharged him,and therefore rowell did not suffer an adverse employment action.on appeal,rowell contends that the district court erred in holding that a reasonable person would not have felt compelled to accept the voluntary severance plan offered by bellsouth because rowell was convinced that if he did not accept voluntary severance,he would be terminated involuntarily.
rowell was hired as a lineman by bellsouth in.he later became a lineman foreman,a position he held until his retirement in.in may,bellsouth announced that it would undertake reduction in force of its management personnel.rowell supervisor explained that the reduction in force would take place in two stages.first,an enhanced voluntary package would be offered to employees.depending on his years in service,if an employee accepted early retirement,he could receive a minimum of and a maximum of of his base salary,as well as other benefits.at the conclusion of the voluntary program,if not enough employees had retired,bellsouth would institute a second stage,involuntary reduction program to meet its workforce goals.the involuntary program would offer a minimum of and a maximum of of an employee salary and reduced additional benefits.
to implement the reduction in force,bellsouth employees were divided into universes,which were groups of employees with similar job descriptions.rowell,age at the time of the reduction,was in a universe with five other employees greg sharpe,age ferdinand williams,age forty doug farnell,age billy james,age and gwen devalk,age.bellsouth determined that two positions in rowell universe would be eliminated.to be prepared in the event that additional cuts were needed at the second stage,bellsouth instructed managers to begin ranking and rating employees on each of six competency factors.the six factors were demonstrates broad business knowledge and savvy achieves results through speed and decisiveness maintains a focus on customer satisfaction instills purpose and vision communicates openly and effectively and builds high performing teams and individual talent.
if necessary,a certain number of the lowest ranking employees in each universe would then be cut during the involuntary second stage.all employees,including rowell,were informed that depending on the number of employees that accepted the voluntary retirement in the first stage,it was possible that enough new job openings would be created so that an employee whose position was eliminated after the voluntary phase could be transferred within the company.specifically,les durel,a manager in rowell chain of supervision,informed employees that it was likely that there would be positions available in mississippi because the company was eliminating some contract positions there and would need hires to replace them.during the initial stages of the reduction in force,immediate supervisors were told not to disclose the actual ratings given to managers in the universe they ranked,but they were permitted to give managers an idea of whether they were at risk so that a manager could decide whether to take the voluntary package.
rowell and ferdinand williams received the lowest scores in rowell universe.see rowell,at.doug farnell,a year older than rowell,received a score sufficient to place him in the top four positions in the group.rowell then asked carl robitzsch,his immediate supervisor,whether he needed to be looking for a job elsewhere,to which robitzsch,responded,yes.see id.at rowell testified he told robitzsch,i one of the kind of guys i just want to know.i do want to sit here and think about it,i want to know was i one of the ones that needed to be looking for a job elsewhere,and he told me i was.rowell also testified that he and robitzsch did have a discussion about the potential for any jobs opening up elsewhere.id.at.after speaking to the other members in his universe,rowell learned that williams would be taking early retirement but that sharpe,farnell,and james would not.rowell never learned what devalk intended to do.see id.at.
when rowell received the papers for the voluntary early retirement offer in,he reviewed them carefully and even discussed them with his attorney.see id.at.he further testified that no one forced him to take the voluntary retirement and that he could have rejected the offer and taken his chances on finding something else within the company.see id.at.he had no reason to believe he could not have been a candidate for the additional job openings that might be created by the voluntary first stage.see id.at.in fact,rowell asked robitzsch to inform him if any other job openings became available at bellsouth.see id.at,after talking over his options with his attorney,rowell signed the papers to accept the voluntary early retirement on september.see id.at.as part of his acceptance,he signed a waiver releasing any and all claims against bellsouth except for an adea claim.see id.at.
rowell was separated on september,and received in severance pay under the voluntary program.he also received a lump sum pension benefit of because he was eligible for retirement.rowell testified that because of the success of the voluntary program,he now understood that sufficient vacancies were created that he likely would have been able to transfer within bellsouth had he wanted to continue his employment.see id.at.
in support of his claim for age discrimination,rowell testified that he believed robitzsch had discriminated against him during the ranking process.see id.at.rowell admitted,however,that other than the ranking scores,robitzsch had never said or done anything to suggest he would discriminate on the basis of age.see id.at.rowell also did not believe any other bellsouth employee discriminated against him.see id.at.he did not want to risk losing the half a year pay that was only available to those who took the voluntary early retirement.see id.at.
the district court concluded that rowell could not show he was constructively discharged because he could not have reasonably believed his only choices were retirement or discharge.the court recognized that rowell choice may have been a difficult one,but it was not no choice at all.because the district court found that rowell could not establish an adverse employment action,the court did not consider rowell alternative argument that he could establish bellsouth legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the ranking were pretextual.rowell then filed the instant appeal.
although the district court found that rowell failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because he could not demonstrate he was constructively discharged,we may affirm the district court on any ground that appears in the record,whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.powers united states,cir.many courts,in cases,begin by considering whether it is being done in an age neutral way,presumably because a reduction in force generates adverse employment actions,which of course are quite lawful if not based on impermissible characteristics such as age.as the parties have briefed the contention that bellsouth discriminated against rowell on the basis of age,we will begin at this point.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo viewing the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.the adea makes it unlawful for an employer to fail to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against an individual because of that individual age.see chapman ai transport,cir en banc quoting a.
in williams general motors,cir.unit b,we applied the prima face case of age discrimination to a reduction in force case and found the elements to be a plaintiff who is within the protected age group,adversely affected,qualified to assume another position at the time of discharge,and evidence,circumstantial or direct,from which a factfinder might reasonably conclude that the employer intended to discriminate in reaching the decision at issue.id.at.to satisfy the last prong,we elaborated that the plaintiff must produce some evidence that an employer has not treated age neutrally,but has instead discriminated based upon it.specifically,the evidence must lead the factfinder reasonably to conclude either that the defendant consciously refused to consider retaining or relocating a plaintiff because of his age,or regarded age as a negative factor in such consideration.id.at.we noted,for example,that a plaintiff could present circumstantial statistical evidence regarding age or evidence that the employer plan was subterfuge for discrimination,such as evidence that an plan existed which shifted protected workers into jobs most likely to be cut in the reduction in force.id.at.
rowell is within the protected age group,and because no one has argued otherwise,we assume that he was qualified to take another position at the time he accepted the voluntary early retirement package.rowell contends that the competency rankings conducted by robitzsch were discriminatory because they did not take into consideration the employees training,experience or job performance,he received higher scores on his october and february evaluations than his evaluation done in august in preparation for the reduction in force,he was better qualified for his job than greg sharpe,age,and billy james,age and cathy mcintosh and norman robbins,other bellsouth employees,testified that they believed their rankings were impermissibly based on age.
rowell takes issue with the six categories of competency rankings because they did not account for training,experience,or job performance.rowell does not contend that the six categories were selected as a subterfuge or code for achieving a younger work force rather,he simply believes that they were not the appropriate categories on which to rank employees.it is by now axiomatic that we can not the business decisions of an employer.see,wilson aerospace,cir.bellsouth determined that these six areas were of greatest importance.rowell did not develop any evidence to demonstrate that the selection or application of these categories would result in discrimination on the basis of age.furthermore,only four of the six competency areas used in the reduction in force were also used in the regular job performance evaluations conducted by bellsouth.thus,that rowell received different scores on his annual review and the review done for purposes of reduction does not provide evidence of discriminatory animus.the facts that the annual evaluations covered only that year performance whereas the reduction in force evaluations were to take into consideration the employee whole experience also make the comparison not relevant for purposes of determining whether there was discriminatory intent.
rowell next contends that he was better qualified than sharpe and james.sharpe had been employed by bellsouth for thirteen years and served as a network manager for five years at the time of the reduction in force.james had worked for bellsouth for five years and had been promoted to network manager in september.rowell believed he was more qualified than james and sharpe because he had more job experience,knowledge of outside plant equipment and procedures,bellsouth schooling,and knowledge of quality and safety issues.these factors,however,were not relevant to the competency ratings.furthermore,rowell personal belief that he was more qualified is not sufficient to demonstrate discriminatory intent.see,lee gte florida,cir.moreover,sharpe and james were not the only other individuals in rowell universe,and thus a discussion of their qualifications is not reflective of what happened in rowell entire universe.
in fact,there is no obvious correlation between age and ranking in rowell universe.the people in rowell universe were ranked as follows 
rowell and williams,one of the younger individuals in the universe,received the lowest scores,and at least one of the four higher scorers,doug farnell,was older than rowell.
finally,mcintosh and robbins were in different universes than rowell,and thus,their testimony would not tend to show that bellsouth treated rowell in a discriminatory manner.for example,mcintosh testified that her manager,carla little,performed the competency ratings for six employees in mcintosh universe of thirteen people.of those six employees,four got together to discuss their rankings and discovered that the rankings correlated with seniority,not necessarily age,for these four employees.mcintosh statements about the rankings of only four people out of a universe of thirteen,however,can not have any relevance for what happened in her universe,let alone rowell.
robbins testified that he met with his supervisor,everett gillis,several times about whether he was at risk in the involuntary reduction.during a conversation with gillis about which employees would be let go in the reduction,rowell name came up.see robbins,at.gillis said rowell and others at risk,including robbins,would be let go due to how it was rated and w h ere we fell out in the rating.id.at.later in the conversation,gillis told robbins it was more based on age.id.at.he did not tell robbins what led him to believe that or what gave him that information.id.during a separate conversation about the reduction in force,gillis told robbins that a lot of the decision is based on that the company wants to keep the youth.and because of my age,it was detrimental to me.id.at.again,gillis did not tell robbins where he got that information.id.at.robbins testified that gillis told him the company wanted youth for really vague superfluous ideas that gillis had.it was more like costs less,less insurance and stuff like that.and they can develop them in what they wanted them to do.id.at.robbins was then asked whether it was your impression that gillis was reflecting his own personal opinion,or whether he was somehow telling what he had been told by some senior person or upper management as far as these references to age playing some part in how people were being rated during the reduction in force id.at.robbins responded it was gillis personal opinion.id.at.robbins also testified that gillis pointed only to himself as the basis for the comments that the company wanted to keep youth.id.at.
on motions for summary judgment,we may consider only that evidence which can be reduced to an admissible form.see macuba deboer,cir although evidence that is otherwise admissible may be accepted in an inadmissible form at summary judgment stage,hearsay could not be reduced to admissible form.if it is to be contended that gillis statements represent the policy of bellsouth,federal rule of evidence d d might make the statement admissible.that rule states that a statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party and is a statement by the party agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,made during the existence of the relationship.id.under rule,a court would have to determine by a preponderance of the evidence that gillis was speaking as an agent of bellsouth at the time he made these statements.nothing in robbins testimony,however,supports such a conclusion.it is in reality nothing but the inadmissible opinion of gillis.
it is true that courts have admitted statements of managers under rule d d where there is some evidence that the statements reflected some kind of participation in the employment decision or policy of the employer.see,yates rexton,cir woodman haemonetics,cir.these cases,however,are distinguishable.in yates,the plaintiff was terminated at age as part of a reduction in force.at.the plaintiff proffered evidence that two executives of his employer parent company were of the opinion that employees over age should retire.id.at.the record also reflected that these executives exerted pressure on the plaintiff chain of supervisors to terminate the plaintiff employment.the eighth circuit held that even if these two executives did not play a role in the plaintiff termination,their statements were admissible under rule d d because s ignificant involvement,either as advisor or other participant in a process leading to a challenged decision,may be sufficient to establish agency under rule d d.id.at quoting equal employment opportunity comm watergate at landmark,cir.
in woodman,the plaintiff was also terminated as a result of a reduction in force.the plaintiff proffered testimony that his supervisor had attended a meeting with the company upper management at which they discussed future employee terminations.following the meeting and referencing the discussion about terminations,the supervisor made the comment,these damn want younger people here.at.the defendant argued that the supervisor statement was not admissible under rule d d because she was only a first line supervisor with no authority to make termination decisions.the court held,however,that her statement was admissible because she had attended the meeting in the scope of her employment and evaluated employees,including recommending the plaintiff termination.thus,the court found,she was directly involved in the reduction in force.id.at.
here,in contrast,there is no evidence that gillis was involved in the decisions of how to structure the reduction in force or how to design the performance evaluations used during the involuntary stage of the reduction.there is also no evidence that gillis had received any information from bellsouth upper management to indicate that age was to play a factor in these decisions.rather,the only evidence before the court is robbins testimony that gillis statements were gillis own personal opinion and not something that gillis had been told by upper management about the role age was to play in the performance ratings.see robbins,at.in fact,gillis only pointed to himself as the basis for his comments that the company wanted to keep youth.id.at.significantly,not only did robbins testify that gillis comments reflected only gillis opinion,robbins was not able to identify any particular person in bellsouth to whom gillis could point as the basis for his comments.carden westinghouse electric,cir excluding testimony under rule d d where supervisor only stated to plaintiff that they wanted a younger person for the job and the record did not establish a foundation as to the identity of they.
we find gillis testimony similar to that which we rejected in mitchell usbi,cir.there,the employer engaged in a reduction in force of its engineers because a contract with nasa had been cancelled.id.at.after the layoff list was developed,managers worked with members of the company human resources department to determine whether any of those slated for layoff were eligible to bump other employees.under the layoff policy,a more senior employee could bump a less senior employee if the senior employee had the requisite qualifications to perform the less senior job.id.the plaintiff was on the layoff list and the company determined that he could not bump any of the twenty less senior employees because he did not have the requisite qualifications.although it was unclear the role performance evaluations played in the layoff process,the plaintiff proffered testimony that his supervisor had given younger employers higher evaluations in order to increase their salaries and encourage them to stay with the company.id.at.for the purposes of summary judgment,we assumed that the evaluations played a role in the layoff process.as the district court,we assumed that the plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of discrimination.we then rejected his arguments as to why the employer legitimate reason for layoff was pretextual.the plaintiff argued that comments by various usbi employees demonstrate a corporate culture conducive to age discrimination.id.at.he also pointed to comments of a manager,frank batty,but conceded he did not participate in the decision to terminate him.the plaintiff also asserted that another manager had suggested that the layoffs were aimed at the employees who were more secure and did not have young children in school.id.again,however,we noted that this manager was not a decisionmaker.as such,we did not accept the comments of either manager as to be even circumstantial evidence of discrimination.id.
similarly,we find that rowell has not proffered any evidence to show that gillis statements reflect any policy of bellsouth,and since gillis was not a decisionmaker with respect to rowell,his statements can not demonstrate discriminatory intent.see steger general electric,cir statements made by nondecisionmakers or statements made by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process do not demonstrate discriminatory intent quoting price waterhouse hopkins,d,concurring.
under williams,rowell would have to show that bellsouth either consciously refused to consider retaining or relocating a plaintiff because of his age,or regarded age as a negative factor in its actions.clearly,rowell can not show that bellsouth refused to consider relocating him.robitzsch and durel both informed employees that if enough individuals accepted voluntary early retirement,jobs would become available in other areas of the company.rowell does not dispute that he would have been eligible and that no one at bellsouth informed him he would not be able to apply for those positions.next,as discussed above,none of the other evidence pointed to by rowell is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that bellsouth regarded age as a negative factor during the reduction in force.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that rowell has not presented any evidence from which a factfinder might reasonably conclude that the employer intended to discriminate in reaching the decision at issue.williams,at.
in any event,we would also affirm the district court order finding that rowell could not establish he was constructively discharged from his position.in young southwestern savings loan association,cir,we adopted the standard for determining whether an employee has been constructively discharged from the national labor relation board constructive discharge doctrine.there,the plaintiff resigned after learning that she was expected to attend mandatory meetings that began with a short religious talk and prayer delivered by a minister.we stated that the general rule is that if the employer deliberately makes an employee working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary resignation,then the employer has encompassed a constructive discharge and is as liable for an illegal conduct involved therein as if it had formally discharged the aggrieved employer.id.at citing nlrb brennan,cir see also calcote texas educational foundation,cir applying same standard to race discrimination claim bourque powell electrical manufacturing,cir in equal pay sex discrimination claim,referring to young and holding that constructive discharge occurs where working conditions would have been so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee shoes would have felt compelled to resign.
in downey southern natural gas company,cir.unit b june,we addressed for the first time the issue of constructive discharge in the context of a job elimination age discrimination suit.there,the plaintiff,a longtime employee,had sought a transfer to a new facility.he did not receive the job but later learned that a with only three years experience had been selected.the plaintiff testified that the personnel director informed him he had not been chosen because he would only be at the facility for a few years before a replacement would have to be trained due to the plaintiff advanced age.the personnel director also informed the plaintiff that the company did not have anything else for him to do and he was in danger of being discharged because the company did not want to keep him around until the mandatory retirement age of seventy.finally,he was told he would lose his stock benefits if he were discharged by the company.rather than risk the loss of these benefits,the plaintiff requested and was granted early retirement.id.at.the plaintiff then filed su
