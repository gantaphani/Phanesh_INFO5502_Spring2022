this case is before the court on appeal from an order of the florida public service commission psc.the psc order relates to a petition by gtc,gt com gtc to impose a customer surcharge pursuant to section b,florida statutes,for costs incurred following hurricane dennis in.we have mandatory jurisdiction because the order relates to the rates of a public utility providing telephone service.see art.v,b.stat.
background 
gtc is a local telecommunications company that served approximately lines in seventeen exchanges in the florida bend area in.before,incumbent local exchange telephone companies ilecs,such as gtc,were monopolies subject to extensive rate base,rate of return regulation.in,section,florida statutes,was enacted to provide that ilecs electing regulation would be exempt from rate base,rate of return regulation and from the requirements of several statutes under which the psc formerly regulated the company rates.see ch,laws of instead,an ilec rates would be frozen at levels with three means for a rate increase allowance of an inflationary factor beginning in a general increase where there is a compelling showing of changed circumstances and certain allowable increases for nonbasic rates.see.stat.gtc elected regulation under section in.see gtc,garcia,so d.
shortly before hurricane dennis hit florida in,section was amended by the addition of subsection b.this subsection,effective june,provides that damage resulting from a named tropical system occurring after june,constitutes a compelling showing of changed circumstances for which a temporary surcharge may be granted for recovery of those intrastate costs of replacements and repairs caused by the storm.see ch,at,laws of.under the amendment creating section b,an ilec,such as gtc,may file a petition with the psc for a surcharge to be included in its billings to recover intrastate costs and expenses related to repairing,restoring,or replacing lines,plants,or facilities damaged by a named tropical system such as hurricane dennis.
gtc was the first ilec to file a petition under the new storm cost recovery procedures,seeking recovery of costs associated with the repair and replacement of its lines,plants,and facilities damaged by hurricane dennis.included in the hurricane costs sought by gtc were capital costs,labor and engineering costs,and normal operating costs and overhead allocated to storm repair.in total,gtc submitted intrastate costs of for expenses it attributed to work.
gtc sought psc approval to add the statutory maximum of per customer line to billings for one year gtc took the position that the costs and expenses referred to in the statute were all costs and expenses related to the storm replacements and repairs without limitation.public counsel for the citizens of the state of florida public counsel,intervenor below and an appellee here,took the position that section b confers both broad discretion and a duty on the psc to determine which costs are reasonable for approval as a storm surcharge.
after an evidentiary hearing,the psc rejected gtc position that it lacked discretion under the statute to prevent a double recovery or to examine whether costs were incurred within or in excess of normal operating costs.the psc ultimately ruled that gtc could impose only a surcharge to recover a total of in adjusted storm repair costs.gtc now challenges the psc denial of for labor and engineering costs,in capital costs,and its decision to set off against storm costs,which represents federal support reimbursement funds projected to be received by gtc because of gtc storm costs and expenses 
on appeal to this court,gtc asserts that the psc misconstrued its statutory responsibilities by not allowing gtc to impose the maximum surcharge based on all of the costs incurred to repair its lines and restore service following the hurricane.gtc asserts that by virtue of its status as an ilec,whose rates are and not subject to rate base,rate of return regulation,the psc had no authority to determine whether the costs incurred were in excess of its normal operating costs.further,gtc asserts that double or even triple recovery should be irrelevant to the psc inquiry.
the issues in this appeal are whether the psc acted in accord with the legislative mandate of section b and whether there is competent,substantial evidence in the record to support the psc findings and conclusions.the specific statutory construction question that we must resolve in this case is whether the psc correctly interpreted section b as providing the psc with discretion to deny storm surcharge recovery for costs and expenses that the psc finds are not in excess of normal operating costs or normal capital costs,or that are expected to be reimbursed by a federal subsidy.
standard of review 
generally speaking,statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to de novo review.see bellsouth,meeks,so d.the plain meaning of the statute is always the starting point in statutory interpretation.see holly auld,so d.as explained in holly and recited many times by the court 
florida case law contains a plethora of rules and extrinsic aids to guide courts in their efforts to discern legislative intent from ambiguously worded statutes.however,
w hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning,there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.
id.quoting douglass,mcrainey,so.thus,if the meaning of the statute is clear then this court task goes no further than applying the plain language of the statute.however,when a statutory term is subject to varying interpretations and that statute has been interpreted by the executive agency charged with enforcing the statute,this court follows a deferential principle of statutory construction 
an agency interpretation of the statute that it is charged with enforcing is entitled to great deference.see bellsouth telecommunications,johnson,so d.this court will not depart from the contemporaneous construction of a statute by a state agency charged with its enforcement unless the construction is clearly unauthorized or erroneous.

statutory construction of section b 
the agency construction of section,as amended in,was a matter of first impression for the psc.prior to the amendment,one of the grounds provided by section for allowing a local telecommunications company to request a rate increase was by a compelling showing of changed circumstances.stat.the amendment added subsection b specifically for tropical storm damage,and expressly provided that damage resulting from a named tropical system would constitute a compelling showing of changed circumstances sufficient for a company to petition for a temporary rate increase.as enacted,section b,provides in pertinent part 
b for purposes of this section,evidence of damage occurring to the lines,plants,or facilities of a local exchange telecommunications company that is subject to the obligations,which damage is the result of a tropical system occurring after june,and named by the national hurricane center,constitutes a compelling showing of changed circumstances.
a company may file a petition to recover its intrastate costs and expenses relating to repairing,restoring,or replacing the lines,plants,or facilities damaged by a named tropical system.
the commission shall verify the intrastate costs and expenses submitted by the company in support of its petition.
the company must show and the commission shall determine whether the intrastate costs and expenses are reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system.
a company having a fund may recover costs and expenses from its customers only in excess of any amount available in the fund.
the commission may determine the amount of any increase that the company may charge its customers,but the charge per line item may not exceed cents per month per customer line for a period of not more than months.
emphasis supplied.therefore,under section b,the psc must verify the intrastate costs and expenses.further,the company must show and the psc must determine that the costs and expenses are reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system.b.stat.
public counsel and the psc both rely on the portion of the statute that provides that t he company must show and the psc shall determine whether the intrastate costs and expenses are reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system.b.stat.the psc views the plain meaning of section b as authority to exercise broad discretion to allow surcharge recovery of only those costs that it finds are reasonable in relation to the storm,the psc those costs and expenses that are in excess of normal operating costs and normal capital costs,and which are not recovered through some other means.the psc contends that any other statutory interpretation would be unreasonable because it would allow customers to be billed twice for the same costs.additionally,the psc and public counsel assert that because the psc is charged with enforcing this statute,its interpretation as to the meaning of reasonableness for purposes of recovery of hurricane costs is entitled to deference and is not clearly unauthorized or erroneous.
gtc,on the other hand,argues that the phrase reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system in section b is not authorization for the psc to engage in a general reasonableness inquiry,but limits its determination of reasonableness only to determining that the costs were expended in repairing damage caused by the named tropical system.gtc further contends that the plain meaning of section b,as evidenced by its text,allows surcharge recovery of all intrastate costs and expenses relating to repairing,restoring,or replacing the lines,plants,or facilities damaged by a named tropical system.gtc submits that the only limitations which may be imposed are those stated in subsections through,none of which expressly disallow recovery of costs on the basis that they involve labor and engineering,prudent replacement practices,normal capital costs,or offsets for federal subsidy funds.
because the phrase reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system is subject to differing interpretations,we conclude that the statute is ambiguous as to the scope of the psc authority to disallow expenses and thus statutory interpretation is appropriate.the psc interprets the statutory provision reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system as imposing on it an obligation to scrutinize costs for reasonableness and in a manner that will avoid double recovery,thereby allowing recovery only for costs that exceed normal operating costs and normal capital costs.this interpretation is a reasonable view of the statute and the psc role in administering it.we reject gtc contention that this interpretation is clearly unauthorized or erroneous.level commc ns,so d at.as explained by the psc in its order 
we find the phrase reasonable under the circumstances allows us great latitude in determining the methodology and factors that should be taken into consideration when reviewing the petitioner request.we also find that this statute was enacted to assist the petitioner in defraying additional costs caused by extraordinary circumstances,specifically tropical storms.
one of the main goals of this statute is to assist the petitioner financially.accordingly,the reasonable clause implicitly ensures that storm related cost recovery should be based on expenditures incurred over and above normal operating expenditures.it is highly unlikely that the legislature intended,through section,florida statutes,to reimburse companies for costs that they would have incurred regardless of whether a storm had occurred or not.
because this is a reasonable construction,we apply the rule of statutory interpretation that requires us to defer to the psc expertise and its interpretation of the provision.
we do not,however,rely only on the principle of deference.we must also consider the principle of construction that parts of a statute are not read in isolation.it is axiomatic that all parts of a statute must be read together in order to achieve a consistent whole.forsythe longboat key beach erosion control,so d.the psc interpretation of the scope of its discretion is supported by another provision contained in section b.section b provides that t he commission may determine the amount of any increase that the company may charge its customers,but the charge per line item may not exceed cents per month per customer line for a period of not more than months.emphasis supplied.the discretionary nature of the phrase,may determine the amount of any increase,supplies additional support for the interpretation reached by the the psc is invested with discretion to determine what amount of storm recovery costs are reasonable to be charged to the consumer.
support for the psc interpretation is also found in a related statutory provision contained in chapter.section a,florida statutes,requires the psc to p rotect the public health,safety,and welfare by ensuring that basic local telecommunications services are available to all consumers in the state at reasonable and affordable prices.that provision directs the psc to exercise its jurisdiction in order to protect consumers,in part,by ensuring the availability of telecommunications services at reasonable prices.this court has previously recognized that the psc authority ilecs derives in part from the legislative mandate contained in section a.see crist jaber,so d,gtc,so d at.gtc reading of section b,in a manner that would divest the psc of any discretion to determine the reasonableness of costs sought,is contrary to the psc authority to ensure the availability of reasonably priced telecommunications services.
gtc has also characterized the psc determination of what costs are reasonable for recovery under section b as an improper rate base,rate of return analysis that is inapplicable to gtc,a entity.however,that argument was rejected in gtc when gtc previously challenged the extent of the psc authority in matters involving companies.as we explained in gtc,other provisions in chapter support the conclusion that the legislature intended for the psc to retain certain powers with respect to ilecs 
for example,section still gives the commission broad regulatory powers with regard to the telecommunications industry.see.stat.it is the legislative intent to give exclusive jurisdiction in all matters set forth in this chapter to the florida public service commission in regulating telecommunications companies,and such preemption shall supersede any local or special act or municipal charter where any conflict of authority may exist.additionally,section a i defines the commission scope of authority,including the power to protect the public health,safety,and welfare,the power to promote competition,and the power to e liminate any rules regulations which will delay or impair the transition to competition.indeed,the last two jurisdictional provisions,promoting competition and eliminating rules were added by the legislature.see ch,laws of.importantly,nothing within section indicates that companies are exempt from the provisions in section.
id.at emphasis supplied.
in this case,reading section a the psc shall exercise its jurisdiction to ensure telecommunications services are available at reasonable prices together with section b the psc shall determine whether the costs are reasonable under the circumstances of the storm and section b the psc may determine the amount of any increase,further supports the psc construction of the statute as providing it with discretion to determine what storm costs may reasonably be passed on to the consumer.
the psc also noted in its order that the senate staff analysis and economic impact statement for the amendment was in accord with its own interpretation of legislative intent for that provision.the senate staff analysis for section b stated 
the committee substitute requires that the company show,and the commission determine,whether costs and expenses are reasonable under the circumstances.traditionally,for industries,the commission would apply a prudent and reasonable test to ensure,for example,that costs are not double recovered,are booked to the appropriate costs accounts,and are necessary for the restoration process.the proposed language implies a similar type of review.
senate commerce consumer services,cs for cs for sb,staff analysis april.certainly,while not determinative of final legislative intent,it is one touchstone of the collective legislative will,white state,so d,on which the psc relied for confirmation of its own interpretation of the statute.in this case,given an ambiguous statute and our utilization of several principles of statutory construction,the staff analysis serves merely as confirmation of the reasonable interpretation employed by the psc 
gtc contends that the psc erroneously relied on the staff analysis and then points to section n,florida statutes,as support for its argument that the legislature did not intend for the psc to apply a reasonableness test under section b.section n is a cost provision that pertains to electric utilities and was enacted during the same legislative session as was section b.see ch,at,laws of.section n is found within an extensive and detailed regulatory framework and provides for adjustment of costs for rate base,rate of return regulated electric utilities,as follows 
n costs means,at the option and request of the electric utility,and as approved by the commission costs incurred or to be incurred by an electric utility in undertaking a activity.such costs shall be net of applicable insurance proceeds and,where determined appropriate by the commission,shall include adjustments for normal capital replacement and operating costs,lost revenues or other potential offsetting adjustments.
emphasis supplied.this provision evidences legislative intent to limit the costs under section for rate base,rate of return regulated electric utilities to those costs and expenses that exceed normal overhead or normal capital replacement.
in comparison,the provision for storm cost recovery procedures for ilecs found in section b contains no similar roadmap for calculating the storm recovery costs for ilecs such as gtc.gtc argues that because the legislature included no similar limitations in section,it intended no limitations on the storm costs that can be recovered under that section,other than the expressly stated limitation concerning a fund,which is not applicable here.the psc contends,on the other hand,that section b provides the psc greater discretion in the determination of reasonableness of storm cost recovery than does section because it does not limit the exercise of discretion to enumerated factors.we agree with the psc that the storm cost recovery provisions contained in section b for companies do not eliminate the ability of the psc to exercise discretion to determine the reasonableness of claimed costs under the circumstances for the tropical system.
the psc construction of the storm cost recovery provisions of section b that prevents consumers from paying for all those costs and expenses normally covered by their regular rates and once again for the same costs and expenses in a storm recovery within the overall goal of section a.further,the psc construction is founded on the text of section b,and is a reasonable interpretation of a statute that is within the psc broad regulatory authority.gtc has not carried its burden of showing that the psc construction of section b is clearly unauthorized or erroneous.
disallowance of specific expenses 
we next address gtc arguments relating to the psc denial of storm surcharge recovery for certain specified costs and expenses a plant and engineering labor expenses b capital costs and c universal service fund.in so doing,we remain mindful of our standard of review 
t he commission factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness.
to overcome these presumptions,a party challenging an order of the commission on appeal has the burden of showing a departure from the essential requirements of law and the legislation controlling the issue,or that the findings of the commission are not supported by competent,substantial evidence.this court will approve the commission findings and conclusions if they are based upon competent,substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous.

a plant and engineering labor expenses 
gtc challenges the psc disallowance of recovery for plant and engineering and labor expenses in the amount of.the testimony of gtc regional controller,mark ellmer,established that gtc petition included costs for normal material and labor,costs of construction,wages and benefits,budgeted overtime labor,regular time labor,and overhead.public counsel expert testified that because gtc submitted invoices of total costs,and not extraordinary costs over and above normal operating costs and normal capital costs,there was no way to verify the extraordinary costs that might be considered recoverable under the psc interpretation of the statute.
the psc disallowed these labor and engineering expenses because it found that they were included within normal business operations and would have been incurred without the storm.the psc concluded in its order that 
gt com labor costs should not be included in the amount to be recovered through a storm charge as the company is already recovering this amount through its normal business operations.witness ellmer agreed during cross examination that its labor costs that were included in gt com storm cost recovery request amount,would have been incurred by the company regardless of whether hurricane dennis had occurred.the cost included for labor,therefore,was not incurred as an extraordinary amount related to hurricane dennis.since the labor costs would have been incurred by gt com regardless of whether hurricane dennis had occurred,it is not reasonable for the company to recover these costs through the storm charge recovery mechanism.
it should be noted that,although the psc denied recovery of costs it found were included in normal business operations,it did allow recovery of expenses for contracted labor.
gtc contends that the psc should not be concerned with whether the costs sought are already covered by normal operating costs and expenses.gtc asserts that the possibility of double recovery is irrelevant under the statute because its rates are not based on rate base,rate of return regulation.we have already rejected this argument in construing the statute.moreover,gtc presented no evidence that as a result of using labor to make the extensive repairs,it suffered any additional costs or incurred overtime expenses over and above its normal costs.therefore,in this case gtc failed to carry its statutory burden of establishing that the labor and engineering costs and expenses are reasonable under the circumstances for the named tropical system.b.stat.
other than advancing its interpretation of the statute as a basis for reversal,gtc has not overcome the presumption of correctness accorded to the psc orde
