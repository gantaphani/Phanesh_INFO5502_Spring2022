the key issue presented in this petition for review is whether the federal communications commission exceeded its authority,under section c a of the communications act of,when it issued an order that preempted the states from requiring or prohibiting the use of line items in customer billing for cellular wireless services.c a see and billing format,ass of state util.consumer advocates petition for declaratory ruling regarding,hereinafter second report and order or the order.the commission argues,on the one hand,that the regulation of billing involves rates charged for cellular wireless services,which is the exclusive province of federal regulation.c a.representatives of state interests argue,on the other hand,that the regulation of billing involves other terms and conditions of cellular wireless services,which are regulable by the states.id.
this appeal also addresses three threshold issues whether,under the hobbs act,this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the petition filed by the vermont public service board the vermont board whether the national association of regulatory utility commissioners the state utility regulators may participate as an intervenor and whether the national association of state utility consumer advocates the state consumer advocates has standing to petition for review.as to the threshold issues,we dismiss the petition of the vermont board because it is not a party aggrieved by the second report and order,but we allow the state utility regulators to continue as an intervenor and deny the motion to dismiss the petition of the state consumer advocates,which have standing as a consumer of wireless service.
on the key issue,we grant the petitions for review because we conclude that the commission exceeded its authority when it preempted the states from requiring or prohibiting the use of line items.the scope of federal authority to regulate rates or entry does not include the presentation of line items on cellular wireless bills.c a.this billing practice is a matter of other terms and conditions that congress intended to be regulable by the states.id.
background 
the state consumer advocates filed a petition with the commission that requested a prohibition on the use of line items by cellular wireless carriers unless the line item is mandated by state or federal law.in response to this petition,the commission issued an order that amended the rules of the commission,preempted the states from requiring or prohibiting the use of line items in customer billing for wireless service,and proposed further rulemaking to preempt the states from the regulation of billing practices of wireless service providers.the state consumer advocates and the vermont board petition for review of the order by the commission.sprint nextel and cingular wireless llc collectively,the carriers intervene in support of the commission,and the state utility regulators intervene in support of the vermont board.
to explain the context of this appeal,we address three preliminary matters.we first describe the enactment and amendment of the communications act and the promulgation of the rules.we next discuss the petition for declaratory ruling filed by the state consumer advocates and the second report and order issued by the commission in response to that petition.we then discuss motions filed by the carriers and the commission to dismiss the petitions of the vermont board and the state consumer advocates.
a.the communications act of and the rules 
the communications act of,to,was enacted for the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio.id.the act vested the commission with the authority to regulate radio frequencies used in wireless services.id.in,congress amended the communications act to create a new regulatory class called commercial mobile radio service,which is any mobile service that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available to the public or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public.id.d.the amendment granted the federal government exclusive authority to regulate the rates charged and entry of wireless carriers.see id.c a.although the states were prohibited from regulating rates or entry,the amendment provided that the states could continue to regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service.id.
in may,in response to a growing concern with consumer fraud in the provision of telecommunications services,the commission promulgated the rules.in re and billing format,hereinafter first report and order.the stated purpose of the rules was to ensure that consumers are provided with basic information they need to make informed choices in a competitive telecommunications marketplace,while at the same time protecting themselves from unscrupulous competitors.id.at.the rules required consumer telephone bills to be clearly organized,clearly identify the service provider,and highlight any new providers contain full and descriptions of charges and contain clear and conspicuous disclosure of any information the consumer may need to make inquiries about,or contest charges,on the bill.id.at.
the commission exempted wireless service providers from several of these rules,id.at,but the commission required,among other things,that the name of the service provider associated with each charge be clearly identified on the bill and that each bill should prominently display a telephone number that customers may call in order to inquire or dispute any charge contained on the bill.id.at.the commission sought further comment on whether the rules should be applied to wireless service providers.id.at.
b.the state consumer advocates and the second report and order 
the state consumer advocates are state agencies designated by laws of their respective jurisdictions to represent the interests of utility consumers before regulatory agencies and in the courts.the state consumer advocates petitioned the commission for a declaratory ruling that prohibited wireless telecommunications carriers from imposing any separate line item or surcharge on a customer bill that was not mandated or authorized by federal,state or local law.second report and order,at.a line item is a discrete charge identified separately on an end user bill.id.at.according to the state consumer advocates,the use of line items that were not required by federal or state law violated the rules and the communications act because these line items do not allow customers to accurately assess what they are being billed for or permit customers to determine whether the amounts charged conform to the price charged for service.id.at.
in response to the request for a declaratory ruling filed by the state consumer advocates,the commission issued a notice that solicited comments regarding the petition.the notice stated that the commission seeks comment about whether telecommunications carriers should be prohibited from imposing monthly charges,surcharges or other fees on customers bills unless such charges have been expressly mandated by a regulated agency.ass of state util.consumer advocates petition for declaratory ruling regarding,wl public notice.comments were submitted by wireless carriers,the state utility regulators,the state consumer advocates,and individual consumers.many consumers submitted brief comments that expressed confusion and dissatisfaction with their monthly telephone bills.
after the public comment period closed,during the permit but disclose proceedings,see,the commission received ex parte presentations and letters.on march,the state utility regulators provided notice of oral and written ex parte communications with the members of the commission.also on march,the vermont board sent an ex parte letter addressed to the five members of the commission.on march,the period closed,and communications with the commission were no longer permitted.see id.on that date,the vermont board electronically filed notice of the ex parte letter it had sent on march,but the clerk of the commission excluded the letter because it was received during the sunshine agenda period,and is associated with,but not made part of the record.
on march,the commission issued its conclusions in an order that addressed three issues.first,in a second report and order,the commission amended or clarified the rules and applied these rules to wireless service providers.second report and order,at.second,in a declaratory ruling,the commission denied the petition filed by the state consumer advocates and preempted the states from requiring or prohibiting the use of line items on monthly telephone bills by wireless service providers.id.at.third,the commission requested a second further notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed to adopt new rules in the billing practices of wireless service providers.id.at.
as to the first issue,the commission reviewed the history of the rules and concluded that wireless service providers should no longer be exempt from the requirement that billing descriptions be brief,clear,and in plain language.id.at see also b.the commission found that the increasing number of consumer complaints to this commission and state regulatory agencies regarding wireless billing practices provides empirical evidence that application of the rules to wireless service providers is necessary and in the public interest.second report and order,at.the commission emphasize d that the application of the rules to wireless service providers did not limit states authority to enforce their own generally applicable consumer protection laws,to the extent such laws do not require or prohibit use of line items.id.at.
as to the second issue,the commission denied the petition filed by the state consumer advocates because nothing in the order prohibits carriers from using line items.id.at.although the commission found that consumers and state regulatory agencies were confused about the use of line items,the commission recognize d that overbroad state regulations may frustrate our federal rules and the federal objective of minimizing regulatory burdens on the competitive wireless service provider industry.id.at.the commission stated that it is permissible for carriers to recover regulatory costs so long as they do so in a manner that complies with the rules,but it is a misleading practice for carriers to state or imply that a charge is required by the government when it is the carriers business decision as to whether and how much of such costs they choose to recover directly from consumers through a separate line item charge.id.at.
the commission also concluded that state regulations requiring or prohibiting the use of line items constitute rate regulation and are preempted under section c a of the act.id.at.the commission explained that rates included rate levels,rate structures,and rate elements.id.at.after describing line items as a rate element,the commission reasoned that the prohibition or requirement of line items directly affect s the manner in which the wireless service provider structures its rates.id.at.
the commission distinguished the ability of the states to mandate or prohibit line items from the ability to impose taxes,state universal service support charges,and other disclosure laws,which the commission left undisturbed.id.at.the commission explained that requiring or prohibiting the use of line items has a direct effect on the ability of wireless service providers to structure rates,but other state regulations have an indirect effect on a company behavior.id.at quoting wireless consumers alliance order.the commission stated that it may not always be clear whether line item regulation is preempted by section c a,and it was necessary to look to the substance,and not merely the form of the line item.id.
the commission premised its decision to preempt state regulation on the,deregulatory framework for wireless service providers prescribed by congress.id.at.the commission stated,congress has directed that the rate relationships between wireless service providers and their customers be governed by the mechanisms of the competitive marketplace.id.quoting wireless consumers alliance order,at.because wireless service providers have come to structure their offerings on a national or regional basis,state laws that prohibit or require the use of line items would result in a patchwork of inconsistent rules that conflict s with federal policies.id.
as to the third issue,the commission solicited comments about the role of states in regulating billing and other issues.id.at.the commission sought comments about whether other state regulation of billing practices was preempted by the communications act.id.at.the commission explained that limiting state regulation of billing practices by wireless service providers will eliminate the inconsistent state regulation that is spreading across the country,making nationwide service more expensive for carriers to provide and raising the cost of service to consumers.id.at.
the state consumer advocates and the vermont board filed petitions for review of the order.the state utility regulators intervened in support of the vermont board.sprint nextel and cingular wireless,public corporations that provide cellular wireless services,intervened in support of the commission.
motions filed after the petition for review 
after the state consumer advocates and the vermont board petitioned for review of the order,the commission moved to dismiss both the petitions of the state consumer advocates and the vermont board.the commission argued that the state consumer advocates lacked standing to petition for review on behalf of its members because the state consumer advocates failed to establish that at least one of its members meets the minimal article iii prerequisites for standing to sue.the commission contended that we lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition of the vermont board because it was not a party to the agency proceedings under the hobbs act.the carriers supported the motion to dismiss of the commission.
the vermont board responded that it was a party aggrieved because it had participated in the proceedings,or alternatively,was a party because the commission expressly subjected the vermont board to its order.first,the vermont board argued that it had participated in the commission proceedings because it both submitted comments in the first order,which had the same agency docket number,and sent an ex parte letter to the commissioners on march that was deemed untimely by the clerk of the commission.the vermont board moved to correct the administrative record by including the ex parte letter.second,the vermont board argued that even if it had failed to participate in the agency proceedings,it could petition for review because it was directly bound by the order.
the state consumer advocates responded that their association has standing to challenge the order either on behalf of its members or as a consumer of wireless service.the state consumer advocates argued that they have associational standing because the members of the state consumer advocates are charged by state statutes to advocate on behalf of consumers.in support of this argument,the state consumer advocates submitted affidavits from three individual members of the state consumer advocates who are consumers of wireless telecommunications service.the affidavits stated that the preemption order will make it difficult to enact new state laws that are necessary to protect wireless customers from unreasonable,misleading,deceptive or illegal line item fees and charges.the state consumer advocates attached the affidavit of john perkins,the president of the state consumer advocates,who testified,nasuca is itself a consumer of telephone services all of the monthly bills for service received by the state consumer advocates contain line items.
in response to these arguments,the commission moved to withdraw the motion to dismiss the state consumer advocates,but continued to move for dismissal of the vermont board.the carriers then submitted their own motion to dismiss the petition of the state consumer advocates on the same grounds the commission had argued in its withdrawn motion.we granted the motion by the commission to withdraw its motion to dismiss the petition of the state consumer advocates,and we ordered that the motions to dismiss the petitions of the state consumer advocates and the vermont board be carried with the case.the motion of the vermont board to correct the administrative record was also carried with the case.
ii.standard of review 
we review our subject matter jurisdiction de novo.williams best buy,cir.we review whether a party has standing to challenge an order de novo.bochese town of ponce inlet,cir,cert.denied,d.we review the authority of the commission to regulate under the communications act based on the standard enunciated in chevron natural resource defense council,d.
iii.discussion 
before we address the petitions for review,we must consider issues about our jurisdiction.we first address whether the vermont board is a party aggrieved by the order under the hobbs act.because we conclude that the vermont board is not a party aggrieved,we next consider whether the state utility regulators may continue as intervenors.we then address whether the state consumer advocates have standing to petition for review of the order.after we conclude that the state consumer advocates and the state utility regulators have standing,we then turn to the merits of the petitions for review whether section c a expressly preempted the ability of the states to require or prohibit the use of line items by wireless service providers.
a.the vermont board is not a party aggrieved under the hobbs act.
the communications act provides,any proceeding to enjoin,set aside,annul,or suspend any order of the commission shall be brought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in the hobbs act.a.the hobbs act vests exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of appeals to determine the validity of all final orders of the commission.any party aggrieved by the final order may file a petition to review the order id.a party aggrieved is one who participated in the agency proceeding.power fcc,cir.a nonparty to the proceeding of the commission must file a petition for reconsideration as a condition precedent to judicial review of the order.a.
the vermont board presents three arguments that it is a party aggrieved by the order.first,the vermont board contends that,because it participated in the first report and order,which shares the same docket number as the second report and order,it has participated in the proceedings.second,the vermont board argues that it is a party aggrieved because it submitted an ex parte letter to the members of the commission,which the vermont board alleges was erroneously excluded from the administrative record.as part of this argument,the vermont board moves to correct the administrative record by including the ex parte communication.third,the vermont board argues that even if it did not participate in the proceedings,it may challenge the order because it is subject to the order and its arguments challenge the authority of the commission.we address each argument in turn and conclude that each argument fails.
participation in the first report and order does not render the vermont board a party aggrieved.
the vermont board argues that the comments it submitted in the proceedings for the first report and order confer party status on it to petition for review.because the docket number for the first report and order,docket,is the same as the second report and order,the vermont board argues that it is a party aggrieved under the hobbs act.we disagree.
the reliance by the vermont board on the docket number to argue that it is a party aggrieved by the second report and order is misplaced.under the hobbs act,a ny party aggrieved by the final order may petition for review.although the first and second orders and report share the same docket number,the hobbs act confers party status on those who participated in proceedings that led to the order under review.see.power,at.
the vermont board is not a party aggrieved by the final order because the vermont board petitions for review of the second report and order.regardless of the docket number assigned to the proceeding,the vermont board had to be a participant in the proceedings that led to the second report and order to be a party aggrieved.id.the comments that the vermont board submitted in the proceedings that led to the first report and order are immaterial those comments make the vermont board a party aggrieved by the first report and order,but they do not make the vermont board a party aggrieved by the second report and order.see simmons icc,stating that the petitioner was not a party aggrieved where the petitioner participated in a proceeding that was procedurally and substantially independent from the challenged order.
the ex parte letter submitted by the vermont board failed to comply with regulations issued by the commission.
the vermont board also contends that it participated in the commission proceeding because it submitted an ex parte letter that it asserts was erroneously excluded from the administrative record.the commission did not include the letter in the administrative record because the vermont board electronically submitted notice of the letter during the sunshine period when no communication was allowed with the commissioners.see a.the vermont board moves to correct the administrative record by including the letter.we address the motion filed by the vermont board before we consider whether the ex parte letter is sufficient to confer the vermont board with party status.
we have discretion to correct the administrative record to supply any omission from the record or correct a misstatement.fed.b.an administrative record consists of the order sought to be reviewed or enforced,the findings or reports on which it is based,and the pleadings,evidence and proceedings before the agency.fed.a.we may deny a motion to correct the record where,among other reasons,the proffered item does not fall within the definition of the record,see deukmejian nuclear regulatory comm n,the proffered item is immaterial or incomplete.tissue ctr.of of sullivan,cir,or the agency did not have the opportunity to consider the evidence,see altawil ins,cir.
the regulations of the commission provide that ex parte presentations are allowed during the period of the agency proceeding.a.ex parte presentations shall be included in the administrative record if the presentation includes a cover letter and shall clearly identify the proceeding to which it relates,including the docket number,if any,shall indicate that two copies have been submitted to the secretary,and must be labeled as an ex parte presentation.b.to be considered,ex parte communications must comply with these provisions.see id.a.
the vermont board concedes that its electronic submission on march failed to include a cover letter to explain that it provided notice for the march ex parte letter.there was no way for the commission to discern that the letter electronically filed on march disclosed an ex parte communication that timely had been submitted to the five commissioners.because the electronic submission failed to identify that it disclosed an ex parte letter submitted on march,it is not properly part of the record that the agency should have included.id.b stating that the cover letter that provides notice must be labeled as an ex parte presentation see deukmejian,at in discharging their obligation to monitor agency action,courts review a record compiled by the agency and containing its rationale and supporting findings.the commission followed its regulations when it excluded the ex parte letter from the administrative record.
we deny the motion to supplement the record with the ex parte letter.we must give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations,thomas jefferson shalala,d,and the commission was not arbitrary and capricious when it excluded the letter from the administrative record,a.the vermont board did not participate in the proceedings by submitting the letter.power,at.
no exception exists to allow the vermont board to petition for review of the order.
the vermont board alternatively argues that,even if it did not participate in the proceedings,it is a party entitled to petition for review of the order for two reasons.first,the vermont board contends that it is a party aggrieved because it is subject to the order.second,the vermont board argues that party status is not required when the agency has acted beyond its authority.
the argument that the vermont board may petition for review because it is subject to the order fails because the vermont board misunderstands the scope of our jurisdiction.the hobbs act confers on the courts of appeals subject matter jurisdiction to review the orders of administrative agencies.since petitioners were never parties to the rulemaking proceedings,this court simply does not have jurisdiction over their claim.gage atomic energy comm n.the cases cited by the vermont board are inapposite because they involve the extension of personal jurisdiction,gilchrist cap,cir,titanic,haver,cir,or the relaxation of prudential standing requirements,devlin scardelletti,d.these cases do not allow a court to expand the statutory grant of subject matter jurisdiction to review an agency decision.
the argument that a petitioner need not be a party when the petitioner challenges the authority of an administrative agency runs contrary to our precedent.we have held that a party aggrieved is one who participated in the agency proceeding.power,at.in support of its argument,the vermont board cites two decisions from the fifth circuit,see wales,icc,cir am.trucking ass ns,icc,cir,but we are bound by our decision that a petitioner must be a party aggrieved without regard to the type of challenge the petitioner seeks to bring.power,at baros.mexican ry,cir stating that the exception to party status discussed in american trucking ass ns has been squarely rejected by some of our sister circuits rail steering comm.surface transp,cir concluding that the discussion in american trucking ass ns is dictum and wales transportation erroneously relied on american trucking ass ns.the vermont board is not a party aggrieved entitled to petition for review of the order by the commission.
we grant the motion by the commission to dismiss the petition of the vermont board.neither the participation of the vermont board in the first report and order nor the ex parte letter that was procedurally deficient confer party status on the vermont board,and no exception excuses the failure of the vermont board to participate in the proceedings of the commission.we lack jurisdiction to consider the petition filed by the vermont board.
b.the state utility regulators may proceed as an intervenor.
although we dismiss the petition of the vermont board,the state utility regulators may continue as an intervenor.intervention can not create jurisdiction if none existed before,charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed,but we have discretion to treat intervention as a separate action,especially when the intervenor has an independent basis for jurisdiction,atkins state bd.of educ.of,cir per curiam see wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,at see also fuller volk,cir.because the state utility regulators participated in the proceedings by submitting comments and notice of ex parte communications,the state utility regulators have independently established their status as party aggrieved.we exercise our discretion to allow the state utility regulators to continue in the petition for review.
c.the state consumer advocates have standing to petition for review.
the constitution of the united states limits the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and controversies,art.iii.t he core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the minimum requirements for constitutional standing are injury in fact,a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,and that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.at.on a motion to dismiss,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice.id.at.at.
the carriers move to dismiss the petition of the state consumer advocates for failure to establish associational standing.the carriers contend that the state consumer advocates can not establish that at least one of their members has suffered particularized injury and only the member agencies of the state consumer advocates have the authority to petition for review.the state consumer advocates argue that we need not address this argument because they have standing on an alternative ground.
the state consumer advocates argue that they need not rely on associational standing because they are a consumer of wireless telecommunications services that receives bills.the affidavit submitted by the state consumer advocates from the president of their organization stated,nasuca is itself a consumer of telephone services,both wireline and wireless.it presently has wireline service with verizon and and wireless service with verizon wireless.all of the monthly bills for service received by nasuca contain line items.
the state consumer advocates have established general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct.lujan,at.at.the state consumer advocates contend that,because the preemption of the commission affects the ability of the states to regulate the disclosure of charges on consumer wireless bills,the order adversely affects the interests of the state consumer advocates as a consumer of wireless service.the complaints of the state consumer advocates are redressable by granting the petition and vacating the order of the commission.that disposition would allow the states to require or prohibit the use of line items by wireless service providers,which the state consumer advocates contend would protect consumers from fraud.
the carriers argue that the state consumer advocates may not rely on their status as a consumer of wireless service as a basis for standing because the state consumer advocates chose not to base their right to seek review on their own receipt of phone bills in the petition for review.we disagree.when ruling on motions to dismiss for lack of standing,federal courts may consider affidavits and other factual materials in the record.see lujan wildlife fed n,d considering affidavits submitted in response to a motion for summary judgment to establish standing,city of dallas,d,overruled in part on other grounds by city of littleton gifts,llc,d s tanding must affirmatively appear in the record.internal quotations and citations omitted emphasis added.because the state consumer advocates have established standing to petition for review as a consumer of wireless service through the affidavit of their president,we deny the motion by the carriers.we next turn to the merits of the petitions for review filed by the state utility regulators and the state consumer advocates.
d.the commission exceeded its authority when it preempted state regulation of billing under section c a.
this constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art vi.the supremacy clause of art.vi of the constitution provides congress with the power to state law.pub.serv.comm fcc,d.a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may state regulation.id.at.at.
where congress has directed an administrator to exercise his discretion,his judgments are subject to judicial review only to determine whether he has exceeded his statutory authority or acted arbitrarily.fid.fed.sav.loan de la cuesta,d quoting united states shimer,d.where a federal agency preempts state law,the inquiry becomes whether the federal agency has properly exercised its own delegated authority rather than simply whether congress has properly exercised the legislative power.new york fcc,d.federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.fid.fed.sav.loan,at.at.
federal law may preempt state law in three ways.first,express p occurs when congress,in enacting a federal statute,expresses a clear intent to state law.pub.serv.comm n,at.at.second,conflict preemption occurs when there is outright or actual conflict between federal and state law.id.third,field preemption occurs where compliance with both federal and state law is in effect physically impossible.id.t he categories of preemption are not rigidly distinct field may be understood as a species of conflict.crosby foreign trade council,d see caleb nelson,preemption.
t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of analysis.cipollone liggett group,d plurality opinion quoting malone white motor,d.a ny understanding of the scope of a statute must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose.medtronic,lohr,d.congress intent may be explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.id.quoting jones rath packing,d.courts interpret the text of the statute and apply traditional cannons of statutory construction to discern the intent of congress.see mci telecomms.am,d see.pub.serv.comm n,at.at.
when we consider issues that arise under the supremacy clause,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not superseded by federal law unless preemption is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.cliff payco am.credits,cir.although the constitution makes a few of the federal government powers exclusive,the states retain concurrent authority over most of the areas in which the federal government can act.nelson,supra,at.we accordingly presume that congress does not cavalierly state law.medtronic,at.at.f ederal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion,or that the congress has unmistakably so ordained.lime avocado growers,paul,d.although the presumption against preemption can not trump our review of the order under chevron,this presumption guides our understanding of the statutory language that preserves the power of the states to regulate other terms and conditions.see smiley citibank,d.we apply these principles to determine whether congress granted the commission authority to preempt the state regulation of line item billing.
in the second report and order,the commission preempted state regulation of billing based on the express language of the communications act.see at.the commission concluded that the language of section c a of the communications act prohibit s states from prescribing,setting or fixing rates of wireless service providers.id.at quoting pittencrieff commc ns.the commission explained that e fforts by individual states to regulate wireless service providers rates through line item requirements would be inconsistent with the federal policy of a uniform,national and deregulatory framework of the communications act.id.at.
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.chevron,at.at.first,we consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.to determine if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,courts interpret the language of the statute and apply traditional cannons of statutory construction,see mci telecomms,at.at.the construction put on a statute by the agency charged with administering it is entitled to deference by the courts,and ordinarily that construction will be affirmed if it has a reasonable basis in law,b ut the courts are the final authorities on issues of statutory construction.sec sloan,internal citations and quotations omitted see also chevron,at.at.
second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.at emphasis added.to determine whether a term within a statute is ambiguous,we consider the context in which the term is used.see mci telecomms,at.at explaining that chevron deference applied because contextual indications created ambiguity in the term modify.the interpretation of an ambiguous statute by an administrative agency is given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.at.unexplained inconsistency is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d june.
the commission premised the preemption of state regulation of line item billing on the language of section c a.that provision states that no state or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service,except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a state from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services.c a.the commission found that congress did not specifically define rates,entry,or other key terms in section c a,but explained that rate regulation extends to regulation of rate levels and rate structures for wireless service providers.second report and order,at citing sw.bell mobile.the commission reasoned that the type of state regulations in question reveals that many directly affect wireless service providers rates and rate structures in a manner that amounts to rate regulation.id.at.we disagree with this reasoning.
the language of section c a unambiguously preserved the ability of the states to regulate the use of line items in cellular wireless bills.although the term rates charged is not defined in the communications act,the meaning of this term is clear in this context.a straightforward reading of the complementary phrases regulate entry of or the rates charged and other terms and conditions,c a,evidences the clear and manifest purpose of congress to leave the regulation of line items to the states,cliff,at.
a rate,as defined by the oxford english dictionary,is t he amount of a charge or payment having relation to some other amount or basis of calculation.oxford english dictionary ed.other dictionaries define a rate as a n amount paid or charged for a good or service,black law dictionary ed,or a charge per unit of a commodity,online dictionary,available at last visited june.a s a basic rule of statutory interpretation,we read the statute using the normal meanings of its words.horton homes,united states,cir quoting consol.bank,dep t of,cir.in the absence of an indication to the contrary,words in a statute are assumed to bear their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.walters metro.ed,d quoting pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d.
the prohibition or requirement of a line item affects the presentation of the charge on the user bill,but it does not affect the amount that a user is charged for service.state regulations of line items regulate the billing practices of cellular wireless providers,not the charges that are imposed on the consumer.because the presentation of line items on a bill is not a charge or payment for service,oxford english dictionary ed,it is an other term or condition regulable by the states,c a.
the commission argues that the second report and order is consistent with its previous decisions because the prohibition or requirement of line items directly affect s wireless service providers rates and rate structures in a manner that amounts to rate regulation.second report and order,at.according to the commission,section c a prohibits the state regulation of rate structures and rate levels.id.at.the commission contends that state regulation of the use of line items directly intrudes upon the carrier ability to set rates and establish rate structures for wireless service.this argument fails.
in the second report and order,the commission failed to follow the common definition of rates employed in its previous decisions.the commission has stated that rate is defined in the dictionary as an amount of payment or charge based on some other amount.sw.bell mobile,at.the commission has also rule
