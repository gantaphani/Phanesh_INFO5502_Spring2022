this appeal arises from the denial of a petition for writ of mandate writ petition brought under the california environmental quality act ceqa.pub.resources code,et the writ petition sought to overturn the decision of respondent city and county of san francisco the city to permit real parties in interest and respondents t mobile west corporation,t mobile usa,t mobile resources corporation,and omnipoint communications,collectively t mobile to place sets of wireless telecommunications equipment on existing utility poles,including a pole located near appellants homes the trial court denied the requested relief.we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
on april,t mobile filed an application with the city planning department requesting ceqa review of a series of about proposed wireless telecommunications equipment installations the t mobile.the installations were to be fastened to existing utility poles at locations distributed throughout the city and not concentrated in one particular area.
on august,t mobile applied to the city department of public works for a permit to install wireless equipment the randall street equipment on an existing utility pole in the utility on the block of randall street where residents homes are located.although the planning department had not yet issued its determination of t mobile application for ceqa review of the t mobile project as a whole,t mobile checked a box on the permit application indicating that the installation of the randall street equipment was exempt from ceqa review under a categorical exemption.on august,the permit was issued as requested.
on september,and again on november,the planning department issued certificates of determination that the t mobile project was exempt from ceqa review under a categorical exemption,as set forth in guidelines section,subdivision d the certificates noted that the individual installations would be visible to passersby and observers from nearby buildings,but added that they would not be so visually prominent that they would necessarily be noticed.the installations would be perceived in the context of existing poles and overhead wires that are common throughout the city urbanized environment,so that the incremental visual effect would be minimal.
the randall street equipment was installed in late december.it consists of three inch high,inch wide,inch deep antennas concealed within an enclosure that is affixed at the top of the utility pole and painted to match it,plus four inch high,inch wide,inch deep cabinets and an inch high,inch wide,inch deep power meter,all of which are attached to the pole at different heights 
on february,residents filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief in the san francisco superior court.on february,the court entered an order denying residents petition for writ of mandate.a judgment in favor of t mobile and the city was entered on march,and filed on march,and this timely appeal ensued.
discussion 
failure to conduct ceqa.applicability of class categorical exemption 
residents first argument on appeal is that the city violated ceqa by approving the installation of the randall street equipment without first conducting an environmental review.t mobile counters that no such review was required,because the city correctly determined the installation was categorically exempt from ceqa review.
certain classes of projects have been administratively determined to be exempt from ceqa because they do not have a significant effect on the environment.citation.such classes of projects are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.citation.the determination whether a project is exempt under one of these classes is made as part of the preliminary review process prior to any formal environmental evaluation of the project.citation.where a project is categorically exempt,it is not subject to ceqa requirements and may be implemented without any ceqa compliance whatsoever.citation.save our carmel river monterey peninsula water management dist.th,d save our carmel river.
a governmental agency determination that a particular project is exempt from compliance with ceqa requirements is subject to judicial review under the abuse of discretion standard in ceqa section.citations.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.citation.where the issue turns only on an interpretation of the language of the guidelines or the scope of a particular ceqa exemption,this presents a question of law,subject to de novo review by this court.citations.our task is to determine whether,as a matter of law,the project met the definition of a categorically exempt project.citation.thus as to the question whether the activity comes within the categorical class of exemptions,we apply a de novo standard of review,not a substantial evidence standard.citations.save our carmel river,supra,th at,d see also san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d san lorenzo.in the present case,the city decision that the installation was categorically exempt did not involve the resolution of any factual issue.accordingly,we review the city categorical exemption determination as a question of law.see wollmer city of berkeley th,d wollmer substantial evidence test governs review of factual determination that project is categorically exempt,but does not govern issues of interpretation of relevant statutes and regulations.
in determining that the t mobile project was categorically exempt,the city relied on the set of exemptions commonly referred to as class exemptions.these exemptions apply to the construction and location of limited numbers of new,small facilities or structures installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures and the conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure.guidelines.
courts have approved the application of class exemptions to projects such as the construction of a home in a residential neighborhood association for protection city of ukiah th ukiah,and a addition to an existing structure that was intended for use as a firearms training facility.simons city of los angeles d.the t mobile project fits squarely within the ambit of the class exemptions.residents have not identified any authority under which a similar or analogous project,the installation of small new equipment on numerous existing small structures in scattered locations was held not categorically exempt under the class exemptions.accordingly,we hold that as a matter of law,the t mobile project fell within the scope of the class categorical exemptions under the guidelines.
cumulative impact exception 
the guidelines provide that a project that is categorically exempt under class may nonetheless require review under ceqa if it falls within one of the exceptions to the exemptions.guidelines.one of those exceptions is when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place,over time is significant.guidelines,subd.b see santa monica chamber of commerce city of santa monica th,d santa monica.t he purpose of the requirement that cumulative impacts be considered is to ensure review of the effects of the project in context with other projects of the same type.thus the guidelines expressly provide that c umulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time.citation.save our carmel river,supra,th at,d.
there is a split in the case law regarding the standard of proof and the standard of review applicable to an agency determination whether a project falls within the cumulative impact exception to categorical exemptions.some courts hold that a party seeking to apply an exception must produce substantial evidence showing a reasonable possibility of adverse environmental impact sufficient to remove the project from the categorically exempt class.citations.citations.fairbank city of mill valley th,d,italics added.under this approach,a court will uphold an agency decision if there is any substantial evidence in the record that there will be no significant effect on the environment.banker hill,hillcrest,park west community preservation group city of san diego th,d banker hill,original italics,fn.omitted.
other courts hold that the government agency tasked with ceqa review of a project must apply a fair argument approach in determining whether,under guidelines section,subdivision c,there is no reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment so as to bring the project within the scope of an exception.banker hill,supra,th at,d,italics added see also wollmer,supra,th at,d reviewing court must determine whether record reveals substantial evidence of fair argument of possible significant effect on the environment ukiah,supra,th at,d finding no fair argument to support cumulative impact exception to residence categorical exemption friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection th,d applying fair argument standard to issue whether to require cumulative impact analysis of timber harvest plan.courts that apply this standard independently review the agency determination under guidelines section,subdivision c to determine whether the record contains evidence of a fair argument of a significant effect on the environment.banker hill,supra,th at,d.
in the present case,we need not resolve the question which standard applies.see hines california coastal com.th,d hines.as will appear from the discussion that follows,even under the more environmentally rigorous fair argument approach,residents have not demonstrated that the t mobile project is subject to the cumulative impact exception 
residents argument is that in assessing whether the cumulative impact exception applies to the t mobile project,it is necessary to consider the cumulative impact of all of the telecommunications equipment that t mobile and other similar companies had installed,planned to install,or could install in the future,on all the utility poles located throughout the city.this argument ignores the language in the guidelines limiting the cumulative impact exception to successive projects of the same type in the same place guidelines,subd.b,italics added.this limitation makes sense,because without a limitation as to the location of the projects whose cumulative impact must be considered,agencies deciding whether the exception applies to a project would be required,in every instance,to consider the cumulative environmental impact of all successive similar projects in their jurisdictions,at least,and perhaps regionally or even statewide.if this were the case,the exception would swallow the rule,and the utility of the class exemption would be vitiated.
thus,we reject residents argument that the city was obligated,in determining whether the t mobile project fell outside the class exemption,to consider the cumulative impact of all similar telecommunications installations throughout the entire city and county of san francisco.rather,under the language of the guidelines,residents can prevail only if there is a fair argument that an adverse environmental impact would result from the cumulative impact of successive telecommunications installations in the same place.
the meaning of the term the same place in this context is not.neither party has cited any authority interpreting this language,as used in guidelines section,subdivision b,and our research has disclosed none given the overall purpose and logic of ceqa and the guidelines,we construe the same place to refer to an area whose size and configuration depend on the nature of the potential environmental impact of the specific project under consideration.for example,in determining whether there may be a cumulative impact from an otherwise categorically exempt project that may affect water quality in a stream,consideration must be given to potential similar projects located in the watershed of the same stream.for a project producing noise pollution,the area to be considered would be that within which the noise could be expected to be audible.
in the present case,residents have specified only the t mobile project visual and auditory impacts as the environmental damage they contend resulted from the project.those impacts are inherently limited by the range of human sensory perception.thus,with respect to this project,the cumulative impact exception applies only if the record contains evidence supporting a fair argument that potential future installations of similar equipment are likely to occur within visual or auditory range of an installation included in the t mobile project.
as noted by the city in its determination that the t mobile project was exempt from ceqa,the locations of the installations included in the project were widely dispersed they were distributed throughout the city and not concentrated in one particular area.residents have identified no facts in the record indicating that any of the installations at issue are within visual or auditory range of other similar installations that currently exist or are likely to be created.on the contrary,the only evidence on this issue in the record is the city finding that all of the existing and proposed similar installations by other telecommunications companies were or would be placed separately at different locations so that there were no foreseeable cumulative impacts.accordingly,residents have failed to produce substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the cumulative impact of the t mobile project,when considered together with other similar installations,will have an adverse visual or auditory impact on the environment.
rather,residents argument amounts to a speculation that future installations may occur within sensory range of the installations included in the t mobile project.however,speculation that potential future projects similar to the one under consideration could cause a cumulative adverse impact is not sufficient to negate a categorical exemption.hines,supra,th at,d single family residence did not fall outside categorical exemption due to theoretical possibility that additional residences could be approved for construction in same area.in the absence of evidence supporting a fair argument that future telecommunications installations will likely be located within sensory range of the installations included in the t mobile project,the categorical exemption here is not negated by the cumulative impact exception 
timing of permit issuance 
as noted in the statement of facts,when the city public works department issued a permit allowing t mobile to proceed with the project,the city planning department had not yet issued its certification ceqa exemption certificate that the t mobile project was exempt under ceqa.in addition,the city department of public health dph did not issue its certification dph approval that the t mobile project would produce an acceptable level of radio frequency rf emissions,as required by section of the san francisco administrative code and implementing city regulations,until after the permit had been issued.
residents assert that the city thereby violated its own laws and regulations,as well as ceqa requirement that any required environmental review be completed before an agency approves a project.residents do not dispute that the dph approval was eventually obtained,nor do they challenge the substantive propriety of that approval.residents also fail to note that the record shows the randall street equipment,in particular,was not installed until after both the ceqa exemption certificate and the dph approval had been obtained.indeed,residents have not pointed to any evidence in the record indicating that any of the installations included in the t mobile project were actually carried out before the issuance of the ceqa exemption certificate and the dph approval.nonetheless,residents argue that the city issuance of the permit in advance of the ceqa determination and the dph approval requires that the city approval of the t mobile project be set aside.
