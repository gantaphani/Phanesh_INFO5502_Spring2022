background 
at t is a common carrier subject to the requirements of title ii of the communications act of ca or the act,et.defining common carrier.section of the act prohibits unreasonable discrimination by common carriers in the provision of like communication services.see a.pursuant to that statute,the fcc has promulgated regulations requiring common carriers to provide services to resellers on the same terms that such services are provided to end users.see regulatory policies concerning resale and shared use of common carrier services and facilities,resale rules see also at t fcc,cir upholding the fcc resale rules.
at t offers a service called software defined network sdn which it introduced in in order to provide dedicated network long distance service to large corporations.a few years later,at t began to offer a new technology,switched access,that allows users to access sdn through regular phone lines.through this process sdn calls are sorted and routed through the local exchange carrier,rather than through special dedicated lines.
this innovation had an unintended consequence it enabled a new group of resellers,those with no routing facilities of their own,known as switchless resellers,to provide sdn services to.due in part to at t volume discounts,switchless resellers were then able to provide sdn services to small businesses for less than at t direct price to those same,while still making a profit.see national communications ass v.at t,civ,wl,at march,nca i describing nca resale of sdn.as a result,a large number of switchless resellers began subscribing to sdn in.
at t own customers commercial customers were serviced by a division of at t called the business sales division bsd.initially,switchless resellers resellers were also served by the bsd,but as the volume of resellers increased,at t moved the processing of reseller orders to a division called the channel development operations center cdoc.the cdoc exclusively serviced resellers,while the bsd exclusively serviced commercial customers.
nca,a reseller,signed a subscription agreement with at t on march,and placed its first orders for sdn in april of that year.although at t told nca that it would take approximately three months to set up its sdn network and an additional days to add customers,at t admits that it did not provision nca orders as quickly as it had predicted.by the end of,at t had processed only a fraction of nca orders.in and,its provisioning speed improved.
nca filed this action on march,claiming that at t had unjustifiably favored its own customers over resellers such as nca in processing orders for sdn.after proceedings,its case consisted of various claims that at t had violated.b and a,as well as the fcc resale rules see nca ii,wl,at.a single a discrimination claim is at issue in this appeal.
in support of its a discrimination claim,nca argued at trial that at t answer to the arbitrage threat that resellers posed to its own sdn retail business was to intentionally discriminate against the resellers.it had,for example,given far fewer resources to cdoc than to the bsd.as a result of this and other discriminatory practices,nca argued,orders from resellers took up to nine months to provision,as opposed to to days for orders from commercial customers.at t countered that the deluge of sdn orders it received in and resulted in equal delays for resellers and commercial customers.
on february,the jury,while rejecting nca claims under the resale rules and b,found for nca on its a claim and awarded million in damages.in an opinion filed december,the district court denied at t motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial under.b and.on june,the court entered a supplemental judgment awarding interest in the amount of,for a total judgment of.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo the denial of a motion under rule b,see disanto,cir per curiam,and review the denial of a rule motion for abuse of discretion,see dailey societe generale,cir following a jury verdict,an appellate court will reverse a trial court denial of a new trial motion if the denial constitutes an abuse of discretion.
section a provides 
it shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges,practices,classifications,regulations,facilities,or services for or in connection with like communication service,directly or indirectly,by any means or device,or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person,class of persons,or locality,or to subject any particular person,class of persons,or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.
a.the district court instructed the jury,and the parties do not dispute,that a a claim consists of three elements whether the services are like if so,whether the services were provided under different terms or conditions and whether any such difference was reasonable.see nca ii,wl,at see also mci telecomms.fcc.at t principal arguments on appeal,and the only ones that merit discussion,are that the district court should have granted its motions to dismiss and for a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury a verdict,and the district court erroneously instructed the jury that the burden of proving the third element of a a claim rested with at we disagree with both contentions.
in moving for judgment as a matter of law,at t faces a high bar 
judgment as a matter of law may not properly be granted under rule unless the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the opposing party,is insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find in her favor.in deciding such a motion,the court must give deference to all credibility determinations and reasonable inferences of the jury,and it may not itself weigh the credibility of witnesses or consider the weight of the evidence.thus,judgment as a matter of law should not be granted unless there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture,or there is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded persons could not arrive at a verdict against it.
disanto,at quoting realty dev,cir alterations omitted.
on appeal,at t argues only in passing,and unconvincingly,that the sdn services it provided to resellers and to commercial customers were not like.the district court noted that throughout the trial no one disputed that nca was attempting to purchase the same sdn service that commercial customers purchased.see nca ii,wl,at.the only sufficiency issue,then,pertains to the second element of the a claim whether nca presented enough evidence at trial upon which a reasonable jury could have found that at t discriminated between nca and its commercial customers.
we believe the evidence,although not overwhelming,was sufficient to uphold the jury verdict under our deferential standard.because a reasonable juror could have found a a violation based entirely on evidence that at t unreasonably discriminated between resellers and commercial customers in the time it took to provision sdn services,we find the evidence of disparate delay sufficient to support liability.
as we have mentioned,nca argued at trial that at t processed resellers sdn orders in about nine months,as compared to orders from its commercial customers,which were provisioned in to days.in support of the figure,nca points to testimony indicating that in it took three to six months to provision sdn reseller orders on the network,and an additional three months for sdn usage to be recorded on bills and sent to the ultimate customers.on appeal,at t does not contest the figures for processing reseller orders rather,it argues that its commercial customers experienced the same delays.
however,several pieces of evidence support nca contention that at t processed its commercial customers orders more expeditiously.a memo from john greco,division manager of cdoc,to glenn starr,product manager for sdn,states resellers complaint that at t had been servicing its commercial customers in to days,as opposed to four to five months for resellers.while noting at t management assurances that all sdn customers are currently subjected to long intervals,greco informed starr that he could no longer accept those assurances with confidence and expressed concern that there may be some legitimacy to resellers complaints.in addition,joseph britell,sdn marketing manager,made a marginal note in on a fellow employee draft speech next to a paragraph concerning provisioning intervals stating that since november we have tracked our results which clearly indicate a less than day interval.brittell testified that the figure referred only to commercial customers.moreover,starr agreed at trial that in sdn service for commercial customers was being installed in days,provided that the order did not require many optional features.and finally,a document prepared by ray robinson,operations vice president,noted that in at t had a switched access featureless average cycle time of days.
the district court held,and the parties do not dispute,that in order for nca to recover damages,at t conduct must have been willful.nca ii,wl,at.we believe that there was also sufficient evidence on the basis of which a jury could reasonably have found that at t discrimination was willful.
unremarkably,at t viewed resellers as competitors.various testimony and documentary evidence was presented to the effect that at t managers were concerned that resellers had an arbitrage opportunity and were perverting the market.one internal at t memo notes that resellers threaten both the marketing and pricing structures that serve as the foundation of our business.there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that,as a result,at t decided to delay provisioning of sdn services to resellers.in response to a question concerning reseller complaints that their orders were getting installed,britell testified that sdn managers had a strategy to slow that process down by moving the resellers into a separate organization and contain ing them.other evidence indicated a desire on the part of at t to make the sdn market less attractive to resellers,to kill the arbitrage,to elongate provisioning,and to develop roadblocks to sdn resale.
to be sure,at t challenged this evidence and offered evidence to the contrary.but it was the jury task to resolve evidentiary conflicts ours is only to determine on the basis of the evidence presented by nca whether a reasonable jury could have found it more likely than not that at t discriminated between resellers and its own commercial customers in its provisioning of sdn service.we think the evidence was sufficient to support such a finding.
accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of at t b motion for judgment as a matter of law.we also do not disturb the district court denial of at t motion for a new trial pursuant to rule we find that the district court acted within its discretion.
the district court instructed the jury that,while nca would bear the burden of proof on the first two of the three elements that comprise a a claim,at t would bear the burden of proving the last one 
first,nca must prove that both nca and another at t customer or class of customers took services that are like one another.second,if the services in question are like one another,nca must prove that at t provided like services to another customer or class of customers under different terms or conditions than those offered or provided to nca.and third,if nca has proved these first two elements,then at t must prove that any difference in treatment with respect to the like services was not unreasonable or unjust.
nca ii,wl,at emphasis added.at t argues that it was error for the court to have required it to bear the burden of showing that any discrimination was reasonable.
the court of appeals for the circuit has stated in the context that i f the services are like,the carrier offering them has the burden of justifying the price disparity as reasonable.mci,at.because the mci court decided ultimately that the services were not like one another,its discussion of the burdens is dicta.however,in an earlier case,not cited by the parties,the same court held that the fcc did not err when it placed the burden of proof on the carrier to justify a difference in rates for like services.see am.trucking ass ns,fcc.the court in american trucking justified the under as in accord with rulings usually applied when a party comes forward with an affirmative defense to a prima facie illegality.id.at.
the fcc in its amicus brief similarly characterizes a complaining party proof of the first two elements likeness of service and discrimination in establish ing a prima facie case of discrimination requiring a justification from the carrier.the fcc characterization is supported by,among other things,this court recognition in western union int l fcc,cir,that because the two services before us were like,such that they shared a functional similarity,there was good cause to suspect that there was little justification for a large difference in the rates charged.western union,at.
the concept of the shifted burden as an affirmative defense is also found in the context of analogous provisions.in trailways of new england,civil aeronautics,cir,the first circuit court of appeals drew an analogy between the federal aviation act of faa,b,the interstate commerce act of ica,a and b,and the ca,and it held that the shifting of the affirmative burden of showing that the discrimination is justified under faa is analogous to rules under other provisions that place upon the carrier the burden of disproving discrimination by the affirmative defense of competitive need,once the complaining party establishes a prima facie case of discrimination.
persuaded by these authorities and the underlying rationales for assigning burdens,we hold that the district court properly placed the burden on at t to prove that any discrimination between resellers and its commercial customers in the provision of like sdn services was reasonable.see also western union,at o nce the fcc demonstrated a basis for its determination of likeness,the burden shifted to the party defending the disparity in treatment to disprove the discrimination in their favor.american broad.fcc,noting that once likeness and price difference had been shown,the commission shifted the burden to at t to justify the discrimination.
as its amicus brief to this court chronicles the fcc has consistently supported the mci court assignment of burdens in a cases.see,bowles united.of,at panamsat comsat,at allnet communication,west,at in re competition in the interstate interexchange marketplace,at.we find the fcc consistent practice to be persuasive.see aguirre ins,cir following an agency interpretation even though not required to do so by chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
while the reasoning behind assigning such burdens is often obscure,see john strong,mccormick on evidence,at ed there is no key principle governing the apportionment of the burdens of proof see also wilkins am.ex.isbrandtsen lines,cir,here we believe three rationales support placing the burden on at first,all else being equal,the burden is better placed on the party with easier access to relevant information.see ralph winter,the jury and the risk of nonpersuasion,law soc y,mccormick,at charles wright ken
