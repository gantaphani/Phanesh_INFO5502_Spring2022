atlas,total,and appeal different parts of a single order of the federal communications commission.the commission held that atlas,an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec,created total,ostensibly a competitive access provider,as a sham entity solely in order to increase the rates charged to,an interexchange carrier ixc,and thereby engaged in an unjust and unreasonable practice,in violation of b of the communications act of,et.the commission also held that had legitimately blocked calls to total atlas must pay damages to in the amount that paid to atlas for tandem switched transport and is liable to atlas for reasonable access charges.the commission then dismissed counterclaim under the telephone disclosure and dispute resolution act tddra,as moot,without prejudice.
we reject all atlas claims and deny its petition for review.we reject the commission argument that does not have standing to seek review of the order,the preclusive effect of which could prejudice in defending against total pending lawsuit to collect access charges.we grant in part petition for review and remand the order to the commission to consider argument that total did not provide access service and to clarify the effect of its having dismissed counterclaim.
background 
atlas telephone,is the ilec in big cabin,oklahoma,where it serves approximately customers.atlas provides local exchange service to the end users and provides originating and terminating access service to ixcs.total telecommunications services,formed in,offers service to only one customer,audiobridge of oklahoma,which runs a free service allowing multiple callers to dial in and talk to one another.during the relevant time period,a call to audiobridge placed by an customer went through that customer local telephone company to,which provided interexchange service by transporting the call across its network to a point of presence pop located near big cabin and served by southwestern bell telephone company.from the pop,southwestern bell transmitted the call through its facilities to a meet point with atlas,which then carried the call through its tandem switch to total.as the terminating access provider,total completed the call to audiobridge.total provided no local exchange or originating access service.
atlas and total have a close relationship to say the least.the president of atlas is the chairman of total board of directors total received a startup loan from the atlas pension fund total only office is in an atlas building and total leased all its transmission facilities from atlas.
as an ilec,atlas was subject to dominant carrier regulation of its rates and therefore had to get its tariffs preapproved by the commission.to that end,atlas elected to charge the rates in the tariff filed by the national exchange carriers association neca,which prepares and files a joint tariff on behalf of small ilecs.neca participants pool their revenues,and each receives an amount equal to its costs and its pro rata share of all earnings.thus,for calls to audiobridge,atlas charged the tandem switching transport fee in the neca tariff.
in july total,as a carrier,filed its own tariff,which was effective immediately,pursuant to which it charged at a rate percent higher than what atlas was charging under the neca tariff.total then split with audiobridge the revenues total received from.this was audiobridge only source of income.
total began completing calls from customers to audiobridge in august.when received from total unexpected bills for terminating access service in addition to atlas bills for tandem switching transport and found out about the relationship between total and atlas,it first threatened to,and starting on november did,block calls from its customers to audiobridge.also refused to pay total,which had already terminated about million minutes of calls.unbeknownst to,in july total gave audiobridge different numbers that did not block.
on november atlas and total filed suit against in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma.that court referred the case to the commission pursuant to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.see total telecommunications,civ.action.see also reiter cooper,d.atlas and total then brought essentially the same suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia,with the same result.see total telecommunications services,aff.
finally atlas and total filed a complaint with the commission,alleging that blocking calls to audiobridge violated the communications act of.counterclaimed,alleging that atlas and total had violated the act by creating a sham entity and charging unreasonable rates.
the commission denied atlas and total claims,wl order.the commission first concluded that atlas created total as a sham entity designed to impose increased access charges on calls made to audiobridge.id.at.therefore,the commission held,atlas and total had engaged in an unjust and unreasonable practice,in violation of b.order,at.as a consequence,did not have an obligation under a to complete calls to audiobridge through total requests by customers to send traffic to audiobridge via total do not constitute reasonable requests for service for purposes of section a,because they would require to purchase access service that we have previously determined is unreasonably priced and the product of a sham arrangement.id.at.
atlas and total had argued that blocking calls also violated the ixc duty under a to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.the commission rejected that argument,too,reading the text and structure of the act,along with its own regulation defining interconnection,to mean that interconnect refers to a physical linking of two networks,and not to the exchange of traffic between networks.id.at emphasis in original.
the commission denied in part and granted in part counterclaims.whereas had argued that it should pay nothing to atlas and total,the commission concluded that would have to pay a reasonable access charge,which in this case was the fee that atlas would have charged for terminating traffic directly to audiobridge,had total never existed,id.at,and that the neca tariff supplied the appropriate rate.id.at.the commission,however,did not order to pay atlas and total because,it determined,they had failed in their complaint explicitly to state a claim for relief based on the calls made by customers from august to november.id.at.the commission did not advert to possible liability for access charges with respect to calls made by customers to audiobridge after july,when total activated the new numbers.the commission also held that atlas should pay damages to in the amount had paid atlas for tandem switched transport because b ut for its unlawful relationship with total,atlas would not have charged anything at all for tandem switched transport to total.id.at.finally,the commission dismissed as moot,without prejudice claim that atlas and total violated the tddra even if atlas and total violated the tddra,the commission stated,that violation would not vitiate obligation to pay a reasonable access charge for services already provided.order,at.
ii.analysis 
atlas and total,which filed a joint brief,and each challenge various aspects of the order.argues that the commission erred in finding that total was a sham entity interpreting reasonable request in a interpreting interconnect in a ordering atlas to refund tandem switched transport charges and denying total a remedy for refusal to pay for access services.complains that the commission failed to address its claim that total did not provide access service,and argues that the agency arbitrarily resolved its unreasonable rate claim,and erred in dismissing its counterclaim in the nature of a defense under the tddra.we may set aside the order only insofar as it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
a.the petition 
total as a sham entity 
section b of the act declares unlawful any communication common carrier charge,practice,classification,or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable.the commission found that atlas created total as a sham entity designed solely to extract inflated access charges from ixcs,and that this artifice constitutes an unreasonable practice in violation of section b of the act.order,at.does not quarrel with the underlying facts upon which the commission based its determination that total was a sham entity.rather,argues that the fcc finding that total was a sham entity because it was not truly independent of atlas is inconsistent with many past fcc rulings concerning affiliates of dominant carriers,such as those allowing an affiliate to sell cellular or interexchange service.in response,the commission points out that those rulings involved an affiliate offering a competitive service the provision of access service by an ilec,in contrast,is subject to dominant carrier rate regulation,which would be circumvented if an ilec could offer access service through an affiliate.the commission also argues that because total is not independent of atlas,those prior decisions do not apply.
we agree with the commission in both respects.none of the cases cited by supports the proposition that an ilec may create an alter ego to provide access service in the same geographic area as the ilec and thereby avoid regulation as a dominant carrier.if accepted,argument would enable every ilec completely to avoid dominant carrier regulation by a mere artifice.in this respect,it is noteworthy that,although the commission determined that atlas created total to increase access charges for calls to audiobridge,does not argue on appeal that total had any other purpose,or indeed that it had any economic substance at all.clearly,the entire arrangement was devised solely in order to circumvent regulation of atlas as a dominant carrier,deserves to be treated as a sham,and can not benefit from precedents set with respect to legitimate affiliates.
section a reasonable requests 
section a of the act provides that a communications common carrier has a duty to furnish communication service upon reasonable request.a.the commission determined that an customer who called audiobridge was not thereby making a reasonable request for service because would have had to purchase a service that was unreasonably priced and the product of a sham arrangement.order,at.because the congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we must decide whether the commission permissibly construed the statute.chevron usa,natural resources defense council,d.
argues the commission misinterpreted a because refusal to serve customers who wanted to call audiobridge frustrated the goal of universal service assertedly underlying that section.according to,instead of unilaterally blocking calls to audiobridge,should have paid total and then sought a refund by filing a complaint with the commission pursuant to of the act.the commission responds that could legitimately block service because total was a sham entity.
if,as suggests,could not refuse as unreasonable a request for service the provision of which would have required it in turn to procure a service available only at an unreasonable price from a sham entity,then the modifier reasonable in a would have little if any meaning.the inclusion of that term in the statute implies that a common carrier may lawfully deny service to a customer in some circumstances,whatever its effect upon universal service.the question is,were there here such circumstances or,more precisely,could the commission reasonably so conclude surely the answer is yes.
as a rule,grievances are to be raised,as says,via and not by resort to.the commission itself has so stated.see,bell frontier communications services,wl t he proper way for an ixc to challenge a lec rate is to initiate a section proceeding at the commission.here the commission recognized an exception to the rule,that allowing an ixc to block calls when a sham entity is charging it unreasonable rates for access services.if the commission later held that total was not a sham entity or that total had charged reasonable rates,then the agency presumably would have found liable to total for blocking the calls.in other words,by blocking calls to audiobridge was acting at its peril.elkhart telephone,southwestern bell telephone,wl those who choose the course of are on notice that they will be acting at their own peril,should the question of the legitimacy of their refusal to meet their common carrier obligations be decided against them.
the commission decision is not inconsistent with its precedents none of the cases cites for the proposition that first had to file a complaint with the commission involved a sham entity.nor do we see how the seemingly narrow exception for a sham entity charging an unreasonable rate will swallow the rule of,as predicts.the commission specifically declined to address the broader question of what other circumstances might permit an ixc to refuse to purchase,or discontinue purchasing,access service from a competitive lec.order,at.any carrier that engages in,therefore,runs the risk that the commission will find against it even if its underlying position is vindicated and hold it liable solely for engaging in.in these circumstances,the commission judgment that it has not opened pandora box is surely reasonable.
section a interconnect 
section a provides in part that e ach telecommunications carrier has the duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.in the order,the commission interpreted this duty to interconnect as referring solely to the physical linking of two networks,and not to the exchange of traffic between networks.at emphasis in original.
argues that the duty to interconnect in a encompasses the duty to exchange traffic between networks,not just the duty to establish a physical linkage between networks.contends that the history of the requirement of interconnection and the legislative history of both indicate that to interconnect means to exchange traffic,and the meaning given to interconnect in the order a ignores the phrase or indirectly in a,and b does not comport with.we review the commission interpretation of interconnect under the test of chevron,at.at,looking first to the intent of the congress and then,if the term is still ambiguous,determining whether the agency construction of the statute is a reasonable one.here we need not go beyond the first step.
as the commission points out,both the text of a and the structure of strongly indicate that to interconnect and to exchange traffic have distinct meanings.the former section refers only to facilities and equipment,not to the provision of any service.see also competitive telecommunications ass fcc,cir stating of c,by its own terms,this reference is to a physical link,between the equipment of the carrier seeking interconnection and the lec network.the latter section,which establishes pricing standards for agreements between carriers,provides separately for interconnection and network element charges d and for charges for transport and termination of traffic d.section thus contemplates the very distinction between physical linkage and exchange of traffic the commission applied in the order.
argues that the commission definition of interconnect ignores the phrase or indirectly if were not required to exchange traffic with atlas or total,and is not required to establish a physical connection to their facilities,then section a would not require to do anything at all.but has no basis for saying is not required to establish a physical connection with them the commission has never said that,and in fact does connect indirectly with atlas through a meet point established by southwestern bell.nothing in the commission approach,therefore,deprives the term indirectly of a role in the statute.because we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear,ratzlaf united states,d,we do not consider argument that the background of the interconnection requirement and the legislative history of require a different interpretation of interconnect.the commission definition of interconnect in the order faithfully follows the meaning of
