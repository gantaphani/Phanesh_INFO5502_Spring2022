petitioners,worldcom,time warner telecom,and other long distance telephone service providers,seek review of the fcc fifth report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking in in re access charge reform,wl hereinafter order or pricing flexibility order.that order grants local exchange carriers lecs immediate pricing flexibility for some interstate access services and establishes procedures through which lecs may seek substantial additional relief from existing price cap regulation.petitioners maintain that the order is arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law in that it violates the fcc statutory mandate to ensure just and reasonable prices for telecommunication services and promote the public interest.several,qwest,sbc communications,and in support of the fcc.
we hold that the fcc decision to grant additional pricing flexibility to incumbent lecs through a series of collocation based triggers,deregulation of new services,and deaveraging of rates was neither arbitrary and capricious nor contrary to law.the fcc made a reasonable policy determination that collocation was a sufficient proxy for market power in determining whether to grant pricing flexibility to lecs and sufficiently explained the basis for its decision to grant immediate pricing flexibility for some services.for these reasons,we uphold the fcc order and deny the petitions for review.
background 
legal and regulatory context 
in recent years,the fcc has sought to facilitate greater competition in the provision of both and local telephone service.see,fcc,bell atl.fcc,rural telecom ass fcc.competition for telephone services,where it exists,serves the fcc statutory goal of ensuring fair and reasonable prices for telecommunications services.therefore,as telephone markets become more competitive,the fcc has lessened regulatory control over those markets,including the market for interstate access services.it is within this evolving regulatory context that this case arises.
interstate access services 
local telephone service is provided by local exchange carriers.typically,one lec is the dominant,or incumbent,service provider in each local area.until relatively recently,the incumbent lecs had virtual monopolies over the provision of local phone service in their territories.
long distance is,service between local access and transport areas latas or interlata,for the most part,provided by interexchange carriers ixcs,such as petitioners worldcom and.long distance providers are reliant upon lecs to reach their customers.when a customer makes a long distance call,the ixc must have access to the local networks at both the originating and receiving end of the call in order to complete the connection.generally,the lec connects the call from the caller to a switch or end office,which is in turn connected to a serving wire center swc,which is itself connected to an interconnection point,or point of presence pop,with the long distance carrier.this same series of connections will also be made at the receiving end of the phone pop to swc to switch to call recipient.lecs charge the ixcs for providing this access service in accordance with part.ixcs then bill customers directly for long distance calls.
there are two types of access service switched access and special access.switched access service requires the creation of a connection between the caller and the long distance company on a basis.this entails a connection between the caller and a local lec switch,a connection from the lec switch to the swc interoffice transport,and an entrance facility which connects the swc and the long distance company pop.switched access can either be dedicated to a particular ixc dedicated transport or direct trunked transport or shared among ixcs.special access service,on the other hand,uses dedicated lines between the customer and the ixc local pop.switched access is used by most residential customers.most users of special access services are companies with high call volumes.
for quite some time incumbent lecs dominated access service markets.in recent years,however,other companies have begun to enter these markets.market entrants typically provide a portion of full access service,such as from the ixc pop to the swc,in any given market.this development was facilitated by changes in fcc regulations.beginning in,the fcc required incumbent lecs to permit competitors to collocate their equipment at lec wire centers and connect directly to the lec networks as a means of spurring additional competition in access service.see expanded interconnection with local.facilities,wl,reconsidered,wl,vacated in part and remanded in part,bell atl.fcc.now,the fcc believes,there may be sufficient competition for access services to justify deregulatory measures.
regulatory framework 
for years the fcc imposed traditional rate of return regulation on the lecs.beginning in,however,the fcc substituted price cap regulation for the largest lecs.see rural telecom ass n,at.price cap regulation imposes a cap on aggregate prices charged by lecs for certain services in a given area.see.for the purposes of setting the caps,services are grouped in various baskets.see d.these are the common line basket,basket,trunking basket,and special access basket,the latter two of which are at issue in this case.lecs are also required to charge averaged,uniform rates in given service areas,absent substantial cost differentials.see e.this averaging requirement is designed to prevent price discrimination by lecs.
price cap regulation offers more pricing flexibility than rate of return regulation,as companies are relatively free to set their own prices so long as they remain below the cap.a company can raise the price for one service so long as that increase is offset by a price decrease in another.prices that are below upper price bands for a given service are also presumed lawful and given streamlined review by the fcc.see bell atl,at.the fcc implemented price cap regulation for lecs as a transitional regulatory scheme until actual competition makes price cap regulation unnecessary.order.
price cap regulation is supplemented by tariff requirements for dominant carriers including all regional bell operating companies in their local service areas,under which companies are required to publish rate changes before they are implemented.a,a.tariffs must be filed fifteen days in advance of price increases and seven days in advance of price decreases.a.this allows both the fcc and affected customers to review and challenge price changes by lecs.the tariff requirement is waived for those carriers that are deemed because they face substantial competition from other firms.
in,congress enacted the telecommunications act of to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.pub,stat,introductory statement.the act requires incumbent lecs to grant competitors such as the ixcs greater access to their local networks through collocation of facilities,the purchase and resale of unbundled network elements and services,and mandated interconnection.c.in response to the act,the fcc has sought to move toward greater competition for,and less regulation of,telecommunications services.
b.the fcc pricing flexibility order 
on august,the fcc adopted the fifth report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking in in re access charge reform,wl.in accordance with the stated goals of the act,the order granted immediate pricing flexibility for some services and set competition thresholds to trigger additional relaxation of regulatory controls.according to the fcc,the order was the logical next step in the commission ongoing effort to coordinate reduced regulation with competitive developments.brief for federal communications commission at.
immediate pricing flexibility 
the order provides immediate pricing flexibility for lecs in three important respects lecs may introduce new services subject to a streamlined approval process lecs may offer deaveraged rates for services in the trunking basket and interstate interlata and intralata toll services are removed from price cap regulation.order.petitioners challenge the first and second changes as unlawful.
new services are those services that,by definition,expand the range of service options available to consumers.id.previously,an lec needed a waiver to offer a new switched access service that did not fit into the preexisting rate structure.the lec was required to demonstrate that such a waiver was in the public interest.finding that existing new service rules impede the introduction of new services,id,the fcc order eliminates the required public interest showing and allows lecs to file tariffs for new services with only notice.lecs are still prohibited from offering new services outside of price cap regulation.id.
under the fcc regulations,price cap lecs are generally required to geographically average charges for access elements across a given study area typically a state or region.e.disaggregation of charges for specific service access only allowed in up to three zones per lec and only subject to certain conditions,such as intensity of use.under the new rules,lecs may define up to seven zones subject to the requirements that each zone other than the highest price zone accounts for at least fifteen percent of the lec trunking basket revenues in the study area,and annual price increases in a zone can not exceed fifteen percent.order.according to the fcc,this new flexibility enhances the efficiency of the market for those services by allowing prices to be tailored more easily and accurately to reflect costs and,therefore,promotes competition.id.
the pricing flexibility order also removes interlata and intralata toll services from price cap regulation upon an lec implementation of toll dialing parity.see id.toll service is telephone service between stations in different exchange areas for which there is made a separate charge not included in contracts with subscribers for exchange service.when an lec provides toll dialing parity,it permits its local service customers within a given calling area to make a local telephone call notwithstanding the identity of the customer or the called party telecommunications service provider.lecs are required to implement toll dialing parity throughout their service areas.see.upon meeting this requirement for all interlata and intralata toll services,an lec provision of these services is removed from price cap regulation.this portion of the pricing flexibility order is not challenged in this case.
future pricing flexibility 
the fcc order also provides for additional pricing flexibility once an lec shows that certain competitive thresholds triggers have been met in a given metropolitan statistical area msa.according to the fcc,this step is merely the latest effort to allow incumbent lecs progressively greater pricing flexibility as they face increasing competition.order.the triggers measure market competition based upon investments in infrastructure by potential competitors.the fcc stated aim is to balance the benefit of further deregulation with the potential risk of exclusionary behavior or increased prices for consumers.see id.noting that the relief if granted prematurely,might enable price cap lecs to exclude new entrants from their markets,or increase rates to unreasonable levels.therefore,the more relief sought,the higher the trigger is is,a greater level of investment by competitors is required.
the relief comes in two phases.in phase i,lecs may offer contract tariffs and volume and term discounts,while remaining subject to some price cap rules and tariff requirements.in addition,for lecs subject to phase i relief,new tariffs only require one day advance notice as opposed to seven or fourteen days notice under current rules.phase i relief is available upon a showing that competitors have made irreversible investments in the facilities needed to provide the services at issue,thus discouraging incumbent lecs from successfully pursuing exclusionary strategies.id.phase i relief is potentially available for dedicated transport entrance facilities,transport,channel terminations,and common line and services.
in order to obtain phase i relief for dedicated transport services an incumbent lec must show collocation in fifteen percent of wire centers within the msa in which relief is sought,or in wire centers accounting for at least thirty percent of revenues for services in question.id.in addition,at least one competitor must rely on transport facilities provided by a lec in each wire center relied on in the applicant lec petition.phase i relief is available for channel terminations upon a showing of collocation in fifty percent of wire centers within the msa in which relief is sought or in wire centers accounting for at least percent of revenues for services in question.id.the trigger for common line and services is that a competitor must offer service to fifteen percent of incumbent lec customer locations using its own transport and switching facilities.id.
in each case phase i relief is subject to several conditions to prevent price discrimination or other potentially predatory behavior.under phase i,contract tariff rates must be available to all similarly situated customers,and volume discounts must be available to all similarly situated customers willing to make equivalent term commitments.id.incumbent lecs must continue to offer services pursuant to price caps as well.id.finally,lecs remain subject to fcc enforcement actions for anticompetitive behavior.see,id.
in phase ii,lecs are given greater freedom to raise and lower rates outside of price cap regulation.phase ii relief is available for the same services and may be sought once competitors have established a significant market presence in the provision of the services at issue.order.phase ii relief allows lecs to offer services outside of price cap regulation,though lecs must still file generally available tariffs and remain subject to fcc enforcement actions for anticompetitive behavior.
in order to obtain phase ii relief for dedicated transport services an incumbent lec must show collocation in fifty percent of wire centers within the msa in which relief is sought or in wire centers accounting for at least percent of revenues for services in question.id.in addition,as with phase i relief,at least one competitor must rely on transport facilities provided by lecs in each wire center relied on in the applicant lec petition.id.phase ii relief is available for channel terminations upon a showing of collocation in percent of wire centers within the msa in which relief is sought or in wire centers accounting for at least percent of revenues for services in question.id.the fcc has not yet set a collocation trigger for common line and services phase ii relief.
as with phase i relief,lecs must file tariffs and remain subject to fcc enforcement actions for anticompetitive behavior under the relevant statutory provisions.id.the fcc acknowledged that its rule may allow phase ii relief before the manifestation of actual competitive alternatives for interstate access service customers but that the costs of delaying regulatory relief outweigh the potential costs of granting it before ixcs have a competitive alternative for each and every end user.id.
both phase i and phase ii relief are available on an basis.this is because,according to the fcc,msas best reflect the scope of competitive entry,and therefore are a logical basis for measuring the extent of competition.id.relief is not available on a rural service area basis.rather relief is available for the parts of a study area typically one or more rural service the triggers are satisfied for the entire area.id.the fcc acknowledges the theoretical possibility that granting relief on an basis could enable lecs to engage in predatory behavior.id.however,the commission concluded the costs,particularly the administrative costs,of granting pricing flexibility on a wire center basis outweigh the benefits of protecting against such theoretical harms.id.the commission declined to provide relief on a lata basis,as in some states the relevant lata encompasses the entire states.id.
the triggers relied upon by the fcc are largely based upon collocation by competitors at lec facilities.the fcc adopted this trigger for two reasons.first,the fcc concluded that collocation is a reasonable proxy for competitive conditions in a given msa.id.specifically,the fcc found that collocation by competitors in incumbent lec wire centers is a reliable indication of sunk investment by competitors.id.sufficient sunk investment of this sort,in the fcc view,will discourage exclusionary pricing behavior.id.in addition,the fcc determined that the collocation level is an easily verifiable,test that serves to avoid excessive administrative burdens.id.in this sense,the trigger balances the fcc desire for an accurate measure of actual competitive conditions in a given msa,while also establishing a clear administrative standard.
the fcc acknowledged that adopting specific thresholds,like utility ratemaking,is not an exact science.id.accord united states fcc.rather,the thresholds are policy determinations based on our agency expertise,our interpretation of the record before us in this proceeding,and our desire to provide a rule to guide the industry.id.footnote omitted.moreover,the fcc claimed its effort to select triggers that precisely measure competition for particular services also is hampered by the lack of verifiable data concerning competitors revenues and facilities.id.
to set the proper trigger thresholds the fcc examined a few local markets to assess the extent of market penetration that correlates with a given level of collocation investment,and scaled the various triggers to correlate with the level of relief sought.thus,the phase ii triggers are higher than those for phase i,and different services have different trigger levels depending upon the fcc estimation of the threat of predatory or anticompetitive conduct.thus,the amount of collocation required to obtain phase i relief for channel terminations is higher than for dedicated transport services.
ii.analysis 
collocation thresholds for pricing flexibility 
petitioners challenge the fcc decision to offer lecs relief from price cap regulation based upon a showing that one or more competitors have made substantial local investments in collocation.petitioners contend that this decision was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law because the fcc failed to condition this relief upon a finding of competition sufficient to protect consumers from anticompetitive conduct.collocation,petitioners contend,is a poor proxy for actual competition in the provision of interstate access services.as a result,petitioners claim that the order violates the commission statutory duty to ensure that prices are nondiscriminatory,just,and reasonable.
petitioners specifically challenge three aspects of the fcc new pricing flexibility framework basing the triggers for pricing flexibility on collocation rather than an analysis of actual competitive conditions granting pricing flexibility on an basis based on collocation in only a portion of the msa and selecting specific triggers in an arbitrary fashion and without sufficient explanation.in assessing these claims,we consider whether the fcc actions are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.this is a deferential standard that presume s the validity of agency action.southwestern bell.fcc,accord jersey shore broadcasting fcc.like agency ratemaking,price cap regulation of local carriers involves policy determinations in which the agency is acknowledged to have expertise.time warner entertainment fcc,per curiam internal quotation omitted.therefore,it is not our role to second guess the fcc policy judgment,so long as it comports with established standards of administrative practice.the fcc judgment about the best regulatory tools to employ in a particular situation is entitled to considerable deference from the generalist judiciary.western union int l,fcc.
collocation 
under the pricing flexibility order,lecs are eligible for regulatory relief upon a showing that there is sufficient collocation by one or more competitors.in this fashion,the fcc uses investment in collocation as a proxy for competition in access service.petitioners contend that this is arbitrary and capricious because collocation is not a sufficient measure of actual market competition.therefore,petitioners argue,the fcc can offer no assurance that lecs will continue to offer just and reasonable rates once they are granted pricing flexibility.to petitioners,the regulatory relief provided for by the fcc order is tantamount to foregoing dominant carrier regulation altogether,and can only be justified upon a finding of actual competition.
it may well be that collocation is a poor measure of market share,as petitioners attest.that competing firms have invested in collocation does not mean that they have captured a significant portion of the market for access services.yet the fcc did not conclude that a loss of market share was necessary to prevent an incumbent lec from raising prices.the fcc has long held that market share is not the,of competition.see fcc,the fcc has never viewed market share as an essential factor in evaluating market competition emphasis in original.it is merely one of several relevant factors considered when making a market power determination.for example,in motion of to be declared for international service,wl,the fcc wrote that 
market shares,by themselves,are not the sole determining factor of whether a firm possesses market power.other factors,such as demand and supply elasticities,conditions of entry and other market conditions must be examined to define a relevant market,and determine whether a particular firm can exercise market power in the relevant market.
the fcc is free to change this policy so long as it provides an adequate explanation for the shift,at,but it has not done so.
as the fcc noted in its order,the presence of substantial sunk investment,and the resulting potential for entry into the market,can limit anticompetitive behavior by lecs.specifically,the fcc found that 
once multiple rivals have entered the market and can not be driven out,rules to prevent exclusionary pricing behavior are no longer necessary.investment in facilities,particularly those that can not be used for another purpose,is an important indicator of such irreversible entry.if a competitive lec has made a substantial sunk investment in equipment,that equipment remains available and capable of providing service in competition with the incumbent,even if the incumbent succeeds in driving that competitor from the market.
order.even if a rival lec is unsuccessful at challenging an incumbent,the presence of competition with significant sunk investment makes exclusionary pricing behavior costly and highly unlikely to succeed.id.collocation,in the fcc expert view,is a reliable indication of sunk investment by competitors.id.therefore,collocation can reasonably serve as a measure of competition in a given market and predictor of competitive constraints upon future lec behavior.
whatever its faults as a measure of competition,the fcc found collocation to be superior to the various alternatives proposed by petitioners during the notice and comment period.see id.petitioners,for their part,offer no alternative save a painstaking analysis of market conditions such as that which is required when an lec seeks classification as a carrier or the forbearance of dominant carrier regulation under section of the communications act.see,fcc.the fcc determined that this would be burdensome and point which petitioners do not thus not appropriate in all cases.it therefore sought an alternative for the purpose of providing pricing flexibility,in addition to the statutory procedure under section,which remains a viable and independent means for carriers to seek regulatory relief,at.
that the fcc chose to rely upon an admittedly imperfect measure of competition does not render its use arbitrary and capricious.ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc,naruc.nor is the fcc decision to make ease of administration and enforceability a consideration in setting its standard for reg
