for over a decade,frank redisi,and his son,frank redisi,operated a variety of business entities in the chicago suburbs that manufactured cable television decoders,which allow one to view all of a cable provider scrambled premium or programming free of charge.from to,the redisis sold thousands of decoders to customers of the plaintiff csc holdings,which refers to itself as cablevision here.in may,cablevision brought suit for violations of the cable communications policy act of,and secured a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against the redisis and their businesses.the district court found against the redisis on summary judgment and after a damages trial awarded cablevision over million.on appeal,the redisis assert a statute of limitations defense and also contest numerous discovery rulings and the district court damages determination.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the redisis began selling their illegal wares sometime before,initially operating under the name of teleview distributors.by january,fbi agents were investigating the redisis activities and meeting with leaders of the cable television industry,including robert astarita,cablevision senior of corporate security,to discuss the problem of cable theft.at one point in,astarita sent teleview distributors a letter indicating that he had evidence that some of the products teleview distributors was selling might be capable of descrambling cablevision signal and that,if so,it should cease and desist immediately.the redisis failed to respond to the letter.
on november,the fbi served a search warrant on teleview distributors,obtaining substantial evidence of wrongdoing and shutting down the business.as a direct result,redisi,pleaded guilty to one count of violating.the fbi kept astarita apprised of its progress in fighting cable theft through at least in particular,it gave him updates on the investigation and the criminal charging of redisi.
cablevision claims that after november,it believed that the redisis had turned from their life of crime,but this proved not to be the case.they very quickly resumed operations and later incorporated as omega holdings owned by the redisis and omega of elgin owned by redisi,and shared facilities,equipment,and inventory with various other companies selling decoders owned by defendants who have settled out of the case.between november and may,the redisis through various corporate identities and affiliates sold decoders to probable cablevision customers.
cablevision began a serious investigation of the redisis in march,in the course of which it made six undercover purchases of decoders that descrambled all of its programming over the course of the next year.on may,cablevision filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze and sought monetary and injunctive relief.the district court enjoined the redisis from selling any decoders,froze the redisis personal and corporate assets,and directed the marshal to seize business records and computers.
when the redisis appeared in court,they moved unsuccessfully to have the action dismissed.the district court instead granted a preliminary injunction on june and set a briefing schedule under which discovery was to close on september.the defendants served written discovery requests on the plaintiffs in july but did not notice any depositions at that time.cablevision moved for summary judgment on july.
on friday,august,the redisis attorney noticed depositions for five cablevision employees to be conducted on the first three days of september.astarita was scheduled to be deposed on the morning of september,six days after the notice was sent.cablevision informed the redisis that it would produce four of the employees but would not produce astarita,representing that he had no knowledge of events relating to the case that could not be gained from the other four witnesses.the district court then denied the redisis motion to compel astarita deposition,finding that the redisis had produced no evidence of relevance and that the expedited discovery request would be unduly burdensome to astarita.
on friday,september,one week before the close of discovery,the redisis again noticed a deposition for astarita.cablevision refused to comply with this notice,and the redisis then sought reconsideration of their original motion to compel.they produced affidavits from fbi agents indicating that astarita,and thus cablevision,knew of the redisis actions as early as and had engaged in extensive discussions with the fbi between and.they further represented that this fact was important to their statute of limitations defense.the district court denied this motion as well on the ground that the deposition was not relevant.in december,it granted cablevision motion for summary judgment as to liability in its entirety,rejecting the redisis statute of limitations defense.
damages discovery led to a repeat of many of the disputes from the liability phase.after deposing joseph flaim,cablevision principal damages witness,the redisis moved to bar flaim damages analysis on the ground that it was based on undisclosed materials and requested an extension of discovery.the district court denied both motions but did order cablevision to provide the redisis with a summary of its damages calculations and supporting materials other than its customer lists.flaim testified as to his damages analysis at trial,which the district court in large part accepted.the court then awarded cablevision almost million in damages,plus in costs and attorneys fees.
the parties agree that the relevant statute of limitations is found at a,which provides,all actions at law by carriers for recovery of their lawful charges,or any part thereof,shall be begun,within two years from the time the cause of action accrues,and not after.the redisis do not seriously dispute that they have violated the law,but they argue that the statute of limitations bars cablevision suit because cablevision knew of its injuries more than two years before it filed suit in may.
in the first place,it should be noted that the redisis made a number of decoder sales to cablevision customers during the two years preceding the commencement of this action.under any theory of the case,cablevision filed a timely claim as to those sales,as the redisis counsel conceded at oral argument.but at least on the face of the statute,cablevision claims as to or so of the decoders sold would be barred if the redisis statute of limitations argument is correct.cablevision offers two reasons why it should still be permitted to prosecute its claim in its entirety the redisis actions amounted to a continuing violation and the statute of limitations was tolled because cablevision did not know or have reason to know of the redisis violations.
t he statute of limitations does not begin to run on a continuing wrong till the wrong is over and done with taylor meirick,cir.this is a general legal principle,just as applicable to title vii and section cases as it is to copyright violations or business torts.heard sheahan,cir.a continuing violation exists where it would be unreasonable to require or even permit a plaintiff to sue separately over every incident of the defendant unlawful conduct.id.at.
the supreme court recently clarified the nature of continuing violations in national passenger morgan,d.in morgan,the court ruled that a title vii plaintiff could not recover for discrete discriminatory acts that occurred outside the relevant eeoc filing deadlines but could recover for such actions on a hostile work environment theory.id.at.we too have noted the contrast between a continuing wrong,such as deliberate indifference to a prisoner medical treatment,and discrete acts,such as consistently underpaying an employee because of her sex.heard,at.
the wrong alleged here is the redisis distribution of equipment intended for unauthorized reception of any communications service offered over a cable system a.while cablevision contends that the redisis action was continuing because of their continued sales made over a span,this belies the actual nature of the claim.the redisis sold over decoders.each of those sa
