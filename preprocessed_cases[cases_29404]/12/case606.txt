background 
a.the permit application requirements 
the kansas city,kansas,code of ordinances code establishes a permitting procedure whereby individuals or entities may seek to have the local governing body authorize,through the issuance of special use permits,certain uses and situations with characteristics which may not blend or harmonize with the uses in the standard zoning districts.kansas city,code of ordinances.section lists t elecommunication antennas and towers as such an allowable special use.id.at.telecommunication antennas and towers which meet certain specified minimum criteria may be permitted under special use permit in any zoning district except as specifically limited herein.id.at a.
the code also establishes the considerations and factors which the governing body should take into consideration in granting special use permits.section provides that the decisions and recommendations of the governing body should be based on the following general considerations conformance with these regulations,the comprehensive plan,and other adopted plans,design guidelines and policies recommendations of staff and recommending bodies input of reviewing agencies and departments public comment and testimony received at the hearing and effects of the proposal on the neighborhood,area,and.id.at a.with regard to special use permits in particular,section states that approval or denial of applications must be based on the following factors 
a the character of the neighborhood.
b whether the proposed use will increase the amount of vehicular traffic to the point where it exceeds the capacity of the street network to accommodate it.
c where applicable,hours of operation.
d whether the proposed use is reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the public and will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use,visual quality,or marketability of adjoining property.
e whether the noise,vibration,dust,or illumination that would normally be associated with such use is of such duration and intensity as to create problems for nearby property.
f whether the proposed use would pollute the air,land or water.
g compatibility with existing and proposed land uses in the surrounding area.
h whether the use would damage or destroy an irreplaceable natural resource.
i the relative gain to the public health,safety,morals,and welfare as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual landowner or landowners.
j the applicant ability to maintain the use in an as proposed condition.
k whether the proposed use would result in overcrowding of land or cause an undue concentration of population.
l in general,commercial and industrial special use permits should not be granted adjacent to residential districts.

special use permit application 
on december,filed an application for a special use permit,requesting permission to build a telecommunications tower to provide adequate residential and vehicular cell phone coverage in the vicinity of the proposed site.the application identified other structures including a water tower and an existing monopole at a high school within a mile of the site that could be used as alternatives to the proposed site,but rejected each of them as inadequate.the application also included propagation studies showing existing coverage as well as anticipated coverage with the new tower.
the united government planning department staff staff advised rejecting the application.the staff report report,issued on march,considered numerous factors,several having particular relevance here.the report noted,in considering the character of the neighborhood and the use of the property in question,that the neighborhood was somewhat commercial in nature and that the proposed site which was zoned residential was owned by and used as a church.the report also considered the proposal compatibility with and detrimental effect on nearby property,stating that the tower would be the tallest structure in the area and may be considered unsightly by many.furthermore,the report,in considering whether the proposed use would be reasonably necessary for the welfare of the public,stated that the staff doubted that there was a sufficient deficiency in cell phone performance to require a new tower.
following the united government planning commission commission decision to postpone action on the application pending further information from,submitted new propagation maps and the results of a drive test.stated that the drive test confirmed the existence of a significant gap in cell phone coverage,and,therefore,the need for the proposed tower,while the staff updated its report by stating that the test showed adequate service.
the application was then taken up for consideration by the commission and the unified government board of commissioners board.the commission addressed the application on april.following testimony by and the planning director,the commission recommended rejecting the application.the board then took up the application for final consideration on may,hearing more testimony from both and the planning director.the planning director testified that drive test showed no dropped calls.in turn,explained that the drive test was not a test of dropped calls in the area,but rather simply confirmed in the field what our propagation maps already told us,that we had a hole in coverage in this particular area.introduced evidence from tests showing over dropped calls in the vicinity during one week,and over dropped calls during a different week.the planning director responded by stating that had minutes of use per dropped call in the area,which he thought was pretty good.in response,stressed that its numbers fell below the industry average of minutes of use per dropped call.at no time during the hearings did neighbors oppose the proposal on the basis of its aesthetics.
the board denied the application,citing three primary reasons.first,the board concluded that had failed to show that denial of the application would prohibit the provision of personal wireless services.according to the board,d rive studies indicated that there were no dropped calls in the area surveyed in stark contrast to studies submitted for other applications for cellular towers.indicating zero or limited dropped calls seems to indicate this tower is not necessary for the convenience of the public.second,the board stated that the proposed tower was not the least intrusive means of fulfilling a gap,if any exists,in services.the board cited the code preference for commercial districts over residential districts,the indirectness of the relation between the proposed tower and the existing use as a church,and the aesthetic impact of the proposed tower.third,the board stated that the commission had considered the golden factors factors that kansas courts have recommended that cities review when deciding whether to grant special use permits and had decided to reject application.

overview of applicable law 
the federal telecommunications act of tca,limits the authority of local government bodies regarding the placement of wireless communications facilities.while congress expressly preserved local zoning authority over the construction of personal wireless service facilities when it enacted the tca,see cellular of greater tulsa,llc city of broken arrow,cir,congress adopted the tca in order to promote competition and higher quality in telecommunications services and to encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies,city of rancho palos verdes abrams,d.the tca furthered these goals by reducing the impediments that local governments could impose to defeat or delay the installation of wireless communications facilities such as cell phone towers,and by protecting against irrational or substanceless decisions by local authorities.sw.bell mobile,todd,cir.
to that end,congress amended the communications act of by placing six restrictions on the authority of local governments in regulating the placement,construction,and modification of telecommunications facilities.c b i v.two of these provisions have potential relevance in this case.first,the tca requires that any decision by a local government to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.c b iii.second,the tca provides that local governments must not make decisions that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.c b i ii.because the board decision was not supported by substantial evidence,we need not reach the second of these provisions to conclude that the board violated the tca.see metropcs,city and county of san francisco,cir if a zoning board decision,reached under its own rules,is not supported by substantial evidence,then we need not consider the application of the or antidiscrimination prongs of the statute.
b.the board decision is not supported by substantial evidence 
under c b iii,a ny decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.judicial review under the substantial evidence standard is quite narrow.broken arrow,at ready mixed concrete nlrb,cir.while deferential,however,it is not a rubber stamp.broken arrow,at quoting sw.bell mobile,at.substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the decisionmaker.substantial evidence requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.broken arrow,at quoting sandoval aetna life casualty ins,cir alteration in original.the possibility of drawing two competing conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding of substantial evidence.id.quoting curtis,cir.while a reviewing court has no power to substitute its own conclusions for those of the,cellular.town of oyster bay,cir,if the record as a whole contains conflicting evidence,the must adequately explain its reasons for rejecting or discrediting competent evidence,cellular.zoning bd.of adjustment of the borough of,cir.
substantial evidence review does not create a substantive federal limitation on local land use regulatory power.as the ninth circuit has stated,the substantial evidence inquiry does not require incorporation of the substantive federal standards imposed by the tca,but instead requires a determination whether the zoning decision at issue is supported by substantial evidence in the context of applicable state and local law.metropcs,at.emphasis in the original.our substantial evidence review is directed to those rulings that the board is expected to make under state law and local ordinance in deciding on variances,special exceptions and the like.broken arrow,at quoting sw.bell mobile,at.accordingly,this court must look to the requirements set forth in the local zoning code to determine the substantive criteria to be applied in determining whether substantial evidence existed to support the board decision.see also metropcs,at cellular city of wichita falls,cir.
here,the board written decision offered three reasons for denying application.the central issue is whether each of these reasons is supported by substantial evidence in the record.
reason one failure to show prohibition of personal wireless services 
absence of support in local law for the failure to show prohibition of personal wireless services criterion 
the first reason,set forth in paragraph of the written denial,that the board asserted to support its decision was that had failed to show that the denial of the special use permit would prohibit the provision of personal wireless services.however,the board erred in requiring to demonstrate that denying the application would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services.no such criterion appeared in the code at the time of application.while the code provided that approval or denial of special use permits should be based upon consideration of certain factors enumerated in section f and set forth specific minimum criteria for telecommunication facilities in section a,it did not require telecommunication providers to demonstrate prohibition of personal wireless services.
by inventing a criterion for which the applicable local ordinances did not provide,the board failed to act on the basis of substantial evidence.in order to be supported by substantial evidence,the proffered reasons must comport with the objective criteria in existence zoning regulations,permit application policies.governing bodies can not simply arbitrarily invent new criteria in order to reject an application.virginia metronet,bd.of supervisors of james city,see new par city of saginaw,cir concluding that the zoning board decision was not supported by substantial evidence because,among other reasons,the applicant failure to show lack of alternatives did not go to any of the criteria set out in the zoning code town of amherst,omnipoint commc ns,cir stating that the substantial evidence standard surely refers to the need for substantial evidence under the criteria laid down by the zoning law itself emphasis omitted at t wireless servs.of,llc city of carlsbad,d.indeed,we have clearly stated that we must look to the requirements set forth in the local zoning ordinance to ascertain the substantive criteria to be applied.broken arrow,at.although the tca does not divest local officials of any authority they may have to consider the quality of existing services,neither does it create such authority.efforts to assess existing quality must be authorized by and performed within the parameters of governing state and local law,at.because the board had no basis in the local code for this criterion,the board erred in its decision to require to demonstrate that the denial of the application would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services.
zero or limited dropped calls 
however,the unified government did set forth one finding under the failure to show a prohibition of personal wireless services heading that is justified under the applicable code and should be examined under the substantial evidence test.
in paragraph a of the written denial,the board stated that the d rive studies indicated that there were no dropped calls in the area surveyed in stark contrast to studies submitted for other applications for cellular towers.indicating zero or limited dropped calls seems to indicate this tower is not necessary for the convenience of the public.the unified government argues that this conclusion is supported by statements in its application.first,as paragraph a itself states,the unified government relies on the fact that the drive test showed no dropped calls.second,the unified government argues that,by stating that its customers in the targeted area averaged nearly minutes of use between dropped calls while its customers in the kansas metro core as a whole averaged nearly minutes of use between dropped calls,failed to show any prohibition of service in the targeted area.moreover,the unified government contends that evidence showing that there were over and dropped calls in two separate weeks is unremarkable and provides substantial evidence for denying the application.
however,the record does not show that the unified government had substantial evidence to support the conclusion that there were zero or limited dropped calls.the unified government erred to the extent that it relied upon the fact that the drive test did not show any dropped calls.the unified government,in asserting that the drive studies indicated that there were no dropped calls in the area surveyed,apparently relied on the statements of the planning director at the may,board meeting,when the planning director stated that the drive test showed no dropped calls.however,as the record amply demonstrates and as the district court concluded,the drive test was not designed to measure dropped calls rather,it was intended to measure the level of existing network coverage.as the drive test was not supposed to show the existence of dropped calls,the board can not rely upon it to show the absence of dropped calls.therefore,because the board reliance on the drive test was based upon a misunderstanding of its purpose,the drive test can not provide the substantial evidence necessary to support the board decision.
because it was erroneous for the board to rely upon the drive test,the board had no substantial basis to determine that the amount of dropped calls customers experienced was actually acceptable.the only other evidence upon which the board could rely to support its conclusion was the uncorroborated assertion of the planning director,who stated that,in his opinion,the dropped call data provided by indicated that service in the targeted area was pretty good.in opposition to this uncorroborated statement,submitted evidence stating that the number of dropped calls fell below the industry average.accordingly,evidence purporting to show significant numbers of dropped calls which directly contravened the board conclusion stands substantially uncontradicted.
while it is clear from this court decision in broken arrow that substantial evidence may exist to support a decision to refuse to issue a special use permit even if alternative conclusions could be drawn from the evidence,broken arrow,at,that situation is not presented here.rather,the evidence available shows that the board erroneously relied upon a drive test not intended to show dropped calls and upon the personal opinion of the planning director that the dropped call data was pretty good.a determination regarding the quality of existing service must be based on substantial,competent evidence,at,and that technical determination is not supported by substantial evidence where it is made solely on the adjudicator unsubstantiated belief,see primeco pers.commc ns city of mequon,d,aff,cir.as arguments regarding the existence of dropped calls stands contradicted only by an unsubstantiated opinion,there is no substantial evidence to support the board finding.
reason two not the least intrusive means of filling a service gap 
absence of support in local law for the least intrusive means criterion 
the second reason,set forth in paragraph of the written denial,that the board proffered for denying application was that t his particular foot tower is not the least intrusive means of fulfilling a gap,if any exists,in the particular service provided by.again,however,the board erred in requiring to demonstrate that its proposal was the least intrusive means of filling a service gap because nothing in local law permitted the board to impose such a requirement.no such criterion appeared in the code at the time of application.because the board had no basis in the code for this criterion,the board erred in its decision to use the least intrusive means analysis as part of its process see broken arrow,at new par,at omnipoint commc ns,at virginia metronet.at.
the unified government frequent references to broken arrow and cellular bd.of adjustment of city of seminole.cir,are inapt.in broken arrow,we upheld a local board decision to reject a tower application on the grounds that the proposed site was zoned transitional,and the cellular company had not demonstrated that no other tower could accommodate the proposed antenna.broken arrow,at.similarly,in seminole,we found that the local board denial of a tower application was valid because the proposal violated setback requirements,and the cellular company had not offered evidence regarding the feasibility of other sites.seminole.at.the unified government relies on broken arrow and seminole to argue that the opinions of city officials regarding the feasibility of alternative sites are sufficient to constitute the substantial evidence required by the tca.however,in both broken arrow and seminole the applicable zoning code required the applicant to prove that no existing structure could accommodate the proposed antenna.see broken arrow,at seminole.at.here,in contrast,the code did not require the applicant to prove that there was no other feasible alternative.therefore,the unified government argument,based on these cases,that had to demonstrate that another site would be less intrusive is entirely irrelevant.
nevertheless,the unified government sets forth several considerations under the least intrusive means heading that are justified under the applicable code and should be examined under the substantial evidence test.
preference for commercial districts 
first,in paragraph a of the written denial,the board noted that section of the code created a preference for placing towers in commercial districts rather than residential districts.the code states,in evaluating such proposed sites,commercial districts are generally preferred over those in residential districts as are sites in less restrictive residential or commercial districts generally preferred over those in more restrictive districts.code a h.the unified government argues that because the proposed site has a residential rather than commercial designation,the board had substantial evidence to support its finding that the proposed tower was not the least intrusive means of filling a gap in service however,argues that the code stated preference for commercial districts does not constitute substantial evidence because the master plan for the city designated the parcel as commercial and because the immediate vicinity included a church,a seminary,and an auto parts store,while there were only a few residential uses nearby.indeed,the staff and the commission recognized that the neighborhood is somewhat commercial in nature and that there are only a few residential uses in the general area.the district court concluded that the board failure to consider the actual use of the surrounding property meant that there was no substantial evidence supporting the board conclusion,d at.
the district court was correct in reaching this conclusion.it is unreasonable for the board to claim that the property residential zoning constitutes substantial evidence without considering contrary factual evidence.t he record should be viewed in its entirety,including evidence opposed to the board view.oyster bay,at see preferred sites,llc troup county,cir a court should view the record in its entirety,including evidence unfavorable to the state or local government decision.if th
