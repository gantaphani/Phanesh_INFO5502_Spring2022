a provider of prerecorded telephonic messages,filed in federal district court a motion for a preliminary injunction and a declaratory judgment seeking to prevent indiana from enforcing its statute prohibiting the use of automatic dialing machines to send prerecorded messages to indiana telephone subscribers.three days earlier,indiana had filed an action in an indiana state court against one of freeeats clients,the economic freedom fund,and numerous prerecorded telephonic message providers,to enforce the indiana statute.based on its state court action,indiana moved the district court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction pursuant to the principles of younger harris,d,and to stay the case pending the resolution of its motion.the district court denied both of indiana motions,as well as freeeats motion for a preliminary injunction.indiana and freeeats.we reverse the district court denial of indiana motion to dismiss pursuant to the younger abstention doctrine,and vacate its denial of freeeats motion for a preliminary injunction.
freeeats is a virginia corporation that uses prerecorded telephonic messages to poll households,identify political supporters,deliver political advocacy messages,and encourage supporters to go to the polls to vote for particular candidates.it makes interstate telephone calls into all fifty states.if a freeeats call is not answered by a live person,freeeats will attempt to call the number again up to three times.
prior to the november elections,the economic freedom fund hired freeeats to make prerecorded telephone calls to indiana residents from the freeeats call center located in virginia.in early september,freeeats began making calls on behalf of the economic freedom fund to indiana telephone subscribers in support of various congressional candidates.on september,indiana filed an action in indiana state court seeking an injunction and civil penalties against the economic freedom fund for violating indiana automated dialing machine statute the adms,which generally prohibits the use of automatic dialing machines to send prerecorded messages to indiana telephone subscribers.indiana complaint did not name freeeats,but it did name several john does who it claimed were responsible for making the offending telephone calls.
three days later,on september,freeeats filed in federal district court this action against both indiana and the indiana attorney general,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prohibit indiana from enforcing the adms.specifically,freeeats claimed that indiana should be enjoined from enforcing the adms because federal law preempts it it violates the commerce clause and it violates the first amendment.the next day,indiana moved to amend its state court complaint to name freeeats as a defendant,and to stay the federal proceedings pending the resolution of the state case pursuant to the principles that the supreme court set forth in younger harris,d.
on october,the district court denied indiana and the indiana attorney general motion to stay.it also denied their motion to dismiss pursuant to the younger abstention doctrine,upon finding that this case involves important federal issues that require urgent attention in light of the congressional election.additionally,the district court denied freeeats motion for a preliminary injunction based on its finding that freeeats had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits on any of its three claims.specifically,it first found that freeeats was unlikely to prevail on its preemption claim,because federal law,and in particular the tcpa,did not preempt the adms.the district court reasoned that the tcpa savings clause allows the states to enact stricter regulations than the tcpa baseline federal standards,including regulations impacting interstate calls coming into a state.second,the district court found that freeeats was unlikely to prevail on its commerce clause claim,because the adms does not impose a clearly excessive burden on interstate commerce in relation to the putative local benefits of protecting residential privacy third,the district court found that freeeats was unlikely to prevail on its first amendment claim,because the adms is content neutral,it is narrowly tailored to achieve indiana interest in protecting residential privacy,and it leaves open alternative channels for communication.in particular,the district court pointed out that the adms does not ban freeeats from delivering its messages to indiana residents via telephone rather,it merely requires freeeats to use a live operator to obtain consent before playing its prerecorded messages.the district court also noted that the adms does not impose any limitations on other traditional forms of political speech,such as campaigning,bulk mailings,or posting signs.
freeeats appealed the district court denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction,and indiana the district court denial of it motion to dismiss pursuant to the younger abstention doctrine.freeeats then moved the state court to stay its proceeding pending this court decision.on december,the state court denied freeeats motion and ordered discovery to commence.as of the date of publication,the state action was ongoing.both the economic freedom fund and freeeats have moved for partial summary judgment,but the state court has yet to rule on their motions 
as a threshold matter,we must address indiana claim on that the district court should have abstained from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over this matter.we review de novo a district court decision to decline to abstain from exercising jurisdiction pursuant to the younger abstention doctrine.forty one news,county of lake,cir citations omitted younger generally requires federal courts to abstain from taking jurisdiction over federal constitutional claims that involve or call into question ongoing state proceedings.younger.see also forty one news,at younger abstention is appropriate only when there is an action in state court against the federal plaintiff and the state is seeking to enforce the contested law in that proceeding.the rule in younger harris is designed to permit state courts to try state cases free from interference by federal courts.id.quotations and citations omitted.see also younger,at.the younger principles of abstention apply both to claims based on constitutional challenges,as well as to those based on federal preemption challenges.see new orleans public,council of city of new orleans,d.
the court holding in younger was based partly on traditional principles of equity,but rested primarily on the even more vital consideration of comity.new orleans public,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.the younger court defined comity as 
a proper respect for state functions,a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a union of separate state governments,and a continuance of the belief that the national government will fare best if the states and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.this,perhaps for lack of a better and clearer way to describe it,is referred to by many as our federalism,and one familiar with the profound debates that ushered our federal constitution into existence is bound to respect those who remain loyal to the ideals and dreams of our federalism.the concept does not mean blind deference to states rights any more than it means centralization of control over every important issue in our national government and its courts.the framers rejected both these courses.what the concept does represent is a system in which there is sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both state and national governments,and in which the national government,anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests,always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the states.it should never be forgotten that this slogan,our federalism,born in the early struggling days of our union of states,occupies a highly important place in our nation history and its future.
younger,at.accordingly,younger and its progeny require federal courts to abstain from enjoining ongoing state proceedings that are judicial in nature,implicate important state interests,and offer an adequate opportunity for review of constitutional claims,so long as no extraordinary bias or which auger against abstention.majors engelbrecht,cir citing middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar,d.see also auto serv.station llc city of chicago,cir stating that except in extraordinary situations,a federal court may not enjoin ongoing state proceedings that arise out of important state interests,if the litigant has an adequate opportunity to present its constitutional arguments in the state forum.
there is no dispute that this case satisfies the first three factors for abstention under younger.first,the state proceedings are judicial in nature as indiana filed in the brown country circuit court its complaint against the economic freedom fund and freeeats alleging violations of the adms.second,indiana complaint clearly implicates an important state interest,specifically the preservation of residential privacy as expressed by the indiana legislature in its passage of the adms.third,freeeats may potentially avail itself of the same remedies in either the indiana state court or the district court for its claims that the adms is preempted by federal law and unconstitutional.accordingly,this case qualifies for abstention.
despite the fact that the younger factors all favor abstention,the district court found that extraordinary then rapidly approaching congressional its exercise of federal jurisdiction.the party claiming extraordinary circumstances must demonstrate their existence.green benden,cir citing ramsden,at.the supreme court has pointed out that such a determination must be made on a basis 
the very nature of extraordinary circumstances,of course,makes it impossible to anticipate and define every situation that might create a sufficient threat of such great,immediate,and irreparable injury as to warrant intervention in state proceedings.but whatever else is required,such circumstances must be extraordinary in the sense of creating an extraordinarily pressing need for immediate federal equitable relief,not merely in the sense of presenting a highly unusual factual situation.
kugler helfant,d footnote omitted see also arkebauer kiley,cir recognizing that the extraordinary circumstances exception is a nebulous one.the court has stated that a district court should not abstain under younger where the pending state proceeding was motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted in bad faith,see huffman pursue,d see also ramsden,at or the plaintiff has demonstrated an extraordinarily pressing need for immediate equitable relief that,if not granted,will irreparably injure the plaintiff,see moore,at.quoting kugler,at.see also younger,at.noting that even irreparable injury is insufficient unless it is both great and immediate.brunken lance,cir discussing the two exceptions to the younger doctrine we consider each of these exceptions in turn 
first,we must determine whether the pending state proceeding was motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted in bad faith.freeeats also makes no allegations that the indiana state court is incompetent to adjudicate the issues in this case because of bias,or that indiana filed the state action based on a desire to harass or in bad faith.accordingly,the first exception to the younger abstention doctrine is not applicable in this case.
second,we consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated an extraordinary pressing need for immediate federal equitable relief that,if not granted,will irreparably injure the plaintiff.moore,at.quoting kugler,at.in kugler,the supreme court expounded on this second exception,noting that for it to apply,there must be no state remedy available to meaningfully,timely,and adequately remedy the alleged constitutional violation and that the litigant will suffer great and immediate harm if the federal court does not intervene.kugler,at.see also trainor hernandez,d.thus,to satisfy the first predicate of the extraordinary circumstances exception,freeeats must show that there is no state remedy available to meaningfully,timely,and adequately remedy its alleged constitutional violations.the district court found that freeeats made this showing,based upon the temporal proximity of the election and its conclusion that the state court was unlikely to resolve freeeats claims prior to election day.specifically,the district court conclude d that abstention is inappropriate because this case involves important federal issues that require urgent attention,the state action was in its infant stages,and the delays that have taken place in that matter to date make it unlikely that the state court will be able to address those claims prior to the general election.
whether a election justifies refusing to abstain under the principles of younger is an issue of first impression in this circuit we find guidance,however,in the supreme court decision in pennzoil texaco,d,in which the court reiterated that a federal court should assume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy,in the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary.id.at.in this case,the district court observed that while the state court could provide a remedy to freeeats,it could not do so prior to the election due to various procedural obstacles.this calls for an examination of the proceedings in the state court.
on september,eight days after indiana filed its state court complaint,the original state court judge assigned to the matter recused herself.prior to her recusal,the original state court judge had scheduled a hearing on indiana motion for a preliminary injunction for october,which was over one month prior to the election.pursuant to indiana state and local court rules,the original state court judge appointed a special judge to hear the state action.three days before the hearing date,freeeats state court,the economic freedom fund,moved for a change of judge.the next day,and before the state court had ruled on the change of judge motion,freeeats moved to continue the october,hearing on indiana motion,and to stay the entire state court proceeding pending the district court resolution of its own federal court motion for a preliminary injunction.freeeats also represented that it would not make any more calls to indiana telephone subscribers unless and until it received a favorable ruling from the district court.the day after that,october,which was one day before oral arguments were scheduled on indiana motion,the special judge accepted jurisdiction that same day,the special judge granted freeeats motion to continue the october,hearing,as well as the economic freedom fund motion for a change of judge.a second special judge accepted jurisdiction on november.five days later,and the day before the election,freeeats again moved to stay the state court proceedings,this time until we resolve its appeal.on december,the second special judge denied freeeats motion to stay the state action,and the state action continues to date.based upon these facts,it is clear that the state court could have,and would have,conducted a hearing on indiana motion for a preliminary injunction prior to the election,but for freeeats and the economic freedom fund exercise of their procedural options to stay the hearing and request a change of judge.while we do not express an opinion regarding whether these procedural tactics were dilatory,they were undertaken at freeeats and its client election with the obvious consequence of postponing any hearing until after the election.a party that exercises a state court ordinary procedural processes to delay an action can not then turn around and claim that because of that delay there is no state remedy available to meaningfully,timely,and adequately address its constitutional claim.to find otherwise would offend comity.
the district court also stated that its decision not to abstain was supported by the fact that the state action was in its infant stage.we have recognized that where state criminal proceedings are begun against the federal plaintiffs after the federal complaint
