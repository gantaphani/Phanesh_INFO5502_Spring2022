this petition for review comes before us on remand from the supreme court.previously we held,with judge leval dissenting,that the indecency policy of the federal communications commission fcc or commission was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act apa,a.see fox television stations,fcc,cir.the supreme court reversed,upholding the policy under the apa and remanding for consideration of petitioners constitutional arguments.see fox television stations,fcc,scalia.we now hold that the fcc policy violates the first amendment because it is unconstitutionally vague,creating a chilling effect that goes far beyond the fleeting expletives at issue here.thus,we grant the petition for review and vacate the fcc order and the indecency policy underlying it 
background 
section of title of united states code provides that w hoever utters any obscene,indecent,or profane language by means of radio communication shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years,or both.in,congress authorized the fcc to impose civil forfeitures for violations of section.see b d.it was not until,however,that the fcc first exercised its authority to regulate speech it deemed indecent but not obscene.the speech at issue was comedian george carlin filthy words monologue,a string of expletives broadcast on the radio at in the afternoon.
the fcc brought forfeiture proceedings against the pacifica foundation,the broadcaster that had aired the carlin monologue.citizen complaint against pacifica found.station wbai fm,n.y.in finding that pacifica had violated section,the commission defined indecent speech as language that describes,in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium,sexual or excretory activities and organs,at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.id.at.pacifica petitioned for review to the circuit,which declared the fcc indecency regime invalid.see pacifica found.fcc.in finding the fcc order both vague and overbroad,the court pointed out that the commission definition of indecent speech would prohibit the uncensored broadcast of many of the great works of literature including shakespearian plays and contemporary plays which have won critical acclaim,the works of renowned classical and contemporary poets and writers,and passages from the bible.id.at.such a result,the court concluded,amounted to unconstitutional censorship.id.at.
in a plurality opinion authored by justice stevens,the supreme court reversed.see fcc pacifica.the court limited its review to the question of whether the fcc could impose a civil forfeiture for the carlin monologue and declined to address pacifica argument that the regulation was overbroad and would chill protected speech.id.at,invalidating any rule on the basis of its hypothetical application to situations not before the court is strong medicine to be applied sparingly and only as a last resort.quoting broadrick oklahoma.in limiting its review,the court stressed the specific factual context of the carlin monologue,id.at,focusing in particular on carlin deliberate and repetitive use of expletives to describe sexual and excretory activities.
the court then went on to hold that the fcc could,at least in the situation before it,restrict indecent speech in the broadcast context that did not meet the legal definition of obscenity.id.at concluding that if the government has any such power to restrict indecent speech,this was an appropriate occasion for its exercise.resting on a nuisance rationale,the court first noted that of all forms of communication,it is broadcasting that has received the most limited first amendment protection because of its uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans.id.at.moreover,the nature of broadcast opposed to printed it uniquely accessible to children,even those too young to read.id.at.the court,however,emphasize d the narrowness of its holding.id.at.n uisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.we simply hold that when the commission finds that a pig has entered the parlor,the exercise of its regulatory power does not depend on proof that the pig is obscene.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
justices powell and blackmun,who concurred in a separate opinion,also made clear that the fcc regulatory authority was limited,stating that the court holding did not give the fcc an unrestricted license to decide what speech,protected in other media,may be banned from the airwaves in order to protect unwilling adults from momentary exposure to it in their homes.id.at powell,concurring.nor,they explained,did the holding speak to cases involving the isolated use of a potentially offensive word in the course of a radio broadcast,as distinguished from the verbal shock treatment administered by respondent here.id.at.finally,they took the fcc at its word that it would proceed cautiously,which they reasoned would minimize any chilling effect that might otherwise result.id.at.
in the years after pacifica,the fcc did indeed pursue a restrained enforcement policy,taking the position that its enforcement powers were limited to the seven specific words in the carlin monologue.see in re application of wgbh educ,at infinity broadcasting,et,rcd,at infinity order.no enforcement actions were brought between and.infinity order,rcd,at.then,in,the fcc abandoned its focus on specific words,concluding that although enforcement was clearly easier under the standard,it could lead to anomalous results that could not be justified.id.at.the fcc reasoned that under the prior standard,patently offensive material was permissible as long as it avoided certain words.this,the commission concluded,made neither legal nor policy sense.id.the commission instead decided to utilize the definition it had used in pacifica,adopting a contextual approach to indecent speech.
despite its move to a more flexible standard,the fcc continued to exercise restraint.in particular,it consistently held that a single,use of an expletive was not actionably indecent.see,in re application of wgbh educ.found,at.noting that the single use of an expletive in a program that aired at pm should not call for us to act under the holding of pacifica in re regents of the of,rcd,at speech that is indecent must involve more than an isolated use of an offensive word.communications of,rcd,finding the single utterance of the not indecent because it was a fleeting and isolated utterance which,within the context of live and spontaneous programming,does not warrant a commission sanction in re application of lincoln dweller,renewal of the license of stations kprl am and kddb fm,rcd,the use of a single expletive did not warrant further review in light of the isolated and accidental nature of the broadcast.
in,in an attempt to provide guidance to the broadcast industry regarding its enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency,the fcc issued a policy statement in which it set forth its indecency standard in more detail.industry guidance on the commission case law interpreting,rcd,at industry guidance.in industry guidance,the fcc explained that an indecency finding involved the following two determinations whether the material describe s or depict s sexual or excretory organs or activities and whether the broadcast is patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium.id.at emphasis omitted.the fcc further explained that it considered the following three factors in determining whether a broadcast is patently offensive the explicitness or graphic nature of the description or depiction whether the material dwells on or repeats at length the description or depiction and whether the material appears to pander or is used to titillate,or whether the materials appears to have been presented for its shock value.id.at emphasis omitted.the industry guidance reiterated that under the second prong of the patently offensive test,fleeting and isolated expletives were not actionably indecent.id.at.
in,however,the fcc policy on indecency changed.during the golden globe awards,band member bono exclaimed,upon receiving an award,this is really,really,fucking brilliant.really,really,great.in re complaints against various broadcast licensees regarding their airing of the golden globe awards program,rcd,at golden globes order.in response to complaints filed after the incident,the fcc declared,for the first time,that a single,nonliteral use of an expletive a fleeting expletive could be actionably indecent finding that the is one of the most vulgar,graphic,and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the english language,id.at,and therefore inherently has a sexual connotation,id.at,the fcc concluded that the fleeting and isolated use of the word was irrelevant and overruled all prior decisions in which fleeting use of an expletive was held per se not indecent,id.at.the fcc also found that the broadcast was profane within the meaning of section,abandoning its previous interpretation of the term to mean blasphemy.id.at.
at the same time that the fcc expanded its enforcement efforts to include even fleeting expletives,the fcc also began issuing record fines for indecency violations while the commission had previously interpreted the maximum fines in the statute as applying on a perprogram basis,it began treating each licensee broadcast of the same program as a separate violation,thereby multiplying the maximum fine the fcc could order for each instance of indecent speech.in addition,congress amended section b c ii to increase the maximum fine permitted by a factor of to that the fine for a single expletive uttered during a broadcast could easily run into the tens of millions of dollars.see b c iii.
nbc universal,nbc,along with numerous other parties,filed petitions for reconsideration of the golden globes order before the fcc,raising statutory and constitutional challenges to the new policy.while the petitions for reconsideration were pending,the fcc applied the golden globes order policy in in re complaints regarding various television broadcasts between february,and march,rcd.omnibus order,which the commission stated was intended to provide substantial guidance to broadcasters and the public about what was considered indecent under the new policy.id.at.in the omnibus order which dealt with many more programs than are at issue in the present case,the commission found four billboard music awards,the billboard music awards,various episodes of abc nypd blue,and cbs the early and profane under the golden globes standard.
all four programs involved what could be characterized as fleeting expletives.for instance,during the billboard music awards,cher,in an unscripted moment from her acceptance speech,stated people have been telling me i on the way out every year,right so fuck em.id.at.similarly,during the billboard music awards,nicole stage to present an award with paris the following unscripted remark have you ever tried to get cow shit out of a prada purse it not so fucking simple.id.at.episodes of nypd blue were found indecent based on several instances of the word bullshit,id.at,while the cbs the early show was found indecent on the basis of a guest use of the word bullshitter to describe a fellow contestant on the reality tv show,survivor vanuatu,id.at.
in finding these programs indecent and profane,the fcc reaffirmed its decision in the golden globes order that any use of the word fuck was presumptively indecent and profane,id.at,further concluding that any use of the word shit was also presumptively indecent and profane,id.at.it also held that the four broadcasts in question were patently offensive because the material was explicit,shocking,and gratuitous,notwithstanding the fact that the expletives were fleeting and isolated.id.
fox television stations,fox,cbs broadcasting cbs,and abc abc,as well as several network affiliates,filed petitions for review of the omnibus order the fcc moved for a voluntary remand,which we granted,so that it could have the opportunity to address petitioners arguments and could ensure that all licensees had a full opportunity to be heard before the fcc issued a final decision.after soliciting public comments,the fcc issued a second order on november.see in re complaints regarding various television broadcasts between february,and march,rcd.remand order.in the remand order,the fcc reaffirmed its finding that the and billboard music awards were indecent and profane.however,the fcc reversed its finding with respect to the early show and dismissed the complaint against nypd blue on procedural grounds 
in the remand order,the fcc rejected the petitioners argument that uses of expletives were not indecent,reasoning that any strict dichotomy between expletives and descriptions or depictions of sexual or excretory functions is artificial and does not make sense in light of the fact that an expletive power to offend derives from its sexual or excretory meaning.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,the commission did not take the position that any occurrence of an expletive is indecent or profane under its rules,allowing that expletives that were integral to an artistic work or occurring during a bona fide news interview might not run afoul of the indecency standard.id.at emphasis added.as such,it reversed its previous decision concerning the cbs the early show because the utterance of the word bullshitter took place during a bona fide news interview.the commission made clear,however,that there is no outright news exemption from our indecency rules.id.at.
petitioners and intervenors which collectively represented all the major broadcast networks as well as local affiliates affected by the fcc indecency policy hereinafter,the networks,returned to this court for review of the remand order,making a variety of administrative,statutory,and constitutional arguments.in a decision with judge leval in dissent,we held that the fcc indecency policy was arbitrary and capricious under the apa.fox,at.we reached this decision because we believed that the fcc had failed to adequately explain why it had changed its policy on fleeting expletives.id.at.moreover,we noted that the fcc justification for the children could be harmed by hearing even one fleeting expletive the first blow theory bore no rational connection to the commission actual policy,because the fcc had not instituted a blanket ban on expletives.id.
because we struck down the indecency policy on apa grounds,we declined to reach the constitutional issues in the case.we noted,however,that we were skeptical that the commission could provide a reasoned explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster.id.at.we expressed sympathy for the networks contention that the fcc indecency test wa s undefined,indiscernible,inconsistent,and consequently,unconstitutionally vague.id.at.we were also troubled that the fcc policy appeared to permit it to sanction speech based on its subjective view of the merit of that speech.id.at.however,because it was unnecessary for us to reach them,we left those issues for another day.the fcc subsequently filed a writ of certiorari,which the supreme court granted.
in a decision,the supreme court reversed our apa ruling,holding that the fcc fleeting expletive policy was not arbitrary and capricious because t he commission could reasonably conclude that the pervasiveness of foul language,and the coarsening of public entertainment in other media such as cable,justify more stringent regulation of broadcast programs so as to give conscientious parents a relatively safe haven for their children.at.however,the court declined to address the networks constitutional arguments,see ing no reason to abandon our usual procedures in a rush to judgment without a lower court opinion,and remanded for us to consider them in the first instance.thus,after further briefing by the parties,intervenors,and amici,we now turn to the question that we deferred in our previous the fcc indecency policy violates the first amendment.
discussion 
it is that indecent speech is fully protected by the first amendment.reno aclu,where obscenity is not involved,the fact that protected speech may be offensive to some does not justify its suppression.quoting carey population servs.int l.in most contexts,the supreme court has considered restrictions on indecent speech to be restrictions subject to strict scrutiny.see united states playboy entm t group.for instance,in reno aclu,the supreme court struck down the communications decency act of,finding that a provision criminalizing the knowing transmission of indecent speech through the internet was unconstitutionally vague and not narrowly tailored.at.in playboy,the supreme court confronted a provision of the telecommunications act of that prohibited cable television operators from broadcasting sexual content during certain hours.while recognizing that television presents unique problems not present in other mediums,the court held unequivocally that the restriction was subject to strict scrutiny,and struck it down because scrambling technology provided a less restrictive means of protecting minors from indecent content.at.similarly,the supreme court in sable communications of california,fcc declared unconstitutional a provision of the communications act that prohibited the transmission of indecent commercial telephone messages,finding that a total ban was not the least restrictive means available.
broadcast radio and television,however,have always occupied a unique position when it comes to first amendment protection.the categorization of broadcasting as different from all other forms of communication pacifica.see,red lion broad.fcc,although broadcasting is clearly a medium affected by a first amendment interest,differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the first amendment standards applied to them.internal citation omitted.and the supreme court has continuously reaffirmed the distinction between broadcasting and other forms of media since pacifica.see reno,at sable,at.however,it was in pacifica that the supreme court gave its fullest explanation for why restrictions on broadcast speech were subject to a lower level of scrutiny,relying on the twin pillars of pervasiveness and accessibility to children.at.while pacifica did not specify what level of scrutiny applies to restrictions on broadcast speech,subsequent cases have applied something akin to intermediate scrutiny.see fcc league of women voters.
the networks argue that the world has changed since pacifica and the reasons underlying the decision are no longer valid.indeed,we face a media landscape that would have been almost unrecognizable in.cable television was still in its infancy.the internet was a project run out of the department of defense with several hundred users.not only did youtube,facebook,and twitter not exist,but their founders were either still in diapers or not yet conceived.in this environment,broadcast television undoubtedly possessed a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans.pacifica,at.
the same can not be said today.the past thirty years has seen an explosion of media sources,and broadcast television has become only one voice in the chorus.cable television is almost as pervasive as percent of households subscribe to a cable or satellite most viewers can alternate between broadcast and channels with a click of their remote control.see in re annual assessment of the status of competition in the market for the delivery of video programming,fcc rcd,at.the internet,too,has become omnipresent,offering access to everything from viral videos to feature films and,yes,even broadcast television programs.see in re implementation of the child safe viewing act examination of parental control technologies for video or audio programming,rcd,at csva report the number of suppliers of online video and audio is almost limitless.as the fcc itself acknowledges,c hildren today live in a media environment that is dramatically different from the one in which their parents and grandparents grew up decades ago.in the matter of empowering parents and protecting children in an evolving media landscape,rcd,at.
moreover,technological changes have given parents the ability to decide which programs they will permit their children to watch.every television,inches or larger,sold in the united states since january contains a,which allows parents to block programs based on a standardized rating system.x.moreover,since june,when the united states made the transition to digital television,anyone using a digital converter box also has access to a.csva report,rcd,at.in short,there now exists a way to block programs that contain indecent speech in a way that was not possible in.in fact,the existence of technology that allowed for blocking of unwanted cable channels was one of the principle distinctions between cable television and broadcast media drawn by the supreme court in playboy.the court explained 
the option to block reduces the likelihood,so concerning to the court in pacifica,that traditional first amendment scrutiny would deprive the government of all authority to address this sort of problem.the corollary,of course,is that targeted blocking enables the government to support parental authority without affecting the first amendment interests of speakers and willing for whom,if the speech is unpopular or indecent,the privacy of their own homes may be the optimal place of receipt.
playboy,at internal citation omitted.we can think of no reason why this rationale for applying strict scrutiny in the case of cable television would not apply with equal force to broadcast television in light of the technology that is now available.
nevertheless,as we stated in our previous decision,we are bound by supreme court precedent,regardless of whether it reflects today realities.the supreme court may decide in due course to overrule pacifica and subject speech restrictions in the broadcast context to strict scrutiny.this court,however,is not at liberty to depart from binding supreme court precedent unless and until the court reinterpret s that precedent.onesimpleloan sec y of,cir quoting agostini felton,alterations in original.the networks,although they may wish it otherwise,seem to concede that we must evaluate the fcc indecency policy under the framework established by the supreme court in pacifica.see abc television affiliates association br.at.
there is considerable disagreement among the parties,however,as to what framework pacifica established.the fcc interprets pacifica as permitting it to exercise broad regulatory authority to sanction indecent speech.in its view,the carlin monologue was only the most extreme example of a large category of indecent speech that the fcc can constitutionally prohibit.the networks,on the other hand,view pacifica as establishing the limit of the fcc authority.in other words,they believe that only when indecent speech rises to the level of verbal shock treatment,exemplified by the carlin monologue,can the fcc impose a civil forfeiture.because pacifica was an intentionally narrow opinion,it does not provide us with a clear answer to this question.fortunately,we do not need to wade into the brambles in an attempt to answer it ourselves.for we conclude that,regardless of where the outer limit of the fcc authority lies,the fcc indecency policy is unconstitutional because it is impermissibly vague.it is to this issue that we now turn 
it is a basic principle that a law or regulation is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.piscottano murphy,cir quoting grayned city of rockford.a law or regulation is impermissibly vague if it does not give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.farrell burke,cir quoting grayned,at.the first amendment places a special burden on the government to ensure that restrictions on speech are not impermissibly vague.see perez hoblock,cir a law or regulation that threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights,such as the right of free speech,will generally be subject to a more stringent vagueness test.quoting vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates.however,perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.united states.williams,quoting ward rock against racism.
the vagueness doctrine serves several important objectives in the first amendment context.first,the doctrine is based on the principle of fair notice.w e assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct and we give him notice of what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly.farrell,at quoting grayned,at.notice is particularly important with respect to speech restrictions because of their obvious chilling effect on free speech.reno,at.vague regulations inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.farrell,at quoting grayned,at.second,the vagueness doctrine is based on the need to eliminate the impermissible risk of discriminatory enforcement.gentile state bar of.a vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to government officials for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis grayned,at emphasis added.specificity,on the other hand,guards against subjectivity and discriminatory enforcement.
the networks argue that the fcc indecency test is unconstitutionally vague because it provides no clear guidelines as to what is covered and thus forces broadcasters to steer far wider of the unlawful zone,rather than risk massive fines.in support of their position,the networks rely on the supreme court decision in reno aclu.section a of the communications decency act cda prohibited transmitting indecent material to minors over the internet while section d prohibited material that in context,depicts or describes,in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,sexual or excretory activities or organs.id.at quoting d.in addition to finding that the statute was not narrowly tailored,the court found the statute unconstitutionally vague because the many ambiguities concerning the scope of its coverage render ed it problematic for purposes of the first amendment.id.at.the court found that the statute use of the general,undefined terms indecent and patently offensive cover ed large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value.because of the vague contours of the regulation,the court held that it unquestionably silence d some speakers whose messages would be entitled to constitutional protection.id.at.the networks argue that since reno found this indecency regulation unconstitutionally vague,the fcc indecency test for broadcasting must fall as well.
fcc argues the reno forecloses a vagueness challenge to the fcc policy.in reno,the government argued that the cda was plainly constitutional under the pacifica decision.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument,distinguishing pacifica on the grounds that the fcc is an expert agency that had been regulating the radio for decades the cda was a categorical ban on speech while the fcc indecency regulation designated than would be permissible to air such a program the order at issue in pacifica was not punitive and the broadcast medium had traditionally received the most limited first amendment protection.id.at.according to the fcc,because the court refused to find pacifica controlling of the constitutional challenges to the cda,we must find reno equally inapplicable here.
as an initial matter,we reject the fcc argument that reno forecloses the networks vagueness challenge.when the supreme court distinguished pacifica in reno,it did so with respect to the level of first amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium,not to its analysis of whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague.id.at.broadcasters are entitled to the same degree of clarity as other speakers,even if restrictions on their speech are subject to a lower level of scrutiny.it is the language of the rule,not the medium in which it is applied,that determines whether a law or regulation is impermissibly vague.
we also reject the networks argument that reno requires us to find the fcc policy vague.to be sure,the cda definition of indecency was almost identical to the commission,and language that is unconstitutionally vague in one context can not suddenly become the model of clarity in another.however,unlike in reno,the fcc has further elaborated on the definition of indecency in the broadcast context.for example,the fcc has outlined three factors that it purportedly uses to determine whether a broadcast is patently offensive,industry guidance,rcd,at,and has declared fuck and shit presumptively indecent,omnibus order,rcd,at.this additional guidance may not be sufficient to survive a vagueness challenge,but it certainly distinguishes the fcc policy from the one struck down in reno.
finally,we reject the fcc argument that the networks vagueness challenge is foreclosed by pacifica itself.pacifica,which did not reach the question of whether the fcc policy was unconstitutionally vague,was an intentionally narrow opinion predicated on the fcc restrained enforcement policy.pacifica,at powell,concurring.the fcc policy has now changed and we would be hard pressed to characterize it as restrained.thus,the questions left unresolved by pacifica are now squarely before us,as the supreme court itself indicated in its opinion above.see fox.at w hether the fcc policy is unconstitutional,will be determined soon enough,perhaps in this very case.
having concluded that neither pacifica nor reno resolves the question,we must now decide whether the fcc indecency policy provides a discernible standard by which broadcasters can accurately predict what speech is prohibited.the fcc set forth its indecency policy in its industry guidance,in which the fcc explained that an indecency finding involved the following two determinations whether the material describe s or depict s sexual or excretory organs or activities and whether the broadcast is patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium.id.at.under the policy,whether a broadcast is patently offensive depends on the following three factors the explicitness or graphic nature of the description or depiction whether the material dwells on or repeats at length the description or depiction and whether the material appears to pander or is used to titillate,or whether the materials appears to have been presented for its shock value.id.at emphasis added.since,the fcc has interpreted its indecency policy in a number of decisions,including golden globes order and the orders on review here.
the fcc argues that the indecency policy in its industry guidance,together with its subsequent decisions,give the broadcasters sufficient notice as to what will be considered indecent.the networks argue that the policy is impermissibly vague and that the fcc decisions interpreting the policy only add to the confusion of what will be considered indecent.
we agree with the networks that the indecency policy is impermissibly vague.the first problem arises in the fcc determination as to which words or expressions are patently offensive.for instance,while the fcc concluded that bullshit in a nypd blue episode was patently offensive,it concluded that dick and dickhead were not.omnibus order,rcd,at.other expletives such as pissed off,up yours,kiss my ass,and wiping his ass were also not found to be patently offensive.id.at.the commission argues that its patently offensive test gives broadcasters fair notice of what it will find indecent.however,in each of these cases,the commission reasoning consisted of repetition of one or more of the factors without any discussion of how it applied them.thus,the word bullshit is indecent because it is vulgar,graphic and explicit while the words dickhead was not indecent because it was not sufficiently vulgar,explicit,or graphic.this hardly gives broadcasters notice of how the commission will apply the factors in the future.
the english language is rife with creative ways of depicting sexual or excretory organs or activities,and even if the fcc were able to provide a complete list of all such expressions,new offensive and indecent words are invented every day.for many years after pacifica,the fcc decided to focus its enforcement efforts solely on the seven dirty words in the carlin monologue.see infinity order,rcd,at.this strategy had its meant that some indecent speech that did not employ these seven words slipped through the cracks.however,it had the advantage of providing broadcasters with a clear list of words that were prohibited.not surprisingly,in the nine years between pacifica and the fcc abandonment of this policy,not a single enforcement action was brought.this could be because we lived in a simpler time before such foul language was common.or,it could be that the fcc policy was sufficiently clear that broadcasters knew what was prohibited.
the fcc argues that a flexible standard is necessary precisely because the list was not simply found offensive ways of depicting sexual or excretory organs or activities without using any of the seven words.in other words,because the fcc can not anticipate how broadcasters will attempt to circumvent the prohibition on indecent speech,the fcc needs the maximum amount of flexibility to be able to decide what is indecent.the observation that people will always find a way to subvert censorship laws may expose a certain futility in the fcc crusade against indecent speech,but it does not provide a justification for implementing a vague,indiscernible standard.if the fcc can not anticipate what will be considered indecent under its policy,then it can hardly expect broadcasters to do so.and while the fcc characterizes all broadcasters as consciously trying to push the envelope on what is permitted,much like a petulant teenager angling for a later curfew,the networks have expressed a good faith desire to comply with the fcc indecency regime.they simply want to know with some degree of certainty what the policy is so that they can comply with it.the first amendment requires nothing less.
the same vagueness problems plague the fcc presumptive prohibition on the words fuck and shit and the exceptions thereto.under the fcc current policy,all variants of these two words are indecent unless one of two exceptions apply.the first is the bona fide news exception,which the fcc has failed to explain except to say that it is not absolute.the second is the artistic necessity exception,in which fleeting expletives are permissible if they are demonstrably essential to the nature of an artistic or educational work or essential to informing viewers on a matter of public importance.omnibus order,rcd,at.in deciding whether this exception applies,the fcc consider s whether the material has any social,scientific or artistic value.in re complaints against various television licensees regarding their broadcast on november,of the abc television network presentation of the film saving private ryan,rcd,at saving private ryan.
as we stated in our previous opinion 
although the commission has declared that all variants of fuck and shit are presumptively indecent and profane,repeated use of those words in saving private ryan,for example,was neither indecent nor profane.and while multiple occurrences of expletives in saving private ryan was not gratuitous,a single occurrence of fucking in the golden globe awards was shocking and gratuitous.parental ratings and advisories were important in finding saving private ryan not patently offensive under contemporary community standards,but irrelevant in evaluating a rape scene in another fictional movie.the use of numerous expletives was integral to a fictional movie about war,but occasional expletives spoken by real musicians were indecent and profane because the educational purpose of the documentary could have been fulfilled and all viewpoints expressed without the repeated broadcast of expletives.the on the early show was not indecent because it was in the context of a bona fide news interview,but there is no outright news exemption from our indecency rules.
fox,at internal citations and emphasis omitted.there is little rhyme or reason to these decisions and broadcasters are left to guess whether an expletive will be deemed integral to a program or whether the fcc will consider a particular broadcast a bona fide news interview.
the fcc created these exceptions because it recognized that an outright ban on certain words would raise grave first amendment concerns.in the omnibus order,the fcc recognize d the need for caution with respect to complaints implicating the editorial judgment of broadcast licensees in presenting news and public affairs programming,as these matters are at the core of the first amendment free press guarantee.rcd,at.likewise,in applying the artistic necessity exception,the fcc noted that it was obligated to proceed with due respect for the high value our constitution places on freedom and choice in what the people say and hear,particularly with respect to speech that has social,scientific or artistic value.saving private ryan,rcd,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is these same concerns that informed the fcc original restrained enforcement policy,which had the advantage of prohibiting the most egregious instances of indecent speech while minimizing the burden on protected speech.
the fcc current indecency policy undoubtedly gives the fcc more flexibility,but this flexibility comes at a price.the artistic necessity and bona fide news exceptions allow the fcc to decide,in each case,whether the first amendment is implicated.the policy may maximize the amount of speech that the fcc can prohibit,but it results in a standard that even the fcc can not articulate or apply consistently.thus,it found the use of the word bullshitter on cbs the early show to be shocking and gratuitous because it occurred during a morning television interview,omnibus order,fcc rcd,at,before reversing itself because the broadcast was a bona fide news interview.remand order,fcc rcd,at.in other words,the fcc reached diametrically opposite conclusions at different stages of the proceedings for precisely the same the word bullshitter was uttered during a news program.and when judge leval asked during oral argument if a program about the dangers of sex designed for teenagers would be permitted,the most that the fcc lawyer could say was i suspect it would.with millions of dollars and core first amendment values at stake,i suspect is simply not good enough.
with the fcc indiscernible standards come the risk that such standards will be enforced in a discriminatory manner.the vagueness doctrine is intended,in part,to avoid that risk.if government officials are permitted to make decisions on an ad hoc basis,there is a risk that those decisions will reflect the officials subjective biases.grayned,at.thus,in the licensing context,the supreme court has consistently rejected regulations that give government officials too much discretion because such discretion has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.forsyth county,nationalist movement,internal quotation marks omitted see also city of lakewood plain dealer pub,permit scheme facially unconstitutional because post hoc rationalizations by the licensing official and the use of shifting or illegitimate criteria are far too easy,making it difficult for courts to determine in any particular case whether the licensor is permitting favorable,and suppressing unfavorable,expression.
we have no reason to suspect that the fcc is using its indecency policy as a means of suppressing particular points of view.but even the risk of such subjective,raises grave concerns under the first amendment.take,for example,the disparate treatment of saving private ryan and the documentary,the blues.the fcc decided that the words fuck and shit were integral to the realism and immediacy of the film experience for viewers in saving private ryan,but not in the blues.fox,at.we query how fleeting expletives could be more essential to the realism of a fictional movie than to the realism of interviews with real people about real life events,and it is hard not to speculate that the fcc was simply more comfortable with the themes in saving private ryan,a mainstream movie with a familiar cultural milieu,than it was with the blues,which largely profiled an outsider genre of musical experie
