guy martino appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to his former employer,mci communications services,and then,following a merger,verizon business network services,unless specificity is needed,we refer to both as the company.martino alleges that the company selected him for termination during a nationwide reduction in force rif because he was nearing his birthday.the district court decided that no reasonable jury could reach that conclusion.martino appeals and we review the district court decision de novo,starting with the facts viewed in the light most favorable to martino.
martino was exactly a spring chicken when he started working for mci.he was.but apparently that did trouble mci or the manager who interviewed him,bob gross.from the time he began his employment in february to the day he was released in july,martino reported to gross in his capacity as a business solutions consultant,or bsc.in that position,martino assisted core sales teams,which in turn had a list of client accounts.to use the company lingo,martino was in an overlay provided support to sales teams but never actually spearheaded sales.on the other hand,martino had a financial stake in the process.in addition to a salary,he received commissions on sales to which he was assigned.that would bring quite the benefit when martino had the good fortune to work on a deal with british petroleum bp.
mci began negotiations with bp over the summer of and closed the deal in october.although martino was technically part of the team working the deal,his involvement was peripheral.even at that,some of the more important people schiffman,the core sales rep who quarterbacked the deal,and steve rumstein,the director of it hosting martino came up short.one of the key phases of the transaction was drafting a response to bp request for proposal rfp.in plain english,this was mci chance to make its sales pitch.schiffman took the lead on the project,but he assigned martino the task of gathering and providing technical information regarding data centers and products and services.from schiffman perspective,martino failed in that task.he did not do an adequate job in assisting the core sales team he provided inaccurate incomplete information he was frequently inaccessible and he was not a team player.rumstein impression was much the same.he expected martino to take a much stronger leadership role in driving the sale process.naturally,martino had a different view of things.he said his colleagues relied very heavily on him from a hosting standpoint,and he would like to think of himself as a key person on the deal.
in any event,martino got credit for the bp deal after it closed,boosting his sales figures well over quota and turning a handsome commission.that was,however,the sole bright spot in an otherwise unremarkable tenure.nearly percent of martino sales during his employment resulted from the bp deal and,as we noted,martino credit for those sales was more a consequence of the nature of mci crediting acknowledge everyone involved,no matter how weak their of hard work.when the bp deal was in play,martino numbers suffered.in,he failed to reach quota during march,april,may,june,july,august,september,november,and december.and in the absence of the bp deal,martino would have hit only percent of his quota for.martino therefore puts it rather mildly when he says the bp transaction was just a significant contributor to his overall performance.
but apart from the fact that the bp deal was martino only big he was hardly instrumental to the deal at skill set was soon to be obsolete.following mci merger with verizon in january,sweeping changes took place.verizon did a redundancy analysis to identify duplicative positions,a common practice when companies in the same industry merge.naturally,redundancies were found,and that led to a rif.but in martino department at least,something else drove the rif.verizon wanted to shift the focus of that department,it hosting solutions,to the provision of more complex services.bear with us now as we march through the associated jargon.
during martino employment with the company,the data services sold were either colocation services or managed hosting services.colocation involved a client purchasing space,power,and cooling for its servers in the company data centers.the client managed the servers.in managed services,on the other hand,the client purchased space,power,and cooling,but the company managed the servers and applications.so colocation services were more basic and thus cheaper,while managed services were more elaborate,involved more work on the company end,and presumably generated more revenue.when verizon took over it decided to change the role of the bscs in all of this.going forward,bscs would no longer be responsible for selling basic colocation services.instead,they would only receive credit and commissions for the sale of managed services,and they would be expected to take a more active role in the sales process.this was problematic for martino because he had limited success selling managed services the majority of his qualified the bp transaction in which he did not meaningfully of basic colocation services.martino was thus a prime candidate for termination.
and terminated he was.word came down in june that employees needed to be discharged from it services of which martino group,it hosting solutions,was a subunit.ed franklin,the of it services,in turn asked rumstein to submit a list of individuals from it hosting solutions least likely to contribute to the company moving forward.in addition to martino,rumstein identified five others,all of whom were significantly younger than martino ranging in age from to.he considered several factors to come up with the names,including geographical coverage because some areas were staffed more adequately than others the employee demonstrated ability to sell the complete product line with a particular emphasis on managed hosting services credibility with core sales teams and actual sales performance.rumstein placed limited weight on this last factor,however,since,as we have explained,the sales numbers could be skewed by virtue of the crediting system.considering all the factors,rumstein believed martino looked good on paper but brought little to the table beyond that,especially in light of the shifted focus to managed hosting services.
franklin then decided to discharge martino along similar lines 
after receiving rumstein list,i selected martino for the rif based on his performance.although martino qualified sales numbers were very good on their face,a deeper inquiry into his performance revealed that he was not as strong as his numbers suggested.first,the overwhelming majority of his qualified sales were a result of one sale to bp that occurred in.based on information i received from my reports,most notably from rumstein,i was aware that martino did not participate in the bp sale in a meaningful way.second,martino track record as a business solutions consultant demonstrated that he had a limited ability to sell managed services or services and,instead,the majority of his qualified sales consisted of basic colocation services.at the time of the rif,verizon was planning to change the bsc position such that bscs would be responsible for selling only managed services,and no longer be responsible for selling colocation services,in the second half of or the beginning of.
in other words,franklin decision was based entirely on the needs of verizon and nothing else.indeed,from the looks of it,franklin was unaware at the time of martino age.
so,where is the evidence of age discrimination martino concedes that there is none when it comes to either the actual decisionmaker franklin or the manager who offered him up as a rif candidate rumstein.invoking the cat paw theory,however,he contends that he has a viable claim for discriminatory discharge through the alleged animus of a,his immediate supervisor.according to martino,gross sometimes called him an oldtimer.that does strike us as inherently friends it often a term of martino sees it as evidence of bias in favor of the young.before we test that claim,though,let r
