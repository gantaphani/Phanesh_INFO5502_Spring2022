on july and,the federal communications commission auctioned licenses for a slender band of spectrum known as the interactive video and data services ivds spectrum auction.the ivds spectrum consists of two kilohertz channels mhz and mhz and auction distributed one license for each channel in metropolitan statistical areas msas a total of licenses.the petitioners were among auction winning bidders.
petitioners seek review of a final order of the fcc that eliminated a percent bidding credit for businesses owned by women or members of racial minorities established and retroactively applied a substantially similar bidding credit to licensees that qualified as small businesses and offered various options for licensees to restructure their outstanding financial obligations to the commission.see in re amendment of part of the commission rules to provide regulatory flexibility in the mhz service,restructuring order.petitioners contend that the restructuring order unlawfully limited the bidding credit to small business licensees.petitioner celtronix also argues that the commission arbitrarily rejected celtronix proposed restructuring options.we conclude that the restructuring order was a lawful and reasonable exercise of the commission authority over spectrum auctions,and accordingly deny the petitions for review.
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat,amended the communications act to require the commission to distribute spectrum licenses through a system of competitive bidding.see id.at a,stat.codified as amended at j.congress further required that the commission,in designing competitive bidding processes,ensure that small businesses,rural telephone companies,and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of services,and,for such purposes,consider the use of bidding preferences,stat.codified at j d.responding to this mandate,the commission established for auction a percent bidding credit for businesses owned by women or that could be applied to one license in each msa.see in re implementation of section j of the communications act competitive bidding,auction rules d the bidding credit operated to reduce the amount a winning bidder owed the commission by percent.
the commission also sought to assist small businesses by allowing winning small business to make a percent down payment and to pay the remaining percent in installments over the term of the license.see auction rules,at d.small businesses owned by women or minorities were allowed to take advantage of both the bidding credit and the installment payment plan.see auction rules,at,fcc auction bidder information package procedures,terms and conditions,available at http last visited.
of the winning bidders,qualified as small businesses those small businesses won of the available licenses.see fcc auction results,availableat last visited.one hundred and four winning bidders qualified for the bidding credit and those businesses accumulated licenses nearly half of the available total.id.every winning bidder who qualified for the bidding credit also qualified for the small business installment payment option.see restructuring order,at.the auction experiences of certain petitioners illustrate the operation of the different payment options 
sioux valley rural television was the high bidder in the rapid city,south dakotamsa with a bid of.see fcc auction results.because it was neither a small business nor owned by women or minorities,sioux valley could not employ either the bidding credit or the installment payment option.the next high bidder in the market,media ventures,bid and was awarded the second license.id.media ventures,however,satisfied the ownership and small business requirements,and so the commission reduced media ventures obligation by percent to and allowed it to pay that amount on a installment plan.id.
having bid,self communications,was the bidder for the gary,indiana msa.id.like sioux valley,self communications was not minority or and did not qualify as a small business,and therefore it owed the full amount of its bid upon receipt of the license.id.by contrast,the high bidder for the market,skytouch communications,received a bidding credit,and thus owed the commission only for the license an amount which skytouch,as a small business,was allowed to pay in installments.id.
celtronix telemetry then doing business as community teleplay,was the bidder for the norfolk,virginia market,having offered.id.while celtronix did not receive the benefit of a bidding credit,as a small business it was permitted to make a percent down payment and to pay the remaining percent of its bid in installments over the term of the license.id.
after the results of auction were announced,another winning bidder,graceba total communications,petitioned the commission for reconsideration,arguing that the commission auction procedures had artificially inflated the prices of the ivds licenses.while that petition was pending before the commission,the supreme court decided adarand constructors,pena,d,and held that racial classifications in federal government contracts were subject to strict scrutiny.id.at.the following term,the court held that classifications in government programs must be justified by an exceedingly persuasive justification.united states virginia,d vmi.immediately after adarand,graceba filed a second petition for reconsideration arguing that the commission bidding credit was unconstitutional and requesting that the commission grant it the same percent bidding credit.see restructuring order,at.
finding that graceba constitutional argument had not been timely raised,the commission denied both of graceba petitions.see in re interactive video data service ivds licenses various requests by auction winners.on graceba petition for review,we vacated that order and remanded for consideration of graceba constitutional arguments.graceba total communications,fcc.in so doing,we noted that graceba case raised not only constitutional arguments,but also,policyladen concerns such as questions about the finality of fcc licenses,and fairness to auction participants,resolution of which would benefit from the agency expertise.id.at.
meanwhile,the ivds spectrum was turning out to be an idea whose time had not yet come.the function initially envisioned for the spectrum interactive television was no longer seen as a commercially viable enterprise.see restructuring order,at.in,less than two years after auction,a coalition of ivds licensees sought relief from their financial obligations to the commission,including an extension of the license term and a concomitant extension of the installment payment amortization schedule from five to ten years,along with grace periods from payments.see in re amendment of part of the commission rules to provide regulatory flexibility in the mhz service.in response,the commission effectively suspended payment obligations for licensees not already in default,id.at,and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to examine possibilities for restructuring the licensees financial obligations to the commission,id.at.at that time,the commission also dropped the ivds moniker and eponymously renamed the sliver of spectrum the mhz service.id.at.the name change,however,could not disguise the fact that the deployment of the mhz service had not been successful w ith a few,limited exceptions,licensees had still been unable to offer services.restructuring order,at.
the restructuring order 
responding to both the continuing dormancy of the mhz spectrum and this court graceba remand,the commission released its restructuring order in september.see at.in the restructuring order,the commission took several steps to mitigate the financial distress of the mhz small business licensees with outstanding installment payment obligations to the commission.first,the commission extended the term of the mhz licenses from five to ten years.see id.at.the commission also provided those small business licensees not then in default with three options to restructure their installment payments to the commission resumption,amnesty,or prepayment.see id.at.under the resumption option,the licensee would resume installment payments,reamortized over the new license term.see id.at.the amnesty option allowed a licensee to return to the commission one or more of the licenses it had been awarded.in return,the commission would extinguish any debt associated with that license and refund any installment payments previously made,except for the percent down payment.see id.at.finally,under the prepayment option,a licensee could retain a license by paying in full the outstanding balance on that license,using as part of the prepayment percent of the down payments on licenses surrendered under the amnesty option.see id.at.
the commission also restructured its bidding credit system in response to this court remand in graceba and comments from numerous licensees arguing that the bidding credit ran afoul of the supreme court recent decisions in adarand and vmi.see id.at.the commenting licensees not minority or argued that they,too,were entitled to a percent bidding credit,retroactively applied.see id.at.in its restructuring order,the commission acknowledged that the administrative record on ownership of telecommunications facilities would not adequately support the race and provisions of the competitive bidding rules under a strict scrutiny standard.id.at.the commission thus sought to craft a remedy responsive to the commenters.id.
the commission decided to eliminate from our rules the minority and business bidding credits and simultaneously grant credits of commensurate size to all winning small business bidders in auction.id.this new percent bidding credit for small businesses was called the remedial bidding credit rbc.id.at.the commission noted that while it had revoked the bidding credit previously given to minority and businesses,those businesses would suffer no known negative impact because all such bidders also met the small business qualifications,and therefore would be awarded the substantially identical rbc.id.at.the commission concluded that this course eliminating the unconstitutional bidding credit,then establishing a similar but race and credit strikes a proper balance between the need to cure the bidding credit system of constitutional defects,on the one hand,and auction policy concerns such as the need to avoid any major disruptions to the operations of existing mhz service providers,the importance of finality as a principle in the granting of licenses,and fairness to auction participants,on the other.id.at.
petitions for reconsideration 
several licensees including some of the petitioners here calling themselves the ad hoc coalition the coalition sought reconsideration of the restructuring order,alleging that the commission expressed desire that the rbc have no negative impact on recipients of the earlier bidding credit evinced an unconstitutional motive to perpetuate a race and preference.the petitioning licensees demanded that the percent bidding credit be extended to all mhz licensees,regardless of size.
celtronix filed a separate petition for reconsideration challenging the restructuring order installment payment restructuring options.celtronix asked the commission to add a fourth restructuring option disaggregation whereby a licensee could divide a khz license in half,retaining a license for khz,while surrendering the other half.under this proposal,the licensee down payment on the surrendered portion of the spectrum,rather than being forfeited to the commission,would be credited to pay down the obligation on the retained portion.celtronix also asked that the commission refund down payments to licensees who select the amnesty option,arguing that the commission policy of retaining the down payments was arbitrarily inconsistent with the policy of allowing licensees selecting the prepayment option to allocate percent of the down payments on their surrendered licenses to outstanding obligations on retained licenses.
the commission rejected the arguments of the coalition and celtronix.see in re amendment of part of the commission rules to provide regulatory flexibility in the mhz service,second order on reconsideration the commission concluded that the facially neutral rbc did not implicate either adarand or vmi,and was not otherwise motivated by unlawful discrimination.id.at.the commission observed that petitioners constitutional arguments were premised on the incorrect notion that the rbc was implemented to remedy race and gender discrimination in auction.id.at.the commission emphasized that the restructuring of the bidding credit regime was,in reality,a process first,to ameliorate the constitutional concerns raised in the graceba remand,the commission eliminated the bidding credit.then,because the elimination of that bidding credit the equivalent of an abrupt percent price hike would cause severe disruption among the licensees who had enjoyed the credit,the commission chose to afford all small businesses an after the fact bidding credit.id.in effect,the commission leveled the bidding credit benefit upward to include all small businesses.id.the rbc fulfilled the fcc statutory mandate of encouraging participation of entrepreneurs,rural telephone companies,and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women,and solved a and complex set of regulatory issues.id.the commission thus rejected the petitioners demand that the credit be extended to cover all winning bidders regardless of size.id.
the commission also rejected celtronix disaggregation proposal.see id.at.while the commission acknowledged that celtronix would be able to provide service on a disaggregated khz block of spectrum,other licensees had expressed doubt that channel blocks smaller than khz are practical for innovative uses.id.at.the commission also took note of the claim of several licensees that the existing khz blocks were themselves too small for commercially viable services.id.at.these comments led the commission to doubt that service will be developed in the portion of a channel block that would remain after a licensee elects disaggregation as a restructuring option,or that the market otherwise would support the auction of disaggregated spectrum blocks in the mhz service.id.at.
finally,the commission declined to adopt celtronix proposal that licensees selecting the amnesty restructuring option be refunded their down payments.the commission noted that allowing down payments on surrendered licenses to be allocated to retained licenses under the prepayment option served the public interest benefit of speeding service to the public.id.at.the commission found no adequate counterbalancing public interest benefit to celtronix refund proposal,concluding instead that celtronix proposal would undermine the integrity of the auction process by relieving participants of even the most basic obligation of their participation.id.
the coalition filed a second petition for reconsideration,reprising its arguments that the rbc maintained the unconstitutional race and gender preferences animating the earlier bidding credit.the coalition also launched a new attack on the rbc,arguing that it violated the provisions of the administrative procedure act,b,c.in its third order on reconsideration,the commission rejected these arguments.see in re amendment of part of the commission rules to provide regulatory flexibility in the mhz service,third order on reconsideration.the commission dismissed as repetitious the coalition arguments concerning the constitutionality of the rbc.see id.at.as for the coalition argument,the commission concluded that it had not been made with sufficient particularity in the coalition first petition for reconsideration to merit the commission attention at that time,and was accordingly untimely when presented in the second petition.id.at.finding that no public interest would be served by the review of the coalition untimely argument,the commission dismissed it as well.id.at.
petitioners timely filed petitions for review of the commission restructuring order,and they were consolidated for purposes of appeal.
under the administrative procedure act,our review of agency action is highly deferential we will affirm agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this highly deferential standard,we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.rather,we will leave an agency decision undisturbed as long as it examine s the relevant data and articulate s a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.id.quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.
the arguments raised in the petitions for review fall into two broad categories challenges to the lawfulness of the rbc and celtronix challenges to the restructuring options offered by the commission.we will address each in turn.
remedial bidding credit 
petitioners level two main charges at the rbc first,that the rbc limitation to small businesses is unconstitutional and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious and second,that the commission adoption of the rbc in the restructuring order violated the requirements of the apa.we conclude that both contentions are meritless.
lawfulness of remedial bidding credit 
petitioners claim that the commission acted unlawfully when it limited the rbc to small businesses and rejected petitioners proposal that the rbc be extended to all winning bidders regardless of size.petitioners make three independent in support of this conclusion.
discriminatory intent 
petitioners maintain that the rbc,its facial neutrality notwithstanding,was impermissibly motivated by considerations of race and gender discrimination and thus is unconstitutional.in hunt cromartie,d,the supreme court held that strict scrutiny could be applied to a facially neutral law,but only if it can be proved that the law was motivated by a racial purpose or object,or if it is unexplainable on grounds other than race.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.to discern the intent underlying an agency action,we look to the historical background of the decision,the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,and any departures from the normal procedural sequence.omnipoint fcc,quoting arlington heights metropolitan hous.dev,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
to support their allegation that the rbc is merely a continuation of the unconstitutional bidding credit,petitioners point to the commission observation that the rbc would not negatively impact recipients of the bidding credit,because all of them also qualified as small businesses.see restructuring order,at.petitioners argue that this statement demonstrates that the commission was actually concerned with perpetuating race and preferences,rather than assisting small businesses.we rejected a substantially identical argument in the context of another fcc spectrum auction,stating that the commission consideration of the effect a rule change would have on businesses does not evince its discriminatory intent.omnipoint,at.that would seem to go some distance toward foreclosing petitioners claim of discriminatory intent here.
petitioners nevertheless attempt to distinguish our omnipoint decision on the basis that the restructuring order applied the rbc retroactively whereas,in omnipoint,the change in bidding credit rules occurred before the auction had taken place.this,say petitioners,demonstrates that the rbc unlike the bidding credit in omnipoint could not have been motivated by the congressional mandate to encourage participation of small businesses in spectrum auctions not even the fcc could,in,have encouraged participation in an auction that had occurred in.supposedly having put the lie to the commission stated purpose,petitioners maintain that the rbc is unexplainable on any ground other than race.we disagree.
first,congress did not require only that the commission encourage small business participation in spectrum auctions.see j d.congress also charged the commission with the mandate of disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,including small businesses.id.at j b emphasis added.while the petitioners are surely correct that the rbc could not,five years after the fact,possibly encourage participation in auction,it certainly could and did encourage the dissemination of licenses to small businesses by lowering the financial burden on those favored licensees.in any event,the rbc is readily explainable on other grounds,including finality as a principle in the granting of licenses,fairness to auction participants who had in good faith relied upon the existence of the bidding credit in constructing their business models,and the need to avoid major disruptions to the affected service.see restructuring order,at.similarly,the commission decision to limit the rbc to small businesses is explainable on the ground that the commission quite naturally wanted,consistent with the commission other statutorily defined objectives,to retain as much of the proceeds from auction as possible.see j c directing the commission to recover for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource.by contrast,other than the commission observation of the effects of the restructuring order on recipients of the bidding credit,petitioners have put forth no evidence to indicate that the rbc was intended to manifest racial or gender preferences.petitioners have thus failed to meet their burden of showing that the rbc was motivated by a racial purpose or is unexplainable except on the basis of race.
constitutionally insufficient remedy 
petitioners next argue that the rbc is a constitutionally insufficient remedy pet.br.for the race and gender discrimination that infected auction.specifically,petitioners claim that the rbc is inadequate because it fails to account for the time value of money lost to small business licensees for the period between auction and the payment of the rbc refunds.petitioners assert that to pass constitutional muster,a remedy must be designed as nearly as possible to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct.milliken bradley,d quoting milliken bradley,d.from that case which concerned a federal court school desegregation order petitioners reason that the commission must pay interest to those licensees who benefitted from the rbc but not the original minority female bidding credit.
this argument also fails.first,we are precluded from reviewing any claim for the payment of interest because petitioners failed to present this demand to the commission in a petition for reconsideration.see fcc,court lacks jurisdiction to review an argument not previously presented to commission 
second,petitioners focus on the rbc is misplaced to the extent that they construe the rbc as a remedy for discrimination in auction,they err.the commission remedy for the unlawful discrimination was simply to eliminate from its rules the minority and business bidding credits.restructuring order,at.it was only after the commission had eliminated those credits that it established the race and rbc,crafted not to remedy discrimination but rather to address the and complex set of regulatory issues created by the elimination of the bidding credit,second order on reconsideration,at.once the commission had eliminated the bidding credit,every auction licensee owed the full amount of its winning bid.at that time,petitioners occupied precisely the position relative to favored minority and licensees they would have occupied absent the discriminatory conduct owing of their winning bids.the commission thus adequately remedied the unconstitutional discrimination in auction.
arbitrary and capricious agency action 
leaving the realm of constitutional law,petitioners argue that the commission decision to limit the rbc to small business licensees is arbitrary and capricious.the commission obvious answer to this charge was that congress ha d not directed the commission to take special steps to ensure the participation of large companies,the relevant portions of the communications act express a preference for small businesses.see j b.petitioners advance two,each seeking to undermine the notion tha
