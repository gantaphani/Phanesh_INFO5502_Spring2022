robert lovejoy,individually and doing business as lovejoy drilling,filed a lawsuit alleging that at t corporation had changed his telephone service to a number without his permission and hid that fact from him,a practice known as slamming.he further alleged that as a result he lost his business.in lovejoy v.at t th,d,this court held that lovejoy complaint stated a cause of action for fraudulent concealment.on remand at t moved for summary judgment,contending there was no concealment because the fact that at t was providing number service was clearly disclosed in the invoices at t sent to lovejoy each month.the trial court agreed and granted the motion.
lovejoy appeals from the judgment of dismissal,contending there is a triable issue of fact as to whether there was concealment.we agree.fraudulent concealment includes nondisclosure where there is a duty to disclose.the duty to disclose in the context of changing the provider of telephone service is governed by the provisions of public utilities code section,which requires both full disclosure and verification of the customer agreement.thus,the duty of disclosure includes both disclosure and knowing receipt of the information disclosed.at t provided no evidence that lovejoy knew of the disclosure.in the absence of undisputed evidence of both disclosure and verification,there is a triable issue of fact whether disclosure alone is adequate to discharge the duty.we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
this action arises from the allegation that at t slammed lovejoy telephone number,obtaining control over the service without his knowledge or consent,and then concealed the switch.lovejoy operated a company known as lovejoy drilling.beginning in the company had a number through pacific bell it had regular long distance telephone service with at 
in the united states and canada the inventory of numbers is maintained and administered by the service management system,an independent organization.the customer designates a responsible organization resporg to administer records for the number and.
in february,at t forwarded to pacific bell a form indicating that at t was the new resporg for lovejoy number.pacific bell rejected the form because there was no wet or original signature.
on march,at t forwarded directly to a resporg change authorization form requesting that at t become the resporg for lovejoy number.the form was signed by betsy smith of at t and indicated she had written authorization from the service subscriber lovejoy authorizing the requested resporg change.
at t began providing number service to lovejoy in march.at t sent lovejoy a combined invoice for both his regular long distance service and his number service each month from march through september.lovejoy also continued to receive a bill for number service from pacific bell.
tina lovejoy,lovejoy wife,handled paying the bills for lovejoy drilling.a billing dispute arose after she sent a single check to cover both the home and business phone bills and the business account was not credited.in august,at t disconnected the long distance service,including the number service,for nonpayment.lovejoy eventually paid the disputed amount,about.
lovejoy brought suit against pacific bell for damages caused by the loss of his number,alleging breach of contract,fraud and negligence.the complaint was amended to substitute at t for a doe defendant.lovejoy settled his dispute with pacific bell.
lovejoy moved to amend his complaint in conformity with evidence obtained through discovery.at the same time at t moved for summary judgment.the trial court granted the motion to amend the complaint the amended complaint would not include a breach of contract claim,as lovejoy had elected not to proceed on that theory against at t.the court granted summary adjudication in favor of at t on the negligence claim,but found disputed issues of fact as to the fraud claim.
the first amended complaint alleged that at t misrepresented it had authorization from lovejoy to take over lovejoy number service and based on this misrepresentation at t took over the service.lovejoy had not authorized at t to take over the number service and was unaware at t had done so until after the filing of the original complaint.once at t took lovejoy number,it hid the charges in the long distance statement.lovejoy had no reason to check the breakdown of services in the at t bill because he did not question the long distance charges.
after a billing dispute arose,at t disconnected both long distance service and the number.lovejoy was unaware his number had been disconnected.in the spring of,lovejoy learned his number had been reassigned to a customer in michigan,who received six to calls a day requesting the services of lovejoy drilling.
the complaint alleged at t made false representations to obtain lovejoy as a customer.as a result of these misrepresentations,lovejoy lost his business and was required to file for bankruptcy he also suffered emotional injury.
at t moved for judgment on the pleadings and the motion was granted.the trial court found lovejoy pled himself out of a fraud cause of action by pleading he was unaware at t had taken his number service.being unaware of at t alleged misrepresentation,lovejoy had no justifiable reliance on it.
lovejoy appealed the judgment and this court reversed.lovejoy v.at t,supra,th,d.this court agreed the complaint failed to state a cause of action for misrepresentation because it failed to allege lovejoy relied on at t misrepresentations.just the opposite was true to be successful,att plan required that the switch be concealed from plaintiff so that he would not act on it,a plan which the complaint alleges att implemented by hiding the charges in its phone bill.id.at,d.
we found,however,that the complaint did state a valid cause of action for fraudulent concealment.lovejoy v.at t,supra,th at,d.reading the complaint liberally,all the elements were present.initially att slammed plaintiff telephone number,appropriating it for itself through false representation to third parties,but the misrepresentation did not complete the tort.after the slam,att allegedly suppressed the switch and concealed it from plaintiff by hiding the charges within its long distance bill.the surreptitious switch and its concealment from plaintiff were a breach of duty by att to plaintiff,a customer.it may be inferred that att concealed the switch with fraudulent intent,for the purpose of making a profit it may also be inferred that plaintiff,who was unaware of the switch,would have acted differently had he known of the suppressed fact.specifically,plaintiff would never have permitted termination of his att service had he known that it would have the simultaneous effect of pulling the plug on his number.id.at,d.
this court also rejected at t argument that its summary judgment papers precluded any triable issue as to concealment because the monthly statements from at t revealed lovejoy was being charged for number service.lovejoy v.at t,supra,th at,d.at t had offered pages of printouts attached to a declaration of an employee.this evidence was insufficient to remove all triable issues.the declaration was imprecise it simply stated the attachments were forwarded to lovejoy but did not indicate who sent them or when.at t also failed to establish the foundation necessary for the business records exception to the hearsay rule.ibid.we also noted lovejoy evidence in opposition at t did not change the account number or account designation after adding number service lovejoy continued to receive bills for number service from pacific bell and notices from at t about the disconnection of long distance service did not mention that the disconnection also affected number service.id.at,d.
finally,in a footnote,this court noted the requirements of public utilities code section at that time and at t failure to offer proof it complied with those requirements.in light of these apparent violations of california law,att assertion that there was no concealment as a matter of law rings hollow.lovejoy v.at t,supra,th at,fn,d.
on remand at t attempted to rectify the perceived weakn
