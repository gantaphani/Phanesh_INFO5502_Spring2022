qwest communications international,qwest petitions for review of a decision by the federal communications commission commission to disclose raw audit data to competitors in connection with a notice of inquiry concerning the validity and reasonableness of statistical sampling for equipment not found or not verifiable during a field audit see in re ameritech corporation telephone operating companies continuing property records audit et,memorandum opinion and order,order.qwest contends that the order is contrary to of the trade secrets act,because nothing in f of the communications act of,f,authorizes the commission to release otherwise protected information.qwest further contends that the commission order violates its own longstanding policy to provide special protection to audit information.we hold that f provides sufficient authorization for disclosure of trade secrets,but that the commission has failed to explain how its order is consistent with its policy regarding the treatment of confidential information.accordingly,we remand the case to the commission for further proceedings 
under part of the commission regulations,the regional bell operating companies rbocs are required to maintain detailed accounting records of property used in their local telephone operations,including the property description,location,and cost.see e f.the records,which serve various regulatory functions,including the setting of rates and the assessment of charge allocations,must conform to a uniform accounting system prescribed by the rules and must be sufficiently detailed to allow the property physical existence to be confirmed during a spot check conducted by the commission.see id.
in,the commission common carrier bureau accounting safeguards division bureau began an audit of the rbocs records for central office equipment in order to determine if their records were being maintained in compliance with the commission rules and to verify that property recorded in the accounts represented equipment used and useful for the provision of telecommunications services.during the audit,each piece of equipment was categorized or scored as found as described found in another location not or unverifiable.the commission explained that part of the audit included statistical sampling techniques so that the findings for the sample could be extended as representative of all of the equipment in the category audited,central office equipment.after reviewing the rbocs comments on draft reports,the bureau final audit reports revealed that the rbocs may have overstated their book costs by as much as five billion dollars the rbocs filed objections,in the words of one commissioner,aggressively attack ing the audits,the competence of the auditors,and the credibility of the audit design.qwest challenged the bureau final audit report,claiming that it failed to reflect additional data accounting for a majority of items scored as not found,and reaffirming its conclusion that the audit was fatally flawed for statistical and other reasons in support of the latter point,qwest submitted an analysis by deloitte touche quantitative techniques expert,who raised doubts about the auditors sampling methodology and their evaluation techniques.
the commission,in turn,issued a notice of inquiry in april,seeking public comment on ten criticisms relating to the audits.see in re ameritech corporation telephone operating companies continuing property records audit et,notice of inquiry,noi.the only issue relevant here is issue namely,t he validity and reasonableness of the methodology used by the bureau auditors in determining whether to rescore or to modify a finding during a field audit that equipment was not found.previously,in february,the commission determined,over the dissent of two commissioners,that pursuant to the rbocs waivers of confidentiality,the release of the audit reports and the rbocs responses to them was in the public interest mci thereafter filed a freedom of information act request,pursuant to,seeking public release of the rbocs explanations and supporting documentation regarding their equipment not found,the bureau audit workpapers showing the scoring of particular items,and the continuing property records themselves 
qwest opposed the release of the raw audit data on three principal grounds first,releasing the requested information is barred by f of the communications act and previous commission rulings and would be an unjustified departure from the commission established practice of not releasing materials,except in exceptional cases second,the requested information is confidential commercial information,voluntarily submitted,and thus exempt from release under exemption of the freedom of information act,b and third,the requested information constitutes deliberations and as such,is protected by exemption of the freedom of information act,b,and e of the commission rules,e.qwest indicated that it was opposing only the request for release of data submitted regarding the not found and unverifiable audit items,explaining that these items contain ed detailed information including pricing information on specific items used in the provision of telecommunications services these items,in qwest view,were comprised of highly sensitive business information which mci could use to unfairly improve its competitive position relative to qwest and other market competitors.
the bureau ordered release of the requested raw audit data to parties under a protective order.the bureau relied on j and f of the communications act as providing the commission with explicit authorization for the discretionary release of audit materials otherwise protected from release under the freedom of information act and the trade secrets act.relying also on the commission duty to ensure that parties are given a reasonable opportunity to make informed comment on issue,the bureau viewed the unique situation created by the question posed in issue to require the release of information that is not routinely made available to the public,even under protective orders.the bureau concluded that the question regarding the auditors rescoring process can only be answered by allowing parties interested in filing comments to review this raw data material.the bureau protective order limited access to the requested materials to counsel for a party participating in the noi proceeding and technical advisors or other persons authorized by such counsel.in the bureau opinion,the protective order reasonably ameliorated any potential competitive harm to the rbocs.all of the rbocs except bell atlantic appealed to the commission.
the commission affirmed the bureau decision to release the raw audit data subject to a protective order,relying principally on the commission explicit authority under f g iven the importance of commission audits to the effective performance of the commission statutory responsibilities with respect to carriers,the commission believe s the communications act statutory scheme fully envisions that,in some cases,disclosures of audit information might become necessary in the course of carrying out the commission enforcement and regulatory policymaking functions.order,at.the commission also imposed more stringent terms for access to audit materials,modifying the protective order to restrict access to the audit materials to persons without decision making authority or influence regarding competitive issues,to redact pricing information,and to limit the materials to be released to those relating to issue id.at.the commission also provided that the rbocs could suggest,for bureau approval,other redactions to the auditors workpapers and the rbocs comments.qwest petitioned for review of the order 
qwest contends that the commission decision to release protected confidential information violates the trade secrets act because the commission is not authorized by law to disclose otherwise protected information.section f of the communications act,qwest maintains,is a non disclosure statute that itself prohibits agency employees from releasing information obtained during audits because f is wholly silent as to the power of the commission to issue directions for release of such material,qwest continues,the statute logic and purposes reflect no congressional intention to authorize the commission to disclose confidential information based solely on the exercise of its own unbounded discretion.
the parties agree that the material ordered disclosed by the commission is covered by the trade secrets act.hence,the question is whether the communications act vests the commission with authority to disclose information covered by the trade secrets act,or more specifically,whether,for purposes of of the trade secrets act,the commission was authorized under f of the communications act to allow qwest competitors access to qwest raw audit data.
the parties disagree about our standard of review.we agree with the commission that our principal inquiry of the meaning of f follows the familiar test under chevron,nrdc,d the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress or in the absence of such intent,consider whether the agency interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.necessarily,however,we must first examine what congress intended by of the trade secrets act,and in this regard,as qwest contends,our review is de novo.hence,we look first to the language of and seek guidance from its structure and history.see chrysler brown,d.we then do much the same in examining f of the communications act,reaching the commission interpretation of its enabling statute only if congressional intent is unclear.
section of the trade secrets act prohibits the unauthorized release of trade secrets and commercial information,unless authorized by law,subject to punishment by fine and imprisonment and removal from office or employment.see the history of the act,which was originally enacted in,traces back to congressional concern over disclosures of business information by feckless or corrupt revenue agents.chrysler,at.when congress in consolidated three statutes barring or limiting the release of such information,it sought to address the demands of the new administrative state and thereby broadened the reach of the trade secrets act.see cna fin.donovan.as the court has previously recounted,congress recogni zed that increased governmental access to financial records and commercial operations of individuals and entities had to be accompanied by some restraint on the freedom of governmental employees to disseminate such data to third parties.id.
the limits established by the trade secrets act,however,are not inconsistent with authorizations granted to federal agencies to release data when necessary for the carrying out of the agencies statutory responsibilities.in national parks and conservation ass kleppe,the court noted that the trade secrets act is merely a general prohibition against unauthorized disclosures of confidential commercial or financial information.id.at.the court in cna,continuing to explore the nature of the statute,observed that the trade secrets act 
seems to embody a congressional judgment that private commercial and financial information should not be revealed by agencies that gather it,absent a conscious choice in favor of disclosure by someone with power to impart the force of law to that decision.the act attempts to forestall casual or thoughtless made without first going through a deliberative an opportunity for input from concerned parties.
cna,at emphasis added.
in the leading case on the question of the authorization required by for release of trade secrets,the supreme court interpreted the phrase authorized by law not to have a special,limited meaning.chrysler,at.instead,the supreme court instructed that the exercise by an agency of power must be rooted in a grant of such power by the congress and subject to limitations which that body imposes.id.at.more directly,the court stated that w hat is important is whether the reviewing court could reasonably conclude that the statutory grant of authority contemplated the regulations providing for release of information.id.at.thus,in rejecting the contention that an executive order directing the secretary of labor to adopt regulations as are necessary and appropriate meant that all regulations so promulgated have the full force and effect of law,the court focused on whether there was a nexus between the regulations and some delegation of the requisite legislative authority by congress.id.at.looking at the statutory sources for the executive order the court concluded that it is clear that when it enacted these statutes,congress was not concerned with public disclosure of trade secrets or confidential business information id.at.by way of illustration,the court contrasted the situation in nbc united states,where,based on the language and logic of the communications act,which vested comprehensive powers in the commission,the court upheld commission regulations that extended beyond technical,engineering requirements.see chrysler,at.a mere housekeeping statute,on the other hand,whose history indicated that it was simply a grant of authority to the agency to regulate its own affairs,would not suffice to authorize disclosure of confidential business information because it was not intended to provide authority for limiting the scope of the trade secrets act.id.at.
under a of the communications act,the commission is authorized to direct the kind of financial books and records that carriers must maintain so that the commission can fulfill its mandate of ensuring that carriers rates and practices are just and reasonable.see a.in establishing a uniform system of accounts,the commission is charged with ensur ing a proper allocation of all costs to and among telecommunication services,facilities,and products id.a.under c,the commission shall at all times have access to and the right of inspection and examination of all accounts,records,and memoranda maintained by the carrier pursuant to.in addition,the commission may use public accounting services.in this connection,subsection c provides an exception to nondisclosure laws as well as a nondisclosure limitation on persons having access to information submitted to the commission.subsection c provides that a ny provision of law prohibiting the disclosure of the contents of messages or communications shall not be deemed to prohibit the disclosure of any matter in accordance with the provisions of this section.id.c.the statute further provides that any person conducting a commission audit shall have the powers of the commission under subsection c and shall be subject to subsection f in the same manner as if that person were an employee of the commission.id section f,in turn,provides 
no member,officer,or employee of the commission shall divulge any fact or information which may come to his or her knowledge during the course of examination of books or other accounts,as hereinbefore provided,except insofar as he or she may be directed by the commission or by a court.
id.f emphasis added.
subsection f,first mentioned in c after a sentence that removes any legal obstacles to the disclosure of information submitted to the commission in accordance with,places nondisclosure burdens on all persons having access to confidential information submitted to the commission.thus,its strict limitation on how confidential information is to be handled arises in a context in which the commission will have access to information that is otherwise protected by law from disclosure.nevertheless,congress alluded to the possibility of disclosure by the commission and the court.qwest contention that f is an integral part of a nondisclosure statute is correct so far as it goes.however,viewing f as directed to nondisclosure does not mean that its last clause has no role to perform,much less nothing to do with the conditions under which disclosures may occur.under chrysler,is satisfied without a provision of law that expressly refers to trade secrets.see chrysler,at.
congressional intent to allow an exception to nondisclosure seems implicit in the statutory scheme.in the communications act of,congress delegated broad authority to the commission in carrying out its responsibilities for oversight of licensing,rate making,and carrier practices.see et nbc,at.significantly,in,congress placed in the commission the responsibility to ensure a proper allocation of all costs.a.with the additional provisions authorizing audits,it reasonably follows that congress contemplated that the commission would be reviewing the type of data at issue here.thus,unlike the statutes that were considered by the supreme court in chrysler,see at,focuses on the need for the commission to have access to confidential information regarding licensees and others,and to determine how such information is to be protected when the commission carries out its responsibilities.the former is addressed in c,the latter in f.when congress consolidated various statutes on trade secrets in,it gave no indication that federal agencies interpretation of their authority to release confidential data was in error,much less no longer of force and effect nothing in chrysler suggests that a comparable situation existed with respect to the statutes considered in that case.see chrysler,at.
to the extent qwest contends that f is too broad an authorization,in its view leaving the commission with unfettered discretion,we offer two responses.first,contrary to qwest contention,chrysler does not require that the statutory authorization under be directed,or limited,to trade secrets rather,as the supreme court emphasized in chrysler,the important question is whether the reviewing court can reasonably conclude that the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.see chrysler,at.chrysler test is,in one sense at least,a nondemanding one with respect to the purpose of the trade secrets,to ensure that congress has authorized release of covered information and that any such release occurs only after deliberation by appropriate officials.see cna,at.section f is consistent with the restraint that congress sought to impose in the trade secrets act because it permits release only on order of the commission or the court where,as the supreme court noted,such release would be consistent with the purposes of the communications act.see chrysler,at.as we discuss in part iii,the commission has adopted a confidential information policy and regulations for release decisions to be made upon consideration of certain factors by appropriate officials.
second,other circuits have concluded that,under chrysler,a broadly stated grant of authority to disclose confidential information suffices for purposes of.thus,the fourth circuit in humana of virginia,blue cross,cir,upheld the secretary of health,education,and welfare broad discretion to permit disclosure where the statute,a,provided that n o disclosure shall be made except as the secretary may by regulations prescribe id.at emphasis added.relying on chrysler test,that t he grant of authority relied upon by a federal agency in promulgating regulations need not be specific it is only necessary that the reviewing court reasonably be able to conclude that the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued,id.quoting chrysler,at,the court concluded with respect to the disclosure of cost reports,that absent any action by the secretary,disclosure would be prohibited.such material,however,is not exempt from disclosure for by its very terms the statute contemplates the issuance of regulations by the secretary permitting such disclosure.id.at.in mary hospital,harris,cir,the fifth circuit had reached the same conclusion about a regulation authorizing disclosure of cost reports,stating that s ection bars the disclosure of medicare providers costs reports unless the secretary in his discretion promulgates a regulation like the one being challenged ordering disclosure of these reports at the very least may reasonably be construed to contemplate the promulgation of a regulation such as is at issue.id.at.the sixth circuit agreed in parkridge hospital,califano,cir,interpreting the statute to be a broad grant of authority to the secretary specifically to enact regulations providing for the release of information filed with the agency,at least when such disclosure serves the purposes described in the statute.id.at.
while qwest would distinguish the statute in humana,parkridge,and mary as reflecting congress clear intent to permit disclosure of trade secrets,the effect of the last clause of f of the communications act is essentially the same.that is,in both types of statutes congress has alluded in an except clause to the possibility of disclosure of protected information,and in both circumstances assured that the secretary and the commission must reach a considered determination about releasing protected information.the different statutory treatment by congress can be said to reflect not a difference in congressional intent but the fact that the secretary is an individual,and by requiring the promulgation of regulations,congress constrained the secretary authority regarding the release of protected information.comparable constraint inheres in the statutory requirements that the commission may act only as a deliberative body,when there is a quorum,when parties may be heard,and when its actions are made on the record.see generally h,j.
accordingly,we hold that the communications act,and specifically,f,does not clearly rule out the commission interpretation,which we find reasonable.
the question remains whether the commission has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in ordering the release of qwest raw audit data to some of its competitors see chrysler,at.bartholdi,at.qwest contends that the release order is flatly inconsistent with the commission prior assurance that raw audit data would be protected.more particularly,qwest contends that the commission order is contrary to its precedents on the treatment of confidential information qwest calls attention to the unprecedented nature of the release,maintaining that whatever authority the commission may have to disclose trade secrets in other kinds of proceedings in order to vindicate rights to public participation,the logic and purposes of the statutory provisions governing confidential agency audits are quite different.the order constitutes,in qwest view,a standardless discretionary exemption from disclosure justified solely on the commission unprecedented step of opening audits to public comment.
the commission confidential information policy includes three paragraphs regarding audits that are pertinent here.see in re examination of current policy concerning the treatment of confidential information submitted to the commission,report and order,amended by confidential information policy.paragraph provides that only summary audit data will be released,and only under special circumstances.see id.at.those special circumstances arise when i the summary nature of the data therein is not likely to cause the submitter substantial competitive injury ii the release of the summary data and information is not likely to impair the commission ability to obtain information in future audits and iii overriding public interest concerns favor release of the report.id.
paragraph explains the commission view of audit reports 
the commission has a longstanding policy of treating information obtained from carriers during audits as confidential carriers have a legitimate interest in protecting confidential information,and we agree that disclosure could result in competitive injury to those who provide such information to the commission.this policy is also designed to enhance the efficiency and integrity of our audit process by encouraging carriers to comply in good faith with commission requests for information.moreover,the commission considers the audit reports to be internal agency documents that,consistent with foia exemption,generally should not be disclosed to the extent they present staff findings and recommendations to assist the commission in deliberations.
id.at.paragraph also states that the commission will amend section of its rules to indicate that information submitted in connection with audits will not routinely be made available for public inspection.id.
in paragraph,the commission identified the standards that it would apply were confidentia
