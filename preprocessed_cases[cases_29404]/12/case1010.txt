in this case,we review a decision holding unconstitutional a law that requires payment by a municipality of ad valorem taxes on property owned and used exclusively by the municipality to provide telecommunications services to the public.see dep t of revenue city of gainesville,so d dca.the applicable provision in our state constitution provides that a ll property owned by a municipality and used exclusively by it for municipal or public purposes shall be exempt from taxation.art.vii,a.const.we have mandatory jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.because we conclude that providing telecommunications services does not as a matter of law always serve municipal or public purposes,ad valorem taxation of a municipality telecommunications facilities is not facially unconstitutional.in reaching this conclusion,we do not dispute that telecommunications services are essential services.rather,we make the narrower determination that in providing these services,regardless of circumstances such as the availability of the same services through other providers,a municipality does not as a matter of law engage in an activity essential to the welfare of the community.we therefore reverse the decision of the first district court of appeal holding the statutory provisions imposing ad valorem taxation on these telecommunications facilities facially unconstitutional.
facts and procedural history 
as part of the nationwide transition from telecommunications services to a competitive marketplace,the florida legislature enacted legislation in authorizing governmental entities including municipalities to sell telecommunications services to the public.see.stat.defining telecommunications company to include every political subdivision in the state offering telecommunications service to the public for hire within this state by the use of a telecommunications facility.however,in the legislature made that authority conditional upon payment of ad valorem taxes or equivalent fees on facilities used to provide the telecommunications services.see ch,at,laws of section of the enactment created section,florida statutes,which provides in pertinent part 
telecommunications telecommunications company that is a municipality or other entity of local government may obtain or hold a certificate required by chapter,and the obtaining or holding of said certificate serves a municipal or public purpose under the provision of b,art.viii of the state constitution,only if the municipality or other entity of local government 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,pays,on its telecommunications facilities used to provide telecommunications services to the public for hire and for which a certificate is required pursuant to chapter,ad valorem taxes,or fees in amounts equal thereto,to any taxing jurisdiction in which the municipality or other entity of local government operates.any entity of local government may pay and impose such ad valorem taxes or fees.
emphasis supplied.in other words,the legislature conditioned the grant of the power to obtain or hold a certificate from the public service commission psc for operation of a telecommunications facility on the municipality payment of ad valorem taxes,and specified that payment of the taxes is necessary for the facility to serve a public purpose under the municipal powers clause of the constitution 
in the same act,the legislature amended section,florida statutes,to exclude the telecommunications services authorized in section from the statutory ad valorem tax exemption for municipally owned property used for governmental,municipal or public purposes contained in section c,florida statutes.see ch,laws of the pertinent portion of section,as amended,specifies that p roviding telecommunications services to the public for hire by the use of a telecommunications facility,as defined in,and for which a certificate is required under chapter does not constitute an exempt use for purposes of,with exceptions inapplicable here.stat.
the amended provisions operate in tandem.section invokes the municipal powers provision of the state constitution to mandate ad valorem taxation,and the amendment to section disqualifies municipally owned and operated telecommunications facilities from a statutory ad valorem tax exemption for municipal property.the purpose and effect of this legislation is to make property owned and used by a municipality for a telecommunications business subject to ad valorem property taxation.see.comm.on util,cs for cs for hb staff analysis july,on file with comm.stating that chapter removes the exemptions that municipalities,counties,or other entities of local government have on ad valorem taxes on property used for the purpose of providing telecommunications services to the public.
the city of gainesville the city,operating under the fictitious name gainesville regional utilities,acquired certificates from the psc to operate as a public telecommunications provider.the city then began selling communications infrastructure and integrated telecommunications services to the public,charging contractually rates.under the service agreements with the city,customers do not have any leasehold interest in the city telecommunications property the city uses a network to provide private line service and special access service for the transmission of voice,data,and video.
in its base planning study,the city stated that n o substantial communication services competition appears to be emerging in gainesville,and asserted that i f the citizens of gainesville are to be provided with all of the benefits which will be possible through the national information superhighway at a reasonable price,a major independent investor will need to assume a role in shaping the communications environment.the city anticipated that its telecommunications business would make it both a provider of services and a promoter for the entry of new service providers.the city stated in its business plan that its overall business activities would benefit the local economy by creating competition in what it termed a monopoly market,producing additional revenues for the city,and keeping profits within the community.in its pleadings in this case,the city specified that by,it had invested approximately million in infrastructure and equipment.
in,the city filed suit seeking a declaration that the portions of chapter imposing the tax obligation on its telecommunications facilities are unconstitutional under article vii,section a.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and declared sections and of chapter facially unconstitutional.the first district affirmed,holding that the property in question is being used by the city for a municipal purpose and the legislature attempt to condition the provision of these municipal services on the payment of an amount equal to any ad valorem tax liability is in direct conflict with article vii,section a of the florida constitution.dep t of revenue,so d at.judge ervin dissented,concluding that the amendments are a proper exercise of the legislature discretion to classify real property for ad valorem taxation.id.at ervin,dissenting.
ii.analysis 
article vii,section of the florida constitution requires a just valuation of all property for ad valorem taxation,with exceptions that do not apply here however,governmentally owned property is generally excluded from taxation,through either immunity or exemption.an exemption presupposes an ability to tax,whereas an immunity implies the absence of that ability.see greater orlando aviation auth.crotty,so d,dca.the state and counties are immune from taxation.see canaveral port auth.dep t of revenue,so d,sparkman,so d.unlike counties,municipalities are not subdivisions of the state and are therefore subject to taxation absent an exemption.see greater orlando aviation,so d at.
article vii,section a of the florida constitution confers on property owned by municipalities an exemption from ad valorem taxation under certain circumstances.to qualify for the exemption in article vii,section a,the property must be both owned by a municipality and used exclusively by the municipality for municipal or public purposes.
in this case,the parties arguments generally reflect the majority and dissenting opinions below.in accord with the first district majority,the city asserts that chapter on its face violates article vii,section a by targeting for taxation property that is used by a municipality exclusively for the municipal or public purposes of providing telecommunications services to residential and business customers within the municipality.the department of revenue,relying on judge ervin dissent and precedent holding leasehold interests in municipal property ineligible for the constitutional exemption,argues for a narrower construction of municipal or public purposes that would exclude a municipality telecommunications business that competes with the private sector for customers.
the determination of a statute constitutionality and the interpretation of a constitutional provision are both questions of law reviewed de novo by this court.see zingale powell,so d.while we review decisions striking state statutes de novo,we are obligated to accord legislative acts a presumption of constitutionality and to construe challenged legislation to effect a constitutional outcome whenever possible.florida of revenue howard,so d.further,a determination that a statute is facially unconstitutional means that no set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid.see state bales,so d,cashatt state,so d,dca.
in zingale,in which we were called upon to construe a constitutional provision limiting increases in annual tax assessments of homestead property,we recognized that o ur task in this case of constitutional interpretation follows principles parallel to those of statutory interpretation.so d at.we reiterated from our prior precedent that 
a ny inquiry into the proper interpretation of a constitutional provision must begin with an examination of that provision explicit language.likewise,this court endeavors to construe a constitutional provision consistent with the intent of the framers and the voters 
the fundamental object to be sought in construing a constitutional provision is to ascertain the intent of the framers and the provision must be construed or interpreted in such manner as to fulfill the intent of the people,never to defeat it.such a provision must never be construed in such manner as to make it possible for the will of the people to be frustrated or denied.
moreover,in construing multiple constitutional provisions addressing a similar subject,the provisions must be read in pari materia to ensure a consistent and logical meaning that gives effect to each provision.

the facial constitutionality of the statute imposing a tax obligation on municipally owned and operated telecommunications facilities hinges on whether providing telecommunications services to the public always serves municipal or public purposes as contemplated in article vii,section a.if so,the property used exclusively by a municipality to provide these services can not be taxed,and the legislation requiring payment of taxes on the property as a condition of operation is unconstitutional on its face.
the term municipal or public purposes is not defined in article vii,section a.although governmental,municipal,or public purpose or function is statutorily defined in section,florida statutes which also concerns tax exemptions for governmentally owned property,a reading of section a of article vii clearly establishes that it is a provision and therefore does not require statutory implementation.city of sarasota mikos,so d.therefore,the statutory definition does not control the construction of the term municipal or public purposes in the constitutional provision.in addition,the statutory definition in section applies only to property leased from governmental entities.
article vii,section a was adopted in the revision to the florida constitution.to place this provision in historical perspective,we explore its antecedent provisions in the florida constitution of,which also provided an exemption from ad valorem taxation for property used for municipal purposes.then we discuss the adoption of article vii,section a and precedent interpreting and applying that provision.next we compare the definition of municipal and public purposes in article vii,section a with the definition of municipal purposes used in applying article viii,section b,which governs municipal powers.finally,we specify how the term municipal or public purposes is to be defined in construing the ad valorem tax exemption for property owned and used exclusively by a municipality,and apply that definition in determining whether chapter is facially constitutional.
tax exemptions for property used for municipal purposes under the constitution 
before the revision,tax exemptions for property used for municipal purposes were covered in two different constitutional provisions 
the legislature shall provide for a uniform and equal rate of taxation,and shall prescribe such regulations as shall secure a just valuation of all property,both real and personal,excepting such property as may be exempted by law for municipal,educational,literary,scientific,religious,or charitable purposes.
art.ix.const.emphasis supplied.
the property of all corporations shall be subject to taxation unless such property be held and used exclusively for religious,scientific,municipal,educational,literary,or charitable purposes.
art.xvi.const.emphasis supplied article ix,section differed from article xvi,section in that the former provision was not limited solely to corporations,and the property did not have to be held exclusively for the listed purposes.see state ex rel.cragor doss,so d.in its use of the term as may be exempted by law,article ix,section was not,and therefore a tax exemption under that provision required legislative authorization.see rast hulvey,so.shortly before these provisions were supplanted by the constitution,this court held that article xvi,section was also not.see jasper mease manor,so d,receding from lummus miami beach congregational church,so.
in the few cases in which this court was expressly called upon to construe the municipal purposes exemptions in the constitution,we deferred to the legislature.in state ex rel.harper mcdavid,so,a taxpayer challenged an exemption for property owned by a city housing authority and used for a housing and slum clearance project.the legislature had authorized municipalities to erect housing units and exempted them from ad valorem taxation by declaring that they served municipal purposes.see id.at.this court upheld the tax exemption against challenges under both article ix,section and article xvi,section of the constitution.see id.at.the court noted that it had previously conceded power in the legislature to define a municipal purpose as contemplated by the provisions of the constitution alluded to.id.at.responding to the claim that providing housing did not serve a valid municipal purpose,the court stated 
it is contended that the business of the housing authority is in no sense municipal,that it is in direct competition with private enterprise and even though declared by the legislature to be strictly municipal and charitable,its properties should not be exempt from taxation and that any attempt to make them so should be held in violation of the constitution.
what constituted a municipal purpose is a legislative question that should not be interfered with by the courts in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.a municipal purpose is much broader in its scope than it was a generation ago.under our system of jurisprudence,constitutional validity may be determined by practical operation and effect.measured by this test,we can not say that the legislature exceeded its power in pronouncing the properties of the housing authority held for a municipal purpose free from all forms of taxation.they are held not for profit,must be restricted to a low income group,and contribute materially to the health,morals,safety,and general welfare of the people.they aid materially in reducing the cost of fire prevention and police protection and the housing authority is authorized to make annual compensation to the city in lieu of taxes and other services furnished.there is no suggestion that the officers charged with the administration of the present scheme have failed in their duty and being so,we must assume that the law has been faithfully observed.
the time was when a municipal purpose was restricted to police protection or such enterprises as were strictly governmental but that concept has been very much expanded and a municipal purpose may now comprehend all activities essential to the health,morals,protection,and welfare of the municipality.
id.emphasis supplied.
five years later,this court relied on the same definition in holding that electric light poles and other properties held and used by a city to supply electric power to customers in an adjacent county could not be taxed by that county under article ix,section of the constitution.see saunders city of jacksonville,so d.the legislature had exempted from ad valorem taxation property owned by a municipality public utility but located in a different county.see id.the court concluded that furnishing electric current served a municipal purpose.as in mcdavid,we explicitly rejected the claim that the exemption was invalid because it might enable the city to compete with private utilities required to pay taxes,again deferring to the legislature judgment as the arbiter of this question.id.at the court held that i t is a controlling factor that the owner of the property has no stockholders,or partners,and any income must necessarily accrue to the general public.id.at.
mcdavid and saunders demonstrate that in applying the provisions of the constitution,this court deferred to the legislature authorization of municipal functions and clear intention to exempt property used therefor from ad valorem taxation.further,we held that a municipal purpose could be served even though the activity was one that competed with the private sector,if the legislature determined that the activity was essential to the welfare of the municipality.the court accepted the legislature determination that providing housing and electrical power to those in need were essential municipal services.
tax exemptions for municipal use of municipal property under the constitution 
the constitutional revision effected changes in the exemption from ad valorem taxation for property used for municipal purposes.unaltered since its adoption in,article vii,section a provides in full 
all property owned by a municipality and used exclusively by it for municipal or public purposes shall be exempt from taxation.a municipality,owning property outside the municipality,may be required by general law to make payment to the taxing unit in which the property is located.such portions of property as are used predominantly for educational,literary,scientific,religious or charitable purposes may be exempted by general law from taxation.
this provision differs from its antecedents in the constitution in two significant ways.first,as stated above,it does not require legislative authorization to activate the exemption for property owned and used exclusively by the municipality for municipal or public purposes.in other words,no longer was the exemption contingent upon the legislature declaring that an activity served a municipal purpose and was therefore tax exempt.see mikos,so d at holding change in statutory language on exemption irrelevant because provision is and therefore does not require statutory implementation see generally tax section,the florida bar,florida state and local taxes,at describing exemption in article vii,section a as unique,mandatory and.
second,the exemption requires use of the property by the municipality that owns it,whereas article xvi,section of the constitution did not require ownership and use by the municipality as long as the property was held and used exclusively for municipal purposes.a tax exemption for portions of property used predominantly for municipal purposes,regardless of ownership,still requires legislative authorization under the express terms of article vii,section a.
the requirement that the property be both owned and used exclusively by the municipality was seen as a response to the decision in daytona beach racing recreational facilities district paul,so d,holding that municipal property leased to a corporation for a racetrack served a public purpose because it contributed to the economic of the community,rendering the lessees interest in the property exempt from ad valorem taxation.see volusia county daytona beach racing recreational facilities,so d,perceiving decisions such as daytona beach racing as creating inequities in the tax structure,the draftsmen of the constitution of limited the municipal purpose exemption to property owned by a municipality and used exclusively by it for municipal or public purposes.bonnie roberts,ad valorem taxation of leasehold interests in governmentally owned property,stating that daytona beach racing dealt a substantial blow to the legislature attempt to tax leasehold interests,and that the drafters of the constitution attempted to deal with the problem by limiting the constitutional grounds on which an exemption could be based.
effectuating the intent of the framers and voters,we held in volusia county that property leased from a municipality and used to generate a profit was not exempt from ad valorem taxation under article vii,section a.see so d at stating that the corporation use of the leasehold on governmental property to make profits for its stockholders is determinative.the decision in volusia county marked one step in a series of cases in which this court developed a separate and more restrictive test under article vii,section a for private interests in municipal property.under this test,a tax exemption is constitutionally permitted only if the use by the private entity could properly be performed or served by an appropriate governmental unit,or which is demonstrated to perform a function or serve a purpose which would otherwise be a valid subject for the allocation of public funds.sebring airport auth.mcintyre,so d,quoting roberts,supra,at.in sebring airport authority we applied this standard,known as the test,to invalidate a statutory tax exemption granted under section for profitmaking endeavors such as convention and visitor centers,sports facilities,concert halls,arenas and stadiums.we have also applied the test to uphold ad valorem taxation of property leased from an airport authority by food,drink,and merchandise vendors as well as property leased from a governmental authority for both residential and commercial uses sebring airport authority ultimately established that for private leaseholds of municipal property,the test governs eligibility for the constitutional tax exemption in article vii,section a.see so d at pursuant to this standard,article vii,section a does not permit municipal property leased to private entities for activities to be tax exempt.
our review of the history of article vii,section a and the pertinent case law demonstrates that the test for private interests in municipally owned property was never intended to apply to property both owned and used exclusively by a municipality for municipal or public purposes.for property both owned and used exclusively by the municipality,the question becomes whether municipal or public purposes under article vii,section a of the constitution is as broad as municipal purposes under the corresponding provisions of the constitution as interpreted in decisions such as mcdavid and saunders.
as discussed above,article vii,section does not provide a definition of municipal or public purposes,just as its antecedent provisions in the constitution did not define municipal purposes.the provision added the term public purposes,but this addition neither broadened nor narrowed the exemption.this court had previously held that public purposes,the term specified in a statutory tax exemption for governmental property,was synonymous with municipal purposes.see daytona beach racing,so d at gwin city of tallahassee,so d.thus,although the framers of article vii,section a sought to limit the holding in daytona beach racing,they did so by requiring both ownership and exclusive use of the property by the municipality rather than by narrowing the definition of municipal purposes.
in our decisions since on tax exemptions under article vii,section a for property both owned and used exclusively by a municipality,we have not elaborated on the meaning of municipal or public purposes.in ford orlando utilities commission,so d,this court concluded that property located outside orlando but owned and used by the city for an electrical power plant was used for a valid municipal purpose.we held that under the clear and unambiguous language of article vii,section a,the property was exempt from taxation.id.at in mikos,we held that property owned and held as open space or reserved for future needs was constitutionally exempt from ad valorem taxation under article vii,section a.see so d at.this court recognized that property owned by a municipality is not exempt from taxation if it is used for a private purpose,but held that vacant land held by a municipality is presumed to be in use for a public purpose if it is not actually in use for a private purpose on tax assessment day.id.at 
municipal purposes under article viii,section b 
the city asserts that municipal or public purposes should receive the same broad construction as municipal purposes under article viii,section b of the florida constitution,which prescribes municipal powers.adopted in the same revision as article vii,section a,article viii,section b provides in pertinent part 
municipalities shall have governmental,corporate and proprietary powers to enable them to conduct municipal government,perform municipal functions and render municipal services,and may exercise any power for municipal purposes except as otherwise provided by law.
emphasis supplied.under this provision,municipalities have inherent power to meet municipal needs,and the legislature retained power is one of limitation.lake worth utils.auth.city of lake worth,so d.previously,municipalities were inherently powerless,absent a specific grant of power from the legislature.id.we recognized the broad sweep of municipalities inherent power under article viii,section b in state city of sunrise,so d,where we stated 
article viii,section,florida constitution,expressly grants to every municipality in this state authority to conduct municipal government,perform municipal functions,and render municipal services.the only limitation on that power is that it must be exercised for a valid municipal purpose.it would follow that municipalities are not dependent upon the legislature for further authorization.legislative statutes are relevant only to determine limitations of authority.
id.at see also city of ocala nye,so d,reiterating municipal purposes requirement from city of sunrise as only constitutional limitation on municipal power.
in city of boca raton gidman,so d,this court held that providing day care educational facilities is a valid municipal purpose under article viii,section b.we stated that we would accept the legislature determination that an activity served a municipal purpose absent an abuse of discretion.see id.at.the court also noted that the term municipal purposes had been broadly interpreted and included such activities as maintenance and operation of a radio broadcasting system by a municipality,citing to state city of jacksonville,so d.gidman,so d at.city of jacksonville concerned validation of revenue certificates to finance a municipally owned and operated radio station.there this court employed the same definition of municipal purpose as in mcdavid and saunders,the two tax exemption cases,stating that t hough there was a time when a municipal purpose was restricted to police protection or such enterprises as were strictly governmental that concept has been very much expanded and a municipal purpose may now comprehend all activities essential to the health,morals,protection and welfare of the municipality.city of jacksonville,so d at.
unfortunately,the language in some of these cases has been imprecise.see gidman,so d at defining a municipal purpose as being rationally related to the health,morals,protection and welfare of the municipality emphasis supplied basic energy hamilton county,so d,dca defining municipal purpose under article viii,section b as one that is related to the health,morals,safety,protection or welfare of the municipality emphasis supplied.therefore,we specifically distinguish precedent construing article viii,section b,which uses language that is overly broad for determining eligibility for the ad valorem tax exemption in article vii,section a.
there is another reason to conclude that the precedent construing municipal purposes under article viii,section b is of limited use in construing article vii,section a.as stated above,prior to the adoption of the constitution,the legislature had complete discretion to prescribe municipal powers.thus,the legislative determination that operation of a radio station,parking garage,or public auditorium served a municipal or public purpose was largely unchecked,absent an abuse of discretion.see gate city garage,city of jacksonville,so d parking facility starlight city of miami beach,so d auditorium city of jacksonville,so d at radio station.the court was unwilling to hold that the legislature abused its discretion in determining that a municipal project that it had authorized served a public purpose.
the precedent discussed above shows that this broad construction of municipal powers remains in force under article viii,section b,in which the legislature remaining authority is to limit,rather than authorize,municipal powers.in fact,the only restriction we have placed on the exercise of municipal powers for a municipal purpose under article viii,section b is to hold that borrowing money for the primary purpose of reinvestment is not a valid municipal purpose.state city of orlando,so d.
because the definition of municipal purposes applied under article viii,section b has been imprecise,and because that provision and article vii,section a serve different functions,we conclude that not every municipal activity that the legislature either declined to prohibit after the revision,or had authorized in older cases relied upon in construing the municipal powers provision,was intended to also qualify for the constitutional ad valorem tax exemption in article vii,section a.thus,an activity may serve valid municipal purposes under article viii,section b and constitute a permissible municipal function,but not serve municipal or public purposes under article vii,section a making the property owned by the municipality and used exclusively by it for the activity eligible for the constitutional ad valorem property tax exemption.
delineating municipal or public purposes under article vii,section a 
in the absence of any indication in the constitution to the contrary,we conclude that the term municipal or public purposes should be construed in accordance with the definition utilized by the court in its prior decisions on the constitutional tax exemption.there is nothing in the language of article vii,section a that evinces an intent to create a more restrictive definition of municipal or public purposes for property that is owned and used exclusively by the municipality than the definition applied to municipal purposes under the constitution in mcdavid and saunders through the adoption of the current provision.although mcdavid and saunders rested at least in part on judicial deference to the legislature assessment of what type of activity served municipal purposes,we have no basis to conclude that a narrower construction was intended when the exemption was included in the constitution.to the contrary,had the framers of article vii,section a intended to narrow the exemption,they could have specifically defined municipal or public purposes,or used different terms altogether.
this determination is consistent with the principle that the legislature is presumed to have adopted prior judicial constructions of a law unless a contrary intention is expressed,florida dep t of children families,so d,which is equally applicable on the constitutional level.see generally coastal.police benev.ass williams,so d,stating that rules governing statutory construction are generally applicable to construction of constitutional provisions.as stated by one observer shortly after the adoption of the constitution,cases construing the constitutional municipal purposes exemption and the statutory public purposes exemption continue to be good law even after the adoption of the new constitution.robert williams,note,property tax exemptions under article vii,section a of the florida constitution of.
we therefore conclude that the municipal or public purposes for which municipally owned property must be exclusively used in article vii,section a to qualify for an ad valorem tax exemption encompass activities that are essential to the health,morals,safety,and general welfare of the people within the municipality.we agree with the dissent on the parameters of this test,but disagree on its application in determining the facial constitutionality of the challenged legislation.
whether the tax exemption under article vii,section a necessarily applies to municipal telecommunications facilities 
in putting this definition into practice,we focus on the word essential,which is generally defined as something basic,necessary,or indispensable.see collegiate dictionary ed.for example,an essential element is one on which proof is required in order to establish a legal claim or criminal offense.see,rubano dep t of,so d,proof that the governmental body has effected a taking of the property is an essential element of an inverse condemnation action.randall state,so d,p remeditation is the essential element that distinguishes murder from murder.thus,inherent in the word essential is the concept of great need or necessity.
a thread of necessity also runs through the precedent concerning tax exemptions for municipal use of municipally owned property that we have discussed.in mcdavid,which held a tax exemption for a public housing facility valid,the legislature had declared that housing conditions were a menace to the health,safety,and morals of the people necessitat ing excessive expenditures for crime and fire prevention,health,and welfare,and that public safety demand ed replacement of slums by sanitary and better housing facilities.so.at emphasis supplied.in upholding the tax exemption for property owned by a municipal power company located in another county in saunders,we recognized that the legislature was doubtless well aware of the need for light,heat and power by those areas outside of municipalities.so d at.similarly,in ford,this court held that the production of electricity by a municipality power company served a municipal purpose.see so d at.such services are essential in that municipally owned power companies have legally protected monopolies within their territorial boundaries,and have traditionally provided these services.see.stat.city of homestead beard,so d.finally,the status upheld in mikos for vacant land held by a municipality to preserve natural open spaces or for future needs,so d at,is consistent with the traditional municipal function of providing parks for the municipal population.city of miami beach hogan,so d,stating that i n all heavily populated municipalities the police power should be exercised by municipal officials to afford all of the people light,air,and an opportunity for recreation.
unlike electrical power and public parks,telecommunications services have historically been provided by the private sector.the legislature rationale for opening telecommunications services to competition by various entities including municipalities was to provide customers with freedom of choice,encourage the introduction of new telecommunications service,encourage technological innovation,and encourage investment in telecommunications infrastructure.stat.however,under the law applicable to this case,municipalities may enter the market regardless of whether their participation furthers any of these goals.in other words,a municipality,using infrastructure advantages gained from its utility operations,may enter a market in which a high level of service and competition already exists without introducing new levels of service,fostering innovation,or encouraging infrastructure investment.if that is the case,the municipal telecommunications company does not provide a service that is essential to the health,morals,safety,and general welfare of the people within the municipality 
because this is a facial challenge to the constitutionality of legislation taxing municipal use of municipally owned property,we need not determine whether the specific services provided by the city pass this test.as stated above,in a facial constitutional challenge,we determine only whether there is any set of circumstances under which the challenged enactment might be upheld.see bales,so d at a ny legislative enactment carries a strong presumption of constitutionality,including a rebuttable presumption of the existence of necessary factual support in its provisions.if any state of facts,known or to be assumed,justify the law,the court power of inquiry ends.citation omitted cashatt,so d at a facial challenge to a statute is more difficult than an as applied challenge,because the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid.we conclude that in a situation in which municipal telecommunications services do not promote any of the goals set forth above from section,florida statutes,for the benefit of the municipal population,property used to provide those services does not serve municipal or public purposes and therefore is not exempt from ad valorem taxation under article vii,section a.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons we have stated,we hold that section,florida statutes,as enacted in chapter,section,laws of florida,and the amendment to section contained in section of the same act are not unconstitutional on their face.we do not determine the constitutionality of these provisions as applied.we reverse the decision of the first district holding the provisions facially unconstitutional,and remand with directions to reverse the summary judgment granted in the city of gainesville declaratory judgment action in this case.
it is so ordered.
i respectfully disagree with the majority determination to strictly and narrowly construe the term municipal purpose as it appears in florida constitution,by limiting the definition to only activities that are essential to the health,morals,safety,and general welfare of the people within the municipality.majority op.at emphasis added.the majority adoption of this definition appears both arbitrary and without support from our case law,and it represents an unprecedented challenge to the broad discretion and authority of local government and home rule traditionally favored in florida.as is immediately evident from comparing today majority opinion with the comprehensive review of our case law contained in chief judge wolf opinion for the first district,today holding constitutes a dramatic break from this court unbroken line of decisions broadly construing the term municipal purpose.until today,great deference has been shown to the judgment of local government as to the use of municipal property for the benefit of its citizens.today that deference has been removed.
further,i can not concur in the majority conclusion that a municipality providing telecommunications services to its residents is not an essential service and,therefore,does not constitute a municipal purpose under the majority analysis.even without the dramatic backdrop of enormous communication failures occurring during the recent natural disasters and terrorist attacks in this country,it is simply a modern fact of life that our citizens and our communities view the widespread availability of the latest in communication technology as essential to their general welfare.
constitutional history and the broad interpretation of municipal purpose 
consistent with this court virtually unbroken precedent and case law,the first district below concluded that municipal purpose should continue to be given a broad definition.while i will also attempt to briefly review our constitutional and case law history,i would suggest that chief judge wolf opinion flawlessly and comprehensively speaks for itself in its interpretation of the term municipal purpose as previously construed by this court.there is a particular passage in that opinion that gets right to the heart of the issue 
appellant has not cited any case which supports the proposition that when property is owned and used by a municipality the term municipal purpose as used in article vii,section a,florida constitution,should be narrowly construed.sebring airport authority mcintyre,so d and other cases cited for adopting a narrow interpretation involve situations where municipal property is being leased or utilized by a private entity.in williams jones,so d,a case where a municipality leased municipal property,the court stated that one person operating a commercial establishment for profit should not have an advantage over another commercial establishment also operating for purely proprietary purposes just because one is located on governmental property.the same policy considerations do not apply where the property is being owned and operated by the municipality itself,in which case the focus of the municipality is the provision of service to its citizens.see,city of boca raton gidman,so d.in fact,we are unaware of any public policy reason when property is owned and operated by a municipality that the term municipal purpose should not be given its generally accepted meaning in accordance with article viii,section b,florida constitution.the fifth district opinion in greater orlando aviation authority crotty,so d,dca,and the opinion of this court in page fernandina beach,so d dca,support such a uniform construction.the crotty court noted,
t he constitution exempts from taxation property owned by a municipality and used exclusively by it for municipal or public purposes.the term municipal purpose has been defined as encompassing all activities essential to the health,morals,protection and welfare of the municipality.state city of jacksonville,so d.municipal functions are those created or granted for the special benefit and advantage of the urban community embraced within the corporate boundaries.chardkoff junk company city of tampa,so.see also state ex rel.harper mcdavid,so.city of winter park montesi,so d,dca.our courts have ruled that municipal functions include functions which specifically and peculiarly promote the comfort,convenience,safety and happiness of the citizens of the municipality rather than the welfare of the general public.

dep t of revenue city of gainesville,so d,dca footnotes omitted.this passage focuses on the broad authority granted to municipalities to utilize property owned and used by the municipality to serve its citizens in a broad variety of ways,while still enjoying the constitutional tax exemption that was placed in the constitution to encourage that very activity.obviously,such a tax exemption has served as an incentive to cities to serve their citizens.with today decision,that incentive and the services that go with it have been placed at risk.
the constitution of provided that property owned by corporations shall be subject to taxation unless used exclusively for religious,scientific,municipal,educational,literary or charitable purposes.art.xvi.const.of emphasis added.under this court case law,the term municipal purpose has been consistently interpreted broadly to permit cities wide latitude in using municipal property to serve municipal residents,while still enjoying a constitutional tax exemption.for example,in state city of tallahassee,so,this court held that a city construction of an office building for rent was such a municipal purpose contemplated by the constitutional tax exemption.id.at.in fact,in the same opinion this court noted that the construction of a irports,golf courses,school buildings,and other structures would be proper municipal purposes.id.
subsequently,again construing this provision broadly,this court held that holding a proprietary interest in a community recreational asset and business stimulant,like a speedway,served a municipal purpose because it contributed to the economic of the community,thereby rendering even the lessees interest in the property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the constitutional language.daytona beach racing recreational facilities dist.paul,so d,see also state daytona beach racing recreational facilities,so d,noting that this court has on numerous cases approved as a public purpose the development of recreational facilities.in fact,it was this case and others like it,extending the benefit of the constitutional tax break to private entities,that eventually led to a revision of these tax provisions.
subsequently,article vii,section a of the constitution was revised to prevent private entities from continuing to enjoy a constitutional tax exemption when municipalities leased property to them.the majority appears to acknowledge the purpose of the revisions to address these seemingly unfair tax breaks for private entities.see majority op.at thus,although the framers of article vii,section a sought to limit the holding in daytona beach racing,they did so by requiring both ownership and exclusive use of the property by the municipality rather than by narrowing the definition of municipal purpose.emphasis added.of course,the majority acknowledgment is based on our own case law.see volusia county daytona beach racing recreational facilities,so d,perceiving decisions such as daytona beach racing as creating inequities in the tax structure,the draftsmen of the constitution of limited the municipal purpose exemption to property owned by a municipality and used exclusively by it for municipal or public purposes.bonnie roberts,ad valorem taxation of leasehold interests in governmentally owned property,stating that daytona beach racing dealt a substantial blow to the legislature attempt to tax leasehold interests,and that the drafters of the constitution attempted to deal with the problem by limiting the constitutional grounds on which an exemption could be based.no one has ever suggested that the amendment was intended to take away the exemption from municipalities that both owned the land and used it for the benefit of local residents.
hence,the focus of the revision was on the leasing of municipal property to private parties,rather than on the use of municipal property by the municipality itself,the issue before us today.clearly,the broad exemption of municipal property owned by municipalities and used by them for public purposes,and not leased to private entities,remained in place in our constitution after thus,given both the substantial case law interpreting this phrase as broadly inclusive,and the narrow focus of the amendments of the constitution in concerning private entities enjoying tax breaks,it seems evident that the term municipal purpose should continue to be broadly construed when it is applied to municipal property owned and used by a municipality to serve its citizens.
indeed,that is precisely what this court did in in rejecting a claim that property owned by a municipality to meet future undesignated needs was not entitled to a constitutional tax exemption.in city of sarasota mikos,so d,justice overton declared for a unanimous court 
a reading of section a of article vii clearly establishes that it is a provision and therefore does not require statutory implementation.the change in the language of chapter is irrelevant because although a statute may grant additional exemptions,it may not repeal the exemptions granted municipalities by the constitution.in our view,the city holding of vacant land to meet the future needs of the public and to preserve natural open spaces is not a private use.we do not believe municipalities are required to dedicate land for a particular purpose,construct buildings,or otherwise be active on their land in order to maintain the tax exempt status of the property.neither the constitution nor common sense requires there be an active use of such property.we hold that vacant land held by a municipality is presumed to be in use for a public purpose if it is not actually in use for a private purpose on tax assessment day 
we recognize that property owned by a municipality is not exempt from taxation if it is used for a private purpose.see panama city pledger,so.land leased to a private corporation is not in use for a public purpose city of bartow roden,so d dca land leased to a private enterprise for nonaeronautical activities is not in use for public purpose illinois grain schleman,so d dca land leased to a private corporation is not in use for a public purpose.none of these cases even imply that unimproved vacant land owned by a municipality falls within the category of land held for a private purpose.
if the contentions of the property appraiser were adopted,the tax burden of county residents would be reduced at the expense of city taxpayers.this result is contrary to the purpose of our present constitution which provides that each local governmental entity shall have the same basic taxing authority,shall pay its own way,and shall not receive benefits at the expense of another local governmental unit.
id.at.in essence,our mikos opinion approved of a rebuttable presumption in favor of an article vii tax exemption for municipally owned property not being used for a private purpose,even when the property was not in current use.today majority,and its new and explicit requirement of basic,necessary,or indispensable,simply can not be reconciled with our holding in mikos giving deference to a municipality legislative judgment as to what constitutes a municipal or public purpose unless the property is actually in use for a private purpose.id.at.
majority definition of municipal purpose 
it would also appear that the majority opinion is engaging in a flawed analysis by using the terms basic,necessary,or indispensable to now radically limit the scope of municipal purpose.the majority reliance on state ex rel.harper mcdavid,so,to support this definition is especially troubling.in mcdavid,this court did conclude that a municipal purpose may now comprehend all activities essential to the health,morals,protection,and welfare of the municipality.id.at.but we used the phrase to encompass a broad meaning of municipal purpose.the majority attempt to use mcdavid as precedent for limiting the scope of municipal purpose is simply inconsistent with the actual broad construction and analysis we utilized in that case.in mcdavid,for example,we cited to city of tallahassee and mentioned golf courses,among other items,as endeavors that fall under the very much expanded definition of municipal purpose.mcdavid,so.at.moreover,we stated,the time was when a municipal purpose was restricted to police protection or such enterprises as were strictly governmental but that concept has been very much expanded id.of course,mcdavid recognized and endorsed this broad expansion.in other words,it is virtually impossible to use our opinion in mcdavid as the basis for narrowly construing the term municipal purpose when the opinion explicitly utilizes and approves a broad definition of the term.
authority of local governments 
it is also virtually impossible to square the majority narrow construction of the term municipal purpose with florida long history favoring home rule and local government and at the local level as to the use of municipal property to serve local residents.the approach advocated by the majority alters the historic presumption in favor of cities that has traditionally allowed them broad discretion to decide what constitutes a municipal purpose.by now restricting the definition of municipal purpose to include only those endeavors deemed essential,the majority seems to suggest that municipalities can not be trusted to determine what activities benefit its own citizens.
in fact,with the majority new and restrictive definition of municipal purpose,one is left to wonder what will happen to all of the services that municipalities now provide,including municipal parks,pools,zoos and a multitude of other services that have previously withstood court challenges to their status hopefully,the majority is not signaling a return to the days of the early twentieth century when a municipal purpose was restricted to police protection or such enterprises as were strictly governmental.see mcdavid,so.at.surely,the technological and societal advances recognized as appropriate for municipal attention since the early twentieth century are too significant for this court to now roll back the clock on the services that florida municipalities have decided to provide their citizens through the use of municipally owned property.
providing telecommunications as a municipal purpose 
finally,even adhering to the majority new definition of municipal purpose as one essential to the health,morals,protection,and general welfare of the municipality,surely it can not be denied that providing telecommunications services meets this description.in the midst of a technological and communications revolution that has been hailed as having a greater impact on civilization than anything that has preceded it,we can not deny local governments the opportunity to bring these benefits to their citizens.i have already alluded to the fact that we are deciding this case in a backdrop of natural disasters where government at all levels,including local,has been sharply criticized for its communications failures 
the first district opinion clearly articulates why the provision of telecommunications services should be considered a municipal purpose 
i f property is being used by the municipality for a public purpose,the legislature may not remove the exemption.yet,that is precisely the purpose of section.the legislative staff analysis of chapter states the purpose of the act to remove the exemption that municipalities,counties,or other entities of local government have for ad valorem taxes on real property used for the purpose of providing telecommunication services to the public.comm.on utils.and communications,hb march,staff analysis on file with comm.the only issue before us is whether this property which is owned by the city is being used for a municipal purpose.
indeed,the provision of telecommunication services for the benefit of city residents constitutes a valid municipal purpose pursuant to any reasonable interpretation of the term municipal purpose.the best evidence in this regard is the statute itself which recognizes that political subdivisions within the state may be issued certificates by the public service commission to act as a telecommunications provider.see.stat.
in addition,as recognized by the trial court,there is a long history in florida and elsewhere in this country of local governments providing utility services.in discussing the provision of telecommunications services,the trial court stated,
while the provision of telecommunications services may also partake of no aspect of sovereignty,it is no less a legitimate municipal corporate undertaking for the comfort,convenience,safety,and happiness of the municipality citizens than a marina.indeed,if anything,it is more analogous to such services as electricity and water,long recognized as serving valid municipal and public purposes.see ford orlando utilities comm n,so d property used in furnishing electricity is used for valid municipal purpose and exempt from tax under the florida constitution schultz crystal river three participants,so d dca interest of municipalities in private power plant was tax exempt orlando utilities comm milligan,so d dca furnishing of electricity,power,and water was municipal purpose under florida constitution.
