the tom martino show is a radio talk show that airs telephone conversations between martino and callers seeking help with their consumer problems.feroglia contacted the tom martino show about her dispute with appellants and ultimately,she was invited to call in to the show and explain her problem to martino live on the air.
martino spoke with feroglia and then discussed her complaints over the course of approximately minutes.relevant portions of the program are as follows

ii.discussion 
appellants filed their initial complaint in the circuit court for the state of oregon for the county of clackamas.the complaint was subsequently removed by appellees to federal court on the basis of diversity and federal question jurisdiction.thereafter,appellants filed a first amended complaint in federal court as a matter of right pursuant to.a.appellants claims in the first amended complaint are based on martino statements in segment one of the broadcast,they are just lying to you and w ill they admit to us they lied,they went back on their word.
appellees moved to strike all claims in the complaint pursuant to.magistrate judge dennis james hubel recommended granting appellees motion to strike and concluded as a matter of law that martino statements were nonactionable opinion under both the first amendment and oregon common law the magistrate referred the findings and recommendation to district judge anna brown for her review.judge brown adopted the recommendation and dismissed the action without prejudice.
oregon statutes 
comprise oregon strategic lawsuit against public participation statutes.statutes are designed to allow the early dismissal of meritless lawsuits aimed at chilling expression through costly,litigation.verizon delaware,covad comms,cir.section allows defendants to bring a special motion to strike a claim which shall be treated as a motion to dismiss under or.civ.a and requires the court to enter a judgment of dismissal without prejudice if the motion is granted.the court consideration of a special motion to strike is a process.first,the defendant has the initial burden to show that the challenged statement is within one of the categories of civil actions described in.if the defendant meets the initial burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff in the action to establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim by presenting substantial evidence to support a prima facie case.if the plaintiff meets this burden,the court shall deny the motion.
appellants do not challenge that the appellees met their initial burden to show that martino statements fall within one of the categories of civil actions described in.instead,appellants appeal the district court ruling that appellants failed to meet their burden of establishing that there is a probability that they would prevail on their claims as alleged in the first amended complaint.appellants argue that martino statements constitute false assertions of fact and do not receive first amendment protection.
defamation claim 
standard of review 
whether an allegedly defamatory statement is one of opinion or fact is a question of law.slover or.bd.of clinical soc.workers.we review de novo the district court ruling that martino statements are not defamatory as a matter of law.knievel espn,cir.
standard of law 
there are several decisions in this circuit which address defamation claims and the standards that should be applied.in milkovich lorain journal,d,the supreme court rejected the approach previously used by this circuit and held that while pure opinions those that do not imply facts capable of being proven true or false are protected by the first amendment,a statement that may imply a false assertion of fact is actionable even if it is couched as a statement of opinion.id.at.see also partington bugliosi,cir.
in unelko rooney,cir,we held that the threshold question after milkovich in a defamation claim is whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the contested statement implies an assertion of objective fact.if the answer is no,the claim is foreclosed by the first amendment.we use a test to resolve this question whether the general tenor of the entire work negates the impression that the defendant was asserting an objective fact,whether the defendant used figurative or hyperbolic language that negates the impression,and whether the statement in question is susceptible of being proved true or false.partington,at citing unelko,at see also knievel,at noting the three parts for the totality of the circumstances test as the broad context the specific context and the content of the statement and whether the statement is sufficiently factual to be susceptible of being proved true or false.
in partington,we held that when a speaker outlines the factual basis for his conclusion,his statement is not defamatory and receives first amendment protection.at.in that case,the defendant book,and the sea will tell,implied that the plaintiff represented his clients poorly in a murder trial.id.at.we held that the defendant statements in the book were not defamatory because the book general tenor made clear that the defendant statements were from his personal viewpoint,and not assertions of an objective fact.id.at.
in underwager channel australia,cir,we noted that the word lying is not always defamatory because the word applies to a spectrum of untruths including white lies,partial truths,misinterpretation,and deception which may be statements of nonactionable opinion.the defendant in underwager was sued for rebroadcasting a television show interview where the speaker said the plaintiff was lying about his credentials as an expert in the child psychology field.id.however,the plaintiff failed to show that the challenged statement implied a verifiable assertion of perjury and therefore the statement was protected under the first amendment.id.
in flowers carville,cir,we refined the partington rule to protect a speaker who reasonably relies on facts that may be false.in that case,gennifer flowers sued george stephanopoulos and james carville for defamation after they claimed she lied about her affair with president bill clinton and doctored recordings of intimate phone calls from clinton that she secretly taped.id.at.stephanopoulos and carville argued that their statements were protected because they relied on news reports that the tapes were selectively edited.we explained that in the case of a public figure,unless defendants knew the news reports were probably false or had some obvious reason to doubt their accuracy,their reliance is protected by the first amendment.but if it turns out that defendants knew the news reports were wrong or acted with reckless indifference in the face of some clear warning sign then they were entitled to repeat them publicly and later claim that they were merely expressing nondefamatory opinions.id.at.
finally,and most recently,in manufactured home communities,county of san diego,cir,we held that a defendant statements that accused the plaintiff of lying without expressly disclosing a factual basis for the statements could be defamatory.we remanded the case for further proceedings because in that case,unlike in partington,the defendant statements were not clearly attached to an outline of fact,nor did she explicitly link her statements to an express factual basis.id.at.
analysis of appellants defamation claim 
appellants seek reversal of the district court ruling that martino statements in segment one of the broadcast were protected expression under the first amendment.the magistrate judge explained that the challenged statements could have been referring to any one of three potential lies a lie by plaintiffs when they allegedly said they would buy the pwc back a lie by plaintiffs when they denied saying they would buy the pwc back and a lie by plaintiffs when they said they had tested the pwc and it worked great.appellants argue that martino statements are defamatory because the factual basis that martino relied on was false and martino interview with feroglia was devoid of loose,hyperbolic language so that listeners would assume martino was stating a fact about appellants.we do not need to resolve which lie martino was referring to in the contested statements because we hold that martino statements are nonactionable opinion,which is protected by the first amendment.
martino reliance on feroglia factual statements was reasonable 
a review of the context in which martino made his comments,they lying to you,and will they admit to us that they they went back on their word demonstrates that these statements were not assertions of fact.the tom martino show is a radio talk show program that contains many of the elements that would reduce the audience expectation of learning an objective fact drama,hyperbolic language,an opinionated and arrogant host,and heated controversy.see knievel espn,cir analyzing the format,structure,the language used,and the expectations that the target audience would have with regard to the type of information that might be found in the context,and noting that such context might be paramount,if not dispositive.in the troubleshooting segment of the show in which the allegedly defamatory comments were made,feroglia,a frustrated consumer,called in to narrate her story on the air.it was clear to all that martino had no independent knowledge of the complaint at this point 
because martino lying statements were made in reliance on the facts outlined on air by feroglia in the minutes preceding his commentary,like in partington and unlike in manufactured home communities,no reasonable listener could consider martino comments to imply an assertion of objective facts rather than an interpretation of the facts equally available to martino and to the listener.see partington,at.as we stated in partington,when it is clear that the allegedly defamatory statement is speculat ion on the basis of the limited facts available,at,it represents a personal interpretation of the facts.see see also haynes alfred knopf,cir i f it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view,an interpretation,a theory,conjecture,or surmise,rather than claiming to be in possession of objectively verifiable facts,the statement is not actionable.
appellants argue,however,that feroglia statements were false and that therefore martino reliance on her facts is unprotected under flowers.the flaw in appellants argument is that it ignores the specific language in flowers that protects reliance on the statements of unless the defendant knew that the statements were probably false or had some obvious reason to doubt their accuracy.flowers,at.in that case,flowers was a public figure,id.at,but even assuming appellants are private figures,martino reliance on feroglia factual statements would be protected unless he was negligent or unreasonable in doing so.see gertz robert welch,d holding that where a statement involves a private figure on a matter of public concern,a plaintiff must show that the false connotations were made with some level of fault bank of oregon.news,or,holding that plaintiffs must prove that the false and defamatory statements were made negligently,without due care to ascertain whether they were true.thus,the analysis does not turn on whether feroglia story was wrong as urged by appellants but on whether martino reliance on those facts was reasonable.
we conclude that the appellants have not presented substantial evidence to support a prima facie case that martino reliance on feroglia story was unreasonable or negligent.the declarations submitted by the appellants show that feroglia statements may ha
