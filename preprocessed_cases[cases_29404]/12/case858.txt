ntp,ntp appeals from decisions of the united states patent and trademark office board of patent appeals and interferences board affirming the rejections of claims in united states patent patent,patent,patent,patent,patent,patent,and patent.we address these seven appeals in a single opinion because there are common issues throughout.related appeal presents unique issues addressed in a separate opinion.for the reasons set forth below,we,and remand.
background 
the parties agree that the patents involved in this appeal share substantially identical specifications.appellant br.dir.br.vi.the patents describe a system for sending information such as electronic mail from an originating processor,a personal computer to a destination processor,a mobile computer using an intermediary,an rf receiver.patent ll.prior art systems such as the one shown in figure of the patent required a portable computer to connect to a public switched phone line in order to access electronic messages.because it was difficult to locate a telephone jack,the mobile computer user was often unable to receive electronic mail.id.ll.the inventors set out to solve this problem by introducing a radio frequency rf network.figure illustrates the invention 
the individual elements shown in this figure were all known.for example,it is undisputed that prior art electronic mail systems used gateway switches to store and forward electronic mail.id.ll.the present invention introduced an interface switch to the system that communicates between the gateway switch and the rf network.id.ll.this interface switch receives an electronic mail message from the gateway switch and forwards it,via the rf network,to an rf receiver.id.ll.the rf receiver then transfers the electronic mail message to the destination processor mobile computer when the destination processor is activated.the system also allows for the transmission of electronic mail via the prior art wireline networks.
this is not the first time we have considered this family of patents.in ntp,research in motion,an infringement action,we described the function of the system 
the invention particular innovation was to integrate existing electronic mail systems with rf wireless communications networks.in simplified terms,the invention operates in the following manner a message originating in an electronic mail system may be transmitted not only by wireline but also via rf,in which case it is received by the user and stored on his or her mobile rf receiver.the user can at some later point,connect the rf receiver to a fixed destination processor,his or her personal computer or mobile computer,and transfer the stored message.intermediate transmission to the rf receiver is advantageous because it eliminat es the requirement that the destination processor be turned on and carried with the user to receive messages.instead,a user can access his or her email stored on the rf receiver and review its contents without interaction with the destination receiver.
internal citations omitted.during this litigation,research in motion,rim filed the reexamination requests that led to this appeal.
claim of the patent is illustrative of the claims at issue in this appeal and describes a system for transmitting originated information from originating processors in an electronic mail system to at least one of a plurality of destination processors comprising a gateway switch in the electronic mail system to receive and store originated information the text of an electronic mail message an rf network to receive originated information from the gateway and transmit it to an rf receiver an interface switch to facilitate communications between the gateway and the rf network,wherein the address of the interface switch is added during transmission in the electronic mail system and wherein the electronic mail system may also transmit originated information from an originating processor to a destination processor over a wireline apart from the rf network.other claims in the appeal are broader and remove the specific reference to the gateway switch.for example,claim of the patent describes an interface for communicating between an originating processor and an rf transmission network.
ntp appeals the board affirmance of a number of rejections detailed below.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.
discussion 
ntp raises several issues on appeal.first,it argues that the board claim constructions of electronic mail message and electronic mail system are incorrect.second,it claims that the board erred when it found that ntp could not antedate several references under.third,it asserts that telenor,eight volumes of a printed publication titled mobile data networks description,is not a prior art reference because it is not a printed publication under b.finally,it appeals several rejections unrelated to the construction of electronic mail message based on various prior art references.each issue is discussed in turn.
claim construction 
the claim terms at issue in these appeals are electronic mail or electronic mail message and electronic mail system.in reexamination,claims are to be given their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification,and claim language should be read in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.in re am.acad.of sci.tech,quotation omitted.thus,while reviewing claim construction de novo,singh brake,this court must determine whether the board construction of the term was reasonable,in re morris.
we turn first to the board construction of electronic mail or electronic mail message.the term electronic mail or electronic mail message appears in all eight.the board construed this term to mean a formatted text message having a destination address identifying the persons,places,or objects to which the message is directed.ntp asserts that this construction is incorrect and proposes that electronic mail message means a message that has the destination address an identification of the originating processor the subject of the message and the message or message text with the clear result being that email elements and require a communication system to have both originating and destination processors.appellant br.ntp proposed construction has wavered between two positions throughout these appeals requiring that all the listed fields be entered and requiring that only the destination address be entered with the capability for entry of the other three fields 
the board construction only required the entry of a destination address.this construction,however,ignores the claim language and evidence of the understanding of a person of ordinary skill in the art.the claim language clearly requires that,in addition to a destination address,electronic mail messages have the capability for entry of message content,such as text or an attachment.further,other intrinsic and extrinsic evidence shows that a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that an electronic mail message must also have the capability to enter an identification of an originating processor and a subject.while the board must give the terms their broadest reasonable construction,the construction can not be divorced from the specification and the record evidence.in re suitco surface.
based on the evidence,the broadest reasonable construction of electronic mail message is a message that has a destination address and the capability for entry of message content,an identification of an originating processor,and a subject.as with any claim construction analysis,we begin with the claim language.phillips awh,en banc.the claims of the require that an electronic mail message has a destination address.the parties do not dispute this point.for example,claim of the patent states that the originated information is transmitted with an address of the at least one of the plurality of destination processors.patent ll see also patent ll claiming other originated information having an address of the at least one of the plurality of destination processors patent ll claiming the originated information is transmitted with an address of the at least one rf receiver to receive the originated information patent ll same patent ll claiming a system that transfers the originated information to the at least one of a plurality of destination processors patent ll claiming the electronic mail message includes an address of the one interface patent ll claiming the broadcast including information contained within the electronic mail and an identification of each rf receiver to receive the broadcast.although some claims refer to the address of an interface or an rf receiver,the specification explains that t he address of the destination processor preferably is an identification number of a rf receiver patent ll.without a destination address,there would be no electronic mail message.
turning to the capability for entry of message text,claim of the patent claims a system for transmitting originated information.patent ll.this court construed originated information to mean the message text of an electronic mail message in the rim litigation.the other similarly claim the transmission of originated information.see,patent ll claiming a system for transmitting originated information patent same patent ll claiming a system for transmitting information with the information including originated information patent ll claiming a system for connecting a plurality of electronic mail systems each transmitting originated information patent claiming a system for transmitting an inputted message.moreover,the specification explains that e lectronic mail is typically used to send short informal messages between computers patent ll see also id.ll explaining that figure summarizes electronic mail message entry methods for messages information originating from originating processors within an electronic mail system.because the claims of the include a limitation that originated information be entered in an electronic mail message,an electronic mail message must have the capability for a message to be entered.
based on the claim language alone,it is clear that an electronic mail message must include a destination address and the capability to enter message content,such as text or an attachment.but we can not stop with these two fields,this broad construction would encompass prior art technologies,such as pager messages,that the inventors excluded by using the term electronic mail.thus,we turn to the specification and extrinsic evidence to help determine the meaning of electronic mail to one of ordinary skill in the art.electronic mail messages are prior art to the claimed invention as exemplified by the background art section of the written description.see,patent ll the use of computers to send and receive electronic mail messages is becoming very popular globally.in the background art section,the patent presents a definition of electronic mail as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art 
electronic mail systems have several common items that must be entered in order to originate and send format an electronic message.these items include the destination address an identification of the originating processor the subject of the message and the message or message text 
patent.while this statement does not rise to the level of the inventor acting as its own lexicographer,it does provide insight into the understanding of the person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention.ntp also presented the testimony of an expert that echoed this definition 
a formatted text message that is transmitted over a communication system that includes the following characteristics a a destination address identifying the person s,place s,or object s to which the message is directed b an indication of the sender which may be added automatically by the electronic mail programming c a subject field which may be blank and d the inputted message text.
based on this evidence,we hold that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized that an electronic mail message must include a destination address and must have the capacity to include an address of an originating processor,message content such as text or an attachment,and a subject.there is no contrary record evidence.we can not agree with the pto argument that the following specification quote requires us to affirm the board broad definition 
the invention is user friendly in that the minimum amount of information that must be provided to initiate the transmission of electronic mail from an originating processor to at least one destination processor is an identification of the destination processor and information indicating that the message is to be sent by the rf information transmission network.
patent ll emphases added.that specification quote does not state that electronic mail is anything with a destination address.rather it explains that a destination address is the minimum amount of information necessary to initiate transmission.this portion of the specification is directed to the requirements and processes for transmitting the message and this quote is discussing what portion of the electronic mail is necessary for the initiation of the transmission.we do not agree with the pto that this defines electronic mail.we hold that an electronic mail message is a message that includes a destination address and the capability for entry of message content,an identification of an originating processor,and a subject.therefore,because the board construction of electronic mail message is incorrect,we vacate the board decisions as to the invalidity of the and remand for the board to apply the correct claim construction to the prior art.
next,the board construed electronic mail system to mean a processor placing an electronic mail message on a transmission mechanism capable of delivering the message to the intended recipient.the board construction does not require a plurality of processors.id.ntp argues that this construction is incorrect.we agree.
the claims themselves require a plurality of processors in an electronic mail system.see,patent ll claiming a plurality of originating processors in an electronic mail system emphasis added patent ll same patent ll same patent ll same patent ll same patent ll same patent ll claiming a system comprising a communication system which transmits electronic mail,inputted to the communication system from a plurality of processors.moreover,the specifications of the describe a system having a plurality of processors.see,patent abstract a system for transmitting information from one of a plurality of originating processors.id.ll an electronic mail system for transmitting information from one of a plurality of originating processors id.ll s toring the information received from one of the at least one originating processors id.ll w herein the information from the one of the plurality of originating processors is transmitted id.ll the receiving interface switch stores information that is received from a plurality of originating processors id.ll the number of originating processors is greater than the number of interface switches.
based on the claims and the specification,an electronic mail system,as claimed,must contain a plurality of originating processors.thus,the broadest reasonable construction of electronic mail system is the construction provided by this court in the previous rim litigation a type of communication system which includes a plurality of processors running electronic mail programming wherein the processors and the electronic mail programming are configured to permit communication by way of electronic mail messages among recognized users of the electronic mail system.ntp,at.
ii.swearing behind affidavits and evidence 
one issue common to several appeals is whether ntp successfully antedated a number of references under.we review the board for substantial evidence.in re gartside.the critical date is october.in determining the date of reduction to practice,the board focused on two aspects of the invention that it found to be critical to establishing an earlier invention date the requirement that be sent wirelessly and the requirement that the electronic mail system transmit other originated information through a wireline without transmission using the rf information transmission network.ntp submitted inventor affidavits from thomas campana and gary thelen that allege a reduction to practice date prior to the critical date.
a party seeking to antedate a reference based on reduction to practice must present evidence of the actual reduction to practice of the invention prior to the effective date of the reference.c.b.an inventor can not rely on uncorroborated testimony to establish a prior invention date.id.it has long been the case that an inventor allegations of earlier invention alone are insufficient an alleged date of invention must be corroborated.medichem rolabo,woodland trust flowertree nursery.e vidence is assigned probative value and collectively weighed to determine whether reduction to practice has been achieved.medichem,at.sufficiency of corroboration is determined by using a rule of reason analysis,under which all pertinent evidence is examined when determining the credibility of an inventor testimony.id.
to corroborate the inventors testimony,ntp submitted several pieces of evidence.first,it submitted the telefind e mail integration document telefind.ntp argued that telefind revision,dated october,prior to the critical date,would corroborate the inventor testimony.in reviewing the telefind document,the board noted that the only submitted version,revision,had a date of april,long after the critical date of october.the board thus held that ntp could not rely on the telefind document to corroborate the campana or thelen testimony.
we agree with the pto that substantial evidence supports the board refusal to accord the telefind document the date of revision.the only submitted version of the telefind document is revision,which is dated april.ntp argues that revision and revision have all the same key components.thus,ntp explains that what is disclosed in revision should be treated as present in revision.to substantiate this claim,ntp relies upon the testimony of the same two inventors,campana and thelen.campana states that i have determined from a complete review of the documents that the description of the system in the telefind email integration document which was revision was written by me and was not substantially changed in the later revisions and.thelen testified similarly.id.at.the problem with ntp argument is that it is circular.the affiants seek to corroborate their testimony with the telefind document,but,at the same time,attempt to corroborate the date of the document with their testimony.it would be strange indeed to say that campana,who filed the affidavit that needs corroborating,can by his own testimony provide that corroboration.we agree with the pto that substantial evidence supports the board determination that the earliest reliable date for the telefind document is april,the date of revision.
ntp also relies on four letters written by campana and a meeting report by andros that allegedly detail the patented invention as well as two demonstrations of the patented technology.an august,letter from campana describes attempts to integrate the technology with at t networks.this memo describes a pager and a hand held messager and describes the technology as network messaging.id.later,on august,campana composed a letter using similar language radio messaging and messager pager.id.at.again,on september,campana wrote describing one way radio paging,messaging,and mentioning that at t would like to demonstrate the technology at the comdex show.id.at.a meeting report prepared by andros describes an october,demonstration of the technology.id.at.this report describes the use of a pager as a wireless modem.id.finally,a november,letter from campana describes the comdex demonstration on november.this letter states that,at the comdex demonstration,the system transmitted.
the board found that this evidence did not corroborate the testimony of the inventors.the board noted that the campana letters prior to the critical date only refer to messaging and never mention electronic mail.the board found these letters inconsistent with campana testimony that he was working on an electronic mail implementation during the relevant time period.further,the board found that campana testimony and andros meeting report regarding the october,demonstration were ambiguous because neither stated that ntp demonstrated electronic mail.in coming to this conclusion,the board relied on the testimony of the third inventor,michael ponschke,from prior litigation involving the patents.in an initial deposition,ponschke testified that the october,demonstration had included electronic mail.but in his later trial testimony,he recanted this statement,saying that i apparently misspoke,we did not demonstrate.we demonstrated messaging.the board found that ponschke later testimony was consistent with the three date letters from campana and showed that the inventors did not demonstrate electronic mail prior to the critical date.
ntp argues that all of these documents taken together show that,prior to october,the inventors had reduced to practice the patented invention.it argues that,just days after the critical date,it demonstrated the fully complete invention in public at the comdex demonstration.further,it argues that these letters conclusively show that it had developed the technology to demonstrate to at t on october,three days prior to the critical date.ntp argues that the testimony of ponschke should not outweigh this evidence.
this court does not reweigh evidence on appeal,but rather determines whether substantial evidence supports the board fact findings.we agree with the pto that substantial evidence supports the board finding that these documents do not evidence a reduction to practice prior to the critical date.ponschke testimony is particularly damaging to ntp case.he testified that we did not demonstrate.we demonstrated messaging.this is consistent with the language used in all of the documents prior to october.they simply referred to messaging or to a pager.it was not until november,after the critical date,that any document stated that the system transmitted email.the november letter details the demonstration at the comdex show of the transmission of electronic mail.the problem for ntp is that november,the date of the comdex demonstration,is after the critical date october.proving a november demonstration does not establish reduction to practice prior to october.thus,substantial evidence supports the board determination that these documents do not corroborate the testimony of campana and thelen.none of the documents describes the transmission of electronic mail prior to the critical date and the testimony of ponschke provides sufficient evidence to support the board findings.
ntp also relies on a number of software files att files to corroborate the testimony of thelen.thelen testified that the att files include the code that was demonstrated in october.he states that the very first file generated from the att file that is dated october,did in fact extract electronic mails from the pager and deliver them to the at t laptop.the board rejected thelen testimony regarding the att files.the board stated thelen testimony on sending appears to be contradicted by ponschke who testified that they demonstrated messaging rather than in october.
we agree with the pto that substantial evidence supports the board determination regarding the att files and thelen testimony.although ntp argues that these files are fully operational source code,ntp fails to point to any specific portion of the files that shows that the inventors transmitted electronic mail wirelessly prior to the critical date.further,thelen admits that he could not demonstrate the transmission of electronic mail using this supposedly fully functional code.i also ran the files using my current computer however,because i had no way of entering messages to a pager,the screen did not display any emails.instead,ntp relies on the existence of these files as corroboration of the testimony that the inventors demonstrated the patented technology.again,this falls into the circular logic of using the files to corroborate the testimony and the testimony to corroborate the files.the board did not err in finding that the software files did not overcome the testimony of ponschke.
as an alternative argument for reversal,ntp argues that the board entire decision is tainted because the board rejected the testimony of campana and thelen only because the declarants are interested in the outcome of the reexamination,and many years had passed since the relevant events occurred.appellant br.ntp argues that because only allows declarations from inventors or patent owners,the declarant will always have an interest.further,it argues that reexamination will often occur years after invention,so the board effectively prevents anyone from relying on testimony to antedate a reference.
ntp is correct that the board stated that it would not credit the testimony of campana and thelen due to their interest in the invention and the time that passed since the events in question.see.contrary to ntp assertion,as shown above,the board considered every piece of allegedly corroborative evidence and came to the reasoned decision that it did not corroborate the testimony of the inventors.
finally,ntp argues that the board erred by applying a different claim construction to the issue than it did to the prior art references.ntp argues that,when considering its evidence of antedating,the board refused to consider messaging as synonymous with electronic mail.ntp argues that,contrary to this construction,the board credited messaging prior art as teaching the electronic mail limitations of the claims.it argues that this can not be proper and that we should require the board to apply the same construction to both issues.
we agree that it would be improper to apply one claim construction to evidence of date of invention and a different one in assessing the prior art references.though the board may have erred in its construction of electronic mail message,ntp has failed to swear behind as its corroborative evidence does not support the transmission of electronic mail prior to the critical date even under its own construction,which we have adopted today.in assessing the evidence to antedate the references,the board concluded that the evidence did not corroborate the inventors claim of reduction to practice of the electronic mail system prior to the critical date.we conclude that this determination is supported by substantial evidence.
iii.telenor 
the board affirmed rejections of claims in several of the patents at issue based on telenor.in addition to arguing that telenor does not anticipate the claims,ntp argued to the board that telenor is not a printed publication under b.it based this on two distinct arguments that telenor is not authentic and that it was not reasonably accessible.
telenor came to the pto by way of the reexamination requester.the requester apparently located the documents in the norwegian university of science and technology library in trondheim,norway.each of the volumes of telenor was marked as received and catalogued on a date more than one year prior to the critical date of the patents at issue.
the board considered a letter from the director of the library that detailed its procedures for receiving,date stamping,and cataloguing documents at the time the library received telenor.the director stated that the library date stamped all documents upon receipt.id.at.the library then classified the references under an appropriate subject matter category.the director explained that the library classified telenor under the subject headings computer networks and communication protocols.id.the library loaded information about the reference into bibsys,an online catalogue.bibsys allowed searching by author,title,classification number,subject heading,and other fields.id.according to the library,telenor would have been available for search shortly after its arrival at the library.
the board also considered a declaration of petter sorsdahl,a swedish patent attorney,submitted by the reexamination requester.sorsdahl testified that he believed that a search in at the library would have uncovered telenor.sorsdahl testified that the invention of the patents at issue was mobile data networks and mobile telephony.thus,the board concluded,based on sorsdahl testimony,that because the invention of the patents is similar to the title of telenor and its classifications at the library,one of ordinary skill in the art would locate telenor after reasonable search.
the board considered the declaration of a forensic document investigator,david browne,submitted by ntp.browne analyzed telenor for evidence that would suggest the documents may not be authentic.he focused primarily on three pieces of evidence.first,he testified that certain documents had multiple staple holes indicating that they were disassembled at some point.he stated that this means that it is possible that the references were taken apart and put back together.second,browne testified that telenor included pages that came from different batches of paper.id.third,browne testified that on several pages,the header on a page appeared to be different from the text on the same page.he testified that this meant that someone could have altered the text of the pages.id.at.
finally,the board considered the declaration of rhyne,who testified that one skilled in the art would not have located telenor through a reasonable search.specifically,rhyne posited that the field of the invention of the campana patents is electronic mail and thus one skilled in the art would not have searched for computer networks or communications protocols.
the board held that telenor is a printed publication under.b.it noted that this case is similar to in re hall,where a single thesis catalogued and shelved in germany was a printed publication under b.the board explained that the proponent of the reference must establish a prima facie case that it is prior art,and then the burden shifts to the patent owner.regarding authenticity,the board afforded much weight to the letter from the library detailing its procedures for receiving,and cataloguing references.the board noted that the date stamp showed that the documents were deposited with the library before the critical date.the board then found that the testimony of browne did not establish that the document was altered after the critical date.although the board noted that it in no way suggest ed that browne is not telling us the truth about his examination,it nonetheless found nothing in his testimony to overcome the evidence of authenticity.it noted that browne only testified that something may not be right with telenor,but was unable to show any evidence that it was altered after the critical date.
regarding accessibility,the board found that rhyne defined the field of the invention too narrowly.the board explicitly credited the testimony of sorsdahl over that of rhyne,agreeing that the terms that the library used to classify telenor were relevant to the claimed invention and that rhyne was too narrow in his opinion that only a classification under electronic mail would be sufficient.
authenticity 
consistent with the approach of our sister circuits,we hold that the authenticity of a document is a question of fact.see,united states vidacak,cir united states weiland,cir united states carson,cir.therefore,we review the board regarding authenticity for substantial evidence.
we hold that substantial evidence supports the board finding that the telenor documents are authentic.we agree with the board that the letter from the library is extensive and complete.further,we have held in the past that c ompetent evidence of general library practice may be relied upon to establish an approximate time when a thesis became available.hall,at.this case is distinguishable from in re bayer,ccpa,where there was no evidence that the received document was catalogued or shelved.
the board determination regarding browne affidavit is supported by substantial evidence.browne testimony suggests that the documents may have been taken apart and reassembled.for example,browne stated that i noted there were slight abrasions on the paper t hese marks are clear signs that an implement was used to remove staples from the.j.browne also stated that there were abnormalities with page headers that indicated that the header and the page text may have been created at different times.id.at stating that t he disparity between this header on each page and the rest of the text indicates that the contents of the page have been copied onto paper on which a copy of the header already exists.further,browne observes that a number of pages within each book were from different batches of paper.id.at.
this testimony may support a finding that the document was taken apart and reassembled with staples or that some of the pages may have been photocopied and inserted.but there is an essential element missing from browne analysis he does not show any evidence that the alterations took place after the document was deposited with the library or after the critical date.his testimony only indicates that the documents may have been altered.for example,browne states that some pages came from different batches of paper,but he fails to indicate that this provides any information about the timing of any alterations.just because a different batch of paper was used does not mean that an alteration necessarily occurred after the document was deposited with the library.likewise,the disparate headers may seem curious,but they give no indication as to the date of any alleged modification.ntp had the burden to prove that the document was not authentic.the board conclusion that ntp has failed to establish that any modifications occurred after the documents were deposited in the library is supported by substantial evidence.
in addition to its failure to show that modifications to the document were after the date of deposit with the library,ntp further failed to show that the modifications were relevant.specifically,ntp does not list all the pages or portions of pages of telenor that were allegedly altered.this makes it impossible to determine whether the allegedly altered pages were the ones that disclosed the matter relied upon by the board.for these reasons,we agree with the pto that the board did not err in finding telenor authentic.
accessibility 
whether a reference is publicly accessible is a question of fact that we review for substantial evidence.in re klopfenstein,holding that whether a reference is publicly accessible is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the reference disclosure to members of the public.a reference is publicly available if it was disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or art exercising reasonable diligence,can locate it.kyocera wireless int l trade comm n.
the board determination that telenor was publicly accessible is supported by substantial evidence.the board is correct that the patent specification is drawn to a wider field than simply electronic mail.the title of the document itself,mobile data network description,is descriptive of the subject matter of the patents and the problem the patents purport to solve the transmission of data to mobile computers.the subject matter categories telenor was assigned by the library,computer networks and communication protocols,are similarly indicative of the subject matter of the patents at issue.these facts alone amount to substantial evidence that telenor was available to one of ordinary skill in the art exercising reasonable diligence.finally,we will not set aside the board determination that sorsdahl opinion was more credible than rhyne regarding the correct field of invention.sorsdahl stated that one of ordinary skill in the art would search for the term mobile data network when looking into the technology of the patented invention and thus would have uncovered telenor.
the board factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence.in light of those facts,we agree with its legal conclusion that telenor is a printed publication under b.
iv.prior art rejections 
in the preceding sections,we have addressed ntp arguments regarding general issues that affect a number of patents at issue.although we must remand based on our claim construction of electronic mail message,there are several issues relating to specific prior art references that we can resolve because they are unrelated to this construction.anticipation is a question of fact as is the question of what a reference teaches.para ordnance sgs importers int l,in re baxter travenol.obviousness is a question of law that we review de novo with underlying factual findings.see ksr int l teleflex.we address each basis of rejection in turn.
applicant admitted prior art in view of harrison 
in several of the patents at issue,the board affirmed rejections of claims over the applicant admitted prior art aapa in view of patent harrison and other references.the relevant aapa is best described in reference to patent figure 
the board found that elements marked and in this figure along with the gateway switches constitute an electronic mail system.the board further found that the host cpu of element constitutes an interface connecting the electronic mail system to the lan,an information transmission network.the board acknowledged that the aapa does not disclose an interface with an rf network indeed,the aapa would then anticipate the claims.for this limitation,the board relied on harrison.the board found that harrison discloses a system that incorporates an rf network into an existing lan.the board held that it would have been obvious to incorporate the rf network of harrison into element of the aapa with the host cpu acting as the interface.
ntp argues that the host cpu in box is not the claimed interface between an electronic mail system and an rf information transmission network.rather,ntp argues that the host cpu is part of the electronic mail system itself.ntp also argues that even if the host cpu could be an interface,harrison does not cure the fact that the aapa does not disclose an rf information transmission network.the board stated that this modification would improve the rf subsystem of the aapa by allowing portable units to connect without the need to dial in to a bx or pstn.ntp argues that this reasoning makes no sense because the portable computers of the aapa specifically connected via a phone line.
as an initial matter,our construction of electronic mail message is irrelevant to this basis for rejection because the aapa is the background art of the subject specifications that includes the description of electronic mail.further,the aapa clearly teaches the other limitations of the claim with the exception of the rf network.harrison teaches the use of an rf network to deliver data.thus,the board findings regarding the content of the references are supported by substantial evidence.however,we hold that,as a matter of law,the claims would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art based on the combination of the aapa and harrison.the board improperly relied on hindsight reasoning to piece together elements to arrive at the claimed invention.care must be taken to avoid hindsight reconstruction by using the patent in suit as a guide through the maze of prior art references,combining the right references in the right way so as to achieve the result of the claims in suit.grain processing american maize prods,quoting orthopedic equip.united states.given any network,we could likely carve out a possible interface and combine it with harrison to hold that the addition of a rf information transmission network would have been obvious.this type of piecemeal analysis is precisely the kind of hindsight that the board must not engage in.the board position is further weakened by the fact that the aapa already discloses an rf network that connects portable computers to the system.patent ll.thus,adding an rf network to element in the figure would render the rf network connecting the portable pcs in figure superfluous.because it is based on improper hindsight reasoning,we reverse the board rejections based on the aapa in view of harrison.
the board affirmed the rejections of a number of claims based on verjinski,phase,a portable host access system environment ieee military communications conference,october,verjinski.verjinski discloses a system for connecting wireline remote hosts with portable computers over a wireless link called portable host access system environment phase.verjinski at.verjinski specifically contemplated use of the system in sending electronic mail using smtp between two nodes.id.the interface between the wireline and portable hosts is called the portable host access component phac.id.the system is shown in figure 
when a user at a portable computer shown at the top of this figure wishes to interface with the system,the user dials into the phac.the phac assigns a temporary ip address to the portable computer and allows the computer to communicate with the internet.verjinski explicitly discloses the use of a cellular telephone network to connect the phac to the portable computers.
ntp argues that verjinski fails to teach the transmission of electronic mail.ntp also argues that verjinski phac is not an interface as claimed.it argues that the phac does not connect to an rf information transmission network or an electronic mail system,but to a single computer.
on remand,the board must determine whether verjinski teaches electronic mail under our construction.ntp remaining arguments regarding the disclosure of verjinski are without merit.we agree with the board that the phac corresponds to the claimed interface because it connects to more than just a single computer.there is substantial evidence from the reference itself that verjinski discloses that the design of the phac allows eight connections to portable hosts.these portable hosts can amount to an electronic mail system under our construction from ntp assuming that they transmit electronic mail as construed herein.thus,the phac of verjinski satisfies the claimed interface limitation.
the claims at issue also require that the system transmit originated information over both the rf network and over a wireline network.specifically,claim of the patent requires that 
other originated information originating from one of the originating processors is transmitted without using the rf information transmission network to at least one of the destination processors.
although verjinski does not disclose communication without using the rf link,the board held that i t is rudimentary and mere common sense that if a remote host has reason to communicate with a user who is using a portable computer,it may similarly have reason to communicate with a user who is operating a wirelined computer.
if we agree with the pto,this limitation of the claims is essentially irrelevant because any computer user may want to transmit to both wireline and wireless nodes.for other references discussed below,such as perkins,the board found it necessary to combine with a reference like hortensius to teach this limitation.the same logic should apply to verjinski.while this limitation might have been obvious over verjinski in view of another reference,we can not agree that it would have been obvious over verjinski alone.thus,the board erred in this holding.
telenor describes a mobile data network that is capable of transferring messages between fixed terminals and mobile stations.the following figure shows the system 
the link between the bs and the ms is an rf network.although this figure shows a single set of processors in the system,each mdx handles a number of fixed terminals.similarly,each mdx connects to a number of network adapters which in turn connect to a number of base stations that connect to a number of mobile stations.the system provides operation between up to fixed terminals and up to mobile stations using mdxs.
one of the functions of the mdx is a mailbox service.the reference explicitly discloses use of the protocol.the mdxs communicate with a message handling system via a message handling system internetworking unit miwu.the mdxs are key to providing internetworking between fixed stations and mobile stations in the system.
the board rejected ntp argument that telenor does not enable one with ordinary skill in the art to build a system for transmission of originated information from an rf information transmission network to an rf receiver.ntp argued that telenor fails to disclose the means of communication between the base station and the mobile station.ntp contended that the absence of this disclosure is evidence that the telenor developers had not resolved how to perform this communication at the time the document was prepared.the board held that ntp only pointed to the absence of specifics and put forth no evidence that it would require undue experimentation to fill in this missing disclosure.j.
ntp makes the same argument on appeal focusing on the link between the base station and the mobile station in the telenor figure above.ntp concedes that telenor discloses protocols for this communication.appellant br.but it argues that telenor fails to disclose how one would use these protocols.telenor states that this transmission will depend on the functionality of the protocol chosen for communication.ntp further complains that the board failed to credit its expert testimony that at the time this document was written,the telenor authors had not resolved how to transfer radiograms between a base station and the mobile stations.ntp argues that this is the only evidence of record regarding enablement.appellant br.
a patent claim can not be anticipated by a prior art reference if the allegedly anticipatory disclosure cited as prior art is not enabled.rasmusson smithkline beecham,quoting elan pharm,mayo found.for med.educ.research.although anticipation is a question of fact,baxter,at,whether a prior art reference is enabling is a question of law with underlying factual inquiries.in re gleave.
we agree with the pto that telenor is a sufficiently enabling disclosure as a matter of law.simply because telenor did not include every possible implementation does not mean one of ordinary skill in the art would not recognize the description as enabled.it is sufficient that telenor disclosed a protocol that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to use to implement the disclosed system.the link between the base station and the mobile station is not the focus of the reference,and the protocols function as a guide to teach one of ordinary skill in the art to accomplish this communication without undue experimentation.ntp is incorrect that its expert testimony is the only evidence on the record regarding enablement.the telenor reference itself provides the necessary evidence to satisfy this requirement.thus,the board did not err in its enablement determination.
regarding several dependent claims in the various patents,ntp argues that telenor fails to teach that the required interface assembles the originated information with other originated information received from a plurality of the originating processors into a packet.appellant br.in other words,this claim limitation requires the interface to bundle multiple communications into a single packet.the board notes that telenor discloses some grouping of messages for transmission.specifically,it points out that one single mdx may send several deliver sic messages to a na.but this does not directly address the claim language that requires assembling originated information from a plurality of originating processors into a single packet.while the pto argues that telenor teaches something equivalent to the use of packets the reference does not disclose that a single packet may contain originated information from a plurality of originating processors.thus,the board finding that telenor teaches this claim limitation is not supported by substantial evidence.keeping in mind that these are anticipation,not obviousness rejections,the failure to disclose this claim element requires reversal of these rejections.it is axiomatic that for anticipation,each and every claim limitation must be explicitly or inherently disclosed in the prior art.king,eon labs,silicon graphics,ati,verizon servs.cox fibernet virginia,iovate health,supplements nutrition.
