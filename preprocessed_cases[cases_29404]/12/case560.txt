the opinion filed on august,shall be amended as follows.
replace footnote,at,with 
prosser and keeton say that a plaintiff consent is probably invalid if the defendant ought to have known in the exercise of reasonable care about the mistake.prosser keeton,at.because the stored communications act defines a criminal offense and includes an explicit mens rea requirement,see a,we do not think a defendant can be charged with constructive knowledge on a showing of mere negligence.rather,the defendant must have consciously procured consent through improper means.in this case,the magistrate found that defendants had acted in bad faith.that is enough to charge them with knowledge of netgate mistake.see black law dictionary ed defining bad faith as not simply bad judgment or negligence,but conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity.
replace the fourth full paragraph,at,with 
the united states,as amicus curiae,disputes our interpretation.it first argues that,because subsection b refers to any storage of such communication,it applies only to backup copies of messages that are themselves in temporary,intermediate storage under subsection a.the text of the statute,however,does not support this reading.subsection a identifies a type of communication a wire or electronic communication and a type of storage temporary,intermediate storage incidental to the electronic transmission thereof.the phrase such communication in subsection b does not,as a matter of grammar,reference attributes of the type of storage defined in subsection a.the government argument would be correct if subsection b referred to a communication in such storage,or if subsection a referred to a communication in temporary,intermediate storage rather than temporary,intermediate storage of a communication.however,as the statute is written,such communication is nothing more than shorthand for a wire or electronic communication.
the government contrary interpretation suffers from the same flaw as fraser it drains subsection b of independent content because virtually any backup of a subsection a message will itself qualify as a message in temporary,intermediate storage.the government counters that the statute requires only that the underlying message be temporary,not the backup.but the lifespan of a backup is necessarily tied to that of the underlying message.where the underlying message has expired in the normal course,any copy is no longer performing any backup function.an isp that kept permanent copies of temporary messages could not fairly be described as backing up those messages.
the united states also argues that we upset the structure of the act by defining electronic storage so broadly as to be superfluous and by rendering irrelevant certain other provisions dealing with remote computing services.the first claim relies on the argument that any copy of a message necessarily serves as a backup to the user,the service or both.but the mere fact that a copy could serve as a backup does not mean it is stored for that purpose.we see many instances where an isp could hold messages not in electronic example,sent to or from the isp staff,or messages a user has flagged for deletion from the server.in both cases,the messages are not in temporary,intermediate storage,nor are they kept for any backup purpose.
our interpretation also does not render irrelevant the more liberal access standards governing messages stored by remote computing services.see a,b.the government premise is that a message stored by a remote computing service solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services to the subscriber,id.a b,b b,would also necessarily be stored for purposes of backup protection under section b,and thus would be subject to the more stringent rules governing electronic storage.but not all remote computing services are also electronic communications services and,as to those that are not,section b is by its own terms inapplicable.the government notes that remote computing services and electronic communications services are often the same entities,but often is not good enough to make the government point.even as to remote computing services that are also electronic communications services,not all storage covered by sections a b and b b is also covered by section b.a remote computing service might be the only place a user stores his messages in that case,the messages are not stored for backup purposes.
finally,the government invokes legislative history.it cites a passage from a report indicating that a committee intended that messages stored by a remote computing service would continue to be covered by section a if left on the server after user access,at.the cited discussion addresses provisions relating to remote computing services.we do not read it to address whether the electronic storage provisions also apply.see id.at.the committee statement that section a would continue to cover upon access supports our reading.if section a applies to even before access,the committee could not have been identifying an exclusive source of protection,since even the government concedes that unopened is protected by the electronic storage provisions.
the government also points to a subsequent,rejected amendment that would have made explicit the electronic storage definition coverage of opened.see,at.this sort of legislative history has very little probative value congress might have rejected the amendment precisely because it thought the definition already applied.
finally,the government points to a passing reference in another recent report.i,at.the discussion addresses an unrelated issue and merely assumes that the definition only applies to unopened.this assumption was natural given that fraser had recently been decided.
we acknowledge that our interpretation of the act differs from the government and do not lightly conclude that the government reading is erroneous.nonetheless,for the reasons above,we think that prior access is irrelevant to whether the messages at issue were in electronic storage.because plaintiff messages were in electronic storage regardless of whether they had been previously delivered,the district court decision can not be affirmed on this alternative ground 
the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc is otherwise denied.see fed.fed.no further petitions will be accepted.
we consider whether defendants violated federal electronic privacy and computer fraud statutes when they used a patently unlawful subpoena to gain access to stored by plaintiffs internet service provider.
background 
plaintiffs wolf and buckingham,officers of integrated capital associates,ica,are embroiled in commercial litigation in new york against defendant.in the course of discovery,sought access to ica.he told his lawyer iryna kwasny to subpoena ica isp,netgate.
under the federal rules,kwasny was supposed to take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on netgate.c.one might have thought,then,that the subpoena would request only related to the subject matter of the litigation,or maybe messages sent during some relevant time period,or at the very least those sent to or from employees in some way connected to the litigation.but kwasny ordered production of a ll copies of sent or received by anyone at ica,with no limitation as to time or scope.
netgate,which apparently was not represented by counsel,explained that the amount of covered by the subpoena was substantial.but defendants did not relent.netgate then took what might be described as the approach to subpoena compliance and offered defendants a free sample consisting of messages.it posted copies of the messages to a netgate website where,without notifying opposing counsel,kwasny and read them.most were unrelated to the litigation,and many were privileged or personal.
when wolf and buckingham found out what had happened,they asked the court to quash the subpoena and award sanctions.magistrate judge wayne brazil soundly roasted and kwasny for their conduct,finding that the subpoena,on its face,was massively overbroad and patently unlawful,that it transparently and egregiously violated the federal rules,and that defendants acted in bad faith and showed at least gross negligence in the crafting of the subpoena.he granted the motion to quash and socked defendants with over in sanctions to cover wolf and buckingham legal fees.defendants did not appeal that award.
wolf,buckingham and other ica employees whose was included in the sample also filed this civil suit against and kwasny.they claim defendants violated the stored communications act,et,the wiretap act,et,and the computer fraud and abuse act,as well as various state laws.the district court held that none of the federal statutes applied,and dismissed the claims without leave to amend.it declined jurisdiction over the state law claims under c.plaintiffs now appeal.
the stored communications act provides a cause of action against anyone who intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided and thereby obtains,alters,or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage.a,a.e lectronic storage means either temporary,intermediate storage incidental to electronic transmission,or storage for purposes of backup protection.id.the act exempts,inter alia,conduct authorized by the person or entity providing a wire or electronic communications service,id.c,or by a user of that service with respect to a communication of or intended for that user,id.c.
the district court dismissed on the ground that netgate had authorized defendants access.it held that this consent was not coerced,because the subpoena itself informed netgate of its right to object.plaintiffs contend that netgate authorization was nonetheless invalid because the subpoena was patently unlawful.their claim turns on the meaning of the word authorized in section.we have previously reserved judgment on this question,see konop hawaiian airlines,cir,while other circuits have considered related issues,see,ef cultural travel bv explorica,cir holding access might be unauthorized under the computer fraud and abuse act if it is not in line with the reasonable expectations of the party granting permission internal quotation marks omitted united states morris,cir holding access unauthorized where it is not in any way related to the system intended function.
we interpret federal statutes in light of the common law.see beck prupis,d.especially relevant here is the common law of trespass.like the tort of trespass,the stored communications act protects individuals privacy and proprietary interests.the act reflects congress judgment that users have a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of communications in electronic storage at a communications facility.just as trespass protects those who rent space from a commercial storage facility to hold sensitive documents,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at page keeton,ed,the act protects users whose electronic communications are in electronic storage with an isp or other electronic communications facility.
a defendant is not liable for trespass if the plaintiff authorized his entry.see prosser keeton,at.but an overt manifestation of assent or willingness would not be effective if the defendant knew,or probably if he ought to have known in the exercise of reasonable care,that the plaintiff was mistaken as to the nature and quality of the invasion intended.id,at restatement second of torts.thus,the busybody who gets permission to come inside by posing as a meter reader is a trespasser.desnick,eye,abc,cir.so too is the police officer who,invited into a home,conceals a recording device for the media.berger hanlon,cir,vacated,d,reinstated in relevant part,cir.
not all deceit vitiates consent.t he mistake must extend to the essential character of the act itself,which is to say that which makes it harmful or offensive,rather than to some collateral matter which merely operates as an inducement.prosser keeton,at footnote omitted.in other words,it must be a substantial mistake concerning the nature of the invasion or the extent of the harm.restatement second of torts cmt.unlike the phony meter reader,the restaurant critic who poses as an ordinary customer is not liable for trespass,desnick,at nor,unlike the wired cop,is the invitee who conceals only an intent to repeat what he hears,dietemann time,cir invasion of privacy claim.these results hold even if admission would have been refused had all the facts been known.
these are fine and sometimes incoherent distinctions.see med.lab.mgmt.consultants abc,d,aff,cir.but the theory is that some invited mistakes go to the essential nature of the invasion while others are merely collateral.classification depends on the extent to which the intrusion trenches on the specific interests that the tort of trespass seeks to protect.desnick,at see also lewis united states,d food lion,capital,cir.
we construe section in light of these doctrines.permission to access a stored communication does not constitute valid authorization if it would not defeat a trespass claim in analogous circumstances.section c therefore provides no refuge for a defendant who procures consent by exploiting a known mistake that relates to the essential nature of his access.
under this standard,plaintiffs have alleged facts that vitiate netgate consent.netgate disclosed the sample in response to defendants purported subpoena.unbeknownst to netgate,that subpoena was invalid.this mistake went to the essential nature of the invasion of privacy.the subpoena falsity transformed the access from a bona fide inspection into private snooping.see restatement second of torts addressing consent induced by fraud or mistake as to the validity of purported legal authority bumper north carolina,d a search conducted in reliance upon a warrant can not later be justified on the basis of consent if it turns out that the warrant was invalid.the false subpoena caused disclosure of documents that otherwise would have remained private it effected an invasion of the specific interests that the statute seeks to protect.desnick,at.
defendants had at least constructive knowledge of the subpoena invalidity.it was not merely technically deficient,nor a borderline case over which reasonable legal minds might disagree.it transparently and egregiously violated the federal rules,and defendants acted in bad faith and with gross negligence in drafting and deploying it they are charged with knowledge of its invalidity.see prosser keeton,at consent likely vitiated where defendants ought to have known in the exercise of reasonable care of the mistake 
that netgate could have objected is immaterial.the subpoena may not have been coercive,but it was deceptive,and that is an independent ground for invalidating consent.see restatement second of torts.it was a piece of paper masquerading as legal process.netgate produced the sample in response and doubtless would not have done so had it known the subpoena was in light of its own legal obligation not to disclose such messages to third parties,see a.that netgate could have objected proves disclosure was not an inevitable consequence,but it was still a foreseeable one and the intended one.
allowing consent procured by known mistake to serve as a defense would seriously impair the statute operation.a hacker could use someone else password to break into a mail server and then claim the server authorized his access.congress surely did not intend to exempt such,they seem the paradigm of what it sought to prohibit.morris,at access gained by guessing someone else password is not authorization under the computer fraud and abuse act.
the subpoena power is a substantial delegation of authority to private parties,and those who invoke it have a grave responsibility to ensure it is not abused.informing the person served of his right to object is a good start,see.a d,but it is no substitute for the exercise of independent judgment about the subpoena reasonableness.fighting a subpoena in court is not cheap,and many may be cowed into compliance with even overbroad subpoenas,especially if they are not represented by counsel or have no personal interest at stake.because defendants procured consent by exploiting a mistake of which they had constructive knowledge,the district court erred by dismissing based on that consent.
defendants ask us to affirm on the alternative ground that the messages they accessed were not in electronic storage and therefore fell outside the stored communications act coverage.see a.the act defines electronic storage as a any temporary,intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof and b any storage of such communication by an electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection of such communication.id,incorporated by id.several courts have held that subsection a covers messages stored on an isp server pending delivery to the recipient.see in re doubleclick.privacy,d,fraser nationwide mut.ins,d,steve jackson games,secret,cir messages stored on a bbs pending delivery.because subsection a applies only to messages in temporary,intermediate storage,however,these courts have limited that subsection coverage to messages not yet delivered to their intended recipient.see doubleclick,d at fraser,d at.
defendants point to these cases and argue that messages remaining on an isp server after delivery no longer fall within the act coverage.but,even if such messages are not within the purview of subsection a,they do fit comfortably within subsection b.there is no dispute that messages remaining on netgate server after delivery are stored by an electronic communication service within the meaning of b.doubleclick,d at holding that subsection b did not apply because the communications at issue were not being stored by an electronic communication service.the only issue,then,is whether the messages are stored for purposes of backup protection.b.we think that,within the ordinary meaning of those terms,they are.
an obvious purpose for storing a message on an isp server after delivery is to provide a second copy of the message in the event that the user needs to download it,for example,the message is accidentally erased from the user own computer.the isp copy of the message functions as a backup for the user.notably,nothing in the act requires that the backup protection be for the benefit of the isp rather than the user.storage under these circumstances thus literally falls within the statutory definition 
one district court reached a contrary conclusion,holding that backup protection includes only temporary backup storage pending delivery,and not any form of storage.see fraser,d at.we reject this view as contrary to the plain language of the act.in contrast to subsection a,subsection b does not distinguish between intermediate and storage.indeed,fraser interpretation renders subsection b essentially superfluous,since temporary backup storage pending transmission would already seem to qualify as temporary,intermediate storage within the meaning of subsection a.by its plain terms,subsection b applies to backup storage regardless of whether it is intermediate or.
the united states,as amicus curiae,disputes our interpretation.it first argues that,because subsection b refers to any storage of such communication,it applies only to backup copies of messages that are themselves in temporary,intermediate storage under subsection a.the text of the statute,however,does not support this reading.subsection a identifies a type of communication a wire or electronic communication and a type of storage temporary,intermediate storage incidental to the electronic transmission thereof.the phrase such communication in subsection b does not,as a matter of grammar,reference attributes of the type of storage defined in subsection a.the government argument would be correct if subsection b referred to a communication in such storage,or if subsection a referred to a communication in temporary,intermediate storage rather than temporary,intermediate storage of a communication.however,as the statute is written,such communication is nothing more than shorthand for a wire or electronic communication.
