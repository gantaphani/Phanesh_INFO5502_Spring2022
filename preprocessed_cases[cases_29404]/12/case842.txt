high point sarl high point appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment that equitable estoppel and laches preclude prosecution of this lawsuit.high point to the helped defendants build a communications network through licensed and unlicensed activity for over a decade.high point acquired rights to the and asserted them for the first time against defendants after more than six years of unlicensed activity.we hold that equitable estoppel applies in this instance and high point is barred from bringing this case against defendants.we affirm the district court judgment and decline to address the remaining issue of laches.

past conduct among the parties 
as early as,sprint decided to build a network based on a new technology called code division multiple access cdma.cdma allows a large number of cellphone users to share the same radio frequency by associating each user with a single code.cdma is now standard and used around the world.in september,sprint met with several vendors,including at t,nortel,and motorola,to discuss interoperability standards for its nascent network.
to build the nationwide cdma network,sprint contracted with several vendors to supply equipment for the network.in,sprint executed a supply agreement with nortel for equipment for the cdma infrastructure.in,sprint executed a similar agreement with motorola.in and,at t and later lucent as at t successor agreed to supply sprint with equipment.each of the supply agreements with at t and lucent had a limited license for several patents,including the.the agreements required certain standards and specifications to be met by the vendors so the equipment could be interoperable with other vendors equipment.see.
in,sprint and lucent entered into a memorandum of understanding about the concept of interoperability within sprint cdma network.in that memorandum,lucent represented a desire to work with sprint and other vendors to develop interoperability standards.that same year,lucent entered into a similar licensing arrangement with nortel,which was later to sprint.in,sprint and three of its infrastructure vendors lucent,nortel,and motorola signed another agreement about interoperability.that agreement did not grant sprint,or any of sprint vendors,rights under the,but the agreement manifested each vendor commitment to develop jointly interoperability standards,including an understanding that the equipment should work among and between vendors.avaya succeeded in interest to lucent in,but avaya did not discuss with any of the involved parties the in an infringement context.
at the inception of the sprint network,all sprint zones in the network were covered by a license,either by the license contained in the lucent sprint supply agreement which applied to sprint use of lucent equipment or a that originated from an agreement with lucent and nortel which applied to sprint use of nortel equipment.as the sprint network grew,sprint began to purchase and use unlicensed equipment supplied by several vendors.
in,samsung won a competitive bidding process over lucent,motorola,and nortel to support sprint operations in puerto rico.bidding began around,when lucent was still patentee.it is undisputed that the puerto rican operation involved the installation of unlicensed infrastructure provided by samsung.
in,sprint began upgrading some of the lucent equipment with equipment provided by motorola.motorola was not a party to the lucent sprint licensing agreement.
in,alcatel purchased lucent,naming the subsidiary alcatel lucent usa,alcatel lucent.according to high point,that act terminated any license as to sprint use of lucent equipment.
in,nortel began selling equipment to sprint and others.at that point,nortel was no longer a licensee to the.
the record does not reflect that at any time prior to december,high point,avaya,or lucent raised any infringement concerns.
procedural history 
on december,high point sued defendants in the eastern district of virginia for patent infringement.high point accused defendants of violating the licensing agreements and alleged that the sprint cdma network operated through the combination of licensed and unlicensed equipment to facilitate the transmission of voice call traffic in an infringing manner.in may,the case was transferred to the district of kansas.while the lawsuit was pending,sprint continued to build its network by,among other things,entering into a supply agreement with alcatel lucent under terms similar to those entered into with sprint prior vendors.on february,alcatel lucent intervened as a defendant.
defendants moved for summary judgment on a variety of issues,including laches and equitable estoppel.on december,after reviewing a special master findings and recommendation,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants that laches and equitable estoppel barred the lawsuit.the district court reasoned that,by waiting and not asserting any patent rights,lucent and then avaya placed sprint in detrimental reliance.that silence,while sprint actively engaged in the establishment of the cdma network induced through the sale,purchase,and licensing of equipment for that network,caused sprint economic and evidentiary prejudice.on january,the district court entered final judgment dismissing high point claims.

discussion 
high point asserts that equitable estoppel is an extraordinary remedy that should not apply under these facts.high point contends that a patentee is not obligated to investigate the technical details of its competitor equipment and then match those specifications to its patent portfolio commercial realities dictate that equitable estoppel should not apply when business transactions are complex and varied.
high point further suggests that the district court ignored recent case law that required sprint to demonstrate bad faith through the patentee course of conduct.according to high point,silence alone is not enough when the parties are sophisticated business partners and there is no showing of bad faith.high point asserts that under the licensing agreements,it could not in any event assert infringement until for the motorola equipment after the motorola updates to some of the lucent equipment,for the lucent equipment after alcatel acquired lucent,and for the nortel equipment after the was no longer in effect.
high point urges that we conclude that the district court improperly drew inferences from disputed facts that should have obviated summary judgment.according to high point,the distr
