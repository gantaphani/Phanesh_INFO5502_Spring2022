the united states national security agency nsa appeals from the decision of the district court for the eastern district of michigan that granted summary judgment against the nsa and imposed a permanent injunction.the plaintiffs are a collection of associations and individuals led by the american civil liberties union,and they.because we can not find that any of the plaintiffs have standing for any of their claims,we must vacate the district court order and remand for dismissal of the entire action.
sometime after the september,terrorist attacks,president bush authorized the nsa to begin a operation that has come to be known as the terrorist surveillance program tsp.although the specifics remain undisclosed,it has been publicly acknowledged that the tsp includes the interception,wiretapping,without warrants,of telephone and email communications where one party to the communication is located outside the united states and the nsa has a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al qaeda,affiliated with al qaeda,or a member of an organization affiliated with al qaeda,or working in support of al qaeda.see press briefing by att y alberto gonzales and michael hayden,principal deputy dir.for intelligence,available at last visited july,
the plaintiffs in this action include journalists,academics,and lawyers who regularly communicate with individuals located overseas,who the plaintiffs believe are the types of people the nsa suspects of being al qaeda terrorists,affiliates,or supporters,and are therefore likely to be monitored under the tsp.from this suspicion,and the limited factual foundation in this case,the plaintiffs allege that they have a well founded belief that their communications are being tapped.according to the plaintiffs,the nsa operation of the the possibility of warrantless them to conditions that constitute an irreparable harm.
the plaintiffs filed suit in the eastern district of michigan,seeking a permanent injunction against the nsa continuation of the tsp and a declaration that two particular aspects of the wiretapping and data the first and fourth amendments,the separation of powers doctrine,the administrative procedures act apa,title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act title iii,and the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa.both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court dismissed the data mining aspect of the plaintiffs claim,but granted judgment to the plaintiffs regarding the warrantless wiretapping.see aclu nsa,d.
the nsa had invoked the state secrets doctrine to bar the discovery or admission of evidence that would expose confidential matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.see united states reynolds.the nsa argued that,without the privileged information,none of the named plaintiffs could establish standing.the district court applied the state secrets privilege,but rejected the nsa argument,holding instead that three publicly acknowledged facts about the tsp it eavesdrops,without warrants,on international telephone and email communications in which at least one of the parties is a suspected al qaeda sufficient to establish standing moreover,the district court found these three facts sufficient to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the merits of their claims,resulting in a declaratory judgment and the imposition of an injunction.these three facts constitute all the evidence in the record relating to the nsa conduct under the tsp.
in deciding the merits,the district court construed the fourth amendment as an absolute rule that requires prior warrants for any reasonable search,aclu nsa,d at,and announced that searches conducted without prior approval by a judge or magistrate were per se unreasonable,id.at.having found that the nsa was operating without warrants,the district court concluded without further explanation that president bush had undisputedly violated the fourth amendment and accordingly ha d violated the first amendment rights of these plaintiffs as well.id.at.proceeding from this conclusion,the court deemed the tsp unconstitutional and issued an order enjoining its further operation entirely 
it is hereby ordered that defendants,nsa,its agents,employees,representatives,and any other persons or entities in active concert or participation with defendants,are permanently enjoined from directly or indirectly utilizing the terrorist surveillance program hereinafter tsp in any way,including,but not limited to,conducting warrantless wiretaps of telephone and internet communications,in contravention of the foreign intelligence surveillance act hereinafter fisa and title iii 
it is further ordered and declared that the tsp violates the separation of powers doctrine,the administrative procedures act,the first and fourth amendments to the united states constitution,the fisa and title iii.
aclu nsa.dist.court,judgment and permanent injunction order.the nsa moved for a stay of the injunction pending appeal,which the district court denied.meanwhile,the nsa appealed,arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the state secrets doctrine prevented adjudication on the merits.this court stayed the injunction pending the outcome of this appeal.see aclu nsa,cir

standing is an aspect of justiciability,warth seldin,d,and a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press,daimlerchrysler cuno,d accord lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians.gaming control,cir requiring proof of standing for each individual claim.t he standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.allen wright,d emphasis added.
the particular plaintiffs to this action are a diverse group of associations and individuals,and it would require a rigorous undertaking to assure that each has standing to litigate.however,for purposes of the asserted declaratory not necessarily for the requested injunction it is only necessary that one plaintiff has standing.see bowsher synar,d deciding a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute because at least one plaintiff had standing the injunction in this case is predicated on the declaratory judgment,a determination that the nsa conduct is unlawful,so it follows that if the plaintiffs lack standing to litigate their declaratory judgment claim,they must also lack standing to pursue an injunction.the question is whether any plaintiff has standing to litigate the declaratory judgment claim.
as for the particular claims,the plaintiffs have asserted six separate claims or causes of constitutional first amendment,fourth amendment,and separation of powers and three statutory apa,title iii,and fisa and the plaintiffs must establish that at least one plaintiff has standing for each.see bowsher,at.cuno.at.because a cause of action is intertwined with an injury,the injuries being alleged must be described as precisely and unambiguously as possible.a particularized analysis is therefore necessary.
the conduct giving rise to the alleged injuries is undisputed the nsa eavesdrops,without warrants,on international telephone and email communications in which at least one of the parties is reasonably suspected of al qaeda ties.the plaintiffs objection to this conduct is also undisputed,and they demand that the nsa discontinue it.the plaintiffs do not could the mere practice of wiretapping,eavesdropping is,by itself,unconstitutional,illegal,or even improper.rather,the plaintiffs object to the nsa eavesdropping without warrants,specifically fisa warrants with their associated limitations and minimization requirements.see.according to the plaintiffs,it is the absence of these warrants that renders the nsa conduct illegal and unconstitutional.but the plaintiffs do because of the state secrets doctrine any evidence that any of their own communications have ever been intercepted by the nsa,under the tsp,or without warrants.instead,they assert a mere belief,which they contend is reasonable and which they label a well founded belief,that their overseas contacts are the types of people targeted by the nsa the plaintiffs are consequently subjected to the nsa eavesdropping the eavesdropping leads the nsa to discover and possibly disclose private or privileged information and the mere possibility of such discovery or disclosure has injured them in three particular ways.
notably,the plaintiffs do not allege as injury that they personally,either as individuals or associations,anticipate or fear any form of direct reprisal by the government,the nsa,the justice department,the department of homeland security,such as criminal prosecution,deportation,administrative inquiry,civil litigation,or even public exposure.the injuries that these plaintiffs allege are not so direct they are more amorphous and necessitate a pointed description.
the plaintiffs primary alleged first of their inability to communicate with their overseas contacts by telephone or email due to their ethical obligations under this claim,the immediate injury results directly from the plaintiffs own actions and decisions,based on their subjective belief that the nsa might be intercepting their communications,and the ethical requirements governing such circumstances,as dictated by their respective professional organizations or affiliations.relying on the district court three facts,the plaintiffs allege their well founded belief that the nsa is intercepting their communications with overseas contacts,to the perceived detriment of those overseas contacts.the plaintiffs explain that they have an ethical duty to keep their communications confidential,which,under the circumstances,requires that they refrain from communicating with the overseas contacts by telephone or email,lest they violate that duty the possibility that private communications may be revealed burdens the plaintiffs pursuit of their chosen professions or organizational,in order to comply with their ethical duties,the plaintiffs must refrain from communicating by telephone or email,and are instead required either to travel overseas to meet with these contacts in person or else refrain from communicating with them altogether.the injury manifests itself in both a quantifiable way as the added time and expense of traveling overseas and a way as the incomplete or substandard performance of their professional responsibilities and obligations.the plaintiffs alleged this injury in their complaint and again on appeal,even though it went unaddressed by the district court.
the second alleged the only one expressly addressed by the district the chilling effect on the overseas contacts willingness to communicate with the plaintiffs by telephone or email.under this claim,the immediate injury results directly from the actions of the overseas contacts who,the plaintiffs contend,fear that the nsa discovery of otherwise private or privileged information being communicated by telephone or email will lead to some direct reprisal by the united states government,their own governments,or others.this fear causes the overseas contacts to refuse to communicate with the plaintiffs by telephone or email,and this refusal to communicate burdens the plaintiffs in the performance of their jobs or other lawful objectives,because,in order to pursue their chosen professions or organizational objectives,the plaintiffs must travel overseas to meet with these contacts in person.this injury manifests itself as both an added expense and an added burden.
the plaintiffs third alleged injury is the nsa violation of their legitimate expectation of privacy in their overseas telephone and email communications.under this claim,the immediate injury comes directly from the actions of the nsa.the plaintiffs assert that the fourth amendment,title iii,and fisa limit the occasions and circumstances in which,and the manner by which,the government can lawfully intercept overseas electronic communications,giving rise to a legitimate expectation that their overseas communications will be intercepted only in accordance with these limits.the plaintiffs conclude that,because the nsa has conducted foreign electronic surveillance without obtaining fisa warrants and presumably,without strict adherence to fisa minimization requirements,the nsa has breached their legitimate expectation of privacy,thereby causing them injury.the plaintiffs alleged a violation of their privacy rights in their complaint,but the district court did not mention it and they have not pressed it on appeal 
this third kind of injury,unlike the other two,is direct and personal under this theory,the nsa has directly invaded the plaintiffs interest and proof of such invasion is all that is necessary to establish standing.if,for instance,a plaintiff could demonstrate that her privacy had actually been breached,that her communications had actually been wiretapped,then she would have standing to assert a fourth amendment cause of action for breach of privacy in the present case,the plaintiffs concede that there is no single plaintiff who can show that he or she has actually been wiretapped.moreover,due to the state secrets doctrine,the proof needed either to make or negate such a showing is privileged,and therefore withheld from discovery or disclosure.see tenenbaum simonini,cir upholding dismissal because the defendants can not defend their conduct without revealing the privileged information so the state secrets doctrine thus deprives the d efendants of a valid defense to the plaintiff s claims.this injury is not concrete or imminent under these circumstances,and this opinion focuses on the plaintiffs two other alleged injuries.
one other issue demands attention,namely,that the plaintiffs failure to subject themselves to actual harm does not,by itself,prevent a finding that they have,it does not deprive them of the right to seek declaratory judgment.see a empowering courts to declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.implicit in each of the plaintiffs alleged injuries is the underlying the plaintiffs label a well founded belief and seek to treat as a probability or even a the nsa is presently intercepting,or will eventually intercept,communications to or from one or more of these particular plaintiffs,and that such interception would be detrimental to the plaintiffs clients,sources,or overseas contacts.this is the premise upon which the plaintiffs entire theory is built.but even though the plaintiffs on their superior knowledge of their contacts be reasonable the alternative possibility remains that the nsa might not be intercepting,and might never actually intercept,any communication by any of the plaintiffs named in this lawsuit.
a plaintiff refusal to engage in potentially harmful activities is the typical substance of a declaratory judgment action and does not,by itself,preclude a finding that the plaintiff has standing.see medimmune,genentech,d.but it is important to distinguish the two harms that surround a declaratory judgment action.the anticipated harm that causes one to refrain from the activities may satisfy the element of standing if it is sufficiently imminent and concrete.for reasons that will be made clear in the analysis,the other harm that results from refraining from the potentially harmful another matter.in the present case,the plaintiffs anticipate that the nsa interception of telephone and email communications might be detrimental to their overseas contacts,and this perceived harm causes the plaintiffs to refrain from that communication,potentially harmful activity.because there is no evidence that any plaintiff communications have ever been intercepted,and the state secrets privilege prevents discovery of such evidence,see reynolds,at,there is no proof that interception would be detrimental to the plaintiffs contacts,and the anticipated harm is neither imminent nor is hypothetical,conjectural,or speculative.therefore,this harm can not satisfy the injury in fact requirement of standing.because the plaintiffs can not avoid this shortcoming,they do not propose this harm that causes their refusal to an injury that warrants redress.instead,they propose the injuries that result from their refusal to communicate and those injuries do appear imminent and concrete.
thus,in crafting their declaratory judgment action,the plaintiffs have attempted unsuccessfully to navigate the obstacles to stating a justiciable claim.by refraining from communications,the potentially harmful conduct,the plaintiffs have negated any possibility that the nsa will ever actually intercept their communications and thereby avoided the anticipated is typical of declaratory judgment and perfectly permissible.see medimmune.at.but,by proposing only injuries that result from this refusal to engage in communications,the inability to conduct their professions without added burden and expense,they attempt to supplant an insufficient,speculative injury with an injury that appears sufficiently imminent and concrete,but is only incidental to the alleged wrong,the nsa conduct this is atypical and,as will be discussed,impermissible.
therefore,the injury that would support a declaratory judgment action,the anticipated interception of communications resulting in harm to the contacts is too speculative,and the injury that is imminent and concrete,the burden on professional performance does not support a declaratory judgment action.this general doctrine of explained more fully in the sections of the analysis regarding each,individual cause of action.
by claiming six causes of action,the plaintiffs have actually engaged in a thinly veiled,though perfectly acceptable,ruse.to call a spade a spade,the plaintiffs have only one claim,namely,breach of privacy,based on a purported violation of the fourth amendment or,the plaintiffs do not want the nsa listening to their phone calls or reading their emails.that is really all there is to it.on a straightforward reading,this claim does not implicate the first amendment the problem with asserting only a claim is that,because the plaintiffs can not show that they have been or will be subjected to surveillance personally,they clearly can not establish standing under the fourth amendment or fisa the plaintiffs concede as much in an attempt to avoid this problem,the plaintiffs have recast their injuries as a matter of free speech and association,characterized their claim as a violation of the first amendment,and engaged the first amendment relaxed rules on standing this argument is not novel,but neither is it frivolous it warrants consideration,analysis,and an a full explanation by this court.
at this point,it becomes apparent that my analysis of whether the plaintiffs have standing diverges at a fundamental level from that of the concurring and dissenting opinions.they each employ a single,broad,analysis,with which they attempt to account for all of the plaintiffs alleged injuries,requested remedies,and legal claims.as much as i would prefer that resolution of this question were so simple,i believe the law demands a particularized analysis of the plaintiffs three alleged injuries,six asserted legal claims,and two requested forms of relief.see cuno.at a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.laidlaw,at.a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.therefore,i believe the complexity of this case calls for a far more specific and comprehensive analysis than that offered by my colleagues.
a comprehensive analysis of all six claims in a single opinion,however,invites some overlap of legal doctrine,precedent,and reasoning.such overlap similarly invites ambiguity,confusion,and misapplication.to avoid this pitfall,i define the plaintiffs alleged injuries precisely,confine each cause of action to its own section,and take special care to ensure that i do not improperly carry precedent or legal doctrine from one cause of action to another.the benefit of precision will,i hope,outweigh any annoyance created by strict compartmentalization or redundancy.
the analytical approach to the determination of standing for constitutional claims differs from the approach to statutory claims.see sierra club morton,d.
whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to obtain judicial resolution of that controversy is what has traditionally been referred to as the question of standing to sue.where the party does not rely on any specific statute authorizing invocation of the judicial process,the question of standing depends upon whether the party has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,as to ensure that the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.where,however,congress has authorized public officials to perform certain functions according to law,and has provided by statute for judicial review of those actions under certain circumstances,the inquiry as to standing must begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.
id.quotation marks and citations omitted.the court clarified 
congress may not confer jurisdiction on art.iii federal courts to render advisory opinions,or to entertain friendly suits,or to resolve political questions,because suits of this character are inconsistent with the judicial function under art.iii.but where a dispute is otherwise justiciable,the question whether the litigant is a proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue,is one within the power of congress to determine.

first amendment 
the plaintiffs allege that the nsa has,by conducting the warrantless wiretaps,violated the free speech and free association clauses of the first amendment.the district court assumed that the plaintiffs had engaged in certain protected expression,apparently referring to the telephone and email communications.although the plaintiffs painstaking efforts to keep these communications confidential belies the contention that this case involves expression i nonetheless assume this is a viable first amendment cause of action.standing to litigate this claim requires a showing of three elements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.steel,at.

the supreme court framed the question in laird,at,as whether the jurisdiction of a federal court may be invoked by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his first amendment rights is being chilled by the mere existence,without more,of a governmental investigative and activity.the court held that its plaintiffs,subjects of secret united states army surveillance,may have suffered a subjective chill,but did not allege a sufficiently concrete,actual,and imminent injury to entitle them to standing.id.at.something more was necessary,and in a passage that is peculiarly applicable to the present case,the court explained 
in recent years we have found in a number of cases that constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent,or chilling,effect of governmental regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of first amendment rights.in none of these cases,however,did the chilling effect arise merely from the individual knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or from the individual concomitant fear that,armed with the fruits of those activities,the agency might in the future take some other and additional action detrimental to that individual.rather,in each of these cases,the challenged exercise of governmental power was regulatory,proscriptive,or compulsory in nature,and the complainant was either presently or prospectively subject to the regulations,proscriptions,or compulsions that he was challenging.
id.at.citations omitted emphasis added accord sinclair,at finding surveillance alone insufficient for standing united presb.church reagan,finding no injury in fact because no part of the challenged surveillance imposes or even relates to any direct governmental constraint upon the plaintiffs.
i can not subscribe to a view that the reason the injury in laird was insufficient was because the plaintiffs alleged only chilled speech and that,by something more,the laird court meant more subjective injury or other injuries that derive from the chilled speech.the plaintiffs in laird were political activists and the speech being chilled was political speech.laird,at.in first amendment jurisprudence,political speech is the most valued type of speech.see city of paul,d stevens,concurring our first amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in the constitutional protection of speech.core political speech occupies the highest,most protected position.to say that there could be more injury in other circumstances is to suggest that political speech is not valuable in and of itself and that no consequences flow from the chilling of political speech if such consequences are not easily articulable.certain plaintiffs in the present case contend that the professional injuries that flow from the chilling of their professional speech is enough to satisfy laird requirement of something more.under such reasoning,if the laird plaintiffs had alleged a chilling of some commercial speech,they would have had standing because the lost sales would constitute easily articulable injuries resulting from the chilling,which this something more.this is nonsense,as it would effectively value commercial speech above political speech and protect the former but not the latter.it is also at odds with the remainder of the laird opinion and first amendment doctrine in general.consequently,it is not the value of the speech that determines the injury but the level of restraint,and chilling is not sufficient restraint no matter how valuable the speech.
therefore,to allege a sufficient injury under the first amendment,a plaintiff must establish that he or she is regulated,constrained,or compelled directly by the government actions,instead of by his or her own subjective chill.laird,at.reagan,at.the circuit decision in reagan,at,involved a plaintiff first amendment challenge to alleged government surveillance.the reagan court clarified why mere subjective chill deriving from government surveillance is insufficient to establish a concrete injury,stating 
the harm of chilling effect is to be distinguished from the immediate threat of concrete,harmful action.the former consists of present deterrence of the plaintiff,by the government,from first amendment conduct because of the difficulty that plaintiff has in determining the application of a government practice to that conduct,and will not by itself support standing.
id.chilling effect is cited as the reason why the governmental imposition is invalid under the first amendment rather than as the harm which entitles the plaintiffs to challenge it.id.at.in an attempt to establish harm,the reagan plaintiffs claimed that they were especially likely to be targets of the unlawful surveillance authorized by the order,but the court explained 
even if it were conceded that the plaintiffs were at greater risk than the public at large,that would still fall far short of the genuine threat required to support this theory of standing,as opposed to mere speculative harm.it must be borne in mind that this order does not direct activities against all persons who could conceivably come within its scope,but merely authorizes them.
id.at citations omitted.the reagan court therefore held that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the requirement because they did not allege that any direct governmental constraint was threatened or even contemplated against them.id.the present case is no different.
the plaintiffs here contend that the nsa has inflicted first amendment injury in two ways,both of which prevent them from performing their jobs or pursuing other lawful objectives.the first injury,which went unaddressed by the district court,involves the plaintiffs own unwillingness to communicate with their overseas contacts by telephone or email.the plaintiffs fear that the nsa may intercept their communications,and therefore,their ethical obligations require them to forgo the communications in order to avoid interception.the injurious consequence of the nsa conduct,the plaintiffs contend,is that they must either suffer diminished performance in their jobs for lack of communication,or else bear the cost of traveling overseas to meet with these contacts in person.
even accepting this as a good faith assertion and assuming the factual statements are true,the plaintiffs first injury still involves two purely speculative fears that the nsa will actually intercept the plaintiffs particular communications,and that armed with the fruit of those interceptions,the nsa will take action detrimental to the contacts.if,on the other hand,the plaintiffs could be assured that the nsa would not intercept their communications,or,if interception occurs,that no harm would befall the overseas contacts,then the nsa could continue the tsp wiretapping without harm to the plaintiffs it is not the mere existence of the tsp,but the possibility that the plaintiffs overseas contacts will be subjected to it,that ultimately results in the alleged harm.even assuming these fears are imminent rather than speculative,this is still a tenuous basis for proving a concrete and actual injury.that is,even if it were certain that the nsa would intercept these particular plaintiffs overseas communications,if the overseas contacts were nonetheless willing to communicate with the plaintiffs by telephone or email in spite of the impending interception,then it is doubtful that the plaintiffs journalists,academics,lawyers,or organizations,who have themselves alleged no personal fear of our government or basis for fear of our government,would still be unwilling or unable to communicate.the plaintiffs unwillingness comes not from any anticipated harm to themselves,but from their apprehension for and duty to their overseas contacts 
moreover,even if their allegations are true,the plaintiffs still allege only a subjective apprehension and a personal unwillingness to communicate,which fall squarely within laird,at.in fact,this injury is even less concrete,actual,or immediate than the injury in laird.in laird,the army was conducting massive and comprehensive surveillance of civilians,secretly and apparently without warrants.the laird plaintiffs alleged that the army surveillance program caused a chilling effect on their first amendment rights in that they and others were reluctant to associate or communicate for fear of reprisal,stemming from their fear that the government would discover or had discovered them and their activities by way of the secret surveillance.the harm alleged in the present case is no more substantial the plaintiffs allege a similar chilling effect on their first amendment rights,in that they are bound by professional and ethical obligations to refrain from communicating with their overseas contacts due to their fear that the tsp surveillance will lead to discovery,exposure,and ultimately reprisal against those contacts or others.but unlike the laird plaintiffs,the plaintiffs here do not assert that they personally anticipate or fear any direct reprisal by the united states government,or that the tsp data is being widely circulated or misused.indeed,the district court stated that,to date,no one has been exposed or prosecuted based on information collected under the tsp.aclu nsa,d at.
the plaintiffs attempt to distinguish laird.they first contend that they have alleged a chilling of their own communications,whereas the laird plaintiffs did not.but the laird plaintiffs alleged the same amount or lack of personalized surveillance as the present plaintiffs claim,and both alleged a chilling of their own communications.even if this distinction were accurate,it would not alter laird holding that federal courts lack jurisdiction over cases in which the plaintiff alleges that the exercise of his first amendment rights is being chilled by the mere existence,without more,of a governmental investigative and activity.laird,at.the plaintiffs next argue that they have alleged a present injury,namely,an inability to engage in the communication necessary to perform their professional duties,whereas the plaintiffs in laird alleged only a speculative future harm.but the injury alleged here is just as attenuated as the future harm in laird the present injury derives solely from the fear of secret government surveillance,not from some other form of direct government regulation,prescription,or compulsion.id.at.finally,the plaintiffs argue that the laird plaintiffs reactions to the surveillance were unreasonable because there was no illegal conduct alleged in that case.laird,however,did not discuss the reasonableness of its plaintiffs response it held that the mere subjective chill arising from the government investigative or insufficient to establish first amendment standing.id.at.see also reagan,at rejecting an identical attempt to distinguish laird.i find these attempts to distinguish laird unpersuasive.
the plaintiffs have directed us to several other decisions as support for their assertion that their professional injuries constitute something more than subjective chill.see,meese keene,d ozonoff berzak,cir paton laprade,cir.i reiterate that the something more required by laird is not merely more subjective injury,but is the exercise of governmental power that is regulatory,proscriptive,or compulsory in nature,and that directly regulates,proscribes,or compels the plaintiffs.and these three cases involve plaintiffs who can show direct injury because the government did directly regulate,order,or constrain them.these cases certainly do not help the present plaintiffs,who are not subject to any direct government regulation,order,or constraint.rather,to the extent the plaintiffs claim that they are prevented,required,compelled,or coerced in their actions,it is due not to any direct and immediate order or regulation by the government,but to circumstances stemming from the plaintiffs own subjective apprehension that their communications will be intercepted by the nsa and that interception will be detrimental to their overseas contacts.this is not a concrete,actual,and imminent injury for purposes of establishing standing.see laird,at.reagan,at.
in meese keene,at,the plaintiff,keene,a lawyer and a member of the state legislature,wanted to exhibit certain films that a federal statute required be labeled as political propaganda.id.at.the court found that the harm to keene personal,political,and professional reputation,that would result from his exhibiting films labeled propaganda,constituted injury in fact.id.at.it is evident from even a cursory reading of the case,however,that keene was subject to a regulatory statute that directly and expressly ordered the labeling of the films in the manner that would cause the harm.id.at.the plaintiffs in the present case are not regulated by the nsa operation of the tsp in any way,nor are they directly ordered to do or refrain from doing anything.meese offers no support for the plaintiffs position.
in ozonoff berzak,at,the plaintiff,ozonoff,sought employment with the world health organization,and the government ordered him to submit to a loyalty investigation as a condition of seeking the job.id.at.the first circuit found that this requirement created a speech and qualification for the who job,which effectively punished ozonoff for joining certain organizations or expressing certain views.the court held that this requirement created a concrete injury,satisfying the element.id.at.in contrast,the nsa operation of the tsp does not directly order or require the plaintiffs to do anything instead,it is the plaintiffs subjective apprehension that the nsa might intercept their communication that compels,coerces,or motivates the plaintiffs to alter their behavior.as with meese,ozonoff offers no support for the plaintiffs position under the present circumstances.
finally,in paton laprade,at,paton challenged the government retention of an fbi file on her alleged involvement with the socialist workers party because the existence of that file endanger ed her future educational and employment opportunities.id.at.the third circuit found a sufficiently concrete future injury deriving from the existence of that file.id.paton was not only subject to government regulation,she knew and could prove that the government had intercepted her specific mail not just mail of a like kind and was maintaining an fbi file on her particular activities not just activities of a like kind.in stark contrast,the plaintiffs in the present case allege only their suspicion and fear,their well founded belief that their contacts are likely targets of the tsp or that their communications are likely to be intercepted.as documented in the present record,the plaintiffs have not demonstrated and can not demonstrate that the nsa is monitoring their particular personal activities.
i find no factual or which to distinguish laird from the first amendment claim raised by the plaintiffs here,and i conclude that laird controls this claim.but let me reemphasize,just to be perfectly clear,that i do not contend that laird controls this entire does not.laird controls the first amendment claim,based on the first type of injury.the plaintiffs first alleged injury,arising from a personal subjective chill,is no more concrete,actual,or imminent than the injury alleged in laird.the injury in laird was insufficient to establish standing for a first amendment cause of action the plaintiffs first injury is less than or,at best,equal to that in laird and the plaintiffs first injury is likewise insufficient to establish standing.
the plaintiffs second injury is the unwillingness of their overseas contacts,clients,witnesses,and sources to communicate by telephone or email,due to their fear that the nsa will intercept the communications.the district court,in its standing analysis,framed the issue this way 
the plaintiffs in this case are not claiming simply that the nsa surveillance has chilled them from making international calls to sources and clients.rather,they claim that defendants surveillance has chilled their sources,clients,and potential witnesses from communicating with them.the alleged effect on plaintiffs is a concrete,actual inability to communicate with witnesses,sources,clients and others without great expense which has significantly crippled plaintiffs,at a minimum,in their ability to report the news and competently and effectively represent their clients.
aclu nsa,d at emphasis added.under this view,the plaintiffs claim that their contacts have been chilled,which prevents them from communicating with these contacts 
in presbyterian church united states,cir,the ninth circuit considered a claim by plaintiff churches that ins agents entered the churches wearing body bugs and surreptitiously recorded church services in violation of the first and fourth amendments.the district court had dismissed the claims for lack of standing,based on the plaintiffs failure to show injury in fact,opining that the protections of the first amendment extend not to corporations but to individuals,because churches do go to heaven.id.at.on appeal,the ninth circuit reversed,finding that the plaintiff churches had pled a sufficient injury 
when congregants are chilled from participating in worship activities and refuse to attend church services because they fear the government is spying on them and taping their every utterance,all as alleged in the complaint,we think a church suffers organizational injury because its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired.
id.at emphasis added.the ninth circuit then distinguished laird 
although laird establishes that a litigant allegation that it has suffered a subjective chill does not necessarily confer article iii standing,laird does not control this case.the churches in this case are not claiming simply that the ins surveillance has chilled them from holding worship services.rather,they claim that the ins surveillance has chilled individual congregants from attending worship services,and that this effect on the congregants has in turn interfered with the churches ability to carry out their ministries.the alleged effect on the churches is not a mere subjective chill on their worship activities it is a concrete,demonstrable decrease in attendance at those worship activities.the injury to the churches is distinct and palpable.laird has no application here.

in one sense,the ninth circuit decision could be read as concluding that the churches suffered injury based on the actions of third parties,individual parishioners a reading that supports the plaintiffs arguments in favor of standing in another sense,however,the ninth circuit decision may be confined to the unique idea of organizational injury a church is,after all,an organization comprising a congregation of parishioners,and these congregants are properly viewed as intrinsic to the church organization,rather than as separate third parties.this reading of presbyterian church would weaken its application to the present context because the overseas clients,contacts,and sources in this case are not affiliated with the plaintiffs in the same intrinsic manner as are parishioners with a church none of the plaintiffs have alleged any organizational injury in the present context 
having acknowledged these alternative interpretations of presbyterian church,it is unnecessary to resolve that issue definitively on this record.injury in fact is but one of the criteria necessary to establish standing,and ultimately,it is not determinative of this case.either of the other two or ultimately defeat the plaintiffs claim of standing,even if the plaintiffs alleged injury is deemed adequate to state an injury in fact.
f ederal plaintiffs must allege some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action before a federal court may assume jurisdiction.simon,at.citations and footnotes omitted emphasis added.in other words,a federal court may act only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,and not injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.id.at.emphasis added.causation depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the action at issue.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.when causation hinges on independent third parties,the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the third parties choices have been or will be made in such a manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury.id.at.
in the present case,the putatively illegal action is the nsa interception of overseas communications without warrants specifically fisa warrants,and the threatened or actual injury is the added cost of communication with the overseas contacts or correspondingly,the diminished performance resulting from the inability to communicate.therefore,to show causation,the plaintiffs must show that,but for the lack of warrants or fisa compliance,they would not incur this added cost.there are two causal pathways based on the two types of alleged injury.in the first the nsa warrantless wiretapping,creates in the plaintiffs a well founded belief that their overseas telephone and email communications are being intercepted,which requires the plaintiffs to refrain from these communications,chills communication,and compels the plaintiffs to travel overseas to meet personally with these contacts in order to satisfy their professional responsibilities,thereby causing the plaintiffs to incur additional costs.in the second the nsa warrantless wiretapping causes the well founded belief,which compels the overseas contacts to refuse to communicate by telephone or email,chills communication,thereby requiring communication,with its associated additional costs.the district court attempted to articulate this relationship all of the plaintiffs contend that the tsp has caused clients,witnesses and sources to discontinue their communications with plaintiffs out of fear that their communications will be intercepted.aclu nsa,d at footnote omitted.from this,the district court theorized plaintiffs would be able to continue using the telephone and email in the execution of their professional responsibilities if the defendants were not undisputedly and admittedly conducting warrantless wiretaps of conversations.id.at.in considering these causal pathways,i question the second step whether the well founded belief is actually founded on the warrantless wiretapping and refute the third step whether the unwillingness to communicate is actually caused by the warrantless character of the wiretaps.
the underpinning of the second step is questionable.the plaintiffs allege that they have a well founded belief that their overseas contacts are likely targets of the nsa and that their conversations are being intercepted.the plaintiffs have no evidence,however,that the nsa has actually intercepted or will actually intercept any of their conversations.no matter what the plaintiffs and others might find reasonable,the evidence establishes only a a probability or these calls might be intercepted,that the information might be disclosed or disseminated,or that this might lead to some harm to the overseas contacts.while this lack of evidence is not,by itself,enough to disprove causation,the absence of this evidence makes the plaintiffs showing of causation less certain and the likelihood of causation more speculative.
the third step is unsupportable.in this step,the plaintiffs allege,and the district court found,that it is the absence of a warrant and all that goes with it that has chilled the plaintiffs and their overseas contacts from communicating by telephone or email.see aclu nsa,d at plaintiffs would be able to continue using the telephone and email in the execution of their professional responsibilities if the defendants were not undisputedly and admittedly conducting warrantless wiretaps of conversations.this allegation does not stand up under scrutiny,however,and it is not clear whether the chill can fairly be traced to the absence of a warrant,or if the chill would still exist without regard to the presence or absence of a warrant.the insufficiency of this step leads to a breakdown in the causal pathway.see simon,at.laird,at.not only have respondents left somewhat unclear the precise connection between the mere existence of the challenged system and their own alleged chill,but they have also cast considerable doubt on whether they themselves are in fact suffering from any such chill.
a wiretap is always secret that is its very because of this secrecy,neither the plaintiffs nor their overseas contacts would know,with or without a warrant,whether their communications were being tapped.therefore,the nsa secret possession of a warrant would have no more effect on the subjective willingness or unwillingness of these parties to freely engage in conversations and correspond via email,see aclu nsa,d at,than would the secret absence of that warrant.the plaintiffs have neither asserted nor proven any basis upon which to justifiably conclude that the mere absence of a than some other reason,such as the prosecution of the war on terror,in general,or the nsa targeting of communications involving suspected al qaeda terrorists,affiliates,and supporters,in the cause of the plaintiffs and their overseas contacts reluctance to communicate by telephone or email.
the plaintiffs have argued that if the nsa were to conduct its surveillance in compliance with fisa,they would no longer feel compelled to cease their international telephone and email communications but again,even if the nsa had secretly obtained fisa warrants for each of the overseas contacts,who the plaintiffs themselves assert are likely to be monitored,the plaintiffs would still not have known their communications were being intercepted,still faced the same fear of harm to their contacts,still incurred the same or burden on communications and,therefore,still suffered the same alleged injury.the plaintiffs theory relies on their contention that their ethical obligations require them to cease telephone or email communications any time they believe the private or privileged information in those communications might be discovered or disclosed to the detriment of their clients,sources,or contacts.assuming that this contention is true,it must also be true that this ethical obligation would arise whenever,and continue so long as,the plaintiffs believe their contacts to be the types of people likely to be monitored by the nsa.
the imposition of fisa requirements into this scenario would not change the likelihood that these overseas contacts are the types of people who the plaintiffs believe would be monitored.nor would it change the plaintiffs well founded belief that the nsa is intercepting their communications with these individuals,the plaintiffs ethical obligations,or the overseas contacts subjective fears.even under the plaintiffs depiction,it would merely assure the plaintiffs and their contacts their international telephone and email communications with al qaeda affiliates are still just as likely to be nsa will obtain fisa court orders,which will presumably limit the duration and content of the acquisition and the use and dissemination of the acquired information.the plaintiffs,however,have not asserted,explained,or proven how a change in the duration or content of the nsa hypothetical changes that are unknown and unknowable based on the established record and the state secrets alleviate their fears.specifically,the plaintiffs have not proffered any types or topics of communication,from which they are currently refraining,but about the imposition of fisa limitations and would thereafter freely engage in conversations and correspond ence via email.see aclu nsa,d at.
some plaintiffs especially those who are lawyers assert that the imposition of fisa limit the use and dissemination of the information relieve their fears sufficiently to satisfy their ethical obligations because it would ensure that those communications would remain confidential and privileged in the event of a subsequent criminal prosecution,removal proceeding,military tribunal.therefore,they argue,imposition of fisa requirements would alter the type and content of their communications.this theory,however,is predicated on the assumption that their current fears and apprehensions are there is no support for this assumption.first,there is no evidence in the current record from which to presume that the information collected by the nsa via warrantless wiretapping will be used or disclosed for any purpose other than national security.next,there is no evidence in the record from which to presume that the nsa is not complying with,or even exceeding,fisa restrictions on the acquisition,retention,use,or disclosure of this information,fisa minimization techniques.finally,there is no basis to presume that traditional remedies,such as the exclusionary rule or fisa civil suit provision,would not adequately deter the use or dissemination of this information.consequently,this disconnect in the plaintiffs theory is unavoidable,and the plaintiffs injury is not fairly traceable to the mere absence of fisa compliance.
under the plaintiffs second form of injury,the refusal by the overseas contacts to communicate by telephone or email,this third step in the causal pathway is further disrupted by the independent decisions of the overseas contacts.in simon,the supreme court held that,due to the independence of actors,its plaintiffs could not prove a causal connection between the defendant misconduct and the alleged injury 
the complaint here alleged only that the government,by the adoption of revenue ruling,had encouraged the hospitals to deny services to the indigent plaintiffs but,it is purely speculative whether the denials of service,the alleged harm specified in the complaint fairly can be traced to the government encouragement or instead result from decisions made by the hospitals without regard to the tax implications,government conduct.
simon,at.in the present case,as in simon,it is possible that the overseas contacts refusal to communicate with the plaintiffs has no relation to the putatively illegal government action of wiretapping without fisa compliance.the mere fact that the united states government is aggressively prosecuting a worldwide war on which,by the plaintiffs own well founded belief,these contacts are likely appear sufficient to chill these overseas contacts regardless of the absence of fisa protections.notably,the record contains no testimony,by affidavit or otherwise,from any of the overseas contacts themselves as to the cause of their refusal to communicate it contains only the plaintiffs assertions and affidavits.
the plaintiffs have not shown a sufficient causal connection between the conduct,the absence of a warrant or fisa protection and the alleged harm,the inability to communicate.this inadequacy is further exemplified in the analysis of redressability.
redressability 
relief that does not remedy the injury suffered can not bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court that is the very essence of the redressability requirement.steel,at.redressability thus requires that prospective relief will remove the harm,warth,at,and the plaintiff must show that he personally would benefit in a tangible way from the court intervention,id.at.footnote omitted.in the prototypical redressability case,linda richard,d,a single mother sought to compel the state to enforce a criminal statute against the father of her illegitimate child and imprison him for his failure to pay child support.the supreme court acknowledged that the mother had no doubt suffered an injury stemming from the failure of her child father to contribute support payments.id.at.the court reasoned,however,that even if she were granted the requested relief,it would result only in the jailing of the child father,and not remedy the harm caused by his failure to pay child support.id.the court thus held that the direct relationship between the alleged injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated,which is a prerequisite of standing,was absent in that case.id.
in the present case,the plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment and an injunction.they theorize that their injury,deficient professional performance or the additional cost of communication will be redressed by a declaration that the nsa practice of warrantless wiretapping is unlawful,because it naturally follows that the unlawful conduct will be prohibited.the declaratory judgment thus forms the basis for an injunction prohibiting interception of communications without fisa compliance.the district court agreed,declaring the nsa conduct illegal and imposing an injunction,on the belief that its injunction would redress the plaintiffs injury by assuring them that they could freely engage in conversations and correspond via email without concern,at least without notice,that such communications were being monitored.aclu nsa,d at.this theory of redressability rests on the premise that the nsa compliance with fisa warrant requirements will entice the plaintiffs and their contacts to freely engage in conversations and correspond via email without concern.the likelihood of this outcome,however,can,at best,be termed only speculative,see linda,at.it is just as likely if not more likely that,even with the imposition of a warrant requirement,the plaintiffs current situation will not fears will not be abated.
the tsp is designed and operated for the prevention of terrorism,and the nsa is interested only in telephone and email communications in which one party to the communication is located outside the united states and the nsa has a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al qaeda,affiliated with al qaeda,or a member of an organization affiliated with al qaeda,or working in support of al qaeda.it is reasonable to assume that the fisa court would authorize the interception of this type of communication,see,and keeping this likelihood in mind,the issuance of fisa warrants would not relieve any of the plaintiffs fears of being overheard it would relieve them only of the fear that the information might be disseminated or used against them.see a b a h minimization requirements recall,however,that the nsa has not disclosed or disseminated any of the information obtained via this warrantless wiretapping.this remedy would therefore not alter the plaintiffs current situation and,accordingly,would not redress the injuries alleged.
neither will the requested injunctive relief increase the likelihood that the plaintiffs and their overseas contacts will resume telephone or email communications.as discussed previously,warrantless and secret are unrelated things.all wiretaps are secret,and the plaintiffs are not challenging the secret nature,but only the warrantless nature,of the tsp.because all wiretaps are secret,neither the plaintiffs nor their overseas contacts would or without their communications were being tapped,and the secret possession of a warrant would have no more effect on the subjective willingness or unwillingness of these parties to freely engage in conversations and correspond via email than would the secret absence of that warrant.thus,as a practical matter,the mere issuance of a warrant would not alleviate either the plaintiffs or the contacts fears of interception,and consequently,would not redress the alleged injury.even if the wiretaps were not is,if the overseas contacts and the plaintiffs were actually notified beforehand that the nsa was tapping their knowledge would not redress the alleged injury.it is patently unreasonable to think that those who are reluctant to speak when they suspect the nsa of listening would be willing to speak once they know the nsa is listening.
the district court injunction is also insufficient to relieve the plaintiffs fear of reprisal against their contacts.a warrant requirement will not protect the overseas contacts from prosecution in all circumstances,see in re sealed case,which leaves some doubt whether this will allay their fears enough to entice them to resume unreserved communications with the plaintiffs.ironically,the absence of a warrant would be more likely to prohibit the government from using the intercepted information in a subsequent prosecution,due to the probability that the exclusionary rule would bar the admission of information obtained without a warrant.see mapp ohio,d.the warrant requirement does many things it does not,however,remedy the injuries alleged by the plaintiffs in this case.
similarly,to the extent the plaintiffs or their contacts fear some misconduct by the nsa in the discovery,disclosure,or dissemination of the information,the mere requirement of a warrant,fisa or otherwise,will not guarantee the prevention of that misconduct,and therefore fails to satisfy the redressability element.in leeke timmerman,d,federal prison inmates,who had filed criminal charges against prison guards for a beating that occurred during a prison uprising,filed suit in federal court to facilitate the issuance of arrest warrants for the guards.on review,the supreme court found that the issuance of an arrest warrant is simply a prelude to actual prosecution,because the decision to prosecute is solely within the discretion of the prosecutor and issuance of the arrest warrant in this case would not necessarily lead to a subsequent prosecution.id.at.the court held that the inmates lacked standing because there was no guarantee that issuance of the arrest warrant s would remedy claimed past misconduct of guards or prevent future misconduct.id.at.any such guarantee,that the issuance of a fisa warrant will prevent future fisa misconduct is similarly lacking in the present case.
consequently,the district court declaration against warrantless wiretaps is insufficient to redress the plaintiffs alleged injury because the plaintiffs burden on communications would survive the issuance of fisa warrants.the only way to redress the injury would be to enjoin all wiretaps,even those for which warrants are issued and for which full prior notice is given to the parties being tapped.only then would the plaintiffs be relieved of their fear that their contacts are likely under surveillance,the contacts be relieved of their fear of surveillance,and the parties be able to freely engage in conversations and correspond via email without concern.because such a broad remedy is unavailable,the plaintiffs requested relief,which is much narrower,would not redress their alleged injury.
for the foregoing reasons,the plaintiffs in the present action have no standing to pursue their first amendment claim.even if they could demonstrate injury,they can not establish causation,and their alleged injury is not redressable by the remedy they seek.
fourth amendment 
the plaintiffs allege that the nsa has,by conducting the warrantless wiretaps,violated the plaintiffs privacy rights guaranteed by the fourth amendment.the district a heretofore unprecedented,absolute rule that the fourth amendment requires prior warrants for any reasonable search,aclu nsa,d at and granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on this theory,id.at.
however,the supreme court has made clear that fourth amendment rights are personal rights which,unlike first amendment rights,may not be asserted vicariously.see rakas illinois,d.the court explained in rakas 
under petitioners target theory,a court could determine that a defendant had standing without having to inquire into the substantive question of whether the challenged search or seizure violated the fourth amendment rights of that particular defendant.however,having rejected petitioners target theory and reaffirmed the principle that the rights assured by the fourth amendment are personal rights,which may be enforced only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure,the question necessarily arises whether it serves any useful analytical purpose to consider this principle a matter of standing,distinct from the merits of a defendant fourth amendment claim rigorous application of the principle that the rights secured by this amendment are personal,in place of a notion of standing,will produce no additional situations in which evidence must be excluded.the inquiry under either approach is the same.but we think the better analysis focuses on the extent of a particular defendant rights under the fourth amendment,rather than on any theoretically separate,but invariably intertwined concept of standing.
id.at.quotation marks,citations,footnotes,and edits omitted emphasis added see also ellsberg mitchell,an essential element of each plaintiff case is proof that he himself has been injured.membership in a group of people,one or more members of which were exposed to surveillance,is insufficient to satisfy that requirement.
the plaintiffs do not,and can not assert that any of their own communications have ever been intercepted.instead,they allege only a belief that their communications are being intercepted,based on their own assessment of their overseas contacts as people who are likely to fall within the nsa broad,public description of its targets.as acknowledged by plaintiffs counsel at oral argument,it would be unprecedented for this court to find standing for plaintiffs to litigate a fourth amendment cause of action without any evidence that the plaintiffs themselves have been subjected to an illegal search or seizure.see rakas,at.
separation of powers 
the plaintiffs allege that the nsa has,by conducting the warrantless wiretaps,violat ed the principle of the separation of powers because the nsa conduct was authorized by president bush in excess of his executive authority under article ii of the united states constitution and is contrary to limits imposed by congress.this president bush exceeded his presidential authority under the constitution,and violated a statutory limit imposed upon that authority by that the constitution gives congress the authority to impose limits on the president powers under the present circumstances.the district court agreed with the plaintiffs allegation in toto,and declared the nsa conduct a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.see aclu nsa,d at.
a plaintiff asserting a claim under the separation of powers doctrine must,like all other plaintiffs seeking to bring a claim in federal court,demonstrate injury in fact,causation,and redressability.ins chadha,d requiring an injury in fact and a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prevent or redress the claimed injury see also buckley valeo,d stating that litigants with sufficient concrete interests at stake may have standing to raise constitutional questions of separation of powers.here,the plaintiffs contend that the executive branch,the nsa at the direction of the president has,by instituting the tsp practice of warrantless wiretapping,acted in excess of its constitutional or statutory limitations,thereby encroaching upon the powers expressly reserved to another branch,congress.the nsa violation of the separation of powers doctrine,the plaintiffs say,has caused them to fear that the nsa might intercept their communications with their overseas contacts,preventing them from performing their jobs or pursuing other lawful objectives without incurring additional burden and expense.
to prove causation,the plaintiffs must connect the alleged violation the putatively illegal action to the burden on the performance of their professional obligations the alleged injury.see simon,at.six steps separate the putatively illegal conduct from the alleged injury the president allegedly exceeded his allotted authority by authorizing the nsa to conduct warrantless wiretapping as part of its enhanced national security,counterterrorism operations and the worldwide war on terror,causing the nsa to institute its practice of warrantless wiretapping under the tsp,causing the plaintiffs well founded belief that the nsa is intercepting their telephone and email communications,causing either the plaintiffs themselves or the overseas contacts to refrain from these communications,causing the plaintiffs either to underperform in their professional capacities or to travel to meet personally with these contacts,causing the additional burden on performance of the plaintiffs professional duties.
this record simply does not permit the kind of particularized analysis that is required to determine causation.ignoring for a moment the first two steps in the analysis,it is clear that the third and fourth are problematic.the plaintiffs have presented no evidence to support their alleged well founded belief that their conversations are being intercepted.the evidence establishes only a a probability or these communications might be intercepted,disclosed,or disseminated.furthermore,the reasonableness of this possibility is indeterminable,due to the limited record before us and the state secrets doctrine.unlike each of the cases in which the supreme court has found standing for a separation of powers claim,the plaintiffs in this case do not,and can not assert that they themselves have actually been subjected to the conduct alleged to violate the separation of powers.see,chadha,at.reviewing whether one house of congress could order the plaintiff deported buckley,at.reviewing whether the federal election commission could make rulings regarding the plaintiff palmore united states,d reviewing whether the plaintiff could be tried before iii courts glidden zdanok,d reviewing whether the plaintiffs cases could be adjudicated by judges designated from iii courts.the supreme court has been clear that the injury must be distinct and palpable,and not abstract or conjectural,so as to avoid generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches and the electoral process.allen,at.citations omitted.
it is also unclear from the record whether the plaintiffs or their contacts refusal to communicate can fairly be traced to the president authorization of an ambiguous warrantless wiretapping program,or if that same refusal would exist regardless of the authorization of the tsp.and any wiretap would be merely one component of or military intelligence surveillance.those such as the present plaintiffs,who choose to communicate with individuals located overseas who are by the plaintiffs own reckoning individuals reasonably suspected to be al qaeda terrorists,affiliates,or supporters,should expect that those communications will be subject to heightened monitoring and surveillance for national security or military purposes.therefore,the plaintiffs have no evidence to support a conclusion that the president authorization of the tsp would have any more effect on the parties respective apprehensions than would the broader circumstances of the war on terror and heightened national security.
because the plaintiffs can not demonstrate that the alleged violation of the separation of powers has caused their injury,they lack standing to litigate their claim.it is therefore not necessary to address redressability,the third element of standing.
finally,i note that the district court stated that,unless it found standing for these plaintiffs,the president action would be insulated from judicial review.this idea,however,is neither novel nor persuasive.the assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue,no one would have standing,is not a reason to find standing.schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d.nevertheless,the district court editorialized that,if it were to deny standing based on the unsubstantiated minor distinctions drawn by defendants,the president actions in warrantless wiretapping,in contravention of fisa,title iii,and the first and fourth amendments,would be immunized from judicial scrutiny.it was never the intent of the framers to give the president such unfettered control aclu nsa,d at.
the supreme court has confronted this suggestion and expressly rejected it,explaining its reasoning at some length 
it can be argued that if respondent is not permitted to litigate this issue,no one can do so.in a very real sense,the absence of any particular individual or class to litigate these claims gives support to the argument that the subject matter is committed to the surveillance of congress,and ultimately to the political process.any other conclusion would mean that the founding fathers intended to set up something in the nature of an athenian democracy or a new england town meeting to oversee the conduct of the national government by means of lawsuits in federal courts.the constitution created a representative government with the representatives directly responsible to their constituents at stated periods of two,four,and six years that the constitution does not afford a judicial remedy does not,of course,completely disable the citizen who is not satisfied with the ground rules established by the congress for reporting expenditures of the executive branch.lack of standing within the narrow confines of art.iii jurisdiction does not impair the right to assert his views in the political forum or at the polls.slow,cumbersome,and unresponsive though the traditional electoral process may be thought at times,our system provides for changing members of the political branches when dissatisfied citizens convince a sufficient number of their fellow electors that elected representatives are delinquent in performing duties committed to them.
united states richardson,d.the court noted in laird there is nothing in our nation history or in this court decided cases,including our holding today,that can properly be seen as giving any indication that actual or threatened injury by reason of unlawful activities of the executive branch would go unnoticed or unremedied.laird,at.
the plaintiffs allege that the president,as an actor in our tripartite system of government,exceeds his constitutional authority by authorizing the nsa to engage in warrantless wiretaps of overseas communications under the tsp.but this court,not unlike the president,has constitutional limits of its own and,despite the important national interests at stake,can not exceed its allotted authority.see steel,at.o ur standing doctrine is rooted in concerns.flast,at.stating that article iii standing limitations confine federal courts to a role consistent with a system of separated powers.it would ill behoove us to exceed our authority in order to condemn the president or congress for exceeding theirs.
statutory claims 
in addition to their three constitutional claims,the plaintiffs present statutory claims under the apa,title iii,and fisa or a combination thereof.the first step is to consider whether any of these statutes authorize review at the behest of the plaintiff s,whether these statutes govern the nsa challenged conduct and provide the plaintiffs a means of judicial review.see sierra club,at.the availability of a statutory claim,however,does not relieve the plaintiffs of the need to establish constitutional standing to litigate that claim.see raines byrd,d it is settled that congress can not erase article iii standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.
this standing analysis includes consideration of both constitutional and prudential principles.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three requirements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.steel,at.the prudential standing doctrine embodies judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.bennett spear,d.because these prudential principles are limits on standing,they do not themselves create jurisdiction they exist only to remove jurisdiction where the article iii standing requirements are otherwise satisfied.a prudential standing principle of particular relevance to statutory causes of action is the test,which limits the exercise of federal jurisdiction where a plaintiffs claim falls outside the zone of interest protected by the law invoked.allen,at.the apa,title iii,and fisa are each addressed separately,followed by consideration of a cause of action which,the plaintiffs theorize,arises from the interaction of title iii and fisa.
administrative procedures act 
the administrative procedures act apa,governs the conduct of federal administrative agencies,which presumably includes the nsa,see b.the apa provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute,shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.emphasis added.the apa authorizes judicial review for a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.emphasis added thus,to bring a cause of action under the apa,the plaintiffs,first and foremost,must complain of agency action.
agency action is defined in the apa as the whole or part of an agency rule,order,license,sanction,relief,or the equivalent or denial thereof,or failure to act.this definition is divided into three parts begin ning with a list of five categories of decisions made or outcomes implemented by an rule,order,license,sanction,or relief.norton utah wilderness alliance,d quotation marks omitted.
all of those categories involve circumscribed,discrete agency actions,as their definitions make clear an agency statement of future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy rule a final disposition in a matter other than rule making order a permit or other form of permission license a prohibition or taking of other compulsory or restrictive action sanction or a grant of money,assistance,license,authority,or recognition of a claim,right,immunity,or taking of other action on the application or petition of,and beneficial to,a person relief.
id.quoting,emphasis added.the second part of the agency action definition the equivalent or denial thereof must be a discrete action or the denial of a discrete action,otherwise it would not be equivalent to the five listed categories.id.and the final part of the failure to act is properly understood as a failure to take an agency action.id.under supreme court precedent,classic examples of agency action include the issuance of an agency opinion,see bennett,at,or a declaratory ruling,see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.
here,however,the plaintiffs are not complaining of agency action as defined in the apa,and the record contains no evidence that would support such a finding.the plaintiffs challenge the nsa warrantless interception of overseas communications,the nsa failure to comply with fisa warrant requirements,and the nsa presumed failure to comply with fisa minimization procedures.this is conduct,not agency action.furthermore,there is no authority to support the invocation of the apa to challenge generalized conduct.
looking at the five categories of enumerated agency action,the nsa surveillance activities,as described by the three facts of record,do not constitute,nor are they conducted pursuant to,any agency rule,order,license,sanction,or relief.although the plaintiffs labeled the nsa surveillance activities as the program,and the district court labeled it the tsp,the nsa wiretapping is actually just general conduct given a label for purposes of abbreviated reference.the plaintiffs do not complain of any nsa rule or order,but merely the generalized practice,far as has been admitted or not formally enacted pursuant to the strictures of the apa,but merely authorized by the president albeit repeatedly,and possibly informally.nor do the plaintiffs challenge any license,sanction,or relief issued by the nsa.
the plaintiffs do not complain of anything equivalent to agency action,which also requires some discrete action by the nsa.see norton,at.the plaintiffs are not challenging any sort of circumscribed,discrete action on the part of the nsa,but are seeking to invalidate or alter the nsa generalized practice of wiretapping certain overseas communications without warrants.see id.at.t he limitation to discrete agency action precludes a broad programmatic attack.similarly,the plaintiffs have not alleged that the nsa failed to perform a discrete agency action.when challenging an agency failure to perform,the apa empowers a court only to compel an agency to perform a ministerial or act.id.the plaintiffs contest the nsa failure to adhere to fisa warrant requirement and minimization procedures.even assuming,arguendo,that the warrant requirement and minimization procedures are discrete agency actions,those procedures are replete with discretionary considerations,see h,thus disqualifying them from this definition of agency action under the apa.
no matter how the plaintiffs claims are characterized,they do not challenge agency action as it is defined in the apa.accordingly,the plaintiffs have not asserted a viable cause of action under the apa 
title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of title iii,generally regulates the government interception of wire,oral,and electronic communications.see united states ojeda rios,d.the first relevant question is whether title iii applies to the type of surveillance conducted by the nsa under the tsp,considering title iii express limitations 
nothing contained in this statute,title iii shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the united states government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications,or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system,utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as defined in section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of,and procedures in this statute,title iii and the foreign intelligence surveillance act of shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance,as defined in section of such act,and the interception of domestic wire,oral,and electronic communications may be conducted.
f.when this statutory language is parsed into its three individual clauses,its limitations become clear.the first clause disclaims title iii applicability that title iii does not apply to the acquisition by the united states government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications.the second clause disclaims title iii applicability that title iii does not govern foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system,utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as defined in fisa.the final clause,which is known as the exclusivity provision,recognizes the respective roles of title iii and fisa,by stating that the procedures in title iii and fisa shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance,as defined in section of fisa and the interception of domestic wire,oral,and electronic communications may be conducted.
the first clause of f stating that title iii does not govern the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications expressly disclaims application of title iii to surveillance activities of the type at issue in the present case.the nsa monitors international communications for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence about terrorist organizations this type of surveillance falls squarely under the disclaimer found in the first clause of f.by its own terms,then,title iii does not apply to the conduct of which the plaintiffs complain united states dist.keith,d finding the conclusion inescapable,as to the version of title iii,that congress only intended to make clear that title iii simply did not legislate with respect to national security surveillances.
because the first clause of f expressly disclaims title iii application to this case,it is unnecessary to construe the second and third clauses.but,it is worth acknowledging that these two clauses raise complex legal issues which can not be resolved on the present record.the second clause explains that title iii does not apply if four factors are all satisfied the defendant is engaged in foreign intelligence activities the defendant is acting in accordance with otherwise applicable federal law the defendant surveillance involves a foreign electronic communications system and the defendant utilizes a means other than electronic surveillance as defined in fisa.these factors raise a host of intricate issues,such as whether the nsa wiretapping actually involves electronic surveillance as defined in fisa,and whether the nsa is acting in accordance with federal law,such as the authorization for use of military force aumf,stat.some of these issues involve sophisticated legal questions or complex factual questions.but,resolving these issues is unnecessary because the first clause of f conclusively disclaims title iii application.
it is likewise unnecessary,at this point,to delve into the numerous issues raised by the third clause,the exclusivity provision.the exclusivity provision differs from the first two clauses of f,in that it does not merely disclaim title iii application.instead,it states that title iii and fisa shall be the exclusive means by which particular types of surveillance may occur,thus prescribing the separate roles of title iii and fisa,rather than the application of title iii alone.the plaintiffs assert a statutory cause of action for the nsa alleged violation of the exclusivity provision,which i address separately in section,infra.it is,therefore,unnecessary to dissect the exclusivity provision at this point in the analysis.
because the first clause of f states that title iii does not apply to the internationally focused surveillance activities challenged in this case,the plaintiffs have not asserted a viable cause of action under title iii.
the foreign intelligence surveillance act of fisa,et the separate and distinct counterpart to title the interception of electronic communications involving foreign intelligence information.see a.fisa is fraught with detailed statutory definitions and is expressly limited,by its own terms,to situations in which the president has authorized electronic surveillance,as defined in f,for the purposes of acquiring foreign intelligence information,as defined in e.
first,the surveillance in question must acquire foreign intelligence information,which includes information that relates to the ability of the united states to protect against international terrorism.e b.in the present case,the nsa intercepts communications in which it has a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al qaeda,affiliated with al qaeda,or a member of an organization affiliated with al qaeda,or working in support of al qaeda.see press briefing by att y alberto gonzales and michael hayden,principal deputy dir.for intelligence,available at last visited july,emphasis added.the proclaimed purpose is to prevent future terrorist attacks,see id.this is a very concentrated,very limited program focused at gaining information about our enemy,and thus the nsa conduct satisfies this statutory requirement.
next,the interception must occur by electronic surveillance.according to the plaintiffs,the government admission that it intercepts telephone and email involve electronic media and are generally considered,in common parlance,forms of electronic tantamount to admitting that the nsa engaged in electronic surveillance for purposes of fisa.this argument fails upon recognition that electronic surveillance has a very particular,detailed meaning under legal definition that requires careful consideration of numerous factors such as the types of communications acquired,the location of the parties to the acquired communications,the location where the acquisition occurred,the location of any surveillance,device,and the reasonableness of the parties expectation of privacy.see f the plaintiffs have not shown,and can not show,that the nsa surveillance activities include the sort of conduct that would satisfy fisa definition of electronic surveillance,and the present record does not demonstrate that the nsa conduct falls within fisa definitions.
finally,even assuming,arguendo,that fisa applies to the nsa warrantless wiretapping,the plaintiffs can not sustain a claim under fisa.fisa civil suit provision permits an aggrieved person to bring a cause of action for a violation of that statute 
an aggrieved person,other than a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,as defined in a or b a,respectively,who has been subjected to an electronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of such person has been disclosed or used in violation of shall have a cause of action against any person who committed such violation and shall be entitled to recover 
a actual damages,but not less than liquidated damages of or per day for each day of violation,whichever is greater 
b punitive damages and 
c reasonable attorney fees and other investigation and litigation costs reasonably incurred.
emphasis added.there are at least three reasons why the plaintiffs can not maintain their claims under fisa statutory authorization.first,the plaintiffs have not alleged,and the record does not contain sufficient facts from which to conclude,that they are aggrieved persons.fisa defines an aggrieved person as a person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other person whose communications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.k.t he term aggrieved person is intended to be coextensive with,but no broader than,those persons who have standing to raise claims under the fourth amendment with respect to electronic surveillance,at,reprinted at.citing alderman united states,d report by the permanent select committee on intelligence,in support of the proposed fisa bill and amendments.the plaintiffs have not shown that they were actually the target of,or subject to,the nsa surveillance the same reason they could not maintain their fourth amendment can not establish that they are aggrieved persons under fisa statutory scheme.second,as previously discussed,the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the nsa wiretapping satisfies the statutory definition of electronic surveillance,which is also required by fisa liability provision.third,fisa does not authorize the declaratory or injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs,but allows only for the recovery of money damages.no matter how these claims are characterized,the plaintiffs have not asserted a viable fisa cause of action.
the exclusivity provision 
the plaintiffs attempt to bring an ambiguous statutory cause of action under title iii and fisa jointly,based on their allegation that the tsp violates the exclusivity provision of f.the exclusivity provision states that title iii and fisa shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance,as defined in section of fisa,and the interception of domestic wire,oral,and electronic communications may be conducted.f.this provision contains two separate and independent,albeit parallel,statements title iii shall be the exclusive means by which the interception of domestic wire,oral,and electronic communications may be conducted,and fisa shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance,as defined in section of fisa may be conducted.this provision does not foreclose the possibility that the government may engage in certain surveillance activities that are outside of the strictures of both title iii and fisa.
the plaintiffs can not assert a viable cause of action under this provision.it is undisputed that the nsa intercepts international,rather than domestic,communications,so,as already explained,title iii does not apply.moreover,because the plaintiffs have not shown,and can not show,that the nsa engages in activities satisfying the statutory definition of electronic surveillance,the plaintiffs can not demonstrate that fisa does apply.consequently,this entire provision is inapplicable to the present circumstances.
the plaintiffs,however,read this provision as stating that title iii and fisa are together the exclusive means by which the nsa can intercept any communication,and that these two statutes collectively govern every interception,if not fisa then title iii,and if not title iii then are no other options.specifically,the plaintiffs contend that the nsa can not lawfully conduct any wiretapping under the tsp or otherwise in a manner that is outside both the title iii and the fisa frameworks the nsa conduct must fall within the governance of one statute or the other.based on this reading,the plaintiffs believe that they need not demonstrate the specific applicability of either is,they need not demonstrate either that the nsa is engaging in electronic surveillance,in order to place it under fisa or that the nsa is engaging in domestic surveillance,in order to place it under title iii.
the plaintiffs theory is premised on the assertion that fisa and title iii,collectively,require warrants for the legal interception of any and all communications,and appears to be that because the nsa has publicly admitted to intercepting certain overseas communications without warrants,one must infer that the nsa has violated one or the other of these two statutes.the consequence of this plaintiffs would have us a violation of f,which is not a violation of either title iii or fisa individually,but instead a violation of the collective application of the two.thus,according to the plaintiffs,the nsa has violated the exclusivity provision of f,and based on this presumed violation,the plaintiffs have standing to bring a cause of action under this statutory provision.
the intended inferential logic of the plaintiffs theory falls apart upon recognition of their faulty premise.as previously explained,electronic surveillance under fisa does not cover all types of foreign surveillance,but instead has a very particular and detailed definition.the plaintiffs point to no provision in fisa,title iii,or any other statute that states that the four definitions electronic surveillance listed in fisa are the only kind of electronic surveillance that could ever be conducted.and the fact that the exclusivity provision is expressly limited to electronic surveillance as defined in section of fisa leaves room to infer that other electronic surveillance is possible.therefore,the plaintiffs can not prove that fisa applies.more importantly,this inability to prove that the interceptions are electronic surveillance does not,as the plaintiffs theorize,lead to an inescapable conclusion that title iii applies.it simply means that fisa does not apply.on the other hand,it is irrefutable under the first clause of f that title iii does not apply to this case because the nsa wiretapping activities are focused on international,rather than domestic,communications.to read this entire statute in the way that the plaintiffs suggest is to create an internal contradiction,which courts are loath to do.rather,the unavailability of the evidence necessary to prove or disprove that the nsa is engaging in electronic surveillance compels a conclusion that the plaintiffs can not demonstrate that either statute applies.
but even assuming,arguendo,that the plaintiffs have posited a proper reading of the exclusivity provision,and that the nsa warrantless wiretapping violates that provision,the fact that a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of that person.cannon of chicago,d.the question of whether a statute implicitly creates a cause of action is basically a matter of statutory construction.transam.mortgage advisors,lewis,d.the ultimate question is one of congressional intent,not one of whether this c ourt thinks that it can improve upon the statutory scheme that congress enacted into law.touche ross redington,d.
the exclusivity provision does not appear to create such an implied cause of action.in cases where a court implies a cause of action,the statute in question at least prohibit s certain conduct or create s federal rights in favor of private parties.id.at.this exclusivity provision,however,does not proscribe conduct as unlawful or confer rights on private parties.moreover,the structure of title statute in which the exclusivity provision is that congress did not intend to create a private cause of action.title iii expressly states that the remedies and sanctions described in this chapter are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of title iii.c.thus,title iii explicitly lists the only available remedies and means of statutory relief.because it is unreasonable to assume that congress implicitly,silently intended to create a third avenue of statutory relief with the exclusivity provision in addition to the express causes of action contained in title iii and fisa themselves,the provision does not provide any basis for a cause of action.
when considering statutory claims,the inquiry as to standing must begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.sierra club,at.the plaintiffs asserted three statutory apa,title iii,and none of these three statutes,individually or collectively,provides an express or implied cause of action that authorizes review of the plaintiffs claims.see id.therefore,the plaintiffs can not establish standing to litigate their statutory claims,and further explanation is unnecessary.the plaintiffs have,however,raised certain other arguments that warrant mention.
additional considerations 
having proceeded methodically through the standing analysis,i address the plaintiffs only remaining arguments,which defy classification under a compartmentalized approach.under the first of these arguments,the plaintiffs rely heavily on the supreme court decision in friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services,d,as support for their allegation of injury in fact.in laidlaw,the court considered whether the plaintiffs had article iii standing to bring a claim under the provision of the clean water act,a.therefore,laidlaw is immediately distinguishable with regard to the constitutional claims.see sierra club,at.noting the difference in the standing analysis,as between constitutional and statutory claims.if laidlaw is to offer the plaintiffs any support at all,it is only with respect to their statutory claims.
laidlaw is a case involving particular statutory claims and environmental injuries,however,and differs significantly from the present context,which involves dramatically different statutory claims and far less palpable alleged injuries.in this sense,it is noteworthy that the laidlaw court explicitly confined its reasoning to environmental cases,stating environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.laidlaw,at.quotation marks omitted emphasis added.because the injuries and claims in laidlaw differ in a significant way from those alleged by the plaintiffs in the present case,laidlaw offers only minimal support for the plaintiffs position.
setting aside the fact that laidlaw is an environmental case involving a particular,claim,the court analysis in laidlaw remains unpersuasive in the present context.the laidlaw court found that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge laidlaw discharge of pollutants into a river because the discharge curtail ed their recreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.id.at.in its standing analysis,the court distinguished city of los angeles lyons,d,which had held that a plaintiff lacked standing to seek an injunction against the enforcement of a police policy because he could not credibly allege that he faced a realistic threat from the policy.the lyons court had noted that t he reasonableness of lyons fear is dependent upon the likelihood of a recurrence of the allegedly unlawful conduct,and his subjective apprehensions that such a recurrence would even take place were not enough to support standing.laidlaw,at.quoting lyons,at.in contrast,the laidlaw court found a concrete,actual injury based on the plaintiffs showing that the defendant unlawful discharge of pollutants into a particular river was ongoing and may reasonably have caused nearby residents to curtail their use of that waterway.the facts of the present case are more analogous to lyons than laidlaw.unlike the plaintiffs in laidlaw,the present plaintiffs have curtailed their communications despite the absence of any evidence that the government has intercepted their particular by analogy to laidlaw,without any evidence that the defendant has polluted their particular river.rather,like the plaintiffs in lyons,the present plaintiffs claim a threat from the government policy and are chilled by their subjective apprehension that the government is intercepting their communications.this conclusion is therefore consistent with the holding and reasoning of laidlaw 
the plaintiffs assertion that numerous other district courts have found standing to challenge the tsp is also unpersuasive.other cases involving situated plaintiffs are typically irrelevant to the issue of standing because standing reflects whether a particular person is a proper party to maintain the action.flast,at.see also raines,at.we have consistently stressed that a plaintiff complaint must establish that he has a personal stake in the alleged dispute,and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him.in any event,the existing district court decisions regarding this tsp reveal a wholly different picture from that presented by the plaintiffs.neither of the two district courts to address claims against the nsa operation of the tsp found that their plaintiffs had standing.in islamic foundation,bush,d,unlike the present case,the plaintiffs purported to have evidence proving that their own communications had actually been intercepted.based in part on that evidence,the district court found that the plaintiffs should have an opportunity to establish standing and make a prima facie case,even if they must do so in camera.id.the court did not,however,definitively decide the standing issue at that stage of its proceeding.in tooley bush,dist.lexis,wl,at,the district court found that the plaintiff lacked standing because he did not provide any factual basis for his conclusion that he ha d been the subject of illegal wiretaps.two other cases challenged a telecommunications provider rather than the nsa participation in the tsp.in terkel v.at t,d,the district court found that the plaintiffs were unable to establish standing against at t because they could not show that at t had disclosed their records to the government.in hepting v.at t,d,the district court found that the plaintiffs had standing against at t,but refused to consider the government actions in its standing inquiry.consequently,these cases provide no support for the plaintiffs position in the present case.
based on the evidence in the record,as applied in the foregoing analysis,none of the plaintiffs in the present case is able to establish standing for any of the asserted claims.at oral argument,we asked the plaintiffs counsel if we should remand for further proceedings on the issue of standing.counsel asserted that the plaintiffs injuries were clear and undisputed in the record and there was no need to remand for a hearing or admission of additional evidence on this issue.but even to the extent that additional evidence may exist,which might establish standing for one or more of the plaintiffs on one or more of their claims,discovery of such evidence would,under the circumstances of this case,be prevented by the state secrets doctrine.see,reynolds,at.tenenbaum,at halkin helms.
the district court dismissed the data mining aspect of the plaintiffs claim,finding that the plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case without resorting to privileged information.aclu nsa,d at.the plaintiffs press this issue as a.
a thorough review of the complaint,the district court opinion,and the arguments presented on appeal,makes it clear that the plaintiffs allege no separate injury in connection with the alleged aspect of the tsp.therefore,this standing analysis applies equally,and the plaintiffs must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.see steel,at.
we hold that the plaintiffs do not have standing to assert their claims in federal court.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court and remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
the disposition of all of the plaintiffs claims depends upon the single fact that the plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence that they are personally subject to the tsp.without this evidence,on a motion for summary judgment,the plaintiffs can not establish standing for any of their claims,constitutional or statutory for this reason,i do not reach the myriad other standing and merits issues,the complexity of which is ably demonstrated by judge batchelder and judge gilman very thoughtful opinions,and i therefore concur in the judgment only.
the case or controversy requirement in article iii of the constitution determines the power of the federal courts to entertain a suit,establishing an irreducible constitutional minimum of standing that is required for both constitutional and statutory claims.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d warth seldin,d littleton,d.the constitution requires the party who invokes the court authority to show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d quotation marks omitted emphasis added.this personal injury must be an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual and imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.defenders of wildlife,at.citations and quotation marks omitted see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d noting that the relevant showing is the injury to the plaintiff,not the environment.in order for a plaintiff to show that the injury from a government policy is actual and imminent,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he personally would be subject to the future application of that policy.city of los angeles lyons,d see laidlaw,at.davis scherer,d.a plaintiff fear that he will be subject to the policy is insufficient i t is the reality of the threat of repeated injury that is relevant to the standing inquiry,not the plaintiff subjective apprehensions.lyons,at.see laidlaw,at.
judge gilman opinion arrives at the opposite conclusion,relying exclusively on its reading of laidlaw.it concludes that the need not show that they have ever been or will ever be actual subjects of surveillance but rather only the reasonableness of their fear that they will be subjects of surveillance.gilman.in doing so,judge gilman transforms the holding in laidlaw,under which the plaintiffs who were in fact subject to defendant conduct had standing because they reasonably feared harm from that conduct,into a much broader proposition,under which plaintiffs may establish standing by showing merely that they possess a reasonable fear of being subject to defendant allegedly harmful conduct.this distinction is critical to t he relevant showing for purposes of article iii standing,injury to the plaintiff,laidlaw,at,as the supreme court made clear in distinguishing laidlaw from lyons.in laidlaw,the court noted that in lyons,a policy of chokehold use existed,but the plaintiff subjective apprehensions that such a recurrence of the unlawful conduct would even take place were not enough to support standing.laidlaw,at.the plaintiff fear of being subject to conduct of the defendant under the chokehold policy was insufficient to support standing.the supreme court further explained that standing was present in laidlaw because in contrast,it is undisputed that laidlaw unlawful conduct was occurring t hen,the only subjective issue here is the reasonableness of the fear that led the affiants to respond to that concededly ongoing conduct by refraining from use of the polluted areas.id.brackets omitted.the court noted that it differed from the dissent in seeing nothing improbable about the proposition that a company continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.id.thus,in laidlaw,the plaintiff fear of harm from the defendant undisputed that would also undisputably affect plaintiffs personally if they undertook their desired sufficient to support standing.id.at.in summary,i read laidlaw to require that plaintiffs demonstrate that they are in fact subject to the defendant conduct,in the past or future,and have at least a reasonable fear of harm from that conduct.
the laidlaw majority discussion of lyons and its observations about the laidlaw plaintiffs explain exactly why plaintiffs here are like the plaintiff in lyons,who lacked standing,and unlike those in laidlaw,who had standing.like the plaintiffs in laidlaw and lyons,the plaintiffs in the present case may have a reasonable fear of harm from the defendants conduct.see id.at.finding plaintiffs fear of economic and aesthetic harms from illegal discharges of pollutants to be entirely reasonable lyons,at.describing the deaths of those who were subject to chokeholds.but laidlaw and lyons differ in outcome based on whether the plaintiffs have established that they are in fact subject to the conduct of the defendants.here,plaintiffs fear being subject to a government policy of surveillance and have alleged that they and those with whom they communicate have ceased their normal communication.if they instead continued their normal activities,they would still be fearful,but whether they would actually be subject to surveillance is purely speculative.they are like the lyons plaintiff who can show nothing more than a fear of the use of a chokehold.see laidlaw,at.discussing the subjective apprehensions that such a recurrence would even take place in lyons.by contrast,if the laidlaw plaintiffs had resumed their abandoned activities,they would definitely have been subject to the defendant discharges into the river.see id.contrasting laidlaw concededly ongoing conduct of continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river nearby.
judge gilman attempt to distinguish lyons from the case at bar is directly contrary to the supreme court own reading of that case.it is immaterial that the likelihood that lyons would be subject to the chokehold policy may be far more remote than the likelihood that the in this case may be subject to the warrantless surveillance policy.see gilman.as laidlaw makes clear,a plaintiff must be actually subject to the defendant conduct,not simply afraid of being subject to it,regardless of how reasonable that fear may be.the supreme court distinction between laidlaw and lyons was one of kind,not degree.see laidlaw,at.distinguishing between the subjective apprehensions that such a recurrence would even take place in lyons and the subjective issue of the reasonableness of the fear that pollutants would cause economic and aesthetic harms in laidlaw internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.here,the lack standing because they have failed to present evidence that they are personally subject to the warrantless surveillance policy that is,the have failed to present evidence as to whether,in the government view,there are reasonable grounds to believe that a party to the communication s is affiliated with al qaeda.
judge gilman attempts to distinguish united presbyterian church on its facts by confounding the different injuries alleged in that case.the plaintiffs in that case alleged three different kinds of injuries the chilling of constitutionally protected activities,united presbyterian church,at the immediate threat of being targeted for surveillance,and direct injury from surveillance taken against them,id.at.as the plaintiffs in this case have no evidence that they have ever been subject to the tsp,judge gilman correctly distinguishes the circuit reasoning on the third alleged injury.gilman discussing the direct injury and quoting in part united presbyterian church,at the third kind of harm the plaintiffs allege is too generalized and nonspecific to support a complaint there is no allegation or even suggestion that any unlawful action to which the plaintiffs have been subjected in the past was the consequence of the presidential action they seek to challenge.judge gilman ignores the circuit reasoning on the second alleged injury,for which it found that the plaintiffs lacked standing based upon the same distinction made by the supreme court in laidlaw.the circuit noted that the plaintiffs would have standing if they were subject to an immediate threat of concrete,harmful action.united presbyterian church,at.however,it concluded that the plaintiffs allegations that their activities are such that they are especially likely to be targets of the surveillance authorized by the order were insufficient to support standing because those allegations only place d the plaintiffs at greater risk of being subject to surveillance.id.there is no relevant factual difference between the united presbyterian church plaintiffs,whose activities the circuit conceded made them more likely to be subject to surveillance,and the in this case,whose representation of exactly the types of clients targeted by the tsp makes them more likely to be targeted by the tsp,gilman.
unlike the plaintiffs in united presbyterian church and this case,in every case cited by judge gilman in which standing was found,the plaintiff was clearly subject to conduct of the defendant about which the plaintiff complained.see meese keene,d noting that the three films the plaintiff sought to show were identified as political propaganda steffel,at.noting that the plaintiff fear of prosecution was not speculative because he had been personally threatened with prosecution ozonoff berzak,cir noting that a s one who has worked for the who in the past and who has filed an employment application again seeking work,the plaintiff felt constrained by the loyalty standards paton la prade,cir noting that paton name and address were ascertained as a result of the mail cover and concluding the plaintiff had standing because she may have sustained or be immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the fbi investigation directed against her,which resulted from the mail cover.
in applying any understanding of constitutional standing,it is important to recognize the burden of proof required.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing.defenders of wildlife,at.e ach element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.id.as this case was decided on the government motion for summary judgment,the plaintiffs must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts,which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.id.quoting.e.applying my formulation of the standing requirements,the plaintiffs have failed to meet this burden because there is no evidence in the record that any of the plaintiffs are personally subject to the tsp.judge gilman frequently refers to the allegations,gilman,and concludes that the have alleged a concrete and particularized injury,gilman.on summary judgment,however,the plaintiffs mere allegations are insufficient,and although the publicly admitted information about the tsp supports them,gilman,it does not satisfy the plaintiffs burden.in applying his formulation of the standing requirement,the reasonableness of plaintiffs fear,judge gilman concludes that t he likelihood that the plaintiff in lyons would again find himself in a chokehold by the los angeles police seems to me far more remote than the ongoing concern of the here that their telephone or email communications will be intercepted by the tsp.gilman.unfortunately for the plaintiffs position,besides judge gilman subjective assessment,there is no evidence as to the likelihood the plaintiffs will be surveilled for this court to consider on summary judgment.
under any understanding of constitutional standing,the plaintiffs are ultimately prevented from establishing standing because of the state secrets privilege as judge batchelder notes,plaintiffs have not challenged the government invocation of the privilege or its application.all three members of the panel have reviewed the documents filed by the government under seal that arguably are protected by the privilege.the state secrets privilege operates as a bar to the admission of evidence to which the privilege attaches,and the plaintiff must proceed without the benefit of such evidence.see united states reynolds.see also ellsberg mitchell.where the privilege prevents the plaintiff from producing sufficient evidence to establish his or her prima facie case,the court must dismiss the claim.kasza browner,cir.in this way,the state secrets privilege has prevented the plaintiffs from conducting discovery that might allow them to establish that they are personally subject to the tsp,as i believe constitutional standing requires.however,where the privilege deprives the government of a valid defense to the plaintiff claim,the court must also dismiss the claim.tenenbaum simonini,cir kasza,at.even applying judge gilman formulation of the standing requirement,the court can not avoid the state secrets privilege evidence arguably protected by the state secrets privilege may well be relevant to the reasonableness of the plaintiffs fear.whether that evidence is favorable to plaintiffs or defendants,its unavailability requires dismissal.that it may be unsatisfying that facts pertinent to the standing inquiry are unavailable can have no bearing on the disposition of this case.if the state secrets privilege prevents the plaintiffs from presenting adequate evidence of their standing,we must dismiss their claims.if the state secrets privilege prevents the government from presenting evidence that might refute the plaintiffs allegations that they are likely to be surveilled and undercut the reasonableness of their asserted fear,we must also dismiss the plaintiffs claims.
my colleagues conclude that the plaintiffs have not established standing to bring their challenge to the bush administration terrorist surveillance program tsp.a fundamental disagreement exists between the two of them and myself on what is required to show standing and whether any of the plaintiffs have met that requirement.because of that disagreement,i respectfully dissent.moreover,i would affirm the judgment of the district court because i am persuaded that the tsp as originally implemented violated the foreign intelligence surveillance act of fisa.
procedural posture 
this case comes to us in a relatively unique procedural posture.in the district court,the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment.they filed a statement of undisputed facts in support of that motion.the government then filed its own motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,a motion for summary judgment.in this motion,the government asserted that the plaintiffs could not establish standing and that the privilege barred their claims.but the government did not contest the plaintiffs statement of undisputed facts or provide its own statement of undisputed facts.the district court was therefore bound by the requirements of rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides as follows 
when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule,an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party pleading,but the adverse party response,by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule,must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.if the adverse party does not so respond,summary judgment,if appropriate,shall be entered against the adverse party.
after reviewing the affidavits and related supporting material submitted in support of the plaintiffs motion,the district court found that they had set forth the necessary facts to meet the prerequisites for standing.the court then considered the plaintiffs claims on the merits and granted their motion as to all but their datamining claim.
despite this procedural posture,the lead opinion asserts that the record presently before us contains only three publicly acknowledged facts about the tsp it eavesdrops,without warrants,on international telephone and email communications in which at least one of the parties is a suspected al qaeda affiliate.lead op.at.for the reasons both stated above and set forth below,i believe that this description significantly understates the material in the record presently before us.
injury in fact 
article iii of the constitution requires the party who invokes the court authority to show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d quotation marks omitted.this is sometimes referred to as the direct injury or the distinct and palpable injury requirement.laird tatum,d valley forge,at.the supreme court has defined injury in fact as an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual and imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d citations and quotation marks omitted.an association has standing to sue on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citation omitted.
moreover,as the lead opinion acknowledges,only one plaintiff need establish standing to satisfy article iii requirement.envtl.prot.agency,d only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review.see also bowsher synar,d finding the article iii requirement satisfied where at least one plaintiff could establish standing.the position of the,in my opinion,is the strongest for the purpose of the standing analysis.this is not to say that the journalists and the scholars do not have standing.they might.but because only one plaintiff need establish standing,i will focus my discussion on the.
the lead opinion criticizes the for asserting multiple causes of action despite hav ing one claim,but this is hardly a ruse,whether perfectly acceptable or not as the lead opinion would have it.lead op.at.the supreme court recent decision in daimlerchrysler cuno,d,indeed reiterates that a litigant can not by virtue of his standing to challenge one government action,challenge other governmental actions that did not injure him.in the present case,however,the plaintiffs seek to challenge the only action that has injured nsa implementation of the they do so by identifying all grounds against that action.id.at.thus,i do not believe that this case requires a particularized analysis of the plaintiffs three alleged injuries,six asserted legal claims,and two requested forms of relief.lead op.at.
i now return to the first element of the standing analysis.despite the willingness of the lead opinion to assume that the asserted injuries could be deemed adequate to state an injury in fact,lead op.at,its analysis suggests the opposite.i have accordingly set forth below the reasons why i conclude that the have demonstrated that no such assumption is needed because they have actually stated an injury in fact.
the assert a claim for the injuries flowing from the failure of the tsp to comply with fisa requirements that minimization procedures be utilized to protect privileged as between attorneys and their interception or,if intercepted,from subsequent disclosure.contrary to the lead opinion characterization of the assertions,the harm alleged here in fact causes the plaintiffs to refrain from potentially harmful conduct.lead op.at.i find that the distinction the lead opinion attempts to draw between a harm that causes an injury and a harm that results from an injury is ultimately unpersuasive.to my mind,the have articulated an actual or imminent harm flowing from the tsp.
the lead opinion contrary view is largely based on its reading of the circuit interpretation of laird namely,that a plaintiff must establish that he or she is regulated,constrained,or compelled directly by the government actions,instead of by his or her own subjective chill.lead op.at citing laird,at,and united presbyterian church reagan.in fact,the lead opinion says that laird controls,and that the injury alleged here is at best no more concrete than that in laird.lead op.at.the lead opinion then analogizes the injury to the ability to perform their professional duties as a chill on commercial speech.drawing on this argument never raised by the lead opinion rejects the plaintiffs contention of having suffered an injury in fact because,as so characterized by the lead opinion,the consequence would effectively value commercial speech above political speech.lead op.at.but there is no legal support offered for the lead opinion contention that the plaintiffs inability to perform their jobs is nothing more than the equivalent of a chill on commercial speech.lead op.at.in addition,the lead opinion commentary on the relative value of different forms of speech is not a point raised by either of the parties or,to my mind,in any way relevant to the resolution of this case.for this reason,i find the lead opinion discussion ranking the value of political speech over commercial speech puzzling.i instead believe that laird is distinguishable because the have in fact alleged a concrete,imminent,and particularized harm flowing from the tsp.
on appeal,the government contends that any litigation about the tsp must be premised on the three general facts that the government has publicly disclosed the tsp exists,it operates without warrants,and it intercepts only communications that originate or conclude in a foreign country,and only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a party to the communication is affiliated with al qaeda.according to the government,the plaintiffs can not demonstrate that they were actually targets of the tsp and thus can not show more than a subjective chill on their activities.the government asserts that the plaintiffs can not establish standing because the privilege prevents us from testing the plaintiffs allegations that they have been or likely will be subject to surveillance under the tsp.moreover,the government argues that the plaintiffs improperly seek to assert the rights of third parties,such as their overseas contacts,clients,and sources,who are not presently before the court.
the respond that they have suffered concrete,particularized injuries as a result of the tsp.specifically,they contend that the tsp puts them in the position of abrogating their duties under applicable rules if they communicate with clients and contacts via telephone or email.the tsp,in short,allegedly prevents them from doing their jobs.specifically,the contend that they have had to travel internationally for meetings at a significant expense in terms of time and money.they claim that their ability to conduct research and factfinding has been limited,if not entirely thwarted,as a result.
the,as part of their representation of clients accused of being enemy combatants or of providing aid to organizations designated as terrorist groups,declare that they have conducted internet research on terrorism,religion,politics,and issues in parts of the middle east and south asia.they further state that they have reviewed web sites where topics including jihad,kidnapping,and other terrorist acts are discussed.as part of their work on behalf of their clients,these attorneys have communicated with potential witnesses,experts,lawyers,and other individuals who live and work outside the united states about subjects such as terrorism,jihad,and.the contend that because of the tsp,they have ceased telephone or email communications about substantive issues with their overseas contacts.this is because the tsp,unlike fisa,provides no minimization procedures to protect communications.
under fisa,an application for an order authorizing surveillance must include a description of the minimization procedures that will be utilized to protect privileged communications.a.minimization procedures are specific procedures that are reasonably designed to minimize the acquisition and retention,and prohibit the dissemination,of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting united states persons.h see also h providing a further definition of the term.privileged communications remain such under fisa.a no otherwise privileged communication obtained in accordance with,or in violation of,the provisions of this subchapter shall lose its privileged character.id.h.
as noted above,the lead opinion finds that laird controls this case.lead op.at.although the lead opinion then asserts that it limits its application of laird to only the first amendment claim,its analysis suggests otherwise.laird addressed the question of whether the jurisdiction of a federal court properly may be invoked by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his first amendment rights is being chilled by the mere existence,without more,of a governmental investigative and activity that is alleged to be broader in scope than is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of a valid governmental purpose.at.emphasis added.the case stands for the proposition that a llegations of a subjective chill are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.id.at.in laird,the court found that the army,in its capacity as a domestic peacekeeping body,had collected information on public activities that were thought to have at least some potential for civil disorder.id.at.the information itself was collected by a variety of means,but it is significant that the principal sources of information were the news media and publications in general circulation.id.
i believe that the here allege a distinct set of facts that is legally distinguishable from those set forth in laird.unlike in the present case,the laird plaintiffs simply articulated speculative apprehensiveness that the army may at some future date misuse the information in some way that would cause direct harm to them.at.the court stated that the plaintiffs freely admit that they complain of no specific action of the army against them there is no evidence of illegal or unlawful surveillance activities.id.at.
in contrast to laird,the here complain of specific present harms,not simply of some generalized fear of the future misuse of intercepted communications.the tsp forces them to decide between breaching their duty of confidentiality to their clients and breaching their duty to provide zealous representation.neither position is tenable.the must travel to meet in person with clients and sources in order to avoid the risk of tsp surveillance.unlike the situation in laird,the in the present case allege that the government is listening in on private communications that are not open to the public.these are communications that any reasonable person would understand to be private.the have thus identified concrete harms to themselves flowing from their reasonable fear that the tsp will intercept privileged communications between themselves and their clients.
to survive the government challenge,the do not have to demonstrate that their past communications have in fact been intercepted by the tsp.in laidlaw,for example,the supreme court found that environmental groups had standing to sue a polluter where their members declared that they would use the nearby north tyger river for recreation if laidlaw were not discharging pollutants into it.at.the court did not require the plaintiffs to show that the pollutants had actually harmed the environment,instead finding that their members reasonable concerns about the effects of laidlaw discharges directly affected those affiants recreational,aesthetic,and economic interests,and that these concerns present ed dispositively more than the mere general averments and conclusory allegations found inadequate in prior cases.id.at.citation and quotation marks omitted.
a similar conclusion was reached by the fourth circuit in friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir.in gaston copper,the court found that the plaintiff had standing based on his assertion that he used the affected lake less than he would have otherwise as a result of the ongoing pollution,despite the lack of evidence showing an objective environmental change in the lake.id.at.
both the laidlaw and the gaston copper plaintiffs asserted more than a mere academic or philosophical interest,gaston copper,at,or an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable.united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,d.the in the case before us likewise have alleged a harm far beyond the academic in their challenge to the tsp.
in reaching the opposite conclusion,the lead opinion attempts to distinguish laidlaw by noting that the plaintiffs there brought their complaint under the provision of the clean water act,a fact that the lead opinion asserts offers only minimal support for the plaintiffs in the present case.lead op.at.although the plaintiffs in that case did indeed base their cause of action on an environmental statute,the supreme court still analyzed whether they satisfied the constitutional standing requirements of article iii.see laidlaw,at.the fact that the clean water act contained a provision did not absolve the courts of examining the constitutional standing of the particular plaintiffs before them.i therefore find the lead opinion treatment of laidlaw unpersuasive.as in laidlaw,i have analyzed the assertions of article iii standing and have concluded that they satisfy those requirements.
the concurring opinion also criticizes my interpretation of laidlaw,describing it as transform ing the holding in that case.concurring op.at.i do not believe that this characterization holds up under scrutiny.in discussing the case,the concurring opinion describes the laidlaw plaintiffs as in fact subject to defendant conduct of discharging pollutants in excess of permitted amounts into the north tyger river.id.emphasis omitted.the supreme court,to be sure,noted that it is undisputed that laidlaw unlawful conduct was occurring,but nonetheless found nothing improbable about the proposition that a company continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.laidlaw,at.citation and quotation marks omitted.
the concurring opinion then argues,in reference to the laidlaw plaintiffs,that their fear of harm from the defendant undisputed that would also undisputably affect plaintiffs personally if they undertook their desired sufficient to support standing.concurring op.at emphasis in original.similarly,the concurring opinion acknowledges that the plaintiffs in the present case may have a reasonable fear of harm from the defendants conduct.id.it goes on to state,however,that the lack standing because they must be actually subject to the defendant conduct,not simply afraid of being subject to it.id.because i believe that the plaintiffs in the present case are actually subject to the defendant conduct within the meaning of laidlaw,i respectfully disagree with my colleague conclusion.
to my mind,the concurring opinion describes,rather than distinguishes,the situation of the.the concurring opinion would hold that the must demonstrate that they have personally been subject to surveillance under the tsp in order to have standing to sue.this is akin to laidlaw argument that the plaintiffs should have been required to demonstrate that laidlaw mercury discharge violations caused them to sustain or face the threat of any injury in fact from laidlaw activities.laidlaw,at.but the supreme court rejected such an argument,stating that the plaintiffs need only show the reasonableness of the fear that led the affiants to respond to that concededly ongoing conduct id.at.brackets and quotation marks omitted.
both the lead and concurring opinions proceed to analogize the present case to two cases that i find distinguishable.one is los angeles lyons,d,where the supreme court denied standing for injunctive relief to a los angeles motorist who had been subjected to a chokehold by the police during a routine traffic stop.id.at.the court reasoned in part that the plaintiff subjective apprehensions that a recurrence of the allegedly unlawful conduct would occur were insufficient to support standing.id.at.but the likelihood that lyons would again find himself in a chokehold by the los angeles police seems to me far more remote than the ongoing concern of the here that their telephone or email communications will be intercepted by the tsp.based upon the principles set forth in laidlaw,the reasonableness of the fear of the in the present case strikes me as being well beyond what is needed to establish standing to sue.see laidlaw,at.
pushing the lead opinion reasoning still further,the concurring opinion argues that the can show nothing more than a fear of being subject to a government policy of surveillance.concurring op.at.by contrast,if the laidlaw plaintiffs had resumed their abandoned activities,they would definitely have been subject to the defendant discharge into the river.id.the concurring opinion then asserts that t he supreme court distinction between laidlaw and lyons was one of kind,not degree.id.but i find no support for this assertion,and my colleague reliance on a quotation from laidlaw for this point strikes me as unpersuasive.
in fact,the laidlaw plaintiffs were personally affected by the defendant conduct whether they used the waterway or not.nothing in laidlaw required that the plaintiffs demonstrate that they were all equally likely to be affected by the pollutants,that the pollutants were evenly dispersed through the waterway,or that a plaintiff swimming in the river was more likely than a plaintiff canoeing on the river to be injured.all that was required was that they demonstrate that,given laidlaw undisputed conduct,they possessed a reasonable fear of harm.this holds equally true for the in the present case.the existence of the tsp is undisputed and these plaintiffs are personally affected by the tsp whether they engage in targeted communications or not.in sum,i believe that the distinction between laidlaw and lyons is in fact one of degree,and that the here occupy a position far closer to the former than to the latter.
the other case to which the lead opinion analogizes the present suit is united presbyterian church reagan.in united presbyterian church,a group of religious and political organizations,academics,journalists,and a member of congress challenged the constitutionality of an executive order that specif ied the organization,procedures and limitations applicable to the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the executive branch.id.at.the united presbyterian church plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that this executive order violated the first,fourth,and fifth amendments to the constitution,the doctrine,and the national security act of.id.unlike the in the present case,however,the united presbyterian church plaintiffs fail ed to allege that any plaintiff has suffered any injury in fact under the order.id.discussing the district court opinion.the circuit therefore affirmed the district court dismissal of the complaint for lack of standing to sue,but that result has no bearing on the present case with its dramatically different facts.
in dismissing the complaint,the circuit followed laird in concluding that the plaintiffs had alleged no more than a subjective chill.id.at.the facts in the present case are substantially different,however,with even the concurring opinion acknowledging that h ere the plaintiffs professional injuries are arguably a harm beyond chilled speech.concurring op.at.to be sure,several of the groups in united presbyterian church claimed that they had experienced direct injury,such as interception of their mail,disruption of their events,and infiltration of their meetings.united presbyterian church,at.but these allegations were deemed too generalized and insufficient because t here is no allegation or even suggestion that any unlawful action to which the appellants have been subjected in the past was the consequence of the presidential action they seek to challenge here.id.at.the circuit thus concluded that,w ithout such connection,standing to pursue the present suit does not exist.id.at.
here,in contrast,the have provided a connection between their injury and the tsp.specifically,officials in the bush administration have publicly stated that the tsp involves intercepts of international calls and communications where the government ha s a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al qaeda,affiliated with al qaeda,or a member of an organization affiliated with al qaeda,or working in support of al qaeda.press briefing by alberto gonzales,att y,and michael hayden,principal deputy dir.for intelligence.gov news releases print.html.these are exactly the types of clients that the represent.the tsp therefore constitutes a genuine threat of harm to the,see steffel thompson,d,the absence of which doomed the united presbyterian church plaintiffs action.
a number of cases have distinguished laird in situations such as this where the plaintiffs have suffered professional injuries.in meese keene,d,for example,a state legislator wished to publicly screen three films about the effects of acid rain and nuclear winter.under a federal statute,the films would have had to be designated as political propaganda in order to be shown in this country.keene sued for injunctive relief,contending that the statute violated his first amendment rights.the supreme court held that keene had standing to raise a first amendment claim on the ground that identifying the films as political propaganda threatened to cause him cognizable professional injury.id.at.keene had not in fact shown the films,but alleged that he had standing based on his anticipated harm.the court agreed,convinced that voters would be less likely to support a candidate associated with propaganda.id.at.
another example is ozonoff berzak,cir,where the first circuit found standing for a physician who wished to work for the world health organization who.an executive order required that a citizen undergo a loyalty check before the who could extend an offer of employment to that person,notwithstanding the fact that the who was not an entity of the government.the first circuit distinguished laird because ozonoff was alleging more than the mere existence of a governmental investigative and activity.id.at.instead,ozonoff alleged injury was that the loyalty check would deter him from joining certain organizations or expressing certain views.because of the executive order,ozonoff had chosen to limit his organizational affiliations,much as the existence of the tsp has caused the to limit their telephone and email communications.unlike ozonoff,however,the are stymied in their efforts to do their jobs by the need to limit their communications.i thus believe that the have alleged an even more concrete and particularized injury than ozonoff alleged.
a final example comes from the third circuit case of paton laprade,cir,where the court found standing for student lori paton,who alleged that the existence of an fbi investigative file about her could impair her future educational and professional opportunities.id.at.as part of a high school social studies class on the contemporary political spectrum,paton had requested information from the socialist workers party swp.id.at.the fbi was monitoring mail received and sent by the swp,resulting in paton name and address being recorded and placed in an fbi investigative file.this mail cover was in fact directed at the swp.like the tsp,the mail cover did not directly compel,proscribe,or regulate paton.but its effect,like that of the tsp,was to injure her.paton learned of the file after an fbi agent visited her high school to inquire about her.on these facts,the third circuit found that she had standing to challenge the postal regulation authorizing the recording of information about mail going to or from an organization such as the swp because she may have sustained or be immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury to her present and future educational or professional activities as a result.id.at.
the lead opinion attempts to distinguish these cases and others like them on the basis that they challenged the regulatory,proscriptive,or compulsory exercise of governmental power to which the complainants were presently or prospectively subject.lead op.at quoting united presbyterian church,at.but that type of government power is precisely what is being challenged here.the have made credible allegations that the operation of the tsp has compelled them to cease telephone and email communication about sensitive topics with their clients and contacts.publicly admitted information about the tsp supports them.
what i believe distinguishes meese,ozonoff,paton,and the like from laird is that the plaintiffs in the cases successfully explained the precise connection between the mere existence of the challenged system and their alleged chill.laird,at.unlike the laird plaintiffs who conceded that they themselves were not suffering from any chill,the here have established a reasonable fear that has generated actual,imminent,concrete,and particularized harm resulting from the operation of the tsp,a program that lacks any minimization procedures to protect their privileged communications.see lujan,at.
finally,the concurring opinion would find that the privilege prevents the from establishing an injury in fact.concurring op.at t he state secrets privilege has prevented the plaintiffs from conducting discovery that might allow them to establish that they are personally subject to the tsp,as i believe constitutional standing requires.but this reading expands the reach of the privilege in ways that the caselaw does not support.because the privilege operates to foreclose relief for violations of rights that may well have occurred by foreclosing the discovery of evidence that they did occur,it is a privilege not to be lightly invoked.halkin helms,citation and quotation marks omitted see also ellsberg mitchell,t he privilege may not be used to shield any material not strictly necessary to prevent injury to national security and,whenever possible,sensitive information must be disentangled from nonsensitive information to allow for the release of the latter.
the privilege is typically invoked with respect to specific requests for discovery.see,jabara kelley.if,however,the privilege deprives the d efendants of a valid defense to the plaintiffs claims,then summary judgment may be granted to the defendant.tenenbaum simonini,cir.
but unlike in jabara or tenenbaum,the here seek no additional discovery from the defendants.instead,the argue that they have established standing based on the facts in the public record.this issue highlights what i believe to be the key difference between the lead and concurring opinions on the one hand and my opinion on the other.my colleagues believe that the must establish that they were actually subject to surveillance under the tsp,whereas i conclude that a demonstration of a reasonable,fear that has resulted in actual and particularized injury suffices.my reading of the caselaw leads me to conclude that the privilege is not so broad as to bar the from making such a showing.
in short,the critical question in this case is not whether the have actually been,as the lead opinion aptly notes,a wiretap by its nature is meant to be unknown to its whether the reasonableness of the fear of such surveillance is sufficient to establish that they have suffered actual,imminent,concrete,or particularized harm from the government alleged unlawful action.see laidlaw,at.for the reasons discussed above,i believe that the plaintiffs have established such an injury in fact.i therefore turn to the remaining factors in the article iii analysis.
the plaintiffs must next demonstrate a causal connection between the injury asserted and the government alleged conduct.this means that a federal court can act only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,and not that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.simon.welfare rights,d.the fairly traceable standard,however,does not require that the defendant conduct be the sole cause of the plaintiff injury.see,am.canoe ass n,city of louisa water sewer comm n,cir finding the causation prong satisfied despite the absence of evidence proving to a scientific certainty that the defendant pollution caused the plaintiff injury.
in the present case,the lead opinion finds that the have failed to establish causation due to its characterization of their two causal pathways based on the two types of alleged injury.lead op.at.these two pathways are then described as the plaintiffs decision to cease certain communications as a result of the tsp,and the decision by overseas contacts of the plaintiffs to cease certain communications as a result of the tsp.id.the lead opinion concludes that the plaintiffs have no evidence that the nsa has actually intercepted or will actually intercept any of their conversations.id.rather,the lead opinion characterizes the evidence in the record as establishing only a a probability or these calls might be intercepted,that the information might be disclosed or disseminated,or that this might lead to some harm to the plaintiffs overseas contacts.id.emphasis in original.this possibility is too indeterminate,according to the lead opinion,and thus renders the plaintiffs showing of causation less certain and the likelihood of causation more speculative.id.the lead opinion also concludes that the absence of a warrant for the alleged surveillance is insufficient to establish causation because it is not clear whether the chill can fairly be traced to the absence of a warrant,or if the chill would still exist without regard to the presence or absence of a warrant.lead op.at.
based upon my reading of the complaint and the subsequent motion for partial summary judgment,i believe that the lead opinion has mischaracterized the allegations.what the themselves allege,in fact,is that the existence of the tsp outside of fisa minimization procedures has prevented them from communicating by telephone and by email with their clients,contacts,and sources,thus either compelling them to violate their ethical obligations,or requiring them to undertake costly overseas trips in short,the tsp has prevented them from doing their jobs.in response,the lead opinion asserts that there is no evidence in the record from which to presume that the nsa is not complying with,or even exceeding,fisa restrictions on the acquisition,retention,use,or disclosure of the information acquired,fisa minimization techniques.lead op.at.
this unsupported assertion is belied by statements on the public record from executive branch officials.with respect to the acquisition of information,the tsp has been described as having a softer trigger than fisa,press briefing by alberto gonzales,att y,and michael hayden,principal dep y dir.for intel.gov news releases print.html,and one that uses a reasonable belief standard rather than fisa probable cause standard for surveillance.see remarks by michael hayden,principal dep y dir.of,address to the press club.gov speeches speech.htm.a senior official in the department of justice further informed congress in that,a lthough the tsp does not specifically target the communications of attorneys or physicians,calls involving such persons would not be categorically excluded from interception letter from william moschella,assistant att y,to the honorable james sensenbrenner,at.fas.org irp agency doj fisa doj.pdf.
to be sure,the bush administration has also asserted that procedures are in place to protect privacy rights,including applicable procedures required by executive order and approved by the attorney general,that govern acquisition,retention,and dissemination of information relating to persons.id.a review of this executive order,however,reveals that it makes no mention of protecting privileged communications.see exec.order.furthermore,the administration has claimed that b ecause collecting foreign intelligence information without a warrant does not violate the fourth amendment and because the tsp is lawful,there appears to be no legal barrier against introducing this evidence in a criminal prosecution.letter from william moschella,assistant att y,to the honorable james sensenbrenner,at.
which characterization of injury one accepts will largely determine the causation prong as well as the redressability prong discussed below of the standing analysis.as one distinguished commentator has noted,
t he central problem in the causation cases is not whether there is a causal nexus among injury,remedy,and illegality it is how to characterize the relevant injury.whether the injury is due to the defendant conduct,or likely to be remedied by a decree in his favor,depends on how the injury is described.
cass sunstein,standing and the privatization of public law,colum.
the lead opinion focuses primarily on the lack of evidence that the nsa has actually intercepted or will actually intercept any of the plaintiffs conversations,and on the the absence of a warrant and all that goes with it.lead op.at footnote and emphasis omitted.but as i discussed earlier in part,the need show only the reasonableness of their fear,not that their fear has in fact been realized.see,laidlaw,at.meese,at.i thus find the characterization of their injury the more persuasive.
since learning of the existence and operation of the tsp,the contend that they have ceased communicating by telephone or email about sensitive subjects with their clients and contacts.whether the potential surveillance is conducted pursuant to a warrant is not the gravamen of their complaint.their concern is directed at the impact of the tsp on their ability to perform their jobs.the causation requirement does not demand that the government conduct be the sole cause of the injury,only that the injury be fairly traceable to that conduct.see simon,at.am.canoe ass n,at.if the tsp did not exist,the would be protected by fisa minimization procedures and would have no reason to cease telephone or email communication with their international clients and contacts.i therefore conclude that the have demonstrated a causal connection between their asserted injury and the government alleged actions.
redressability 
this leaves the issue of whether the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.laidlaw,at.the lead opinion redressability analysis appears to make two basic points.first,the lead opinion cites a for the proposition that the issuance of fisa warrants would not relieve any of the plaintiffs fears of being overheard it would relieve them only of the fear that the information might be disseminated or used against them.lead op.at.the lead opinion also asserts that 
fisa might not prohibit the interception of communications under circumstances where the nsa adheres to a policy of complete.due to the state secrets doctrine,the plaintiffs do not and can not know whether the nsa actually adheres to a policy of complete,but based on the record evidence,it certainly remains possible.
lead op.at.that proposition,however,is itself speculation,as the lead opinion concedes.absent a public revelation from the nsa,the or anyone else,for that matter will simply never know whether a nondisclosure policy in fact exists.
in the face of this uncertainty,the must presume the absence of such a policy.their ethical obligations require them to do so,lest they run the risk of revealing confidential and possibly incriminating information directly to the government.the reasonable concern about the possibility of the disclosure those obligations.similarly,the simple assertion that 
t he tsp is designed and operated for the prevention of terrorism,and the nsa is interested only in telephone and email communications in which one party to the communication is located outside the united states and the nsa has a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of,affiliated with,or working in support of al qaeda,
lead op.at,does not mean that the tsp is not and could not be used to facilitate criminal investigation.in re sealed case,stating that fisa does not preclude or limit the government use or proposed use of foreign intelligence information in a criminal prosecution.
the lead opinion contends that there is a lack of evidence in the present record to suggest that the information collected by the nsa under the tsp has been disclosed to anyone for any purpose.lead op.at.but see islamic found.bush,d,discussing the effect of the government inadvertent disclosure of a sealed document that arguably described surveillance of the plaintiffs under the tsp.notwithstanding the lead opinion contention,a plain reading of the fisa statute provides no support for the speculative assertion that a policy of complete exists within the nsa.fisa explicit provisions regarding minimization procedures and privileged communications in fact strongly support the opposite conclusion.
the lead opinion second point is premised on f,which sets forth the exceptions to the normal fisa procedures.it cites this subsection for the proposition that fisa general requirement that electronic surveillance may proceed only upon issuance of a fisa court warrant is not absolute,as fisa provides for instances in which a prior warrant may be unnecessary,at least for a short period of time.lead op.at.i agree that fisa warrant requirement is not absolute.but the warrant requirement is besides the point.instead,fisa minimization procedures regarding the use of wiretapped information are the only fisa protections that ultimately bear on the redressability prong of the standing analysis in the present case.the point is that these minimization procedures are absolute even though the warrant requirement is not.see f if the attorney general authorizes such emergency employment of electronic surveillance,he shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed.emphasis added.
admittedly,the supreme court has furnished little guidance regarding the scope of the redressability inquiry beyond requiring a direct relationship between the alleged injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated.linda richard,d.but i believe that the present case clearly demonstrates such a direct link between the injury and their claim.the redressability arguments revolve around their very real ongoing ethical obligations to their clients,to their profession,and to themselves.these obligations,as noted above,exist independently of whether the communications with their clients have actually been wiretapped through the tsp,independently of whether the nsa actually adheres to a policy of complete for all information,and independently of whether a judicially authorized warrant has actually been procured in advance of the alleged wiretapping.this is where the supreme court decision in laidlaw again comes directly into play.
the court in laidlaw found that the plaintiffs had satisfied the redressability prong even though the defendant,during the course of the appeal,had voluntarily ceased the conduct that had initially given rise to the lawsuit.at.here,too,the nsa has allegedly ceased conducting the tsp independently of the fisa court,as discussed in greater depth in part below.but as the government counsel conceded at oral argument,the executive branch views itself as free to unilaterally opt out of the fisa court oversight at any time.the civil penalties imposed on the defendant in laidlaw,the supreme court held,redressed the plaintiffs alleged injuries from the prior unauthorized pollutant discharges because those injuries were ongoing and the penalties would generally deter not only that particular defendant,but also others similarly situated to it,from engaging in similar conduct in the future.see id.at.
deterrence,in short,is an especially appropriate consideration where,as here,the alleged harm is not wholly past but,as publicly acknowledged by the government,instead ongoing at the time of the complaint and could continue into the future.laidlaw,at.distinguishing the holding in steel citizens for a better env t,d.the court holding in laidlaw could not be more applicable than it is to the present case it can scarcely be doubted that,for a plaintiff who is injured or faces the threat of future injury due to illegal conduct ongoing at the time of suit,a sanction that effectively abates that conduct and prevents its recurrence provides a form of redress.id.at.
the facts alleged by the here fit this language to a each of them faces the threat that the tsp will harm them in the future,the tsp was undisputedly ongoing at the time that the filed their lawsuit,and the district court injunction effectively abates the tsp and prevents its recurrence.the lead opinion parting assertion that t he only way to redress the injury would be to enjoin all wiretaps,even those for which warrants are issued and for which full prior notice is given to the parties being tapped,lead op.at,provides rhetorical flourish but significantly overstates the allegations.simply requiring that the executive branch conform its activities to governing law,including the requirements of fisa,will redress the injury.more is not needed.i therefore conclude that the have satisfied the redressability prong of the standing analysis.
prudential requirements 
the must satisfy the requirements of prudential standing in addition to satisfying the article iii constitutional requirements.specifically,they must demonstrate that they are asserting their own interests rather than those of a third party,see allen wright,d,and that they are asserting a personalized claim rather than a generalized grievance.see fed.election comm akins,d.other requirements exist that are not universally applied in all cases.one such requirement is the test.see clarke sec.indus.ass n,d noting that the test is most usefully understood as a gloss on the meaning of of the administrative procedures act.this test requires plaintiffs to show that they are within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision or constitutional guarantee invoked in the suit.bennett spear,d.
generalized grievance and personal interest 
requirements preclude litigation in federal court when the asserted harm is a generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all of a large class of citizens,or where a plaintiff seeks to rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.warth seldin,d.the fact that a harm is widely shared,however,will not by itself preclude standing if the harm is also concrete and particularized.envtl.protection agency,d w here a harm is concrete,though widely shared,the court has found injury in fact.quoting fed.election comm akins,d.
in the present case,the have alleged specific and concrete injuries to themselves and to their ability to engage in their professional work due to the operation of the tsp.they allege that they are unable to engage in telephone and email communications with clients and contacts because the identity of those clients and contacts,some of whom have been charged with links to terrorism or terrorist organizations,fall within the ambit of the tsp.because the government has admitted that the tsp has operated outside of fisa and does not distinguish attorneys from any other person whose telephone or email communications might be under electronic surveillance,the have been unable,consistent with their ethical responsibilities to their clients and to the bar,to engage in privileged communications.they must instead incur the significant financial and professional burden of traveling to meet in person with clients and contacts.
the tsp has thus injured the both personally and professionally.for these reasons and for the reasons previously discussed in my analysis of injury in fact in part.above,i conclude that the are asserting personalized,individual harms rather than generalized grievances or the rights of a third party.
zone of interests 
the test is the other prudential standing requirement that the must satisfy.they must show that they are arguably within the zone of interests of a relevant statute.clarke,at.the supreme court has clarified that the breadth of the zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue,so that what comes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative action under the generous review provisions of the apa may not do so for other purposes.id.at.quotation marks omitted.
in the present case,the do not raise a cause of action under fisa or under title iii instead,their cause of action arises under the apa.under of the apa,a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.a plaintiff must therefore identify some agency action that affects him in the specified fashion.lujan wildlife fed n,d quotation marks omitted.second,the plaintiff must show that he has suffered a legal wrong because of that agency action or that he is adversely affected or aggrieved by that action within the meaning of a relevant statute.id.at.quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court said in lujan that to be adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of a statute,the plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.id.quotation marks omitted.in determining whether the petitioners have standing under the test to bring their apa claims,we look not to the terms of the relevant statute provision,but to the substantive provisions of the statute,the alleged violations of which serve as the gravamen of the complaint.bennett,at.the here maintain that the tsp violates fisa and title iii by functioning as an electronic surveillance program outside the exclusive means of those statutes.
fisa includes a provision,which states that 
a n aggrieved person,other than a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,as defined in section a or b a of this title,respectively,who has been subjected to an electronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of such person has been disclosed or used in violation of section of this title shall have a cause of action against any person who committed such violation and shall be entitled to recover actual and punitive damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs.
the lead opinion asserts that the can not establish that they have a right to sue because they are not aggrieved persons under fisa.an aggrieved person is defined as a person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other person whose communications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.k.according to the lead opinion,because the plaintiffs have not shown that they were actually the target of,or subject to,the nsa surveillance,they can not establish a cause of action under fisa.lead op.at.
the challenge,however,is precisely that the tsp has operated outside of fisa despite the fact that congress has declared fisa to be the exclusive means for the government to engage in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes in this country.f.they rely on provisions of fisa and of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act,which criminalizes the interception disclosure of wire,oral,or electronic communications other than pursuant to those statutes.see a f.
the lead opinion contends that title iii can not support standing because the statute provides that n othing contained in this chapter or chapter or of this title,or section of the communications act of,shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the united states government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications.f.lead op.at.but this reading of the statute ignores the remainder of the sentence.in full,section f states as follows 
nothing contained in this chapter or chapter or of this title,or section of the communications act of,shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the united states government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications,or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system,utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as defined in section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of,and procedures in this chapter or chapter and the foreign intelligence surveillance act of shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance,as defined in section of such act,and the interception of domestic wire,oral,and electronic communications may be conducted.
emphasis added.in light of the fact that title iii deals only with domestic wiretaps to obtain intelligence information relating to certain specified offenses,see,the subsection makes quite clear that fisa shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes may be conducted.id.emphasis added.
the lead opinion contends,however,that the exclusive means provision of title iii and fisa should be read as two separate and independent,albeit parallel,statements.lead op.at.accordingly,the lead opinion asserts,t his provision does not foreclose the possibility that the government may engage in certain surveillance activities that are outside of the strictures of both title iii and fisa.id.but the lead opinion provides no legal support for this novel statutory interpretation and none is apparent to me.this,in my opinion,flies directly in the face of the plain language of fisa and its legislative history.i note,moreover,that the government announced in january of this year that the tsp would henceforth be conducted under the aegis of the fisa court of review.
the language of both the fisa statute and its legislative history is explicit fisa was specifically drafted to curb the practice by which the executive b ranch may conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on its own unilateral determination that national security justifies it,pt.i,at,reprinted at,see also id.at.when debating fisa,congress made clear that it intended to prevent the executive branch from engaging in electronic surveillance in the united states without judicial oversight,even during times of war.see,at,reprinted at,this bill will establish the exclusive united states law governing electronic surveillance in the united states for foreign intelligence purposes.
congress explicitly refuted the inherent authority argument on which the government seeks to justify the tsp existence 
finally,spells out that the executive can not engage in electronic surveillance within the united states without a prior judicial warrant.this is accomplished by repealing the executive inherent power disclaimer clause currently found in section of title,united states code.provides instead that its statutory procedures and those found in chapter of title shall be the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance,as defined in the legislation,in the united states.the highly controversial disclaimer has often been cited as evidence of a congressional ratification of the president inherent constitutional power to engage in electronic surveillance in order to obtain foreign intelligence information essential to the national security.despite the admonition of the supreme court that the language of the disclaimer was neutral and did not reflect any such congressional recognition of inherent power,the section has been a major source of controversy.by repealing section and expressly stating that the statutory warrant procedures spelled out in the law must be followed in conducting electronic surveillance in the united states,this legislation ends the debate over the meaning and scope of the inherent power disclaimer clause.
pt.i,at,reprinted at.in fact,congress rejected language that would have made fisa and title iii the exclusive statutory means under which electronic surveillance could be conducted,instead adopting language that made those statutes simply the exclusive means governing such surveillance.see conf,at,reprinted at,emphasis added.
more to the point,the government has publicly admitted that the tsp has operated outside of the fisa and title iii statutory framework,and that the tsp engages in electronic surveillance.press briefing by alberto gonzales,att y,and michael hayden,principal deputy dir.for intelligence.gov news releases print.html general hayden i can say unequivocally that we have used this program in lieu of the fisa processes and this program has been successful.in january of,in fact,the bush administration announced that it had reached a secret agreement with the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc whereby the tsp would comply with fisa,a further acknowledgment that the tsp had previously been operating without fisa approval.see letter from alberto gonzales,att y,to the honorable patrick leahy the honorable arlen specter,at a ny electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the terrorist surveillance program will now be conducted subject to the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance court.gov press ag to pjl re fisa court.pdf see also dan eggen,spy court orders stir debate on hill.post,at reporting on the reaction to the bush administration announcement that it will dismantle the controversial counterterrorism surveillance program run by the national security agency and instead conduct the eavesdropping under the authority of the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court,which issues warrants in spy and terrorism cases.
the lead opinion,however,repeats the government assertion that none of the plaintiffs have shown that the nsa surveillance activities include the sort of conduct that would satisfy fisa definition of electronic surveillance,and declares that the present record does not demonstrate that the nsa conduct falls within fisa definitions.lead op.at.as an initial matter,this argument has been waived because the government failed to raise it before the district court.see,united states abdi,cir it is fundamental,and firmly established by supreme court precedent,that appellate courts generally are not to consider an issue brought for the first time on appeal.
moreover,the government contention lacks merit.the attorney general has publicly acknowledged that fisa requires a court order before engaging in this kind of surveillance unless otherwise authorized by congress.press briefing by alberto gonzales,att y,and michael hayden,principal dep y dir.for intel.gov news releases print.html.emphasis added.other administration officials have similarly characterized the tsp as being used in lieu of fisa.id.these statements indicate that the tsp in fact captures electronic surveillance as defined by fisa,despite the belated effort of executive branch officials to disavow this acknowledgment.
there is no doubt in my mind that the have established that the injury complained of falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by these statutes.accordingly,i conclude that they have satisfied the requirements.
standing summary 
for all of the reasons discussed above,i believe that the have satisfied both the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing to sue.i therefore conclude that the are entitled to proceed with their claims against the government for the injuries allegedly flowing from the operation of the tsp.
the last procedural hurdle that the plaintiffs must overcome is the question of mootness.article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to actual,ongoing controversies.honig doe,d.federal courts have neither the power to render advisory opinions nor to decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.preiser newkirk,d quotation marks omitted.mootness became an issue in this case in january of,when the government publicly announced that a judge of the foreign intelligence surveillance court had issued orders authorizing the government to conduct electronic surveillance of international communications into or out of the united states where there is probable cause to believe that one party to the communication is a member or agent of al qaeda or an associated terrorist organization.letter from alberto gonzales,att y,previously cited on,at.
as a result of these orders,electronic surveillance that had been occurring under the tsp will now be conducted subject to the approval of the fisc,and the president has determined not to reauthorize the tsp.id.at.the government,in short,decided to voluntarily cease electronic surveillance of international communications in this country outside of fisa.on the ground that such surveillance would henceforth be,the government argues that we should dismiss this case as moot and vacate the judgment below.to be sure,if we could be satisfied that the tsp would never be reinstituted,then the government argument would have merit.we must therefore determine whether the present situation fits into the exception to the mootness doctrine.
under supreme court precedent,the voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case,does not make the case moot,united states grant,because courts would be compelled to leave the defendant free to return to his old ways.united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d quotation marks omitted.the test is demanding a case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,concentrated phosphate,at,and if interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.los angeles county davis,d.moreover,the heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.laidlaw,at.brackets and quotation marks omitted.the government urges us to find that there is no longer any live genuine controversy to adjudicate because the tsp ceased to exist when the president last authorization for it expired,thus resolving and mooting the plaintiffs claims.
but the government continues to assert that the tsp did not violate the constitution or any federal statute prior to the january fisc orders.instead,it contends that a n independent judicial fisa now acted to provide additional and wholly sufficient legal authority for the activity in question.the government accordingly argues that it has in no sense terminated its conduct in response to plaintiffs suit,but rather that the fisc orders provide legal authority that plaintiffs claimed was absent.both in its briefs and at oral argument,the government insisted that the fisc orders represent an independent intervening act of a coordinate branch of government that suffices to render the exception inapplicable.
but the government acknowledged at oral argument that the president maintains that he has the authority to opt out of the fisa framework at any time and to reauthorize the tsp or a similar program.the government also conceded that the fisc orders were actively sought by the executive branch,and that the president decided that he would comply with the orders only after determining that the fisc order s provide d the necessary speed and agility for surveillance.most recently,the director of national intelligence stated during a congressional hearing that the government continued to believe that the president has the authority under article ii of the constitution to order the nsa to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance.james risen,administration pulls back on surveillance agreement,times,may,at.these facts do not support a conclusion that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.concentrated phosphate,at.indeed,the government insistence that the tsp was perfectly lawful and the reservation of its ability to opt out of the fisc orders at any time lend credence to the opposite position.
i therefore conclude that the government has failed to meet its heavy burden of showing that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again.accordingly,i conclude that this case is not moot and that this court may properly continue to exercise jurisdiction over it.
without expressing an opinion concerning the analysis of the district court,i would affirm its judgment because i conclude that the tsp violates fisa and title iii and that the president does not have the inherent authority to act in disregard of those statutes.the clearest ground for deciding the merits of this appeal is the plaintiffs statutory claim,just as the clearest argument for standing is presented by the.this is not to say that the plaintiffs other causes of action lack merit,but simply that this case can,and therefore should,be decided on the narrowest grounds possible.see,city of cleburne cleburne living,d when a lower court correctly decides a case,albeit on what this court concludes are unnecessary constitutional grounds,our usual custom is to affirm on the narrower,dispositive ground available.quotation marks omitted.
the tsp violated fisa and title iii 
the government contends that it would be imprudent to address plaintiffs fisa claim without a district court decision addressing the predicate questions necessary to the resolution of that claim in the first instance.this argument overlooks the fact that an appellate court possessed of proper jurisdiction can affirm on any ground fairly supported by the record.see in re cleveland tankers,cir.moreover,as the following analysis indicates,no predicate findings from the district court are needed to resolve the plaintiffs statutory argument.
both fisa and title iii expressly prohibit electronic surveillance outside of their statutory frameworks,as set forth in part.above.the language used is unequivocal.in enacting fisa,congress directed that electronic surveillance conducted inside the united states for foreign intelligence purposes was to be undertaken only as authorized by specific federal statutory authority.see.title iii criminalizes the interception and disclosure of wire,oral,and electronic communications except under certain specified exceptions.see f.the statute clearly states that chapter and fisa shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and the interception of domestic wire,oral,and electronic communications may be conducted.id.emphasis added.
in construing statutory language,we assume that congress said what it meant.united states labonte,d.where the text of a statute is clear,we need not assess the legislative history of the provision.circuit city stores,adams,d.i nonetheless reiterate that the legislative history of fisa clearly reinforces the conclusion that fisa and title iii constitute the sole means by which electronic surveillance may lawfully be conducted.during a conference session on the fisa legislation,members of congress rejected language that would have described fisa and title iii as the exclusive statutory means by which electronic surveillance was permitted,preferring instead the broader construction,exclusive means.conf,at,reprinted in.
congress has thus unequivocally declared that fisa and title iii are the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance is permitted.no other authorization can comply with the law.congress further emphasized this point by criminalizing the undertaking of electronic surveillance not authorized by statute in two separate places in the.see e.the government,however,contends that congress authorized the tsp in the aftermath of the september,attacks by enacting the authorization for use of military force aumf,stat.in addition,the government notes that foreign intelligence gathering is vital to the successful prosecution of war.
but fisa itself expressly and specifically restricts the president authority even in times of war.the statute provides that n otwithstanding any other law,the president,through the attorney general,may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war by the congress.fisa thus limits warrantless electronic surveillance to the first days following a declaration of war,a more formal action than even the enactment of an authorization for the use of force.this period of warrantless surveillance was enacted to permit consideration of any amendment to this act that may be appropriate during a wartime emergency.conf,at,reprinted at.
to be sure,congress in likely did not contemplate a situation such as the one that arose with the attacks of september.but in the aftermath of those attacks,congress has shown itself both willing and able to consider appropriate amendments to fisa.congress has in fact amended fisa multiple times since september,increasing the president authority by permitting roving wiretaps and expanding the permissible use of devices.see usa patriot act of,as amended by,codified as amended at and.
but congress has never suspended fisa application nor altered the limit on warrantless electronic surveillance.id.the attorney general has in fact acknowledged that the bush administration has never sought an amendment to fisa that might have provided authorization for the tsp or a similar program because certain members of congress allegedly informed the administration that such an amendment would be difficult,if not impossible to obtain.press briefing by alberto gonzales,att y.gov news releases.html.
yet the tsp is precisely the type of program that fisa was enacted to oversee.a senior department of justice official has conceded that the tsp involved warrantless electronic surveillance of communications into and out of the united states.letter from william moschella,assistant att y,to the honorable pat roberts,the honorable john rockefeller,iv,the honorable peter hoekstra,the honorable jane harman,at,http www.nationalreview.com pdf nsa.pdf.the tsp,in addition,operated without a court order.press briefing by alberto gonzales,att y.html.
in arguing that the tsp did not violate fisa,the government contends that congress authorized such warrantless electronic surveillance when it passed the aumf.the aumf states in pertinent part 
t hat the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,organizations,or persons he determines planned,authorized,committed,or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september,or harbored such organizations or persons,in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations,organizations or persons.
according to the government,the aumf provides the authorization necessary to satisfy fisa prohibition on electronic surveillance except as authorized by statute.see a.no reference to surveillance,however,is found in the aumf.instead,the government argument rests on a general inference to be drawn from the aumf in other words,that the phrase all necessary and appropriate force encompasses electronic surveillance by implication.but this interpretation of the aumf directly conflicts with the specific statutory language of both fisa and title iii.
in particular,the government argument requires us to accept that the aumf has implicitly repealed the exclusive means provision of title iii.see f.the problem with this position is that neither the caselaw nor the rules of statutory construction support the government argument.certainly the express language of the aumf can not sustain such an interpretation because,as noted above,it says nothing about electronic surveillance.in,congress criminalized the undertaking of electronic surveillance except as specifically provided in this chapter or as authorized by fisa.the aumf is neither in this chapter nor designated as an amendment to fisa.in order to give the government argument effect then,the aumf must either repeal the exclusive means provision of the original fisa legislation as codified in title iii or work in conjunction with fisa.
repeals by implication are not favored,ex parte yerger,wall,and are appropriate only when established by overwhelming evidence that congress intended the repeal and when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.ag.supply,pioneer int l,d.in the present situation,the statutes are easily reconciled fisa places limits on the means by which the president may fulfill his duties under the aumf.the president is free to engage in surveillance without a warrant up to the limits set by congress when it enacted fisa,which is in keeping with congress stated purpose to curb the practice by which the executive branch may conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on its own unilateral determination that national security justifies it,pt.i,at,reprinted at.
fisa,as noted previously,includes explicit provisions for wartime usage.the government argues that if the aumf has not implicitly repealed the provision,then the aumf and fisa must be in conflict,and that the aumf should trump fisa.this disregards the fact that shortly after enacting the aumf,congress amended certain provisions of fisa through its enactment of the usa patriot act,as described above.congress thus saw no conflict between fisa and the aumf.wright,cir concluding that congress enactment of the usa patriot act,with specific provisions relating to the detention of terrorist aliens such as the plaintiff,provides still another reason why we can not assume that congress silently empowered the president in the aumf to order the indefinite military detention without any criminal process of civilian terrorist aliens as enemy combatants.
in addition,the government argument completely ignores two fundamental principles of statutory construction.the first relevant principle is that when interpreting potentially conflicting statutes,a more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one,regardless of their temporal sequence.busic united states,d see also morales twa,d noting that a specific and carefully drawn statute prevails over a more general one.fisa provisions regarding wartime electronic surveillance are detailed and specific.the aumf,in contrast,sweeps broadly,making no reference at all to electronic surveillance.
to read the statutes as the government suggests would render fisa provisions relating to wartime usage mere surplusage.such a reading would run counter to the second relevant principle of statutory construction that requires courts to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.montclair ramsdell.see also united states perry,cir discussing the rule against surplusage in statutory construction.thus,fisa prevails over the aumf with respect to electronic surveillance in the context of this case.
in addition,the government reading of the phrase except as authorized by statute strains the legislative record.see elizabeth bazan jennifer elsea,cong.research,presidential authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information,at,noting that the legislative history appears to reflect an intention that the phrase authorized by statute was a reference to chapter of title of the title iii and to fisa itself,rather than having a broader meaning.i accordingly believe that the legislative history does not support the government reading.
the government also contends that the aumf can be read as a more specific statute than fisa based on recent supreme court jurisprudence.in hamdi rumsfeld,d,a plurality of the court concluded that b ecause detention to prevent a combatant return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war,in permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force,congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.the plurality then reached the conclusion that the aumf is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe,namely individuals who were part of or supporting forces hostile to the united states or coalition partners in afghanistan and who engaged in an armed conflict against the united states there.hamdi,at.plurality quotation marks omitted.despite the stated narrowness of this holding,the government argues that hamdi allows us to read the aumf as authorizing signals intelligence gathering on and other suspected terrorists,and to construe such signals intelligence as including electronic surveillance targeting persons inside this country.
but fisa wartime provision distinguishes the present situation from that raised in hamdi.congress had not enacted a law at the time of the hamdi decision that specifically authorized the unlimited detention of american citizens during wartime,and the effect of that legislative omission was the subject of the analysis in the hamdi decision.at.in contrast,congress has enacted a law fisa that specifically authorizes electronic surveillance within the for foreign intelligence purposes,and has specifically included a provision dealing with times of war.what was thus found to be a reasonable exercise of authority where congress had been silent becomes an unreasonable exercise where congress has plainly spoken.see also youngstown sheet tube sawyer.jackson,concurring discussing the authority of the president and how it relates to congressional enactments.
finally,the supreme court more recent decision in hamdan rumsfeld,d,clearly rejected the government theory of the aumf.the court in hamdan declined to read the aumf as implicitly authorizing the president to override a provision in the uniform code of military justice ucmj that sets forth the conditions for convening military commissions in lieu of.t here is nothing in the text or legislative history of the aumf even hinting that congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in article of the ucmj.hamdan.at.
the same observation holds true in the present case.nothing in the aumf suggests that congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in fisa.moreover,the text and the legislative history of fisa and title iii make quite clear that the tsp or a similar program can be authorized only through those two statutes.the tsp plainly violated fisa and title iii and,unless there exists some authority for the president to supersede this statutory authority,was therefore unlawful.
inherent authority 
the government final defense is that the constitution grants the president the inherent authority to intercept the international communications of those affiliated with al qaeda.a contrary position would,according to the government,present a grave constitutional question of the highest order.for that reason,the government contends that we should follow the canon of constitutional avoidance and construe fisa and the aumf to avoid any constitutional conflict.see edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d discussing the canon of constitutional avoidance.
but the canon of constitutional avoidance is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means.clark martinez,d discussing the role played by the canon of constitutional avoidance in statutory interpretation.instead,its purpose is to allow courts to construe a statute so as to avoid serious constitutional problems,unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress.debartolo,at.emphasis added.
the constitution divides the nation war powers between the executive and the legislative branches.see const.art.i,setting forth the powers of congress art.ii,setting forth the powers of the president see also youngstown,at.jackson,concurring noting that the powers of the president depend upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of congress.in contrast to the government suggestion,the president does not have exclusive war powers.const.art.i,setting forth the affirmative powers of the congress,including the power t o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.
the constitution expressly grants congress the power to make laws in the context of national defense.id.moreover,the constitution requires the president to conform to duly enacted laws.const.art.ii,h e shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.this requirement endures even in times of war.in little barreme,cranch,for example,the supreme court held that during the quasi war with france,the president could not give instructions that ran counter to a validly enacted statute,despite the fact that the president construction seemed to give the law better effect.the supreme court reiterated this principle in ex parte milligan,wall,holding that the habeas corpus act of barred the president from denying habeas corpus rights to a detainee who was captured outside the area of battle.more recently,the court held in hamdan that the president may not disregard limitations that congress has,in proper exercise of its own war powers,placed on his powers.hamdan.at citing youngstown,at.jackson,concurring.
the supreme court fully addressed the question of the inherent authority of the president in youngstown.there,the court struck down president truman executive order to seize domestic facilities during the korean war.in his famous concurring opinion,justice jackson described our tripartite system as one of separateness but interdependence,autonomy but reciprocity.youngstown,at.jackson,concurring.presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate,depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of congress.id.he then laid out the three zones of presidential power as follows 
when the president acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of congress,his authority is at its maximum,for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that congress can delegate 
when the president acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority,he can only rely upon his own independent powers,but there is a zone of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent authority,or in which its distribution is uncertain 
when the president takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of congress,his power is at its lowest ebb,for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of congress over the matter.
when the president acts in zone,c ourts can sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case only by disabling the congress from acting upon the subject.presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution,for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.id.at.footnote omitted.
we must thus determine into which zone the tsp fits.from that determination,the program will stand or fall.the government argues that the tsp fits into zone,where the president authority is at its zenith.but this argument ignores congress clear directive that fisa and title iii constitute the exclusive means for undertaking electronic surveillance within the united states for foreign intelligence purposes.the result might not be what the president would prefer,but that does not give him license to disregard limitations that congress has placed on his powers.hamdan.at.in light of fisa and title iii,i have no doubt that the tsp falls into zone,where the president authority is at its lowest ebb.
the government,however,turns to a case from the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review as support for its argument that the president has inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance.see in re sealed case,per curiam.to be sure,the sealed case court stated in dicta that w e take for granted that the president does have the inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information.id.at.this dicta,however,is unpersuasive because the sealed case court relied on a fourth circuit decision from that dealt with a challenge to surveillance.id.discussing united states truong dinh hung,cir.
the sealed case court discussed truong for the purpose of determining whether the fourth circuit had articulated the proper constitutional standard for evaluating a fourth amendment challenge to fisa.id.at.finding that truong did set forth the proper standard,the sealed case court applied the same standard to uphold the act version of fisa against a fourth amendment challenge.id.at.in sum,the dicta in sealed case can not overcome the fact that congress has unequivocally acted within its constitutional power to limit the president authority over warrantless electronic surveillance within this country.
finally,all of the courts to have considered the question of whether fisa was constitutional before the statute was amended by the usa patriot act of have in fact upheld the statute.see united states nicholson,collecting cases upholding fisa against various constitutional challenges.those courts that have considered the constitutionality of fisa since it was amended by the usa patriot act have likewise upheld the statute against constitutional challenges.see united states ning wen,cir finding no conflict with the fourth amendment where evidence obtained pursuant to a fisa court order was used in a criminal prosecution united states damrah,cir noting that fisa has uniformly been held to be consistent with the fourth amendment in re sealed case,at.in light of these persuasive authorities,i find no merit to the government inherent authority argument.
plaintiffs datamining 
the plaintiffs raise a from the district court grant of summary judgment to the government on the plaintiffs datamining claim.after a careful review of the record,i conclude that the district court analysis of this issue and of the preclusive effect of the privilege is persuasive.i would therefore not disturb the district court judgment on the plaintiffs datamining claim.
ii.conclusion 
the closest question in this case,in my opinion,is whether the plaintiffs have the standing to sue.once past that hurdle,however,the rest gets progressively easier.mootness is not a problem because of the government position that it retains the right to opt out of the fisa regime whenever it chooses.its aumf and arguments are weak in light of existing precedent and the rules of statutory construction.finally,when faced with the clear wording of fisa and title iii that these statutes provide the exclusive means for the government to engage in electronic surveillance within the united states for foreign intelligence purposes,the conclusion becomes inescapable that the tsp was unlawful.i would therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
this cause was heard on the record from the district court and was argued by counsel.

the state secrets doctrine has two applications a rule of evidentiary privilege,see united states reynolds,and a rule of,see tenet doe,d.the present case implicates only the rule of state secrets evidentiary privilege.the rule of applies when the subject matter of the lawsuit is itself a state secret,so the claim can not survive.see id.espionage contract weinberger catholic action of haw.peace educ.project,d storage of nuclear weapons totten united states.espionage contract.if litigation would necessitate admission or disclosure of even the existence of the secret,then the case is and must be dismissed on the pleadings.because the government has already acknowledged the existence of the warrantless wiretapping in this case,there is no risk of such disclosure and the rule of does not apply.the alleged data mining,which has not been publicly acknowledged,might fall within this rule.but,under the present analysis,a decision on this matter is unnecessary.
the plaintiffs have not challenged on appeal either the invocation or the grant of the state secrets privilege and that issue is not before the court.at oral argument,judge gilman asked the plaintiffs counsel if the court should remand for further in support of standing.counsel asserted that the plaintiffs injuries were clear and undisputed in the record and there was no need to remand for a hearing or admission of additional evidence on this issue.to be sure,the parties dispute the implications of the privilege,whether the publicly available information about the tsp is sufficient to establish their claims,but it would not be appropriate to inquire,sua sponte,into the propriety of the nsa invocation of the privilege,the district court grant of the privilege,or the scope of the privilege government provided the district court an opportunity to review certain,secret documents,in camera and under seal,as support for the invocation of the state secrets privilege.the government provided each member of this panel with an opportunity to review those same documents,also in camera and under seal,in order to provide a complete record on appeal.finally,the government provided each member of this panel an opportunity to review,in camera and under seal,certain additional,privileged documents as support for the government contention that the appeal had been rendered moot.see fn,infra.at the behest of the government,i reviewed these privileged documents,but their excluded from our consideration and i have not relied on any of that information in this opinion.the state secrets privilege granted by the district court has been maintained on appeal and this opinion is decided solely on the publicly available information that was admitted by the district court and made a part of its record.
on january,a judge of the foreign intelligence surveillance court issued orders authorizing the government to target for collection international communications into or out of the united states where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of al qaeda or an associated terrorist organization.letter from att y alberto gonzales to chair.of the comm.on the judiciary patrick leahy,available at.nytimes.com packages pdf politics gonzales letter.pdf last visited july.according to a letter written by the attorney general,any electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the tsp will now be conduct subject to the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance court.id.the nsa filed a submission with this court,discussing the implication of the intervening fisa court order and contending that the case should be dismissed as moot.the plaintiffs filed a response,disputing any notion that this appeal had been rendered moot by the fisa court order.based on the analysis presented herein,it is unnecessary to reach the issue of intervening mootness.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.
on the merits of this appeal,this court is presented with a cascade of serious questions.has the nsa violated the united states first amendment,the fourth amendment,or the separation of powers doctrine or,has the nsa violated federal apa,fisa,or title iii if the nsa has violated a federal statute,is that statute constitutional when applied to the nsa in this manner if the nsa has violated either the constitution or a valid federal statute,is an injunction justified and,if an injunction is justified,what is its proper scope the district court answered all of the questions in the affirmative and imposed an injunction of the broadest possible scope.
a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.laidlaw,at.citing city of los angeles lyons,d notwithstanding that the plaintiff had standing to pursue damages,he lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief.
after argument on this appeal,the plaintiffs filed a citation to supplemental authority,urging us to rely on the supreme court recent decision in massachusetts epa,d only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review.that case,however,offers no direct legal support for the plaintiffs claim of standing because it involves a petition for review,a particular cause of action under b,see id.at,which has no applicability in the present case.
the plaintiffs,in the plain language of their complaint,actually assert only one statutory cause of action,predicated on the apa.they claim that the nsa violated the substantive provisions of fisa and title iii,and contend that this establishes standing for an apa cause of action even if they can not establish standing to litigate a cause of action under either fisa or title iii civil suit provisions,under the relevant statutes.because the apa itself has no applicability in the present circumstances,see section,the plaintiffs references to fisa and title iii are construed liberally in this opinion,as assertions of independent causes of action under each,to consider whether the plaintiffs had standing to litigate their case despite the possible inartfulness of their pleading.
this injury,as alleged,actually appears to implicate the fifth or sixth amendments,see,united states robel,d brennan,concurring quoting greene mcelroy,d stating that the right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within the liberty and property concepts of the fifth amendment sinclair schriber,cir describing a violation of the sixth amendment right to counsel ensuing from government surveillance berlin democratic club rumsfeld,considering an alleged violation of the sixth amendment due to electronic surveillance of conversations between his attorney and a consultant,but the plaintiffs have not asserted these causes of action.
some plaintiffs appear to describe this injury as an untenable choice,in which they must decide between their professional duty,completing the job and complying with their ethical duties.even accepting,arguendo,that these plaintiffs are bound by these duties,this description is incorrect.while these circumstances demand that the plaintiffs comply with both obligations,this dual compliance is tenable compliance with both obligations will simply be more costly,time consuming,and burdensome.the obligations are not conflicting or mutually exclusive.the choice is actually between paying the cost of this dual compliance or not completing the job,and therefore,the injury is the added cost of completing the job,in compliance with the ethical duties,under the present circumstances.
at oral argument,the plaintiffs counsel conceded that it would be unprecedented for a court to find standing for a person to litigate a fourth amendment cause of action without any evidence that the defendant,government had actually subjected that particular person to an illegal search or seizure.the plaintiffs briefs are not to the contrary.
as will be discussed in section,however,she could this standing to litigate a first amendment cause of action.see laird tatum,d holding that standing is not satisfied by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his first amendment rights is being chilled by the mere existence,without more,of a governmental investigative and activity.
note that a legal determination of objective reasonableness would require additional specific information about the mechanics of the tsp,such as the number of communications being intercepted,the percentage of the total that number represents,the actual selection and screening process,the actual retention,dissemination,and disclosure policy.this information is unavailable due to the state secrets doctrine.see reynolds,at.
to clarify if the plaintiffs and their overseas contacts were to proceed with the telephone and email communications,in disregard of the tsp thereby incurring no additional cost,burden,or diminution of professional performance,and none of their communications were ever actually intercepted by the nsa,then there would be no injury to these plaintiffs due to the nsa conduct.under this scenario,even if the nsa,unbeknownst to the plaintiffs,did intercept a communication,there would be no tangible injury until the nsa disclosed the information presumably in a manner demonstrating a direct injury to the plaintiffs or their contacts.therefore,it is only by refraining from the communications that the plaintiffs can transmute a speculative future injury into an actual present injury.
see gordon warren consol.bd.of,cir explaining that surveillance,which falls under the fourth amendment,does not violate first amendment rights,even though it may be directed at communicative or associative activities.the first amendment protects public speech and the free exchange of ideas,paul,d,while the fourth amendment protects citizens from unwanted intrusion into their personal lives and effects,katz united states,d.otherwise stated,the first amendment protects one right to associate and be heard,while the fourth amendment protects the right to remain unheard.the first amendment protects one posting of a sign in her front yard,while the fourth amendment protects her hiding of the same sign in her basement.
see section citing rakas illinois,d fourth amendment rights are personal rights which,like some other constitutional rights,may not be vicariously asserted.and section citing,at report by the permanent select comm.on,in support of the proposed fisa bill and amendments t he term aggrieved person is intended to be coextensive with,but no broader than,those persons who have standing to raise claims under the fourth amendment with respect to electronic surveillance.
at oral argument,the plaintiffs counsel conceded that it would be unprecedented for a court to find standing for a person to litigate a fourth amendment cause of action without any evidence that the defendant,government had actually subjected that particular person to an illegal search or seizure.the plaintiffs briefs are not to the contrary.
see,eisenstadt baird,d indeed,in first amendment cases we have relaxed our rules of standing without regard to the relationship between the litigant and those whose rights he seeks to assert precisely because application of those rules would have an intolerable,inhibitory effect on freedom of speech.metromedia,city of san diego,d the most important exception to this standing doctrine permits some litigants to challenge on first amendment grounds laws that may validly be applied against them but which may,because of their unnecessarily broad reach,inhibit the protected speech of third parties.
sierra club twice acknowledges that courts reach this analysis only where it is determined that the controversy at issue is otherwise justiciable.sierra club,at.justiciability,of course,includes numerous doctrines,including mootness,standing,the prohibition on advisory opinions,and the political question doctrine.see flast cohen,d.sierra club use of the term otherwise justiciable thus refers to the doctrines of justiciability other than standing.assuming that these other justiciability doctrines are satisfied,sierra club distinguishes between standing analysis for statutory and claims.for claims,which include the constitutional claims at issue here,sierra club requires the plaintiffs to show that they have a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.sierra club,at.the court used this personal stake in the outcome language to define article iii standing prior to its adoption of the test in lujan defenders of wildlife,d.but the standing analysis is different for statutory claims.sierra club instructs courts that the inquiry as to standing must begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.sierra club,at.this instruction to begin standing analysis with the statutory language makes perfect sense in light of the legal principle that congress may enact statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing,even though no injury would exist without the statute.linda richard,d see also simon.welfare rights,d,recognizing congress power to create new interests the invasion of which will confer standing.thus the analysis of whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring a statutory claim necessarily requires a determination of whether the plaintiffs were injured under the relevant statute.
there is,in fact,a certain view that this is not a first amendment issue at all.see gordon warren consol.bd.of,cir noting that surveillance,which falls under the fourth amendment,does not violate first amendment rights,even though it may be directed at communicative or associative activities.ultimately,however,this distinction is a merits issue that i need indeed at this stage.
laird involved a first amendment claim.i do not assert or imply that laird holding,which i narrowly construe as regarding only a subjective chill on first amendment rights,extends to any other causes of action.
as discussed in section ii,this scenario could result in a breach of the plaintiffs privacy under the fourth amendment,but the present analysis concerns only the first amendment cause of action.the fourth amendment,and harms attributable to a defendant breach of its protections,necessitate a different analysis.see section.
the plaintiffs who are lawyers take this argument one step further,alleging that their concerns render them incapable of communicating with their clients and others,which their duty of zealous representation to these clients demands.because they assume with their well founded belief that their communications will be intercepted,they assert that knowingly engaging in such communications would breach their duty to keep those communications confidential.therefore,they argue,their professionally imposed ethical obligations make the alleged effects more acute.as a lawyer,i am certainly mindful of these concerns,but i can not escape the fact that they are premised on the plaintiffs duties to their clients,and not on a personal harm to themselves.a client,after all,can waive such confidentiality,and if a fully informed overseas client who does not fear the nsa chooses to communicate with full awareness that the nsa might be listening,then the lawyer would not breach any duty by engaging in such communication.
in fact,the plaintiffs are claiming that the nsa surveillance coupled with their own ethical obligations has chilled them from making international calls to sources and clients,as has been discussed throughout this opinion thus far.the district court simply misunderstood the extent of the plaintiffs claims.
in finding an injury on this unwillingness of the plaintiffs overseas contacts to communicate due to their fear that the nsa is district court relied on affidavits submitted by several of the individual plaintiffs.none of the overseas contacts provided an affidavit or testimony of their alleged fear the theory is based solely on the plaintiffs own testimony,which is and may be inadmissible as hearsay.ultimately,however,the questionable character of this evidence has no bearing on this analysis,because the outcome is the same even if i assume it to be true.
but see the discussion of the causation element in this first amendment analysis,infra,regarding the difficulties of obtaining standing based on the conduct of actors.
the plaintiffs have not claimed membership in any overriding organization that would include the plaintiffs and the overseas contacts.there has been no suggestion that the plaintiff journalists,academics,or lawyers are members of al qaeda,or that their overseas suspected by the nsa of being al qaeda operatives or or desire to be members of some organization of american journalists,academics,or lawyers.
certain plaintiffs are organizations american civil liberties union,council on american islamic relations,greenpeace and it is therefore possible that these plaintiffs,on a different record,might assert organizational injury.
the fourth amendment warrant requirement involves interjection of a neutral and detached magistrate,demonstration of probable cause,and description of the things to be seized or the place to be searched.see dalia united states,d united states dist.keith,d.the more obscure fisa warrant requirement involves a petition by a federal official,with the approval of the attorney general,a,to a special fisa court,a,for an order approving the electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes,based upon probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power,a a.the fisa petition and order must include,among other things,provisions to limit the duration,a,c e,e,and content,a,c c,i,of the surveillance,and provisions to ensure the minimization of the acquisition,retention,and dissemination of the information,a,a,c a,h.
fisa applicability,the plaintiffs standing to bring a cause of action under fisa is addressed separately in section,infra.the present discussion,which concerns only the plaintiffs assertion that their first amendment injuries are caused by the nsa failure to comply with fisa or would be redressed by imposing fisa requirements,assumes fisa applicability and does not address standing vis a vis a fisa cause of action.
fisa does not necessarily prohibit even the interception of communications.because fisa states that n o otherwise privileged communication obtained in accordance with fisa shall lose its privileged character,a,it therefore follows that fisa,at least in some instances,authorizes the interception of privileged communications,which presumably includes communications between attorney and client.for example,fisa might not prohibit the interception of communications under circumstances where the nsa adheres to a policy of complete.due to the state secrets doctrine,the plaintiffs do not and can not know whether the nsa actually adheres to a policy of complete,but based on the record evidence,it certainly remains possible.the plaintiffs have never alleged,nor is there evidence in the present record to suggest,that the information collected by the nsa under the tsp has been disclosed to anyone for any purpose.see aclu nsa,d at the perceived need for secrecy has apparently required that no person be notified that he is aggrieved by the activity,and there have been no prosecutions,no requests for extensions or retroact
