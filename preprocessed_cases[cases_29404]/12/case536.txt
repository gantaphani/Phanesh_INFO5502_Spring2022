in,congress enacted the fca,which required telecommunications carriers to file a list of tariffs with the federal communications commission fcc showing all charges and the classifications,practices,and regulations affecting such charges.a.the purpose was to prevent unreasonableness and discrimination in charges.mci telecomms.v.at t,d.to ensure compliance with the tariff,courts developed the filed rate doctrine,which prohibited a regulated entity from charging rates for its services other than those specified in its duly filed tariff.ting,cir.under the doctrine,the rights and liabilities defined by the tariff could not be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier,and federal law preempted state law claims seeking to enforce a rate that varied from the filed rate.id.internal quotation marks citation omitted.
the telecommunications act of,stat,subsequently detariffed the regulatory scheme.id.at.the new regime went into effect in july,however,after each of the plaintiffs had already filed its action.since the filed rate doctrine was in force at the time the plaintiffs filed their actions,we apply the law as it stood when the doctrine was in force.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under the fca.the district court held that the fca claims were nonjusticiable pursuant to the doctrine.we review the district court dismissal de novo.see zimmerman city of oakland,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed under rule b unless it appears beyond a doubt that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claim s that would entitle them to relief.evanns,cir internal quotation marks footnote omitted.
under the fca,every common carrier must file tariffs showing all charges and the classifications,practices,and regulations affecting such charges.a.the doctrine derives from the requirements of the fca.evanns,at.we have described the doctrine as follows 
o nce a carrier tariff is approved by the fcc,the terms of the federal tariff are considered to be the law and to therefore conclusively and exclusively enumerate the rights and liabilities as between the carrier and the customer.not only is a carrier forbidden from charging rates other than as set out in its filed tariff,but customers are also charged with notice of the terms and rates set out in that filed tariff and may not bring an action against a carrier that would invalidate,alter or add to the terms of the filed tariff.

plaintiffs argue that the charges,practices,and regulations in defendants tariffs are unjust or unreasonable because their terms are not clear and do not contain explicit explanatory statements regarding the rates and regulations.this argument is foreclosed.brown mci worldcom network,held that no one may bring a judicial challenge to the validity of a filed tariff,and that t he doctrine precludes courts from deciding whether a tariff is reasonable,reserving the evaluation of tariffs to the fcc,cir accord cahnmann,at.in brown,the plaintiff claims were justiciable only because the plaintiff sought to have the court interpret and enforce the terms of a tariff,not to challenge the filed tariff itself.at.we observed,however,that the doctrine precludes courts from determining whether a tariff is reasonable.id.at.
plaintiffs are not helped by their citation of security services k mart corporation,d.there,the court held that the common carrier could not recover under the tariff because there was essentially no tariff on file.id.at.that is not the case here.defendants had a tariff on file that had been approved by the fcc.plaintiffs fca claims were a direct challenge to the filed rate,and consequently barred by the doctrine.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs fca claims.
sound travel contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for remand.sound travel complaint alleges only one legal claim violation of the washington consumer protection act.in essence,sound travel alleges that nos violated the washington consumer protection act by marketing false billing information and by failing to notify consumers of differences between the quoted price and the actual price.it seeks damages due to economic loss,reasonable attorney fees and litigation expenses,and treble,exemplary punitive damages.we review de novo the district court denial of sound travel motion to remand.see audette int l longshoremen warehousemen union,cir.
