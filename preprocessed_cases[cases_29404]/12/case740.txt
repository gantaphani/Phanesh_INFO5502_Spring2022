petitioners are rural telephone carriers.pursuant to and a,they seek review of an october,memorandum opinion and order of the federal communications commission dealing with telephone number portability between wireless carriers.telephone number requests for clarification of porting issues,cc docket,wl october order.the issues are whether the commission adopted the october order in violation of the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act and the regulatory flexibility act,and whether the order is arbitrary and capricious.
under b of the telecommunications act of,all local exchange carriers lecs must provide,to the extent technically feasible,number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the commission.b.the act also imposes a duty on lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b.the act defines number portability as 
the ability of users of telecommunications services to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality,reliability,or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.
congress viewed number portability as a means of encouraging competition a customer is less likely to switch carriers if he can not retain his telephone number.cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc,ctia.
in july,the commission issued rules and deployment schedules to implement number portability.see telephone number portability,wl first portability order,on,wl,further,wl.adopting the statutory definition of number portability in a regulation,l,the commission required lecs to begin implementing number portability to other lecs,and to all telecommunications carriers,including commercial mobile radio services cmrs providers.first portability order,at emphasis added.although b imposed number portability only on lecs,the commission relied on other statutory provisions to require to port numbers among themselves and to and from lecs.at see ctia,at.
at the same time,the commission refused to impose location portability on either lecs or wireless carriers.the commission defined location portability as the ability of users of telecommunications services to retain existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality,reliability,or convenience when moving from one physical location to another.j.for lecs,what the commission meant by physical location was not certain.among the possibilities were the customer physical location,the end of the wire physical location,or the rate center physical location.in the matter of starnet,cir.every number is assigned to a rate center,which is a specific geographic location the lec designates with the approval of a state regulatory commission.for wireline customers,service is fixed at the rate center the lec uses the rate center to determine whether a call is a local call or a toll call.the service areas of wireless carriers tend to be larger because wireless service is mobile,wireless customers can travel out of a rate center and make calls without incurring toll charges.for wireless carriers,the commission said it would impose service provider portability.its regulation defining service provider portability used the same language as the regulatory and statutory definition of number,the ability of users of telecommunications services to retain,at the same location,existing telecommunications numbers without impairment of quality,reliability,or convenience when switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.q.the commission indicated what it meant by moving from one physical location to another when it wrote today,telephone subscribers must change their telephone numbers when they move outside the area served by their current central office.first portability order,at.a central office is a switching unit,in a telephone system which provides service to the general public,having the necessary equipment and operations arrangements for terminating and interconnecting subscriber lines,pt.
to address technical issues regarding number portability,the commission turned to the north american numbering council nanc,a federal advisory committee consisting of representatives of the telecommunications industry.in may,the nanc submitted its recommendations regarding porting.largely adopting the nanc recommendations in a second portability order,wl,the commission also decided that if a state regulatory authority imposed a separate location portability requirement on lecs,this would have to be limited to carriers with a local presence in the same rate center in order to ensure proper rating and routing of calls.the nanc did not address geographic limitations with respect to the obligation of wireless carriers to furnish service provider portability.the commission therefore requested the nanc to make recommendations regarding wireless carriers,such as how to account for differences between service area boundaries for wireline versus wireless services and how to implement number portability in a roaming environment.id.at.in,the nanc later reported that it had been unable to reach a consensus about intermodal porting,that is,porting between wireless carriers and lecs.
after granting extensions for deploying porting and intermodal porting,the commission set november,as the date by which lecs had to port to wireless carriers and wireless carriers had to port numbers among themselves in the nation largest population centers.in other areas,wireless porting had to occur months later.as the deadlines approached,the cellular telecommunications internet association ctia filed petitions with the commission seeking declaratory rulings holding,among other things,that lecs had a duty to port numbers to those wireless carriers whose service areas overlapped the wireline rate center associated with the number,and that wireless carriers had a duty to port numbers to other wireless carriers if their service areas overlapped.
ctia filed its petitions pursuant to,which states that the commission may,in accordance with section e of the administrative procedure act,on motion or on its own motion issue a declaratory ruling terminating a controversy or removing uncertainty.ctia alleged that certain lecs and rural wireless carriers were narrowly construing their obligation to port numbers to cmrs carriers,claiming that they did not have to port numbers to cmrs carriers that had neither a presence in the rate center from which the ported number originated nor a direct interconnection with the customer original carrier.the commission published notices in the federal register seeking comments on the issues ctia raised.june.
among the comments filed with the commission were those of the rural telecommunications group rtg,of which at least some petitioners are members.as relevant to this case,the rtg asserted that in order for one wireless carrier to request number portability from another,the requesting carrier must have a local point of presence,local numbering resources,and local interconnection with the porting out carrier in the rate center with which the ported number is associated.october order,at.if these requirements were not imposed,according to the rtg,number portability will lead to massive customer confusion and discrimination against small and rural carriers.id.
the commission issued two opinions and orders in response to ctia petitions.the first,handed down on october,the october order,dealt only with porting.the second,issued on november,dealt with porting.only the october order is before us in this case.
the october order rejected the rtg claims.the commission decided that nothing in its rules restricted number portability in the manner the rtg proposed and that imposing those restrictions would undermine the competitive benefits of number portability.to limit porting based on wireline rate centers would be to limit the ability of some consumers to port their telephone numbers from one wireless carrier to another.we see no reason to impose such restrictions on the competitive alternatives available to wireless consumers.october order,at.the commission recognized the rating issues rural wireless carriers had raised and their concern that in porting numbers to wireless carriers that do not have a point of presence in the local area,a donating rural wireless carrier delivering a call to a ported number would be forced to deliver the call outside of its local service area and thereby incur transport charges that were not factored into its rate design.id.at.the commission refused to address these issues in its october order because its wireless porting rules did not depend on how calls to the number will be rated and routed after the port occurs and because it would consider the issues in separate proceedings.id.the end of the opinion,in a section entitled procedural matters and ordering clauses,stated the commission is not required by the regulatory flexibility act,to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of the possible economic impact of this order on small entities.id.at.
one month later,in another memorandum opinion and order which we shall call the intermodal order,the commission dealt with porting between wireline and wireless carriers.memorandum opinion and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking,wl.although the commission had already limited porting to carriers with facilities or numbering resources in the same rate center,intermodal order,at footnote omitted,it refused to do so for intermodal porting,despite claims that the absence of restrictions would amount to location portability.in the context of intermodal porting,the commission concluded that porting from a wireline to a wireless carrier that does not have a point of interconnection or numbering resources in the same rate center as the ported number does not,in and of itself,constitute location portability,because the rating of calls to the ported number stays the same.id.at.in the intermodal setting,porting is required if the wireless carrier coverage area encompasses the rate center to which the ported number is assigned.id.at.the intermodal order refused to require interconnection agreements for intermodal porting because this would delay intermodal porting and thus undermine its benefits to consumers.id.at.in view of claims that wireless carriers would be getting an unfair competitive advantage over wireline carriers as a result of the intermodal order,the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on,among other things,how to facilitate porting where there is a mismatch between the rate center associated with the wireless number and the rate center in which the wireline carrier seeks to serve the customer.id.at.
petitioners arguments are that the october order constituted a legislative rule promulgated in violation of the administrative procedure act and the regulatory flexibility act,and that even if the order constituted an interpretive rule exempt from notice and comment rulemaking,the order should be set aside as arbitrary and capricious.we believe we may consider the merits of these arguments despite the commission claims that petitioners lack standing and that their petition for judicial review was untimely.
as to standing,the commission argues that the october order did not injure petitioners because their objections are directed to the commission interconnection rules rather than to the porting requirements.we think there is nothing to this.for one thing,two of the four petitioners are both wireline and wireless carriers the other two are lecs only.as wireless carriers,the order directly affects their porting obligations to other wireless carriers and does so,according their lights,despite the commission violations of the procedural and substantive requirements of the apa.that in itself is sufficient to confer standing on them.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.for another thing,even in their capacity as lecs,the order by petitioners financial interests,because they will be unable to recover the additional costs entailed in porting of numbers tied to their rate centers.
we also reject the commission argument that petitioners are really mounting an untimely challenge to the porting requirements of the first portability order because the commission october order merely reiterated those requirements.the argument goes to the merits.petitioners claim that the october order amended the earlier order in violation of the rulemaking procedures of the apa.the petition for judicial review is therefore timely.
the controversy is a common one for this court petitioners view the october order as embodying a substantive rule the commission defends on the ground that the order is an interpretative rule.by a substantive rule or as we call it,a legislative rule,a term not used in the mean a rule that may be promulgated only after compliance with the rulemaking requirements of of the apa.by interpretative rule,a term the apa does use,the commission means a rule that b a exempts from those requirements.b a.
it is fair to ask why both sides assume that we are even dealing with the making of a rule,whether of the legislative or interpretive variety.agencies often have a choice of proceeding by adjudication rather than rulemaking.the national labor relations board,for one,has traditionally preferred to proceed this way and the supreme court has upheld its preference for adjudication.see nlrb bell aerospace,d see also sec chenery.orders handed down in adjudications may establish broad legal principles.in this case,the commission issued its october order in response to ctia petition for declaratory ruling.the petition sought an adjudication.ctia expressly invoked commission rule,a provision giving the commission the authority to issue declaratory orders.section refers to e of the apa,which states the agency,with like effect as in the case of other orders,and in its sound discretion,may issue a declaratory order to terminate a controversy or remove an uncertainty.e.section e is a subsection of the provision governing formal adjudication.while the proceedings in this matter did not constitute formal adjudication,there is some authority to the effect that the declaratory ruling provision in e may be used in informal adjudication.see jeffrey lubbers blake morant,a reexamination of federal agency use of declaratory orders,admin,citing cases but see attorney general manual on the administrative procedure act.the fact that the commission operated under rule,rather than directly under e,may also make a difference.here,the resulting commission ruling is itself styled memorandum opinion and order.opinions are the end products of adjudications.although the commission used the federal register to notify interested parties of ctia petition,and to solicit comments on the issues the petition raised,the federal register announcement did not suggest that the proceeding would be anything other than an adjudication.see.june.see new york state comm on cable television fcc.
we have included the foregoing discussion despite the commission failure to defend the october order on the ground that it resulted from an adjudication.we think it important to make clear that we are simply assuming that the october order,issued in a proceeding commenced under commission rule,constituted some sort of or than the outcome of an informal adjudication.compare sprint fcc.given the broad definition of rule in apa an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy the october order may comfortably be considered a rule,as may many other agency actions.see ronald levin,the case for finally fixing the apa definition of rule,admin.and it may be so considered despite the commission calling what it did here an order.although the apa defines order as a final disposition other than in a rulemaking,the commission uses the designation order even when it issues legislative rules after overt rulemaking.see,first portability order,supra.
as to petitioners complaint that the commission procedure,or lack thereof,violated the apa,the reasons given in the companion case dealing with the november intermodal order,united states telecom ass n,et fcc,usta,are enough to show that the notice and commen
