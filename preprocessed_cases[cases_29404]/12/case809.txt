petitioner acs of anchorage,challenges a federal communications commission order finding that acs exceeded its permissible rate of return for.as a remedy,the commission ordered acs to pay damages plus prejudgment interest to a complaining customer,general communications,gci.see in re general communication,alaska communications systems holdings,memorandum opinion and order,fcc,at,order id.at.acs poses three claims.first,it says that the commission erroneously required it to allocate to its intrastate services the costs associated with calls to internet service providers isps.second,it argues that even if the commission were right on that issue,acs filing of tariffs under a,a provision for streamlined tariffs,barred any damages for overcharges for the period those tariffs were in effect,namely calendar year.see in re implementation of section b a of the telecommunications act of,report and order,fcc rcd streamlined tariff order.third,as to any damages that were due,acs challenges the rate chosen by the fcc for calculating prejudgment interest.we deny acs petition on the first issue,grant its petition on the second,and remand for further proceedings on the third.
acs is the incumbent local exchange carrier lec in anchorage,alaska.order at.as a carrier,one whose rates are limited in terms of the rate of return rather than via price caps,see b,acs files tariff rates for a period,a the rates must be chosen with a view to yielding a rate of return no greater than the maximum.see in re amendment of parts and of the commission rules to reform the interstate rate of return represcription and enforcement processes,fcc rcd.in addition,such carriers periodically submit monitoring reports showing their actual rates of return.these reports may lead carriers to file revised rates,see b,or cause the commission to start proceedings under to prescribe new rates to be thereafter followed.
three tariff filings by acs are pertinent.in april it filed tariff rates for the period from july,to june,the tariff,and in december a correction tariff covering the balance of that period january,to june,the january tariff.see b permitting corrections southwestern bell telephone fcc,describing use of corrections.acs filed the january tariff under the streamlined tariff provisions of a,which in this instance required a notice period.order at.during this notice period,apparently,the commission took no action to suspend the tariffs and initiate a hearing on the rates,see a a,and the tariffs went into effect without any hearing being ordered.
in june,acs filed its rates for the period from july,to june,the july tariff,also pursuant to the streamlined tariff provisions.the july tariff,however,allocated to acs interstate service the switching costs associated with isp calls.order at.previously,acs had treated isp calls as intra state.see id.at,see also acs br.at.this accounting change had the effect of increasing acs reported interstate costs,thereby making its expected rate of return lower than it otherwise would have been.see order at.again,however,the commission took no action during the notice period,and the tariffs went into effect without any hearing being ordered.
in september,acs filed its final monitoring report for the period from january,to december,the report continued to classify traffic as interstate.anchorage telephone utility,rate of return report,order at.had isp costs been classified as intrastate,acs cumulative rate of return would have been or depending on other accounting practices not challenged here,see order at,responses of alaska communications systems holding,and acs of anchorage,to interrogatories,in re general communication,alaska communications systems holdings,file no,at ex,well in excess of the prescribed maximum rate of return of,see in re represcribing the authorized rate of return for interstate services of local exchange carriers,fcc rcd,prescribing maximum rate of return of a stating that maximum allowable rate of return for any access service category is the prescribed rate of return plus.
in august,gci filed a complaint with the commission alleging that acs had improperly calculated its interstate costs by treating isp calls as interstate,and had violated its prescribed rate of return during the monitoring period.order at.the commission agreed with gci,id.at,and ordered acs to pay damages of about million plus prejudgment interest assessed at the internal revenue service corporate overpayment rate,id.at.
petitioning for review,acs challenges the commission classification of isp calls,its failure to treat the a tariff filings as a bar to damages for,and the rate selected for prejudgment interest.
isp calls classification.because the same telecommunications equipment is often used for both intrastate and interstate communications,carriers must apportion their costs for regulatory purposes through what is called the separations process.see generally.acs argues that because fcc has previously recognized isp calls as interstate for jurisdictional purposes under its analysis,in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,reciprocal compensation order,isp calls should be interstate for separations purposes as well.
of course,generally speaking,separations will follow jurisdiction.this basic norm is inherent in the separations formulas found at a,a b,the supreme court decision in smith illinois bell,and our decision in mci telecommunications fcc.but practical considerations may justify divergent least temporarily.see smith,at.at recognizing the practical difficulty of dividing the property between interstate and intrastate services and requiring only reasonable measures for separation.indeed,in mci,we explicitly upheld a deviation from the jurisdictional norm where the commission was implementing a an interim ratemaking solution b justified by a substantial policy objective.mci,at.
while the order does not explicitly invoke the mci exception,we can reasonably discern the path from its reasoning and citations.see bowman transportation,freight system,d syracuse peace council fcc.the interim nature of the decision is quite,of course,a natural concomitant of the novelty of the internet itself.compare,worldcom fcc,wl.may.as the order explains,the commission views its treatment of isp calls as derivative of its policy exempting isps and other enhanced service providers esps from paying interstate access charges normally paid by an interexchange carrier ixc such as and mci for access to the lecs originating and terminating an interexchange call.order at.insofar as the esp exemption is clearly temporary,it follows that the intrastate classification would be as well.see,in re amendments of part of the commission rules relating to the creation of access charge subelements for open network architecture,report and order,fcc rcd,ona order retaining exemption temporarily to provide stability during open tariff architecture reforms in re amendments of part of the commission rules relating to enhanced service providers,fcc rcd,esp exemption order characterizing esp exemption as a temporary measure to avoid unduly burdening the isp industry.furthermore,recent letters issued by the commission common carrier bureau explicitly note that the intrastate classification is an interim measure only.common carrier bureau issues letter to bell atlantic regarding jurisdictional separations treatment of reciprocal compensation for internet traffic,public notice,fcc rcd,see also common carrier bureau issues letter to sbc regarding its jurisdictional separations treatment of internet traffic,public notice,fcc rcd.
the commission primary policy justification for the intrastate classification matches the language it has used for the esp exemption.rather than directly exempting esps from interstate access charges,the commission defined them as end users no different from a local pizzeria or barber shop.see order at,in re amendments of part of the commission rules relating to the creation of access charge subelements for open network architecture,notice of proposed rulemaking,fcc rcd,ona nprm see also m.while this categorization exempted isps from interstate access charges paid by ixcs,it left them obliged to purchase access through intrastate,local business line charges.the commission contends that acs allocation of isp costs to interstate service would thus create a mismatch.order at.the tariff revenue would be allocated to intrastate and the costs to interstate,disrupting calculations.
once the commission has allotted the revenue to intrastate service,plainly it makes sense to allocate the costs there as well.but that might be said merely to relocate the question as the functional significance of the esp exemption is to channel the revenue to intrastate service,one might ask if such an allocation was reasonable.indeed,acs brief addresses the matching principle in economic terms,the proposition that,in the interest of aligning incentives correctly,costs should be borne by the customers who cause them to be incurred.see union ferc.noting that in creating the esp exemption the commission had recognized that it would cause economic distortions,making users of interstate access bear disproportionate costs,acs argues that the commission can not now rely on the matching principle.see acs br.at citing esp exemption order,fcc rcd at.but the commission need rely on the economic principle.all it invokes is a more modest principle of regulatory orderliness.and because we must take the esp exemption as given,with its concomitant potential for economic distortions,the principle of regulatory orderliness indeed supports the commission.
we are left,then,with the commission matching its separations treatment of costs for calls with its classification of those calls for tariffing and revenue purposes.further,not only is the latter unchallenged here,but the commission appears to be working on a number of interconnected parts of the puzzle.the esp exemption itself is temporary.and the commission has set out to reform the regime to which it is an exception,the regime of interstate access charges,see order at,in re access charge reform,first report and order,fcc rcd,and is investigating future regulatory schemes for isps,in re usage of public switched network by information service and internet access providers,notice of inquiry,fcc rcd.further,it is fundamentally rethinking the separations process in light of isps and other market changes.in re jurisdictional separations reform and referral to the joint board,notice of proposed rulemaking,fcc rcd see also report filed by state members of joint board of jurisdictional separations,public notice,fcc rcd.clearly,as we stated in mci,the commission is entitled to substantial deference when it acts to maintain the status quo so that the objectives of a pending rulemaking proceeding will not be frustrated,mci,at,including the objective of implementing revisions in a manner that would cause the least upheaval in the industry,id.accordingly,we can not find the commission interim intrastate classification of costs to be arbitrary or capricious.
damages for rates filed in streamlined tariffs.acs next argues that a,as elaborated upon by the commission in its streamlined tariff order,is a bar to damages for its purported overcharges in.a,part of the telecommunications act of,states 
a local exchange carrier may file with the commission a new or revised charge,classification,regulation,or practice on a streamlined basis.any such charge,classification,regulation,or practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective days in the case of a reduction in rates or days in the case of an increase in rates after the date on which it is filed with the commission unless the commission takes action under paragraph before the end of that or period,as is appropriate.
id.emphasis added.
the terms legal rate and lawful rate come to us burdened with or illuminated by the supreme court decision in arizona grocery atchison,topeka santa fe railway,as the commission recognized in its streamlined tariff order,fcc rcd at,nn.legality mainly addresses procedural validity.t o render rates definite and certain,and to prevent discrimination and other abuses,rates must be filed and published,and deviation from published rates is subject to criminal and civil penalties.arizona grocery,at.at.a particular rate thus becomes legal when it is filed with an agency and becomes effective.but a rate legality is not enough to establish its substantive reasonableness or lawfulness.see id.noting that a rate legality does not abrogate the duty to charge no more than a reasonable rate.a carrier charging a merely legal rate may be subject to refund liability if customers can later show that the rate was unreasonable.id.should an agency declare a rate to be lawful,however,refunds are thereafter impermissible as a form of retroactive ratemaking.see id.at.at.
informed by this dichotomy,the commission in its streamlined tariff order interpreted the deemed lawful language in a as establish ing a conclusive presumption of reasonableness.streamlined tariff order,fcc rcd at.therefore,a streamlined tariff that takes effect without prior suspension or investigation is conclusively presumed to be reasonable and,thus,a lawful tariff during the period that the tariff remains in effect.id.at.in accordance with arizona grocery,these deemed lawful tariffs are not subject to refunds.if a later reexamination shows them to be unreasonable,the commission available remedies will be prospective only.id.at.as the commission emphatically recognized,a effected a considerable change in the regulatory regime before,tariffs that became effective without suspension or investigation were only legal not conclusively lawful,and thereby remained subject to refund remedies.id.at,describing rule as differing radically from past practice id.at,describing previous practice.
clearly then,to the extent that the streamlined tariff provisions apply to acs tariff filings,the commission may not now impose refund liability for covered ones it concludes were unreasonable.the commission,however,argues that the streamlined tariff provisions do not apply.
first it asserts a critical distinction between rates and rates of return.order at.it claims that since the order found acs in violation of its prescribed rate of return,the fact that acs rates might have been deemed lawful under a does not immunize it from refund liability.in support,the commission relies on new england telephone and telegraph fcc,in which we upheld the commission use of a refund remedy for violations of prescribed rates of return.id.at see also mci telecommunications fcc.since neither a nor the streamlined tariff order directly addressed the issue of violations,the commission contends that the rules concerning liability for violations should be left unscathed.order at.
the commission position,however,overlooks the language of its statutory mandate.under the communications act of,it is empowered to ensure just and reasonable rates charges,not rates of return.see a.the commission acquires the authority to prescribe rates of return only as a means to achieve just and reasonable rates.see nader fcc.as we explained in nader,rates of return are but one element in the task of ratemaking,but the commission can prescribe in separate phases from the other necessary doing so will help the commission carry out its functions in an expeditious manner.id.at.over the years,violations have developed into proxies for finding rates unreasonable.mci,at noting that the commission may treat a violation of a prescription as a per se violation of the requirement that a common carrier maintain just and reasonable rates.but we have never suggested that rates of returns could be ends in themselves,rather than means to the end of reasonable rates.
here,of course,no proxy for un reasonableness is needed.since a deems acs rates to be lawful,the inquiry ends.this situation is quite different from new england telephone,which was decided before the passage of a.in that case,the carrier rates had gone into effect with neither a commission finding of reasonableness,at,which under arizona grocery would bar refunds,nor a suspension of the rates and initiation of a hearing,for which a a precursor to t
