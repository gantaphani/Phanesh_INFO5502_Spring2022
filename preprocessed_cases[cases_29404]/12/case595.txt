the are utah animal rights coalition uarc and five individuals interested in animal rights issues.they filed this claim for alleged violations of their first amendment rights to free speech and to peaceably assemble after the individual plaintiffs attempted to protest a circus in south jordan,utah.the district court entered summary judgment against the plaintiffs.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
in,peter tucker conducted a small demonstration near abravanel hall in salt lake city.a salt lake county employee ordered him to stop.tucker and uarc then sued salt lake county in federal court,challenging county ordinances that require an advance permit thirty days before conducting a public demonstration on property.see salt lake county.the district court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their claim that the ordinances violated the first amendment,and then the parties settled.as a result of that lawsuit,salt lake county attorneys instructed the sheriff office that the ordinances are not enforceable against small,spontaneous demonstrations.
on february,tucker and the four other individual plaintiffs in this case engaged in the protest that is the subject of this lawsuit.specifically,they demonstrated outside a circus at the salt lake county equestrian park park.the park is owned by salt lake county but is located in the city of south jordan therefore,under utah state law,south jordan ordinances apply on park property.see utah code ann.a county may make and enforce within the limits of the county,outside the limits of cities and towns,all such local,police,building,and sanitary regulations as are not in conflict with general laws.emphasis added.art lovato and corey bullock are county employees responsible for park operations.they do not have law enforcement authority.
after the individual plaintiffs had begun their protest,bullock called the south jordan police.south jordan police officers raab and page arrived and told the protesters that they could not demonstrate at the park because they did not have a permit,as required by south jordan law,and that if they did not leave the park they would be arrested.the protesters ended their demonstration and left.the details surrounding the circumstances of the incident are recounted later in this opinion.
one week later,the plaintiffs sued south jordan city,officer page,and officer raab the south jordan defendants and salt lake county,lovato,and bullock the county defendants.uarc sought declaratory and injunctive relief the individual plaintiffs sought damages,in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief.before the answer was due,the south jordan defendants settled.they agreed to review the constitutionality of south jordan laws regarding free expression and demonstrations.see south jordan.the south jordan defendants also agreed to allow the plaintiffs to engage in small,spontaneous demonstrations in the city without giving advance notice or securing a permit.by stipulation of the parties,the court dismissed all claims against the south jordan defendants.
after the south jordan defendants had settled,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming only the county defendants.they alleged that lovato and bullock violated their rights by enforcing the salt lake county ordinances that had previously been found to be unconstitutional as applied to small,impromptu demonstrations.in their answer,the county defendants denied that county ordinances apply to the park,asserting that south jordan ordinances govern.the county defendants admitted that salt lake county can not require an advance permit for small,spontaneous demonstrations such as the plaintiffs demonstration,but they denied that anybody tried to enforce the ordinances.
the county defendants moved for summary judgment.of importance here,they argued that the conduct of the south jordan that of the county the deprivation of the plaintiffs rights.the county defendants noted that only south jordan law applied to the park,and that the plaintiffs own complaint made it clear that no person ever mentioned salt lake county ordinances.the district court agreed with the county defendants,holding that plaintiffs have not affirmatively linked the salt lake county employees to any constitutional violation alleged in the complaint.utah animal rights coalition salt lake county,wl,at.in the alternative,the court held that the county defendants did not act under color of law in calling the south jordan police.id.at.the plaintiffs appeal the county defendants the district court failure to award them costs and attorneys fees.
ii.discussion 
as an initial matter,the defendants question whether uarc and the individual plaintiffs have standing to seek an injunction enjoining them from prohibiting small,spontaneous demonstrations in the future.because this issue goes to our jurisdiction,we must address it before proceeding to the merits.see initiative referendum inst.walker,cir en banc.
the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to c ases and c ontroversies.const.art.iii.to establish a justiciable case or controversy,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he has suffered an injury in fact,that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendants,and that it is redressable by a favorable decision.walker,at.the supreme court has defined injury in fact as an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotations and citations omitted.although a plaintiff is not required to subject himself to actual arrest as a result of exercising his first amendment rights,it is equally that a llegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the injury in fact requirement.walker,at quotations omitted.the party invoking federal,the the burden to demonstrate standing.utah ass of counties bush,cir.
uarc standing 
in support of uarc claim for prospective relief,the first amended complaint alleges the following 
uarc has in the past conducted public demonstrations,free speech activities and out reach actions with regard to animal rights issues in utah.uarc has done so on public streets and sidewalks and on government property open to the public in various cities in utah.
uarc ha s conducted public protests,demonstrations,free speech activities and out reach actions on property belonging to salt lake county,including abravanel hall in downtown salt lake city.
uarc ha s conducted public protests,demonstrations,free speech activities and out reach actions on an impromptu or spontaneous basis.
in,uarc brought suit in the united states district court for the district of utah against salt lake county and others challenging,inter alia,the county ban,absent advance permits,on small spontaneous demonstrations on property belonging to salt lake county that ban had caused harm to uarc 
the county ordinances at issue in this action were at issue in the prior case.
uarc will be harmed by the enforcement of the county continued ban on small spontaneous demonstrations on property belonging to salt lake county.
these allegations do not persuade us that uarc has standing to bring a claim for injunctive relief.uarc has never identified its alleged injury,stating only the conclusion that it will be harmed by the enforcement of the county continued ban on small spontaneous demonstrations.uarc does not claim that it wants to demonstrate in the future.nor does uarc claim that a prohibition on speech regarding animal rights undermines its outreach or educational efforts.uarc simply states that it has been involved in prior litigation with salt lake county and that it has been involved in protests in the past.without a description of the harm uarc will suffer if individual protesters can not hold small,spontaneous demonstrations,uarc has not met its burden to demonstrate an injury in fact therefore,uarc does not have standing to bring this claim.
individual plaintiffs standing 
in contrast to uarc,the individual plaintiffs have standing to seek an injunction.each of them has submitted affidavits demonstrating that they would like to be able to protest in the future and that they fear the defendants will not allow those protests.for example,tucker averred that 
my right and the right of other activists to protest,to assemble and to engage in free speech were,are and will be greatly harmed and circumscribed by ordinances like south jordan city and,and salt lake county et which require advance notice of or permits for all demonstrations regardless of size and advance planning 
i want to be able to participate in small spontaneous demonstrations in south jordan city and at the salt lake county equestrian park and event center without securing a permit and without having to provide advance notice to the city or the county.
i want court protection so that i can spontaneously participate in demonstrations on salt lake county property and in south jordan,utah without interference from the police and without securing a permit or giving advance notice.
i am afraid that unless there is a court order the county employees will act to force me off the grounds of the equestrian park as occurred on february.i am afraid that unless there is a court order the south jordan police will order me not to demonstrate in south jordan unless i have a permit secured in advance,as occurred on february.
the other individual plaintiffs affidavits contain similar averments.we conclude that these allegations are sufficient to demonstrate that the individual plaintiffs future being able to conduct a spontaneous concrete and imminent,is fairly traceable to the action of the county defendants,and would be redressable by a favorable decision 
we review summary judgment decisions de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.sanders sw.bell,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.sanders,at quotations omitted.
to prevail on a claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he was deprived of his federal rights and that the deprivation was caused by a person acting under color of state law.see beedle wilson,cir.the district court granted the county defendants motion for summary judgment for two reasons the district court concluded that the undisputed facts showed that the county defendants were not the cause of the plaintiffs alleged rights deprivation and the court held that the county defendants had not acted under color of state law because they had simply called the police,which is something any private citizen can do.we agree that the plaintiffs have failed to show the requisite causal link between the county defendants conduct and the disbanding of the protest,and we therefore affirm on those grounds without reaching the issue.
the record reveals the following facts.a circus employee wanted the protest to stop.he asked the county employees for assistance.bullock called the south jordan police.he averred to the following facts,which are not contested by any other record evidence 
i ndividuals claiming to be with the utah animal rights coalition staged a demonstration at the park.
the proprietor of the circus approached me and requested that the protesters be evicted.because the park is located within the incorporated city limits of south jordan,i called south jordan city to determine what the legal requirements were,if any,for holding a protest.
eventually,south jordan police arrived and informed the protesters that they would need a permit to protest within south jordan.
i was unaware of any county ordinance bearing on this issue one way or another.
i did not know what legal requirements,if any,there were for protesting under these circumstances and simply deferred to the south jordan officers.
the plaintiffs the encounter with the south jordan police officers.our review of the video,which is quite instructional,shows that south jordan police officer raab told the plaintiffs that they were in south jordan,not an unincorporated part of salt lake county,and that a south jordan ordinance required them to have a permit.one of the protesters told the police that they did not need a permit for impromptu protests.when the officer disagreed,the protester asked for documentation of the applicable law.officer raab told him he could find the ordinance on south jordan website.the protester asked for the specific ordinance so he could speak to his lawyer.officer raab told him he did not have it and again directed the protester to south jordan website.the protester responded that he did not have a computer with him.
at this point,bullock told a protester,if you do put the sign down i going to trespass you off the property.the plaintiffs,however,did not leave.one of the protesters then asked for and received officer raab badge number.the county employees spoke with the police officers,asking whether the protesters needed a permit.an officer replied that he had talked it over with his lieutenant,and that a person must have a permit to protest anywhere in south jordan.a protester asked whether they were on city or county property.the police officer explained that the county owned the property,but that it was under the jurisdiction of south jordan.the officer offered an example,explaining that even though the county owned the park,park vendors had to abide by south jordan liquor licensing requirements.
the protester was not satisfied with this answer and spoke with bullock lovato they repeatedly stated that they did not know what the rules were regarding protests,but that south jordan law applied to the park.one of the protesters explained that they had the same issue with property at abravanel hall,and that they had won a prior lawsuit giving them the right to hold small,impromptu protests on property.one of the county employees again stated that he was not familiar with the rules,which was the reason he called the south jordan police and the reason he had to go with what these gentlemen the police officers say tonight.
officer raab then told the protesters that they were done for the night but could get a permit for the next day.a protester asked what would happen if they stayed.officer raab told them they would be arrested.another man apparently lovato or bullock said,all right,that what the officer says,so i guess we have to go with it.the protesters put their signs away and left.
based on the undisputed evidence and the plaintiffs theory of the case,as articulated in their amended complaint,it is clear that the plaintiffs protest was curtailed only upon the arrest threats given by south jordan police officers,not upon any action by lovato or bullock.the complaint unequivocally states that b ased on the threats of officer raab and officer page,the individual plaintiffs ceased their demonstration,left the county property and went home.this allegation is borne out by the plaintiffs video of the encounter,which shows them refusing to stop their protest and disagreeing with lovato bullock about the law until officer raab tells them they will be arrested if they continue their demonstration.the plaintiffs affidavits also show that they ended their protest only after the police warnings.all five of their affidavits use the exact same language based on the threats of officer raab and officer page,i and the other four activists ceased our demonstration and went home.emphasis added.
the plaintiffs also argue that lovato and bullock ordered them to leave the park before calling the police.however,there is no causal link between this statement and the end of the plaintiffs protest.in fact,the plaintiffs admit that this instruction had no effect.according to coffin affidavit,hutton replied that the group had a first amendment right to be there and that it was fine if he called the police.thus,any instruction to leave by lovato or bullock did not silence the protesters.
to the extent the plaintiffs argue that bullock statement if you do put the sign down i going to trespass you off the property constituted a threat that they would be arrested if the
