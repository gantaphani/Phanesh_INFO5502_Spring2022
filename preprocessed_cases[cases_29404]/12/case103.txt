this telecommunications appeal involves a question about how the prevailing regulatory as it is in legacy to products and services far from contemplation at the time the regime developed.the telecommunications act of the act,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,which deregulated the industry primarily to promote competition,also took major steps toward updating the law in an attempt to keep pace with technology.the current appeal is a direct fallout from the move toward deregulation,for it involves a competitive carrier clec challenge to acquire a portion of the incumbent market share.
global naps,global,a clec in vermont,challenges two rulings of the vermont public service board the board that bear on global interconnection agreement with verizon new england,verizon,vermont incumbent local exchange carrier ilec specifically,global contends that the board erred in concluding that local calling areas would continue to control whether a call is a toll call or a local call and in prohibiting global from offering virtual nxx service the district court affirmed these rulings,denied global motion for summary judgment,granted verizon for summary judgment and denied the individual defendants motion for summary judgment as moot.because we conclude that the board properly exercised jurisdiction over these matters and properly applied the act,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
an elementary knowledge of telecommunications law and terminology is helpful toward understanding what is at stake in this appeal.we accordingly provide a sketch of the services that global provides and of the regulatory structure framing the issues before analyzing the dispute between global and verizon.
global services 
global is a clec in vermont with its principal place of business in quincy,massachusetts.global customer base consists primarily of internet service providers isps,which in turn serve about users in vermont most of global isps have chosen to locate their equipment in global quincy facility rather than in each local calling area.
global system interconnects with verizon in brattleboro,vermont.pursuant to their interconnection agreement,verizon delivers all of global traffic to that brattleboro interconnection point.global then aggregates the internet calls it receives from around the region and delivers them to its isp customers in quincy.to accomplish this aggregation,global relies on virtual nxx technology,which uses nongeographically correlated telephone numbers to identify callers.this arrangement spawned the dispute in the present case global essentially contends that verizon is using its relatively more powerful position as the ilec to prevent it from doing business,while verizon asserts that global is forcing verizon to shoulder the costs of global services by taking advantage of verizon sunk costs in the infrastructure and offering services just different enough to sidestep the prevailing regulatory regime.
the basis for verizon and global interconnection,for global very the act,which as its preamble indicates represents an effort to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies,stat.pmbl.a major purpose of the act was to end local telephone monopolies and develop a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored local telephone market competition.verizon,pub.serv.comm of,d iowa utils,d global naps,verizon new england,cir.toward this end,the act imposes,among other things,a duty on ilecs such as verizon to provide interconnection with their networks and to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of the agreements with clecs such as global.a,c.if the parties can not agree,either party may petition the state commission charged with regulating intrastate operations of carriers to arbitrate any unresolved issues.b.
the dispute here stands at the crossroads of technology and regulation.since global uses the wirelines to serve traffic,we must consider how the regulations traditionally addressing voice communications interact with information communications.the dual nature of this traffic means it is subject to a multitude of potential regulations,many of which appear inconsistent,or even contradictory.resolving these issues requires us to consider the broader themes and trajectory of the regulations,particularly since the overhaul.
two prevalent themes of the act are emphasis on competition for the benefit of consumers and to further innovation,and a predilection to leave the internet largely unregulated.the code of federal regulations abounds with rules designed to open local telephone markets to competition.see,requiring ilecs to interconnect with qualifying clecs requiring ilecs to provide unbundled access imposing a general duty on ilecs to share their infrastructure with qualifying clecs explaining the conditions for infrastructure sharing.those regulations are tempered,however,by a concern that competitors may elect to enter the market not so much to expand competition as to take advantage of the relatively rigid regulatory control of the incumbents.in connection with this concern,the fcc has warned time and time again that it will not permit competitors to engage in regulatory is,to build their businesses to benefit almost exclusively from existing intercarrier compensation schemes at the expense of both the incumbents and consumers.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,intercarrier compensation for traffic,rcd,remanded by worldcom,fcc,hereinafter remand order.finally,although no such claims have been made here,we are sensitive to the possibility that state regulators,who have dealt traditionally only with incumbents,may quite unknowingly tend to share their perspectives.
reciprocal compensation and access charges 
one issue involved here is the requirement of the act that interconnecting local exchange carriers establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating calls.b see also.reciprocal compensation arrangements are structured so that the carrier whose infrastructure is used in making and terminating or completing a call receives compensation from another carrier that is using its network.that is,when a clec customer calls an ilec customer located in the same local calling area,the clec pays the ilec for terminating the local call.likewise,when an ilec customer calls a clec customer located in the same local calling area,the ilec pays the clec for terminating the local call.reciprocal compensation is based on minutes of use and is expressly limited to transportation and termination of local traffic.e,see also b.
calls referred to variously as interstate or intrastate exchange service or toll service are subject,in using local infrastructure,to access reciprocal compensation.a.thus,access charges are charges that companies are required to pay carriers for the use of local network facilities.the federal communications commission fcc has authority over interstate calls,and the state commissions have authority over in addition to local service intrastate.
these rules governing intercarrier compensation are relatively straightforward when applied to ordinary telephone voice calls.parties sometimes disagree about the parameters of the agreements,but it is fairly easy to apply the rules in that normal context.things become far more contentious,however,in the realm of traffic.the fcc has in recent years considered the question whether internet telecommunications traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation but has never directly addressed the issue of calls that cross areas.see generally remand order,rcd.at.
virtual nxx 
the other point of contention in this case surrounds the regulation of virtual nxx numbers unconnected to any particular geographic region.virtual nxx geographical disconnect is significant because whether a telephone call is subject to access charges depends on the location of the switches where a call originates and where it terminates.these switches are associated with nxx codes,which are the middle three digits of a telephone number a call to a particular phone number identifies the nxx code and accordingly,the location where the call is to terminate.
although geographically correlated nxx codes are standard,it is technologically feasible to assign codes so that the designation of a call point of termination does not identify a physical location but instead a location of the customer choice.virtual nxx,then,is similar to foreign exchange or fx service,which allows users in one calling area to obtain a telephone number associated with a different local calling area.the significance of virtual nxx and fx technologies is that they essentially convert,for billing purposes,the caller calls into local calls.the difference between virtual nxx and fx,however,is that an fx customer bears the cost of a dedicated facility known as a private line to enable access to a remote local exchange.
global claims that its isp customers depend on virtual nxx service,since,unlike verizon,global infrastructure serving vermont is physically located only in quincy,massachusetts.in order to provide global isps with local access the isps and the users likely would nxx is essential although we suppose that fx might achieve the same ends,as would moving global quincy facility across the border to vermont or providing different retail calling plans.verizon does not dispute that virtual nxx is technically effective it argues only that it is improper and unfair to allow global to use infrastructure it acquires without cost which is the essential point of virtual nxx to provide access.
verizon and global began negotiating the terms of their vermont interconnection agreement in january.unable to agree to all the terms,global petitioned the board for arbitration in july.the board issued its decision on december,concluding in part that local calling areas should continue to govern intercarrier compensation in vermont and denying global request to use virtual nxx technology.the district court upheld the board ruling,and global now appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court determination that the board order conforms to federal law.see,sw.bell.brooks fiber commc ns of,cir sw.bell.public util.comm n,cir.conversely,we review the board decisions as congruent with state law under the standard.sw.bell,at accord brooks fiber,at.
local calling areas 
the first issue for determination is whether the board overstepped its authority in concluding that calling areas govern whether traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation or access charges.global contends that access charges are appropriate only in circumstances where a carrier imposes separate charges for calls.since it does not impose such a separate charge,global argues,access fees are inappropriate.the determining point here is whether global treatment of all calls within vermont as local for billing purposes affects reliance on the areas traditionally used to determine whether traffic is local or for the purpose of intercarrier compensation.
the parties here dispute only which calling area or provides the relevant framework for ascertaining compensation.the answer might lead to a further question whether traffic is subject to access charges.but we are limited here to the questions actually presented how are the boundaries of local calling areas to be determined for purposes of intercarrier compensation,and what agency is to make that determination 
prior to,the state public service commissions defined the boundaries of all local calling areas.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,rcd,hereinafter local competition order.with the introduction of competition,however,the state boards were required to consider how to realign the local market to govern competitive entry.the fcc,in its voluminous local competition order,explicitly declined to address the issue of local calling areas,noting that the state commissions have the authority to determine what geographic areas should be considered local areas for the purpose of applying reciprocal compensation consistent with state commissions historical practice of defining local service areas for wireline lecs.id.importantly,the fcc concluded that it lacked sufficient information to address the issue of expanded local calling area plans but expect ed that this issue would be considered,in the first instance,by the state commissions.id.thus,despite the monumental changes congress had made in telecommunications law,the fcc early indicated that it intended to leave authority over defining local calling areas where it always had within the jurisdiction of the state commissions.
consistent with this jurisdictional finding,the vermont legislature has made it clear that it envisions the board as having a key role in planning telecommunications for the state.stat.ann.tit.b.in,the board ruled that its clecs were free to define their own local calling areas for purposes of billing their retail customers.investigation into new england telephone telegraph company tariff filing re open network architecture,including the unbundling of net network,expanded interconnection,and intelligent networks in re phase ii,module one,docket,available at http w.the board explicitly stated,however,that the boundaries,which it last established in,would continue to govern intercarrier compensation.id.at.
global argues that the act does not permit the board to reserve the authority to define local calling areas for intercarrier compensation purposes.it centers its argument on the separate charge language in the statutory definition of telephone toll services which in turn defines exchange access,which in turn determines whether access charges apply.global reasons that,since the regulations prescribe that a charge separate from the applicable service contracts is necessary to make a call a toll call and since global imposes no separate toll charges,its traffic is not subject to access fees,regardless of how the board defines local calling areas.this argument attributes far too much significance to the term separate charge.
the underlying statute which we must remember was originally drafted in draws sharp distinctions between services known popularly as local and.see.it seems likely that the separate charge language in the statute was written to underscore that tolls applied exclusively to service and were charged separately.but what really mattered in determining whether an access charge was appropriate was whether a call traversed local exchanges,not how a carrier chose to bill its customers.thus,global argument that since it imposes no separate fee,its traffic can not be considered toll traffic,is beside the point.
accordingly,we decline to challenge the board conclusion that the calling areas it has established are determinative for the purposes of intercarrier compensation.in fact,the fcc has stated that state commissions have authority to determine whether calls passing between lecs should be subject to access charges or reciprocal compensation for those areas where the lecs service areas do not overlap.see in the matter of petition of worldcom.pursuant to section e of the communications act for preemption of the jurisdiction of the virginia state corporation commission regarding interconnection disputes,rcd.although much of the local competition order has been superseded,we find nothing in the thousands of pages the fcc has issued on topics relating to local calling areas that clearly and consistently indicates that it intended to preempt the state commissions authority to define local calling areas for the purposes of intercarrier compensation.our understanding,which is consistent with conclusions that other courts have reached,is that the fcc has not disturbed the states traditional authority to define local calling areas.see,iowa network servs.qwest,d,jaber,so d.this understanding also appears to be consistent with congress intent in the act.see,b c n othing in this part shall be construed to prohibit any state commission from enforcing regulations prescribed prior to february,or from prescribing regulations after february,in fulfilling the requirements of this part,if such regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions of this part and n othing in this part precludes a state from imposing requirements on a telecommunications carrier for intrastate services that are necessary to further competition in the provision of telephone exchange service or exchange access,as long as the state requirements are not inconsistent with this part or the commission regulations to implement this part.
allowing the local calling areas to govern intercarrier compensation also makes good practical sense.carriers may prescribe markedly different local calling areas in accordance with marketing considerations.this diversity may promote consumer choice and ultimately be beneficial to consumers.but,if carriers were free to define local calling areas for the purposes of intercarrier compensation,the door would be open to overweening conduct by the clecs.ilecs are currently fixed in regimes and,in that framework,provide the infrastructure for clecs.local calling areas defined by clecs would permit such areas to be so broad as to eliminate all intercarrier compensation for ilecs.permitting clecs to define local service areas and thereby set the rules for the sharing of infrastructure would eventually require ilecs to absorb all the costs and allow clecs to reap all the profits.
the significant factor added to the considerations under the nature of the attention to the remand order.the ultimate conclusion of the remand order was that traffic within a single calling area is not subject to reciprocal compensation.see brief for fcc as amicus curiae,global naps,verizon new england,cir,at march,t he remand order also indicates that,in establishing the new compensation scheme for calls,the fcc was considering only calls placed to isps in the same local calling area as the caller.the fcc itself has not addressed the application of the remand order to calls outside a local calling area.although the remand order states explicitly that isps are exempt from reciprocal compensation for calling area calls,it sheds little light on calling area calls or access fees.
we can find no authority to clarify this issue,and we are accordingly unable to conclude that the remand order strips state boards of their jurisdiction over traffic.as has been demonstrated,state boards have authority to define local calling areas with respect to intercarrier compensation.whether they have authority to impose access fees on traffic is for another day and for clarification by the fcc.
virtual nxx 
the second question that global presents is whether the board had the authority to prohibit virtual nxx.answering this query involves two questions whether the board had the authority to ban virtual nxx and whether banning virtual nxx was justifiable in the present instance.since this issue involves the complete prohibition of what is arguably a telecommunications technology,it requires searching consideration of state commission jurisdiction.
global,to support its view that the fcc intended to preempt state commissions with respect to traffic,relies on language in the remand order that classifies traffic as interstate traffic.since federal law generally governs interstate communication,global continues,states lack jurisdiction over traffic.this argument,which other courts have analyzed and found wanting,is unpersuasive.see,sw.bell,at noting that the supreme court has recognized that the act can not divide the world of domestic telephone service neatly into two hemispheres,one consisting of interstate service,over which the fcc has plenary authority,and the other consisting of intrastate service,over which the states retain exclusive jurisdiction rather,observed the court,the realities of technology and economics belie such a clean parceling of responsibility.citation omitted quoting.pub.serv.comm fcc,d see also global naps.
while global is correct that,in the remand order,the fcc declared traffic to be a form of interstate communication,the order also explicitly reserves state commission authority in certain relevant matters.the remand order acknowledges,for example,that state commissions have,and should continue to have,a role in arbitrating,reviewing and enforcing interconnection agreements relating to traffic.remand order,rcd.at,stating that a carrier may rebut presumptions regarding the amount of traffic that is traffic by providing evidence to the appropriate state commission.the remand order also leaves intact ilecs ability to seek relief from their state commissions from certain cost recovery mechanisms.id.at,quoting access charge reform order,rcd.at to the extent that some intrastate rate structures fail to compensate incumbent lecs adequately incumbent lecs may address their concerns to state regulators.finally,as the district court noted,the remand order expressly states that access services remain subject to fcc jurisdiction or,to the extent they are intrastate services,they remain subject to the jurisdiction of state commissions.rcd.at.we would have to ignore these provisions and more if we were to conclude,as global urges,that the remand order preempts the states with respect to all traffic issues 
the remand order preemptive effect is further limited by the fact that the fcc promulgated this order specifically to address only the issue of reciprocal compensation for traffic.unlike the technology involved in reciprocal compensation,virtual nxx involves calls originating out of and extending into different local calling areas and transforms what would otherwise be toll calls into local calls.virtual nxx potential compensation arrangement which would possibly involve toll and access charges would differ from that contemplated in the remand order,since that directive is limited to disparities in reciprocal compensation between the ilecs and clecs for traffic.moreover,although the fcc recently had an occasion to examine the proper application of reciprocal compensation to virtual nxx traffic,the fcc noted the lack of clear precedents and rules governing such compensation.in the matter of application by verizon maryland,et,for authorization to provide,interlata services in maryland,washington,and west virginia,rcd.
given this context,a more reasonable interpretation of the remand order is not that the fcc has preempted the field relating to isps,but only that it intended to reserve jurisdiction over intercarrier compensation issues with respect to traffic on matters that would conflict with the fcc specific directives about reciprocal compensation.the fcc is faced with a difficult task in working out a regulatory regime that accommodates new technologies the fact that traffic is should not be a basis for avoiding regulation.as former fcc chair michael powell commented t o allow a carrier to avoid regulatory obligations simply by dropping a little ip in the network would merely sanction regulatory arbitrage and would collapse the universal service system virtually overnight.in the matter of petition for declaratory ruling that ip telephony services are exempt from access charges,rcd,separate statement of michael powell.accepting global interpretation of the jurisdictional arrangement would allow carriers to operate entirely outside the compensation scheme so long as they provide some service to an isp.
having determined that the classification of traffic as interstate does not in itself remove traffic from the jurisdiction of the state commissions,did the vermont board exercise appropriate authority in this instance global argues that,aside from the jurisdictional issue,the board actions were inappropriate here because prohibiting virtual nxx violates various federal antidiscrimination statutes by determining which carriers could serve isps.global reasons that such a prohibition would restrict interstate access and circumscribe the use of telephone numbers within the area code to provide interstate service to its customers.the board,however,did not violate any federal rules or act arbitrarily or capriciously when it prohibited globa
