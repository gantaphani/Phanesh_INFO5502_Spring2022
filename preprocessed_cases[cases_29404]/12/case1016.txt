at t at t appeals from a judgment of the superior court dismissing this action brought by at t against several insurance carriers the d o insurers those carriers issued director and officer d o policies insuring at home corporation at home and at home directors and officers.at t,as at home largest shareholder,designated ten of its employees to serve as at home directors at home later declared bankruptcy,and thereafter,at t and the at home directors were sued jointly and severally for billions of dollars in damages.being insolvent,at home could not indemnify the at home directors for any liability and litigation costs resulting from those lawsuits the underlying litigation.accordingly,the at home directors requested the d o insurers to advance their defense costs.the d o insurers refused,taking the position that the at home directors had not incurred a covered loss under the d o policies.the at home directors then turned to at t for assistance in paying defense costs,settlements and judgments in the underlying litigation.at t agreed to do so,in exchange for which the at home directors assigned to at t their breach of contract claims against the d o insurers.
at t then sued the d o insurers in the superior court,both as assignee of its at home,and as subrogee to those directors coverage claims against the d o insurers for defense costs and indemnification relating to the underlying actions the d o insurers moved to dismiss at t amended complaint on the grounds inter alia that the at home directors had suffered no loss needed to trigger the d o coverage,and at t could not prevail on its equitable subrogation claim,because when it indemnified the at home directors,at t acted as a volunteer.applying california law,the superior court upheld both of the d o insurers contentions and dismissed the complaint this appeal followed.
having analyzed the relevant california authorities and applied them to the facts pled in the complaint,we arrive at a result contrary to that reached by the superior court.accordingly,we reverse.
the facts,which are summarized in the opinion of the trial court,are drawn from at t amended complaint,as is required on a motion to dismiss under superior court rule b.
background at home and at t 
at home was formed in to provide internet access to subscribers of catv companies.at home largest shareholder was,tci,which by controlled percent of the voting power of at home stock.by,tci had been acquired by at t,which became at home new controlling stockholder.
at the time at t acquired tci,at home was experiencing financial difficulties.although at home network performance was enhanced in,by the spring of that year,at home revenue had sharply declined.at t stepped in and among other things infused million in cash into at home,but that company financial situation continued to worsen.on september,at home filed for federal bankruptcy protection.
the underlying litigation 
the williamson action 
the underlying litigation was filed in.in may,the bankruptcy court created the at home bondholders liquidating trust bhlt.in november,the trustee of the bhlt brought a damages action the williamson action against the at home directors and officers,alleging various breaches of fiduciary duty.those claimed breaches of duty at t avers constituted wrongful acts that fell within the scope of the d o policies.in defending williamson,the at home directors retained legal counsel and incurred defense costs.in may,the bhlt trustee settled williamson for approximately million.at t contributed to that settlement on behalf of the at home directors,who,because of at t intervention and payment,did not have to contribute to the williamson settlement amount.
the leykin action 
in march,at home shareholders filed three securities class actions against at home directors and officers.those lawsuits were consolidated into the leykin action.the consolidated leykin complaint alleged claims for securities violations,fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.in defending leykin,the at home directors retained counsel and incurred defense costs.in march,the leykin action was dismissed in its entirety.leykin is currently on appeal.
the d o insurers deny any coverage and at t agrees to indemnify the at home directors 
although at t alleges that the claims against the at home directors in the underlying actions were covered by the d o insurance policies,the d o insurers denied coverage and declined to advance defense costs to the at home directors being bankrupt,at home was unable to indemnify its directors and officers.in these circumstances,at employees had been serving as at home directors at at t the at home directors defense costs and agreed to pay on their behalf any judgments or settlements in the underlying actions.in consideration for at t indemnification agreement,the at home directors assigned to at t their rights to coverage under the d o policies.
because at t had agreed to indemnify them,the at home directors were never required to,nor did they,pay any defense costs or contribute to the williamson settlement.nor will those directors be required to pay any defense costs,settlements or judgments in any future proceedings in leykin.at t concedes that it 
has paid all defense fees and costs and settlements,incurred in connection with the leykin,james and williamson fiduciary actions on behalf of the at home directors and officers,and will pay any future defense fees and costs,settlements,or judgments on behalf of the at home directors and officers,in connection with leykin 
that conceded fact raises the question we are called upon to decide whether at t payment of defense and settlement costs in williamson,and its agreement to pay any such costs and liabilities in leykin,forecloses coverage under the d o policies.that issue is governed by the terms of the d o policies,which are next discussed.
the d o policies 
at issue is coverage under policies issued by the d o insurers for the policy period july,through july.the primary insurer is genesis insurance company genesis,and the four excess insurers are clarendon america insurance company north american specialty insurance company xl specialty insurance company and faraday capital limited,individually and as representative of certain underwriters at lloyd and other companies.the policies issued by those four excess insurers followed form to that is,they tracked the terms and conditions of the primary genesis policy issued to at home.the excess policies provided various layers of coverage above the million of genesis primary coverage.
national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh national union also sold primary coverage to at home.the national union policy provided million in coverage for the policy period july,to july,and million for the policy period july,to july.those national union policies were the subject of the at home insurers motion to dismiss,a motion in which national union joined.
the national union and the genesis policies are structured and worded similarly.coverage for at home directors and officers is triggered by a loss,which the policies define as an amount that the directors and officers are either financially liable or legally obligated to pay.the act or event that triggers coverage must arise from an actual or alleged wrongful act,for example,a breach of duty.coverage is excluded if at home indemnifies its directors and officers,but coverage is not excluded merely because a third party such as at t indemnifies at home directors and officers.
the critical terms of the respective national union and the genesis d o policies are set forth in their insuring agreements and their definitions of loss.those terms are excerpted on a side by side basis for ease of reference in the chart below.
the insuring agreement language of each policy is as follows 
and the policies define loss as follows 
the superior court decision 
in the superior court proceedings,the defendant d o insurers moved to dismiss at t first amended complaint under superior court rule b.the pivotal question was whether the ten at t employees who serve as directors and officers of at home suffered a loss within the meaning of the relevant policies.the d o insurers the superior court under california law,which governs this dispute,the at home directors suffered no loss because they never paid,and never did or will incur any obligation or liability to pay,their defense costs or any judgment or settlement in the underlying litigation.because the at home directors had no claim against the d o insurers for coverage,at t,as their assignee,had no greater rights than the at home.nor,the superior court held,did at t have a legally cognizable claim for equitable subrogation,because under california law,the subrogee at t must not have acted as a volunteer,but in indemnifying the at home directors at t had acted as a volunteer.
the contentions and the issues presented 
on this appeal,at t claims that the superior court erred as a matter of law in holding that the complaint failed to allege a cognizable claim that the at home directors had suffered a loss that was covered under the d o policies,and at t was equitably subrogated to the claims of the at home directors.those claims generate the two issues presented on this appeal.because the dispute involves the superior court grant of a motion to dismiss and its interpretation of insurance policy language,our review is de novo requiring us to determine whether the trial court erred in formulating or applying legal precepts.
our analysis begins with the question of whether the at home directors suffered a loss that triggered coverage under the d o policies.we conclude that the directors did suffer a covered loss,and that at t,as those directors assignee,was entitled to enforce the directors contract claims against the d o insurers.we then consider the second at t was equitably subrogated to the claims of the at home conclude that at t was equitably subrogated.all parties agree that these issues are governed by california law.
whether the at home directors suffered a loss that triggered coverage under the d o policies 
it is undisputed that the at home directors never paid any litigation defense costs in the underlying litigation or contributed to the williamson settlement.nor will those directors be required to pay any future defense or settlement costs or any judgment in leykin.for the at home directors to have suffered a loss covered by the d o policies,therefore,it must be inferable from the complaint allegations that those directors became legally obligated or financially liable to pay any defense costs they incurred and any judgment or settlement in the underlying actions.
the superior court held that no such inference could be drawn from the complaint,because at t had undertaken,on behalf of the at home directors,to pay all defense costs,judgments and settlement obligations attributable to those directors in the underlying litigation as the trial court stated in its opinion 
simply stated,the at home directors are not,and have never been,legally obligated to pay or financially liable.nowhere in the record is there a document or reference which specifically and clearly establishes an obligation personal to the at home directors which obligated or required the directors to pay a portion of the williamson fiduciary settlement or the costs of defending the underlying litigation in fact,in this case,the assignments establish that these at home directors have paid nothing and will never be obligated to pay anything.this case is controlled by california law,and pan and make clear that unless the at home directors made payments or incurred an obligation to pay,there is no loss under the policies 
the question is whether,as a matter of california law,at t agreement to indemnify the at home directors precludes any inference that those directors became legally obligated to pay those defense costs or to pay or contribute towards any judgment or settlement.we conclude that the superior court,by answering that question in the negative,erred as a matter of law for two separate reasons.first,the language of the d o policies supports a contrary conclusion.second,the california cases do not affirmatively require,in order to establish a loss,that the directors who are insured under a d o policy must actually suffer the entry of a judgment,or otherwise contractually promise to pay any judgment costs of defense.
a.the policy language 
if the d o insurers wanted their policies unambiguously to preclude coverage of losses incurred by the named insureds who are indemnified by a third party here,at t,the insurers knew how to achieve that result.both the national union and the genesis policies insure against a loss of the directors and officers resulting from any wrongful act committed in those where the company here,at home has indemnified them no similar exception is created for losses that are indemnified by a party other than the company.the d o insurers could easily have added a second exception from coverage to capture losses indemnified by third parties,but they did not.nor is it a satisfactory answer for the d o insurers to they do adding such a second coverage exception was unnecessary,because that same result is achieved under the policies definition of loss.if that is so,then under the policies definition of loss,losses indemnified by the company should not be covered either,yet the d o insurers carved out from coverage only losses indemnified by the company.the unavoidable inference is that i such an express carve out was needed,because otherwise losses indemnified by the company would be covered by the d o policies and ii the absence of a parallel carve out for a loss indemnified by third parties indicates that such indemnified loss es were intended to be covered.at a minimum this incongruity significantly undercuts the d o insurers position and to that contrary inference the d o insurers offer no satisfactory response.by failing to credit that inference in its analysis,the superior court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.
b.the california case law 
the trial court also read the california case law to require dismissal of the d o coverage claim.we do not interpret the california law to mandate that result.the superior court apparent reading of california law is that a liability to pay defense costs and any judgment or settlement that would be a covered loss under the d o policies,is extinguished where a third party promises to indemnify the directors against that loss.that reading fails to take into account that,if at t had not intervened,the at home directors would have been at all times personally liable to their attorneys for the cost of their defense and would also have been required to contribute out of their own pockets their allocated portion of the williamson settlement.
under california law,an insured becomes legally obligated to pay legal expenses as soon as the legal services are rendered for that reason,legally it does not matter in the superior court words that the record contains no document or reference which specifically and clearly establishes an obligation personal to the at home directors which obligated or required the directors to pay the costs of defending the underlying litigation.under california law,the at home directors liability to pay their defense costs arose once their lawyers began performing services on their behalf.and even though at t agreed to pay those defense costs,the at home director clients would remain liable to their attorneys if,for whatever reason,at t reneged on its agreement only if the at home directors defense counsel had contractually agreed to look solely to at t for payment of their fees would the at home directors be relieved from liability.the amended complaint alleges no such agreement by defense counsel.
that reasoning applies equally to the williamson settlement costs,which at t undertook to and did pay on behalf of the at home directors.again,the trial court opinion fails to take into account that,had at t reneged on its indemnification undertaking and refused to pay the williamson settlement,the at home directors would have been subject to personal liability for any judgment subsequently entered against them in the williamson action.
in concluding otherwise,the superior court reasoned that the settlement agreement in the williamson fiduciary action expressly provides that only at t is promising to pay the settlement amount,and that t he plaintiffs in williamson have no recourse against the at home directors if at t fails to make that payment.that is accurate,but materially incomplete.the williamson settlement agreement goes on to provide that if the agreement is not approved by the at home bankruptcy court,or if any approval is stayed or reversed on appeal,the settlement shall become null and void and the parties shall return to their respective positions ex ante,as though this settlement had never occurred,and the action will be returned to the trial calendar for trial setting and trial.thus,had at t reneged on the settlement agreement,the settlement would never be presented to,let alone approved by,the bankruptcy court.as a result,the at home directors would be required to defend themselves at a trial and be subject to an in personam judgment against them in the event they did not prevail.
had at t never undertaken to indemnify the at home directors,or had at t breached that undertaking,the d o insurers would never have been in a position to argue that the at home directors incurred no loss that triggers d o coverage.the d o insurers are able make this argument only because at t made and honored its fact that elevates irony to new heights.the question is whether under california law,at t which the at home directors would have been entitled to coverage of their defense and settlement costs under the d o those directors of that entitlement.no california case cited to us mandates that result.
the superior court read the cited california cases discussed in its opinion to require that for the at home directors to have incurred a covered loss,they must have either have suffered the entry of a judgment against them or promised to pay any defense costs and judgments,including a judgment entered as part of a settlement.with respect to the defense costs,that conclusion is incorrect because,as previously discussed,the directors incurred liability to pay defense costs as soon as their counsel performed services on their behalf.as for the at home directors liability for the williamson settlement,the california case law is less clear.
in its opinion,the superior court held that the cases cited by at t did not support at t position,because the settlements in those cases involved either the entry of a judgment against the settling directors or an obligation on their part to pay a certain amount equivalent to a judgment debt.for example,in xebec dev.partners,national union fire ins.the parties reached a settlement that was reduced to a joint and several consent judgment against the company and its officers and directors.the directors and officers then assigned their coverage rights under their d o insurance policy to the plaintiff in exchange for the plaintiff promise not to execute on the judgment.in a subsequent insurance coverage litigation,the california court rejected the argument of the insurer national union that the individuals had suffered no covered loss in light of the covenant not to execute,because the directors were liable under the consent judgment.similarly,in smith parks manor a personal injury case,a liability insurer,acting on behalf of the defendant insureds,reached a settlement with the injured plaintiffs under which the insureds were obligated to pay a certain sum or,stated otherwise,created a settlement debt equivalent to a judgment debt.the court held that a t that point the defendants had suffered a loss which the insurer was obligated by contract to indemnify 
the california cases upon which the superior court relied can fairly be read to hold that a settlement that involves a consent judgment being entered against the insured is sufficient to constitute a covered loss under the d o policies at issue.but,those cases can not be read definitively to hold that under california law such a judgment against the insured directors is essential to trigger coverage indeed,no authoritative california decision cited to us definitively so holds.
the only case that arguably could be read to require a judgment or other legally binding obligation to pay a settlement as a condition for coverage,is a federal court opinion,plm,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,plm.in that case,plm settled a breach of contract and fraud action brought by pillsbury against plm and certain plm directors and officers.plm sought reimbursement of a portion of the settlement payment from national union,which had issued certain d o policies covering plm directors and officers.national union denied coverage.in a subsequent lawsuit by plm against national union,the federal court ruled that plm directors had suffered no covered loss,because they paid no claim and were not legally obligated to pay,even though the plm directors had individually guaranteed some of the promised settlement payment.affirming a district court judgment in favor of national union,the ninth circuit stated 
we think it clear that in this case execution of the guarantees created only a contingent obligation to pay on the part of the directors and officers.it was not an obligation to pay and it never became an obligation to pay.hence,there was no loss as defined by the d o provision plm claims that the words legally obligated to pay include situations in which a payment is made by third persons on behalf of a director or officer.since the payments made by plm eliminated potential liability of all defendants in the pillsbury lawsuit,a portion of the payments arguably was made on behalf of the directors and officers.nonetheless,plm argument fails because potential liability is not equivalent to a legal obligation to pay.the directors and officers were not legally obligated to make payments to pillsbury and therefore the payments made on their behalf were not recoverable under the d o provision 
plm is an unpublished ruling by a federal court attempting to apply california law.because plm is not an opinion by a california state court,it is not an authoritative pronouncement of california law on the issue before us moreover,under ninth circuit local rules plm,as an unpublished opinion,can not be cited as precedent in that circuit or in any courts thereof,except in limited circumstances not applicable here and,lastly,the plm opinion cites no california case to support its conclusions,or otherwise attempts to explain why the california courts would adopt the plm court rationale.accordingly,we do not regard plm as persuasive evidence of california law or consider ourselves obligated to follow that decision or accord it significant weight in discharging our independent obligation to ascertain how the california state courts would rule on the precise issue presented to us,we must,therefore,look to other sources.
we begin with the proposition,which the insurers themselves concede,that the williamson settlement payment would be a covered loss if the williamson settlement,like that in xebec,had been structured so that a consent judgment was first entered against the at home directors,and then paid by at t.in terms of economic substance,a settlement so structured would be identical to the different settlement form actually employed in williamson.that being the case,the d o insurers position necessarily reduces to the proposition that coverage under their policies turns entirely upon the matter of settlement structure.the question is whether the california courts would hold such adherence to form is essential for d o coverage to attach.we find no indication that the california courts would so hold.indeed,what indications are available to us point in the opposite direction.
those indications are found in xebec.there to reiterate,the settlement of the underlying litigation against the defendants xebec and its directors all of whom were insured by national the form of a transaction where i xebec and its directors stipulated to a judgment in favor of the plaintiff xdp,in consideration for ii which xdp agreed not to execute on its ju
