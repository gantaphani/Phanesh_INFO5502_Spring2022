during the,robert eckhardt occasionally worked for the teamsters union local in south florida.eckhardt was not a full union member and he worked only when called.
eckhardt relationship with the union deteriorated and he began making threatening calls to its office.in,he pled guilty to making threatening phone calls to the union in violation of b.
eckhardt resumed his telephone campaign on december,calling the teamsters local in florida from his father home in henderson,nv.this continued through june.during that year and a half period,eckhardt made approximately calls to a voicemail extension belonging to local office worker sue ann creech.although creech never met eckhardt,he called her number up to times per week between march and june.count v of the indictment alleged that eckhardt said things such as hey sue,why do you take one of them fuckin school buses and use it like a vibrator up your cunt use them fuckin garbage trucks like a fuckin dildo and stick up your cunt.count vi alleged that eckhardt told creech i can fuckin wet my balls off t here your threat,have me locked up.eckhardt did not identify himself and he always left his messages outside of business hours.the union provided the fbi with copies of eckhardt phone messages.
the government charged eckhardt with violating the communications decency act,et.eckhardt unsuccessfully moved the district court to dismiss the charges because the statute was unconstitutionally vague and the alleged offense conduct was not obscene.at trial,eckhardt contended that he was not the person who called creech.the government rebutted this by presenting voice exemplars from eckhardt conviction,various uncharged phone calls from,and the calls to creech.creech,the fbi case agent from eckhardt conviction,and the general manager of the pensacola motel where eckhardt lived all said that the voice on the tape belonged to eckhardt.over eckhardt objection,the district court admitted recordings of the calls,eckhardt plea agreement,and his judgment and conviction.
at the conclusion of the evidence,eckhardt moved for acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a.eckhardt contended that the phone calls were protected speech because the comments expressed dissatisfaction with the teamsters union.alternatively,he claimed the language in counts v and vi was not obscene,and the calls listed in count vii were not harassing.the district court denied eckhardt rule motion.over eckhardt objection,the court instructed the jury that it could convict eckhardt if his speech was filthy,lewd,lascivious,or indecent so long as eckhardt had a general intent to violate.during the government rebuttal,the prosecutor said that eckhardt should apologize to creech and others for the harassment.eckhardt objected to the prosecutor remark.
a jury convicted eckhardt and the district court sentenced him to months in prison.the sentence included a enhancement because there were more than two threats in counts and of the indictment.eckhardt timely appealed.among other things,he argues that he should not have been convicted of obscenity because his calls addressed matters of public concern.
ii.analysis 
eckhardt vagueness and overbreadth challenges 
we review a district court conclusions as to the constitutionality of a challenged statute de novo.united states panfil,cir.eckhardt was tried and convicted of anonymously making annoying,abusive,harassing,or threatening telephone calls in violation of a c.eckhardt asserts that a c is overbroad because it potentially criminalizes protected speech and vague because it failed to give him notice that his conduct was forbidden.the sixth circuit rejected an identical challenge to in united states bowker,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.the charges in bowker arose after defendant bowker made over anonymous phone calls to a television news reporter over a seven month period.many calls were threatening and sexual in nature.id.at.the bowker decision reasoned that a c was not overbroad because 
the focus of the telephone harassment statute is not simply annoying telephonic communications.it also prohibits abusive,threatening or harassing communications.thus,the thrust of the statute is to prohibit communications intended to instill fear in the victim,not to provoke a discussion about political issues of the day.
the court noted that while a c could have unconstitutional applications,that fact does not warrant facial invalidation.id.at,citing parker levy,d facial invalidation not appropriate when the remainder of the statute covers a whole range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable conduct additional citation omitted.bowker speech was not constitutionally protected because he called his victim predominately,if not exclusively,for the purpose of invading her privacy and communicating express and implied threats of bodily harm.id.
eckhardt called his victim approximately times during a year and a half period.although eckhardt claims for the first time on appeal that the calls addressed matters of public concern alleged corruption,his calls rarely addressed anything that could be construed in that manner.the overarching purpose of eckhardt sexually laced calls was to harass and frighten creech.this type of speech is not constitutionally protected,citing united states landham,cir see also roth united states,d o bscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.thus,we agree with bowker that a c is not overbroad.id.at.
eckhardt vagueness challenge also fails.vagueness may invalidate a criminal statute if it either fails to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits or authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.city of chicago morales,d citation omitted.the bowker decision concluded that the telephone harassment statute provided sufficient notice of its prohibitions because citizens need not guess what terms such as harass and intimidate mean.at.there as here,the meaning of the words used to describe the impermissible conduct can be ascertained fairly by reference to judicial decisions,common law,dictionaries,and the words themselves because they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.id.thus,we agree that a c is not void for vagueness.see also apollomedia reno,d,holding that prior version of a prohibition on obscenity is not impermissibly vague.the statute provides adequate notice of unlawful conduct.
b.the rule a motion for acquittal 
in pertinent part,federal rule of criminal procedure a states that after the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence,the court on the defendant motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.id.in reviewing the denial of a motion for acquittal,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.we review de novo the sufficiency of evidence to support convictions.united states,cir.because eckhardt did not present any evidence following his rule motion,the sufficiency of the evidence against him must be evaluated solely in terms of the proof presented in the government.united states thomas,cir.
in counts v and vi of the indictment,the government charged eckhardt with violating a a.section a a prohibits individuals from using,in interstate communications,a telecommunications device to knowingly make any comment,request,suggestion,proposal,image,or other communication which is obscene or child pornography,with intent to annoy,abuse,threaten,or harass another person id.
count v alleged that eckhardt said hey sue,why do you take one of them fuckin school buses and use it like a vibrator up your cunt use them fuckin garbage trucks like a fuckin dildo and stick up your cunt.count vi alleged that eckhardt told creech i can fuckin wet my balls off t here your threat,have me locked up take your conventions and everything else and stick up your mother cunt.eckhardt contends tha
