fowler superior court d,a criminal case,holds that a county obligation to preserve recordings of telephone and radio communications for more than days arises only when the county has actual notice that such recordings are evidence in any claim filed or any pending litigation.in this civil case,we hold that a government tort claim filed with the county in conformance with section constitutes actual notice to the county that a claim is pending within the meaning of section.
on september,dwayne nelson was arrested by deputies steven trammell and david porter of the los angeles county sheriff department who were responding to several calls about a man with a gun.according to the deputies,nelson was placed in a patrol car,then removed from the vehicle because he was kicking and banging at the doors and windows.to keep nelson from injuring himself or a deputy and to prevent damage to the vehicle,the deputies placed nelson on the ground and applied a total appendage restraint procedure tarp or,as it is sometimes called,a ripp hobble restraint.nelson stopped breathing at the scene,and was transported by ambulance to a hospital,where he was declared dead on arrival.there were numerous radio calls and computer transmissions from the deputies at the scene to and from their supervisors and other deputies,and the entire tarping procedure was videotaped.
on october,lottie nelson dwayne nelson mother filed a claim for damages with the county of los angeles in which she asserted that the county was responsible for her son death.on february,wallace nelson dwayne nelson father filed a similar claim with the county.on july,lottie nelson and wallace nelson,individually and as the administrators of dwayne nelson estate but represented by separate counsel,sued the county of los angeles and the los angeles county sheriff department for wrongful death damages and by later amendments added several individuals as defendants.
in the fall of,plaintiffs served on the county a request for the production of documents in which they asked for the calls to which the deputies responded,all radio transmissions from the sheriff department vehicles,all audio recordings,all computer terminal transmissions from all sheriff department vehicles,all mobile display terminal records from the sheriff department vehicles,all mobile digital terminal printouts of all communications,and all administrative messages and daily work shift messages from the vehicles.the county produced the daily worksheets and administrative messages,but no mobile digital or voice communication systems or audio communications.
in september,after plaintiffs learned at the deposition of the deputy who had videotaped dwayne nelson on september,that the county had not produced certain items which were requested in the first round of discovery,they wrote to the lawyer representing both the county and the sheriff department,demanding the production of transcripts of witness interviews a copy of the microcassette made on the night of dwayne nelson death all dispatch tapes for calls made for medical assistance for dwayne nelson certain daily activity logs and all videotapes describing the sheriff department policies and practices regarding the use of a ripp hobble 
in late september,defense counsel produced complete copies of all interview tapes and transcripts,the requested microcassette,and the daily explained,in an accompanying letter,that the radio transmissions were no longer available but that the audio portion of the videotape contain ed the request for the paramedics and the dispatcher acknowledgement thereof.the letter was supported by a declaration from a sheriff department communication operator explaining that a search had been made for tapes of the radio communications but none had been section allows for the destruction or reuse of telephone and radio communications after days.the los angeles county board of supervisors established a policy of retaining the tapes for days.
in january about two weeks after the county and the sheriff department filed a motion for summary judgment and about six weeks before trial was set to begin,plaintiffs moved for sanctions against the county and the sheriff department on the ground that they had in bad faith destroyed the mobile digital and voice recordings made at the time of dwayne nelson arrest and death.plaintiffs asked the court for orders striking the answer filed by the county and the sheriff department and imposing issue and evidentiary sanctions,for jury instructions to the effect that the recordings had been destroyed notwithstanding a legal requirement to maintain them pending resolution of this litigation,and for monetary sanctions.
the county and the sheriff department opposed the motion on the ground that they were legally entitled to destroy recordings of telephone and radio communications.relying on section authorizes the destruction of recordings of telephone and radio communications after days unless the recordings and communications are evidence in any claim filed or any pending litigation as interpreted by fowler superior court,supra,d,to mean that a duty to preserve such evidence does not arise absent actual notice of a claim or pending litigation,the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for sanctions.
plaintiffs,in turn,filed a petition for a writ of mandate in which they asked us to find that lottie nelson claim filed days after dwayne nelson death was sufficient to constitute a claim within the meaning of section,and to trigger the county obligation to preserve the recordings beyond days.we issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing.
