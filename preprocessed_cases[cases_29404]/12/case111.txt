plaintiff global network communications,global,plaintiff,or appellant appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york stanton,dated and entered june,dismissing its complaint against defendants city of new york city and city of new york department of information technology and telecommunications department collectively defendants,for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under federal rule of civil procedure b.global contends the district court,having considered matters outside the pleadings,committed reversible error by failing to convert defendants rule b motion into a rule motion for summary judgment.
the district court perhaps understandably granted the city motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint because the papers before it contained serious allegations questioning whether it would be in the city best interest to grant a pay phone franchise to plaintiff.but,in dismissing the complaint,the district court erred by considering matters outside the pleadings.we must therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to it.
background 
global is one of the largest independent providers of pay phones in new york city.since it has installed and operated about of them on the city sidewalks and other public.in the city began to regulate pay phone providers by requiring that they obtain a franchise from the department,which is the city regulatory agency for telecommunications,if they wanted to continue doing business on the city.as of there were pay phones in new york city,of which about half were subject to city franchise and permit requirements.the other half,located on,such as stores,lobbies,parking lots,malls,schools,hospitals,do not require a permit from the city.
in global began complying with the city regulations and applied for a franchise.in may the department issued a final decision denying global application on the ground that its sole shareholder and president,ronald massie,had been arrested by the fbi in march for engaging in extortion and organized crime with the bonnano crime family and had used global as a vehicle to launder money.global successfully challenged the department denial in state court on due process grounds.the state court vacated and remanded the case with instructions to the department to cure the procedural deficiencies.on remand in february the department issued a preliminary decision that again denied global a franchise.the department observed that even if massie criminal activities were unrelated to global business,it would,in the exercise of its discretion,deny global a franchise.
plaintiff challenged this decision in a letter dated march.global contended in the letter that the city regulatory scheme and the department denial of the franchise violated federal telecommunications law.global also an effort to ameliorate any misgivings the department might have regarding global separate massie from the operations of the company and to place his ownership interest in an irrevocable family trust.the defendants,ignoring plaintiff letter,instead requested the immediate removal of all global pay phones from the city sidewalks and the sale of its pay phone business to a holder of a valid franchise.
district court proceedings 
global responded to defendants request by initiating the instant action in the southern district on october.it alleged defendants refusal to grant it a franchise violated,inter alia,the telecommunications act of,stat.act.the act,in sweeping terms,prevents local authorities from enacting any statute,regulation,or other legal requirement that prohibit s or ha s the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.a.
on november,the defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.they declared that their regulation of pay phones was not prohibited because another provision of the act permits local government s to manage the public and to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers for use of public on a nondiscriminatory basis.c.in defendants view,the denial of a franchise to global was a permissible exercise of the city authority under the act to manage the public,such as city sidewalks where plaintiff pay phones are placed.defendants asserted,in addition,that global affiliation with massie and its other past criminal activities demonstrated it could not be trusted to compensate the city in a timely manner and without fraud.
on march,while the parties were still briefing the motion to dismiss,the department issued a final determination implementing its preliminary decision of february not to grant global a franchise and thereby extinguishing plaintiff prospects for offering pay phones on the city streets.that same day,defendants filed their reply to global opposition to defendants rule b motion,attaching as an exhibit to its papers the department final determination.
three months later,on june,the district court rendered a decision granting defendants motion to dismiss.d.in arriving at its conclusions,the trial court quoted from massie testimony as a government witness in certain criminal proceedings and from the final determination issued in march.none of the quoted material is mentioned in plaintiff complaint.see id.at.in light of the allegations in defendants moving papers,the district court found that global prior criminal activities,and its past practice of failing to deal honestly with the city for use of the city,constituted valid reasons for denying the franchise,stating 
first,the city refusal of a franchise to global rests solidly on its authority to obtain compensation for the use of its,without need for further support under the city general right of administration or consideration of its scope.second,since global has no franchise it is unaffected by such provisions,and has no standing to complain of them.
id.at emphases in original.by finding the denial of the franchise a valid exercise of the city authority to obtain compensation,the district court effectively disposed of most of global claims,which were by and large premised on the invalidity of the franchise denial.
proceedings in this court 
global appealed the district court decision to this court,declaring that the trial court committed procedural error by failing to convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment,and that it had in fact stated a claim under the act.following oral argument of the appeal,we requested briefing from the federal communications commission fcc which had not been involved in this the question of applicability to global.in its amicus brief to us,the fcc expressed a view largely in accordance with that of the district court,stating that if the city properly denied global a franchise as a result of its owner criminal activities,global can not receive a franchise even if some of the particular terms or conditions that the city imposes on such a franchise might be unlawful.
but the fcc declined to address the substantive issue regarding the interpretation of because it had not yet formally confronted the issue,and suggested the possibility of referring this matter to the commission under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.the federal agency also observed that although the commission has not itself addressed the question whether under state and local governments may take into account the character of franchise applicants,the commission takes account of such matters in exercising its own regulatory authority.contemporary media,fcc.
on february,plaintiff moved,pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure a,for a preliminary injunction to prevent the city from removing global pay phones from the city,pending determination of this appeal.we granted the motion,even though global had moved unsuccessfully for a similar injunction before a motions panel prior to oral argument.
