the members of the pennsylvania public utility commission ppuc and core communications,appeal the district court ruling granting summary judgment in favor of at t.core billed at t for terminating phone calls from at t customers to core internet service provider isp customers from to.when at t refused to pay,core filed a complaint with the ppuc,which ruled in core favor.at t then filed suit in federal court seeking an injunction on the ground that the ppuc lacked jurisdiction over traffic because such traffic is the exclusive province of the federal communications commission.because we find that the fcc jurisdiction over local traffic is not exclusive and the ppuc orders did not conflict with federal law,we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for entry of judgment in favor of core and the members of the ppuc.
congress passed the telecommunications act of tca to fundamentally restructure local telephone markets.before the tca,local telephone service companies operated as monopolies.states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local service area to a local exchange carrier lec.one of the tca principal aims was to end local telephone monopolies and develop a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored local telephone market competition.the tca thus created two classes of lecs the new market entrants are considered competitive lecs clecs and the former monopolies are designated incumbent lecs ilecs 
recognizing the considerable barriers to entry associated with building out a network,the tca required ilecs to allow clecs to connect to their preexisting networks interconnection allows customers of one lec to call the customers of another,with the calling party lec the originating carrier transporting the call to the connection point,where the called party lec the terminating carrier takes over and transports the call to its end point.without mandatory interconnection,a clec customers would not be able to connect with friends or family who are customers of other phone companies whether ilec or clec.
interconnection,of course,costs money.the tca aimed to solve the problem of cost allocation by requiring reciprocal payment arrangements,best understood as an originator pays rule.in basic terms,when a customer of carrier a places a local call to a customer of carrier b,carrier a must pay carrier b for terminating the call,and vice versa.the logic behind this system was that,over time,the number of calls going each way would be essentially the same,and no lec would pay more than its fair share of the costs associated with terminating other lecs traffic.thus,all lecs have t he duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.but because the incumbents established market power gave them a potentially overwhelming advantage in negotiations,ilecs have a duty to negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith as does the requesting telecommunications carrier 
congress also provided an enforcement mechanism to ensure the formation of interconnection agreements.under,either party to an interconnection agreement may request that the relevant state commission participate in contract negotiations and mediate any differences if that fails,either lec may petition the same state commission to arbitrate unresolved issues but because proceedings govern only ilec clec disputes,it leaves something of an enforcement gap clecs have statutory duties to interconnect with other lecs,but there is no procedure specified for one clec to require another clec to enter into an interconnection agreement that would govern the terms of those duties.accordingly,clecs sometimes transmit traffic to each other without interconnection agreements.
the advent of internet invalidated the assumptions behind reciprocal arrangements.suddenly,many customers called isps with calls that,unlike calls to friends and family,were never returned.the fcc soon realized that this situation creat ed an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage.because traffic to isps flows one way,so does money in a reciprocal compensation regime,and if a carrier could create a customer base entirely out of isps,it could be paid to terminate calls,without ever reciprocating.indeed,b efore long,reciprocal compensation on traffic was costing ilecs billions.
the fcc sought to address the problem in its declaratory ruling because the fcc generally has jurisdiction over interstate communications and not purely intrastate communications the fcc first considered its own jurisdiction using its traditional jurisdictional analysis the fcc found that although calls to the isp itself were local,the ultimate destination is an internet website that is often located in another state,so it asserted jurisdiction over traffic more specifically,the fcc found that local traffic was jurisdictionally mixed because it appears to be largely interstate.
following the same reasoning,the fcc found that the reciprocal compensation scheme of,which applies to local traffic does not apply to traffic the fcc noted that,until it adopted a rule creating a new compensation structure,parties could voluntarily,but were not required to,include traffic in their otherwise mandatory interconnection agreements under and despite the nature of the traffic,the fcc still saw a role for state commissions to decide,as part of the arbitrations,whether reciprocal compensation should be required in a specific case 
after the fcc issued the declaratory ruling,ilecs petitioned for review in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the court vacated the ruling reasoning that,because the fcc considered the traffic local for some purposes,the fcc had failed to justify why did not apply to the admittedly local traffic despite its largely interstate character although the standard jurisdictional analysis was valid on its own terms,the fcc had extended the reasoning to determine that the traffic was for substantive rules.the court held that the fcc provided no rationale for that inferential leap notably,the court did not question or alter the jurisdictional analysis it merely noted that the fcc had not demonstrated that the analysis was appropriate for any other use.
in,the fcc responded with the isp remand order,reaching the same substantive conclusion that local traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation but on different legal grounds.the fcc found that it had previously erred by trying to rigidly classify traffic as either local or for the purposes of b,and the commission should instead have recognized that such traffic is a hybrid accordingly,the fcc ceased construing b using that dichotomy,instead reading g to limit the reach of the reciprocal compensation regime mandated in section b.thus,all local traffic would be governed by the reciprocal compensation scheme unless it fell into one of the three categories outlined in g exchange access,information access,and exchange services.the fcc found that traffic is indeed information access,and is therefore exempt from b.
having established a new rationale for exempting traffic from reciprocal compensation,the fcc invoked its general powers under b to address the market distortions under the current intercarrier compensation regimes for traffic.the commission set forth a new interim compensation including four specific rules,the most important of which is the rate cap an upper bound to the prices lecs could charge for traffic.this cap would,over time,move from per minute of use mou to mou,where it now continues to reside the fcc made clear that these caps are caps,not rates,and as such they have no effect to the extent that states have ordered lecs to exchange traffic either at rates below the caps or on a bill and keep basis or otherwise have not required payment of compensation for this traffic.
in addition,the interim compensation scheme created a growth cap,limiting the overall number of minutes a lec could be compensated for isp traffic the new markets rule,under which lecs that were not already party to interconnection agreements would exchange traffic on a basis and the mirroring rule,under which ilecs that seek to benefit from the rate caps must also terminate their own traffic at the same rate in,the fcc granted a petition from core requesting forbearance from enforcement of the new markets and growth cap rules,finding that they were no longer in the public interest 
the isp remand order was also challenged in the court of appeals for the circuit the court again rejected the fcc basis for exempting traffic from b,but determined that there were probably other legal bases for adopting the rules chosen by the fcc the court remanded to the fcc for better reasoning,but left the rules in place 
in,after worldcom successfully petitioned the court of appeals for the circuit for a writ of mandamus,the fcc released the isp mandamus order,in which the fcc concluded that traffic is subject to b but reasoned that the traffic could be treated differently due to the fcc broad authority to regulate and the savings clause in i the effect of the order was to maintain the cap and the mirroring rule pursuant to the fcc section authority,as a placeholder until the commission develops a more comprehensive compensation regime of the interim rules set out by the isp remand order,the rate caps and mirroring rule are still in force today.
core and at t are both clecs operating in pennsylvania.between and,at t provided local and long distance telephone service to its customers.over the same time period,core only customers were isps that provided internet connections to internet users.at t customers placed calls to core customers in order to gain access to the internet.all of the calls at issue were local,originating and terminating in the same local exchange area.each at t customer call was delivered by at t to verizon the local ilec,which then sent the call to core,and core terminated the call to the isp.
core did not bill at t for these calls immediately.during the time period at issue,core had an intrastate switched access tariff on file with the ppuc that specified core rate for terminating calls but did not relate to local calls.in january,core billed at t for calls dating back to june at the rate specified in its state tariff,mou.at t refused to pay,claiming that it believed the traffic had been exchanged on a basis 
on may,core filed a complaint with the ppuc against at t,seeking payment at its rate for terminating the calls.at t moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the ppuc lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute because the calls were subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the fcc.on december,the ppuc issued a final order holding that it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute,and that federal law,including the isp remand order,applied.the ppuc found that its ability to set rates for traffic was preempted by the isp remand order,and because the rate charged by core was greater than the federal cap,the federal cap of mou should be applied as the new rate.accordingly,the ppuc ordered that at t pay core for terminating calls at the lower rate.additionally,pursuant to a state statute of limitations the ppuc limited core recovery to calls terminated on or after may.the ppuc ultimately ordered at t to pay a total of to core by september.
at t then filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,seeking to enjoin enforcement of the ppuc order.soon after,at t moved for a preliminary injunction.because the suit involved only legal issues,the district court converted at t motion to a motion for summary judgment.in the district court,as here,at t argued that the ppuc violated federal law because it lacked jurisdiction awarded charges at a rate not contained in any federal tariff or contract,violating and allowed core to recover reciprocal compensation without a reciprocal compensation arrangement,violating b impermissibly engaged in retroactive ratemaking and applied the incorrect statute of limitations.the district court agreed that the ppuc lacked jurisdiction,and accordingly,did not address the remaining four issues.core and the members of the ppuc appealed.
after lodging the appeal,the ppuc filed a separate petition for declaratory order with the fcc asking whether state commissions have the authority to apply federal telecommunications law to adjudicate intercarrier compensation disputes between two clecs that indirectly exchanged calls without an interconnection agreement.the formal public comment cycle on the ppuc petition closed july.before oral argument on november,we asked the fcc to comment on this case.on november,the fcc sent a letter to the court declining to do so,reasoning that it could not comment because there was an open fcc administrative proceeding presenting the same question between the same parties.accordingly,after oral argument,we held the case until june,to give the fcc time to make a determination.as the fcc has yet to rule on the ppuc petition,we now proceed without its input.
the communications act of created the fcc and gave it the power to regulate interstate communications the act originally designated all communications as either interstate or intrastate,giving the fcc jurisdiction over solely interstate communications and leaving the states with jurisdiction over intrastate communications in,however,the tca significantly altered the clean lines of jurisdiction established in the act t he tca provides that various responsibilities are to be divided between the state and federal governments,making it an exercise in what has been termed cooperative federalism.that is,congress enlisted the aid of state public utility commissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly and with due regard to the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances of local regulation under the prior regime.
the parties ask us to determine whether traffic is interstate or jurisdictionally mixed,with the supposed attendant implications that,in the former case,the fcc has exclusive jurisdiction,and,in the latter,state and federal jurisdiction exist concurrently.the picture,however,is more complicated.
whether a particular type of communications is interstate or intrastate is a technical question.to determine the answer to that question,we look to the telecommunications act of and the fcc regulations interpreting that statute.we defer to an agency interpretation of its regulations,even in a legal brief,unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations or there is any other reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.this deference applies whether or not the question at issue is jurisdictional.
as described above,the fcc employs jurisdictional analysis to determine whether communications are intrastate or interstate while the parties in this case ask us to determine whether the traffic is interstate or jurisdictionally mixed,the fcc has not always been so precise,often using the terms interchangeably.thus,while we read the fcc rulings to mean that the traffic is interstate,the inquiry will not end there.
the fcc first pass at the question came in the declaratory ruling,where the commission found that local traffic was jurisdictionally mixed because it appears to be largely interstate.three more times throughout the order,the fcc used the phrase largely interstate to describe the traffic after the circuit vacated the declaratory ruling,the fcc revisited its original finding in the isp remand order.there the fcc used the terms jurisdictionally mixed and interstate interchangeably to describe both the original ruling and the traffic itself in other places,the isp remand order referred to traffic as being predominantly interstate or having an interstate component.in one of the same paragraphs in which the order refers to the traffic as predominantly interstate,the fcc also noted that it has long held traffic to be interstate.thus,the isp remand order treats the traffic as interstate,but treats jurisdictionally mixed as a synonym.
the fcc has addressed this question elsewhere as well.in,the ninth circuit decided at t communications of california pac west telecommunications that case was factually similar to the one at hand,stemming from an at t subsidiary refusal to pay for traffic exchanged with a clec with which it did not have an interconnection agreement.indeed,the california public utilities commission cpuc ruled against at t,just as the ppuc did here,and at t subsequently sued the cpuc and pac west in federal court,challenging,among other things,cpuc jurisdiction to hear the dispute.when the ninth circuit asked the fcc for its view,the commission filed an amicus brief,stating that it has consistently held that communications are jurisdictionally interstate based on its jurisdictional analysis but the same brief also asked the court to refrain from deciding whether the cpuc had jurisdiction the cpuc had applied a state tariff that exceeded the federal rate cap,and the fcc argued and the court agreed that the court did not need to decide the jurisdictional question because the isp remand order applied even between two clecs and the cpuc application of the higher rate was preempted by the federal rate caps thus,while we are left to address the question of a state commission jurisdiction for the first time,the fcc amicus brief states its position on its own jurisdiction clearly,and it accords with the statements in the isp remand order.
deferring to the fcc determination,we find that local traffic is interstate for jurisdictional purposes nevertheless,as a factual matter,the mixed nature of the traffic is not irrelevant.
we draw two further lessons from the fcc treatment of the jurisdictional question.first,the jurisdictional determination reflects only a finding about the commission power to regulate under section,not a view that its jurisdiction is exclusive.a matter may be subject to fcc jurisdiction,without the fcc having exercised that jurisdiction and preempted state regulation.this makes sense here because the thrust of the isp remand order analysis focused on how the fcc broad authority allows it to create the interim rules under the savings clause in i.the analysis established the fcc power,but did not restrict or even address competing power from the states.
several points further support this conclusion.by using the terms interstate and jurisdictionally mixed interchangeably in the isp remand order,the fcc demonstrated that it could not have been ruling about exclusive jurisdiction.based on the traditional understanding of the terms,purely interstate traffic is exclusively committed to the fcc and jurisdictionally mixed traffic is subject to dual jurisdiction.if the fcc believed the tca committed traffic to its exclusive jurisdiction,it would have distinguished between the two.elsewhere in the text,the order also explicitly reserves state commission authority in certain relevant matters.finally,in the pac west amicus brief,the fcc both called traffic interstate and declined to take a position on whether the jurisdiction is exclusive this would make no sense if interstate traffic necessarily implies exclusive jurisdiction.
second,according to the fcc,or services are generally subject to dual jurisdiction,except where it is impossible or impractical to separate the service intrastate from interstate components and the state regulation of the intrastate component interferes with valid federal rules or policies.that is to say,where as here the interstate and intrastate components are inseparable state jurisdiction over mixed use services such as local traffic is tied to conflict preemption.this view recognizes the realities of technology and economics that belie such a clean parceling of responsibility between the state and federal governments a state is therefore both preempted and lacking jurisdiction to regulate local traffic if and only if the state regulation conflicts with federal law.thus,the question before us is whether the fcc intended in the isp remand order to exercise its jurisdiction over the precise issue here,to the exclusion of state regulation.
discussing its implementation of the new rate caps in the isp remand order,the fcc was clear that state rates were preempted and state commissions no longer had authority to set rates higher than the cap because the fcc exercise d its authority under section to determine the appropriate intercarrier compensation for traffic state commissions no longer have authority to address this issue.read in isolation,at t interpretation that the fcc meant to effect field preemption is plausible.but just two paragraphs prior,the fcc was equally explicit that the rate caps are indeed caps and do not apply to rates lower than those federally mandated if there remain state rates to which the rate caps do not apply,the fcc can not have intended field preemption this reading is further confirmed by the isp mandamus order,in which the fcc conclude d that it is appropriate to retain the rate cap and mirroring rule,but only on a transitional basis until a state commission has established reciprocal compensation rates that are at or below per.the fcc clearly contemplated states continued involvement in ratesetting,and therefore we must conclude that the fcc meant only to preempt rates that conflict with its own regulation that is,rates that exceed the cap 
when faced with the possibility of applying rates that exceed the federal cap,the ppuc recognized the primacy of federal law and reduced the applicable rates to match the federal limit.this is where this case diverges from the facts of pac west.by lowering the state rates it applied,the ppuc avoided a conflict with federal law.because there was no conflict,the ppuc actions were not preempted.
at t argues,however,and the district court concluded,that state commissions may only act pursuant to their role in mediating and arbitrating interconnection agreements under of the tca but the tca itself invites state involvement in more than at t argument ignores both the fcc statements regarding state commissions involvement in ratesetting and the cooperative federalism principles inherent in the tca by presuming that the statute stripped states of all authority to act unless delegated back to them the picture is simply not that 
at t reliance on mci telecommunications bell atlantic is similarly misplaced.mci concerned sovereign immunity for states arbitrating interconnection agreements under.under the eleventh amendment,we held that the states were granted a gratuity and were voluntarily regulating on behalf of congress because congress could have withdrawn all power from states,but instead allowed the states to keep some accordingly,such states waived sovereign immunity and could be sued but we also reasoned that although congress could have made that preemption complete,it did not rather,we stated that congress federalized the regulation of competition for local telecommunications service.based on the integrated system of cooperative federalism that we have previously endorsed and which we reiterate today,we hold that although traffic is interstate,states retain jurisdiction to regulate traffic where the state regulations do not conflict with federal law.
having established that the ppuc had jurisdiction to hear the dispute,we turn to at t additional arguments that the ppuc orders violate federal law in four other ways.
at t contends that the ppuc orders violate and because core neither filed a federal tariff that would apply to billing for interstate services nor negotiated a contract with at t thus,in light of that fact billing at any rate is unreasonable.for support,at t looks to a number of fcc adjudications where the fcc rejected the idea that a clec could bill for interstate services without a federal tariff or contract covering the services.but the cases at t cites all involve interstate services that is,intercarrier compensation for calls between states as we point out above,although local traffic is jurisdictionally interstate,it is still subject to state control unless otherwise preempted by the fcc.nothing in the isp remand order requires federal tariffing had the fcc intended that traffic rates be governed by federal tariffs,it would have set rates to be tariffed,not rate caps that set upper limits to state tariffs.traffic is therefore fundamentally different from interstate services,and there is no federal tariffing requirement.
at t next contends that the ppuc orders violate b,which requires all lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.according to at t,the statutory language explicitly requires an arrangement,a contract,before a lec can recover b charges.this argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.first,while b applies to traffic,the reciprocal arrangements for that traffic are governed by the isp remand order.this is the holding of the isp mandamus order and as the ninth circuit held in pac west,the isp remand order applies as much between two clecs as between and an ilec and a clec thus,because the ppuc complied with the isp remand order,it also complied with b.
at t argument also invites an odd result.core is required by statute to terminate at t traffic irrespective of a billing arrangement being put in place.thus,if at t refuses to pay,core is left no recourse because it followed the law and terminated all the calls it received even though it did not first arrange for payment.this view amounts to a default arrangement,whereby neither side must pay unless each side comes to a voluntary agreement.but that was precisely the new markets rule that the fcc deemed no longer in the public interest in the core forbearance order if that were the meaning of the isp remand order and b,the new markets rule never would have been necessary.and if we were to interpret b this way,we would render null the fcc finding that such a rule is no longer in the public interest.
at t next argues that because no tariff was established,any rate above is impermissible retroactive ratemaking.because these calls were local calls,the intrastate long distance tariff core had filed with the ppuc filed did not directly apply it applied only between two different local exchange areas within the state.to accept at t position,we would again be required to find that the default rate is,which is once again the new markets rule.but that is not the primary reason this argument fails.
the purpose of the rule against retroactivity,and the closely related filed rate doctrine,is to ensure predictability.the question is therefore whether,absent an agreement,it was predictable that the state commission would apply a rate equal to the federal rate cap.at t was on notice since that it could be subject to payment for the exchange of traffic and on notice since that a rate would not be the general default.while at t assumed this traffic was being transmitted on a basis and it had arrangements with other clecs,core charges other clecs it interconnects with so there is no reason to think at t assumption is the industry norm.
though it may have been unclear precisely which rate the ppuc would apply,the federal cap was not only foreseeable,but the most likely rate.four logical possibilities existed core intrastate switched access tariff of mou,the telric rate a state commission rate calculated to defray of mou,the federal cap of mou,or.the first two were clearly not permissible not only because they conflict with the isp remand order,but also because the rates are so much higher than the federal cap that at t should have known that whatever eventual rate the ppuc thought was fair would be capped by federal law.of the two remaining choices,applying the cap as a rate was much more likely than allowing no compensation at all.therefore,the ppuc orders did not violate the rule against retroactive ratemaking.
finally,at t argues that the ppuc orders violate federal law by applying a state statute of limitations to core claims instead of,which applies to a ll actions at law by carriers for recovery of their lawful charges.but at t concedes that a applies only to charges that are subject to federal tariffing requirements we also need not address whether the federal or state statute of limitations applies because,as the ppuc noted in its order,the proper federal statute of limitations is the catchall found at.the applies to any federal civil action enacted after without a specific associated cause of action this includes b,which became law in,and under which this case arose thus,the ppuc application of a statute of limitations is proper.
at t had every reason to believe it could be charged for its customers traffic that core terminated.rather than voluntarily negotiating an interconnection agreement with core,at t waited,putting the onus on core to come forward and negotiate.in reality,the ppuc found that core was entitled to compensation for the traffic,and if at t wanted to negotiate a arrangement,it should have done so.
federal law does not require that core be compensated for the traffic.the tca system of cooperative federalism exists specifically so that state public utility commissions can determine these kinds of questions for themselves,with due regard to the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances of local regulation.the fcc established the boundary of the ppuc jurisdiction by implementing rate caps.when the ppuc chose to apply a rate equal to the federal rate cap,it respected that boundary,and furthered the very purpose of the tca scheme.
we will therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of core and the members of the ppuc.
