comsat and,along with intervenors mci worldcom,sprint corporation,and telecommunications resellers association,petition for review of joint board on universal service,cc docket,sixteenth order on reconsideration,fcc,fcc rcd,wl released,remand order.finding that comsat lacks standing,we dismiss comsat petition for lack of jurisdiction.with respect to the petition of and the intervenors,we reverse and remand.
pursuant to the telecommunications act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of title,united states code the act,the federal communications commission the commission issued its universal service order.see joint board on universal service,fcc rcd,wl.numerous parties challenged that order,and we affirmed it in part and reversed it in part in our decision in texas office of public utility counsel fcc,cir topuc.
in topuc,we addressed two portions of the universal service order pertinent to the petitions now before us.first,comsat,also a party in topuc,attacked the inclusion of international services revenue in determining a carrier universal service fund contribution.comsat contended that for carriers like itself,who generate minimal interstate services revenues,the fcc rule required it to pay a universal service contribution that exceeded its interstate services revenues.comsat maintained that this outcome violated d requirement that all universal service support be equitable and nondiscriminatory.we agreed and found that the commission interpretation of d,in which it found it could impose such costs on carriers,was arbitrary and capricious and manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.
second,gte asserted that requiring incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to recover their universal service costs through access charges to interexchange carriers ixcs contravened the act mandate that all support for universal service be explicit.see topuc,at.we agreed and concluded that the plain language of e did not permit the fcc to maintain any implicit subsidies for universal service support.id.we further found that by forcing ilecs to recover their universal service contributions through access charges,the fcc interpretation maintain ed an implicit subsidy for ilecs.id.accordingly,we reversed and remanded to the fcc.
in response to topuc,the commission issued the remand order.the agency adopted a percentage rule for when a carrier international revenues would be included in the base from which the agency calculates the carrier universal service contribution.under the new rule,if a carrier derives less than percent of its revenue from interstate services,its international revenues will not be used in calculating the contribution.for those carriers receiving percent or more of their revenues from interstate services,the fcc will include their international revenue in the base for determining their contributions.the commission also revised its rule regarding ilec access charges by permitting,rather than requiring,ilecs to recover their universal service costs through access charges to interstate carriers 
comsat and each filed for review of the remand order in the district of columbia circuit court of appeals.their cases were consolidated and they made a motion to transfer the case to our circuit,which was granted.mci worldcom,sprint,and telecommunications resellers association intervened comsat challenges the commission percent rule.challenges the commission decision to permit ilecs to recover universal service fund contributions through access charges to interstate carriers.
as a preliminary matter,we must address the commission assertion that comsat lacks standing to bring this challenge to the universal service fund percent contribution rule.if comsat lacks standing,we lack jurisdiction to consider its challenge.see steel citizens for a better env t,d a party standing must be addressed first because w ithout jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause quoting ex parte mccardle,wall.opinion of scalia.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires three things.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first the plaintiff,must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant third,it must be likely as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.at internal quotations and citations omitted see bertulli indep.of continental pilots,cir.comsat bears the burden of demonstrating that it has met these requirements.see lujan,at.at.
comsat currently makes no payment to the universal service fund,nor are its revenues sufficient to trigger the percent rule.thus,comsat injury is not that it now makes a universal service payment nor that it is subject to the percent rule.instead,comsat posits that it suffers from two interrelated injuries.first,it contends that it faces the threat of a massive universal service payment should its interstate revenues reach the percent threshold.second,the cost of that contribution would be so great as to render entry into the interstate services market unprofitable,and,therefore,the threat of this payment operates as a barrier to comsat entry into that market.in support of its argument,comsat maintains that the threat of payment it faces is analogous to the injury suffered by the new york city health and hospitals nychhc in clinton new york,d,which the supreme court found sufficient to confer standing on nychhc.we disagree.
in clinton,the supreme court concluded that the nychhc had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the line item veto act.nychhc challenged the president cancellation of a provision that would have relieved nychhc of its contingent liability to the united states,which remained contingent because of a pending petition for a waiver of the liability.see clinton,at.at.comsat contends that it too suffers from a contingent liability,the possible universal service payment.in making this comparison,comsat focuses on nychhc still pending waiver and the potential for relief this waiver provided apart from that which would have been afforded by the provision had it not been canceled.this comparison to nychhc is flawed because comsat assumes that the nychhc contingent liability per se was the injury that gave nychhc standing.the supreme court reasoning demonstrates otherwise.in rejecting the government contention that nychhc injury was too speculative because the liability might still be waived,the court compared nychhc injury to the setting aside of a favorable verdict and remanding for a new trial.the court stated even if the outcome of the second trial is speculative,the reversal,like the president cancellation,causes a significant immediate injury by depriving the defendant of the benefit of a favorable final judgment.id.at.at.nychhc injury occurred when the president canceled the provision,depriving it of immediate relief from liability.the fact that nychhc liability might later have been relieved by this waiver did not affect the court conclusion that the cancellation caused nychhc to lose a benefit which it already had in hand.comsat,in contrast,does not contend that it lost a benefit.thus,clinton is inapposite to the case at bar.
a threatened injury satisfies the injury in fact requirement so long as that threat is real,rather than speculative.see whitmore arkansas,d a threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute an injury in fact.internal quotations and citations omitted trominski,cir mere threatened injury is sufficient,and the threat in this case is real.here,in order for the threat of a universal service payment to be sufficiently concrete,comsat must be able to expand into the interstate services market so as to increase its revenue to the requisite percent.see city of los angeles lyons,d lyons standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds b
