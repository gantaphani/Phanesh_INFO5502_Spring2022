plaintiff,global network communications,global appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york stanton,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,the city of new york city and its department of information technology and telecommunications doitt.global lawsuit results from the city denial of global application for a public pay telephone ppt franchise on the basis of its ties to organized crime,its past history of fraud,and its debts and arrears.the district court held that the city denial of global application,as well as the city regulatory scheme for ppts,did not violate the federal telecommunications act of tca.the district court further held that the city regulatory scheme for ppts was not preempted by state or federal law.finally,the court dismissed global claims that the city actions violated its constitutional rights.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the city actions fall squarely within the safe harbor provisions of section c of the tca,which provide local government with the authority to manage public and to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers.global furthermore has failed to identify any federal or state law that preempts the city actions,and its constitutional claims are without merit.therefore,we affirm the summary judgment of the district court.
background 
since,new york city has required a license as a precondition to the installation or operation of a ppt on and property,including sidewalks.prior to,the city did not enforce this requirement rigorously.several telecommunications providers,including global,installed ppts on city sidewalks and on the sides of buildings intruding onto public without having obtained the required license.in,however,the city passed local law,which established the regulatory scheme in effect today.that law provides that n o public pay telephone shall be installed on any street or other inalienable property of the city without a permit.city admin.code.permits are issued only to telecommunications providers who have been granted a franchise to operate ppts by the city doitt.id.a.local law also offered a conditional amnesty procedure whereby previously installed unlicensed ppts could remain in operation if the owner obtained a franchise,identified its ppts on a registry submitted to the doitt,and paid the city interim fees equal to per ppt per year,and the commissioner lodged no objection to the continued operation of such phones on property.city local law,a,d.any company whose application for a franchise was denied by the commissioner decision not to approve a franchise for such owner,was obliged within days either to remove its unlicensed ppts or sell them to a company that possessed a franchise.id.c.local law applies only to city property ppts on private property are not subject to the city regulatory scheme.see city admin.code.
on may,the doitt rejected global initial request for a franchise on the ground that its ceo and sole shareholder,ronald massie,is an associate of the bonnano organized crime family accused of loan sharking and money laundering through the company.massie subsequently pleaded guilty to a federal indictment charging him with loan sharking,mail fraud,and bank fraud.he later testified that global derived to percent of its business from locations that were chosen or secured by members of the bonnano crime family.he admitted to using connections to the bonnano crime family in order to secure ppt locations,and property owners reported that these individuals threatened and intimidated them into accepting the ppts.massie also admitted that global had defrauded the owners of the properties on which global had installed its ppts out of million in commissions.
global challenged the franchise denial through a special proceeding pursuant to article of the new york civil practice laws and rules.on july,the new york supreme court gans,vacated and remanded the matter to the doitt for further proceedings because the denial implicated global liberty and property interests and global therefore should be afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations regarding massie conviction and its relationship to the operation of the business.global network commc ns,dobrin,slip op.at.july.
after conducting further proceedings in which global was afforded the opportunity to respond,the doitt again rejected global franchise request.in its march,determination,the doitt explained 
t here are multiple independent bases for not proposing the award of a franchise to global global established a significant part of its business through its use of organized crime soldiers global has defrauded property owners who authorized use of property for global ppts and global has been repeatedly delinquent in the payment of registry fees and thus can not be reliably trusted to timely pay franchise compensation and also has significant unpaid fines related to its payphone operations that remain payable to the city.
the doitt also specifically noted that even if massie did divest himself more fully from global than merely withdrawing from operations,the nature of the city justifiable concerns about global would not be adequately resolved because of the intimate involvement of global itself with organized crime and the fact that global has failed to timely pay fines owed to the city and has repeatedly been late in its registry payments.
global again challenged the commissioner determination through an article proceeding.in a decision dated november,the new york supreme court feinman,denied global petition on the merits.the court held that the doitt had lawfully exercised its discretion in its march,decision and global due process rights had not been violated.global commc ns,menchini.global failed to perfect an appeal.
global filed its complaint in this lawsuit on october,and amended its complaint on july,setting forth eleven causes of action.the first five claims allege that the city ppt regulatory scheme and its denial of a ppt franchise to global violate the tca.the sixth and seventh claims allege that the city legal framework is preempted by both existing state law and federal law the remaining claims allege violations of global constitutional rights and seek damages,costs,and attorney fees,pursuant to and 
the district court,in a decision dated june,granted the defendants motion to dismiss under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.global network commc ns,city of new york,d.the court ruled that the city denial of global application for a franchise fell within the safe harbor exception of section c of the tca,which provides the city with the authority to manage the public and require fair and reasonable compensation.it also dismissed all of global claims relying on preemption by state and federal law,as well as global claims of constitutional violations.
on appeal,this court vacated the judgment and remanded on the ground that the district court erred in consider ing matters outside plaintiff complaint in granting a motion under rule b global network commc ns,city of new york,cir.we ruled that the district court should have converted the defendants rule b motion into a rule motion for summary judgment and given the plaintiff an opportunity to contest the matter upon which the defendant motion relied.id.at.we also stated that in remanding on procedural grounds,we express no opinion regarding the correctness of the trial court rulings on the merits,and it may well be that upon a motion for summary judgment the court will reach the same conclusion as it did initially.id.at.
on remand,the defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion.global network commc ns,city of new york,d.the district court ruled that the city denial of global ppt franchise fits comfortably within the exception of section c of the tca.it reasoned that inherent within the city right to require compensation is the reasonable expectation that its compensation will be paid accurately in full,on time,and without criminal involvement or fraud and found that the evidence supported doitt deter
