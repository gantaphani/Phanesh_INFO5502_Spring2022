this case arises out of a dispute between two telecommunications carriers.plaintiff appellant autotel is a commercial mobile radio service cmrs provider wishing to provide wireless service in and around pahrump,nevada.it seeks digital interconnection with the facilities and equipment of defendant appellee nevada bell telephone at t nevada,the incumbent local exchange carrier lec in the area.after the parties efforts to negotiate an interconnection agreement failed,autotel brought suit in federal court,alleging that at t nevada violated the telecommunications act of by refusing to negotiate in good faith and failing to provide digital interconnection with symmetrical pricing on an interim basis during negotiations,as required by federal communications commission fcc regulations.
the district court dismissed autotel first cause of action and granted summary judgment to at t nevada on autotel second cause of action.autotel appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
we hold that the district court properly dismissed autotel good faith claim because autotel did not exhaust its administrative remedies under our circuit prudential exhaustion requirement.instead,autotel appeals from the state public utilities commission summary dismissal of its complaint as procedurally deficient without addressing its merits.with respect to autotel second cause of action,we hold that the interim arrangement and symmetrical pricing requirements described in and e apply only when the competing carrier does not have an existing interconnection arrangement with the incumbent lec that provides for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic.because autotel had such an arrangement with at t nevada at all relevant times,at t nevada had no obligation to provide autotel an interim arrangement with symmeterical rates.
we remand,however,to permit the district court to consider what,if any,relief is available to autotel under.
background 
the telecommunications act of the act,stat,introduced a competitive regime for local telecommunications services,radio servs.qwest western radio i,cir.before its passage,a single company within each local area typically provided local telephone service pursuant to a monopoly.see verizon california,peevey,cir.to encourage competition,the act imposed on incumbent lecs,such as at t nevada,the duty to provide interconnection to competing telecommunications carriers,such as autotel.see c.interconnection is the physical act of linking one network to another through facilities and equipment.radio servs.qwest western radio ii,cir emphasis,citations and internal quotations marks omitted.it allows customers of one lec to call the customers of another,with the calling party lec the originating carrier transporting the call to the connection point,where the called party lec the terminating carrier takes over and transports the call to its end point.verizon california,at.
the act adopted several substantive requirements relating to the quality and nature of the interconnection.for example,an incumbent lec must provide interconnection at any technically feasible point within its network that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself.c b,c.in addition,interconnecting carriers must establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b.under a reciprocal compensation arrangement,the originating lec must compensate the terminating lec for delivering its customer call to the end point.verizon california,at 
if a carrier requests interconnection,both parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith the particular terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement.c.the act sets forth a procedural framework for these negotiations.an incumbent lec and a requesting carrier may negotiate a voluntary agreement,and either party may ask a state public utilities commission puc to mediate any differences arising in the course of the negotiation.a.if the parties fail to reach a complete agreement through voluntary negotiations or mediation,either party may petition the state puc to resolve the open issues through compulsory arbitration.see b.
autotel first interconnected with at t nevada network in through five analog loops connecting to the at t nevada switch in pahrump,nevada.at t nevada charged autotel a flat monthly fee pursuant to at t nevada standard retail tariff for such lines.
in august,autotel requested digital interconnection with at t nevada network pursuant to and of the act.voluntary negotiations were unsuccessful,and in august,autotel filed a petition with the public utilities commission of nevada pucn seeking arbitration of an interconnection agreement.after nearly two years,the pucn dismissed autotel petition.it found that autotel had failed to comply with the pucn discovery procedures and orders,and thus had violated its duty to negotiate in good faith.see b.
in march,the fcc promulgated new rules prohibiting lecs from charging cmrs providers rates for transport and termination of local traffic.see intercarrier compensation,d.the fcc explained that as of april,the effective date of the new rules,any existing wireless termination tariffs shall no longer apply and a fter that date,in the absence of a request for an interconnection agreement,no compensation will be owed for termination of local traffic.intercarrier compensation.at.the new rule authorized incumbent lecs to initiate negotiation of interconnection agreements under the act,see e,and in november,at t nevada took advantage of this provision and requested an interconnection agreement with autotel,presumably in an effort to secure a new compensation arrangement.the parties still could not agree.autotel alleges that at t nevada refused to provide autotel with the same digital interconnection that it used in its own network unless autotel accepted at t nevada standard terms and conditions,which were unacceptable to autotel.
on august,richard oberdorfer,autotel president and sole shareholder,filed a complaint with the pucn on behalf of autotel alleging that at t nevada refused to negotiate in good faith,and asking the pucn to order at t nevada to provide digital interconnection on autotel terms.the pucn rejected the complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with the commission procedural requirements for telecommunications complaints.it did not address the merits.oberdorfer refiled the complaint a few days later.the pucn again summarily rejected the complaint as procedurally deficient.rather than correct and refile the complaint with the pucn,autotel filed suit in federal district court under 
autotel asserted three claims before the district court.only two remain on appeal.we consider each claim in turn.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court order granting a motion to dismiss under rule b.see western radio ii,at.we generally consider only allegations contained in the pleadings,exhibits attached to the complaint,and matters properly subject to judicial notice.id.at quoting manzarek paul fire marine ins,cir.we accept as true all factual allegations and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see id.
we likewise review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.verizon california,at.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
ii.failure to negotiate in good faith 
autotel claims that at t nevada violated c and a by failing to negotiate in good faith to provide interconnection that comports with the act.we hold that the district court properly dismissed this claim because autotel did not exhaust its administrative remedies.
in western radio i,at,we held that prudential concerns require that the plaintiff present its good faith claim to the puc before bringing suit in district court under.see also id.at g iven the nature of the plaintiff asserted cause of action and the role allotted to state commissions by congress,the puc must address the plaintiff good faith claim before that claim may be brought in district court.the parties agree that this prudential exhaustion requirement applies to autotel good faith claim but disagree as to whether autotel satisfied it.
the pucn twice rejected autotel complaint without prejudice and without considering the merits because the complaint did not comply with the pucn procedural rules.with respect to the second filing,the pucn noted that autotel had simply changed the title of the document without addressing any of the substantive deficiencies or inconsistencies.the pucn strongly recommended that autotel retain or at least consult with competent legal counsel before refiling because the incomplete submission demonstrate d a lack of required expertise and familiarity with the commission rules and regulations.it explained that it would apply any filing fee that autotel had already paid to any new submission.
autotel contends that its actions were sufficient to satisfy the prudential exhaustion requirement set forth in western radio i.we disagree.in the words of the district court 
were we to conclude that autotel efforts were sufficient,parties seeking to avoid the state regulatory process would have an easy row to hoe they would need only to present a noncompliant application with the pucn,wait for the claim to be dismissed,and then file suit in federal court.
such an administrative bypass would undermine the statutory and regulatory framework underlying the act.see western radio i,at adopting prudential exhaustion requirement to discourage bypass of the administrative process.
in addition,it is undisputed that the pucn did not decide autotel good faith claim on the merits.western radio ii presented a similar scenario.there,the plaintiff attempted to raise its good faith claim before the state puc by an improper request for arbitration.see western radio ii,at.the puc summarily dismissed the petition without reaching the merits.see id.we concluded that the puc dismissal of the petition in no way represented a ruling on any good faith claim and therefore did not support the plaintiff contention that it had exhausted its claim.id.at.we therefore affirmed the district court dismissal for failure to exhaust because the good faith claim was never properly presented to,nor decided by,the puc.id.at.
the same is true here.the pucn summarily rejected autotel complaint on procedural grounds and made no mention of the substantive merits of autotel claim.it dismissed the complaint without prejudice and explained that autotel could refile without paying additional fees.in addition to eviscerating western radio i exhaustion requirement,permitting this sort of purely procedural decision to constitute administrative exhaustion would undermine the uniquely prominent role that congress intended state pucs to have in the process of negotiation and approval of interconnection agreements under the act,including the duty to interpret and enforce the obligation to negotiate in good faith.western radio i,at.it would upset the balance that we struck in western radio i between the rights of parties to bring their private causes of action in federal court and a statutory scheme providing an alternative means of resolution before an agency.id.at.
autotel also argues that its complaint to the pucn was not procedurally flawed and that any failure to exhaust should be excused because returning to the pucn,which refuses to address the good faith issue,would be futile.these arguments are unpersuasive.the pucn did not refuse to address autotel good faith claim.rather,it enforced the procedural requirements of the nevada administrative code.see.admin.code regarding telecommunications complaints.admin.code regarding petitions submitted to the pucn pursuant to and.there is no reason to believe that had autotel submitted a procedurally conforming filing,the pucn would have rejected it nor do we agree that because autotel appeared before the pucn pro se,the commission should have overlooked any procedural defects in autotel complaint.see western radio ii,at rejecting the same argument.we are not reviewing the pucn decision,and the pucn is not a party to this action.in addition,unlike the pleadings rejected in the cases autotel cites in support of this argument,autotel nonconforming complaints were dismissed without prejudice.this is not an unjust and excessive sanction.cripps life ins.of,cir.
finally,we reject autotel contention unsupported by citation to authority that the procedures set forth in the nevada administrative code do not apply to its pucn complaint because its claim was based on federal law.to the contrary,nevada law expressly provides that the provisions of the nevada administrative code govern practice before the pucn,including in proceedings under the act.see.admin.code general practice before the pucn.admin.code petitions submitted under the act.admin.code complaints relating to public utilities,including telecommunications carriers.we recognized that state procedural rules would govern such proceedings when we cited the oregon puc procedures as pertinent to our prudential exhaustion analysis in western radio see at.
iii.failure to provide interim interconnection 
autotel contends that at t nevada violated and e by refusing to provide digital interconnection with symmetrical pricing on an interim basis during negotiation of a permanent interconnection agreement.we agree with the district court that because autotel had an existing interconnection arrangement with at t nevada,at t nevada had no obligation to provide interim interconnection or symmetrical pricing under these sections 
first,autotel argues that under,once it initiated negotiation of an interconnection agreement under the act in august,at t nevada was required to provide interim digital interconnection for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic at symmetrical rates autotel contends that the analog interconnection arrangement between autotel and at t nevada did not satisfy at t nevada interconnection obligation because it was established before congress passed the act and did not provide for reciprocal compensation.we disagree.
by its terms,requires an incumbent lec such as at t nevada to provide transport and termination of local traffic under an interim arrangement only when it receives such a request from a telecommunications carrier that does not already have an interconnection arrangement providing for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic by the incumbent.see a similarly,the obligation to provide interim transport and termination of telecommunications traffic at symmetrical rates is triggered u pon receipt of a request as described in paragraph a of this section,b,which refers to a request from a telecommunications carrier without an existing interconnection arrangement,a emphasis added.the fcc promulgated this regulation to accelerate the pace at which new entrants to the local market could initiate service 
we are concerned that some new entrants that do not already have interconnection arrangements with incumbent lecs may face delays in initiating service solely because of the need to negotiate transport and termination arrangements with the incumbent lec to promote the act goal of rapid competition in the local exchange,we order incumbent lecs upon request from new entrants to provide transport and termination of traffic,on an interim basis,pending resolution of negotiation and arbitration regarding transport and termination prices,and approval by the state commission we also conclude that interim prices for transport and termination shall be symmetrical.because the purpose of this interim termination requirement is to permit parties without existing interconnection agreements to enter the market expeditiously,this requirement shall not apply with respect to requesting carriers that have existing interconnection arrangements that provide for termination of local traffic by the incumbent lec.
