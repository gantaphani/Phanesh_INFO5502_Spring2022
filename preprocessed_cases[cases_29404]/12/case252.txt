this is a permissible interlocutory appeal from an order certifying a class action.plaintiffs allege violations of section b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule of the securities exchange commission.relying on the theory,the district court certified the class.we vacate the certification order and remand,persuaded that the class certified fails for wont of any showing that the market reacted to the corrective disclosure.given the lethal force of certifying a class of purchasers of securities enabled by the doctrine,we now in fairness insist that such a certification be supported by a showing of loss causation that targets the corrective disclosure appearing among other negative disclosures made at the same time.
the class included all investors who purchased the common stock of allegiance telecom between april,and february.three investors bring this suit,oscar private equity investments,its managing partner,brett messing,and his wife,marla messing.they sue royce holland,former chairman and ceo of allegiance,and anthony parella,former executive vice president for sales.allegiance telecom was named in the suit,but filed for bankruptcy and is not now a party.
allegiance was a national telecommunications provider based in dallas,texas.it sold local telephone service,long distance,broadband access,web hosting,and telecom equipment with maintenance to small and medium sized businesses.founded in,by february it was providing service in markets.at the beginning of the class period,april,there were over million common shares of allegiance stock trading on the nasdaq.institutional investors held approximately percent of allegiance stock and over fifty active market makers traded it.
plaintiffs allege that holland and parella fraudulently misrepresented allegiance count in the company first three quarterly announcements of,and that allegiance stock dropped after holland and parella ultimately restated the count in the announcement.defendants explain that the restatement occurred because allegiance installed a new billing system in and reported information from the new billing system instead of from the order management system which it replaced.defendants further argue that the restatement did not cause the stock price to drop.
the relevant announcement history is as follows.allegiance stock,like that of the rest of the telecom industry,was plunging during what is now the class period,losing nearly of its value during.on april,the first day of the class period,allegiance announced its results,including new lines installed revenues of million,an increase over positive sales force growth and improved gross margin.the following trading day allegiance stock rose,from to,but soon declined again.
on july,allegiance announced its results,including new lines installed revenues of million an earnings loss of per share,better than the analysts consensus estimate and positive results in thirteen markets.the following trading day allegiance stock rose,from to per share,but soon declined again.
on october,allegiance announced its results,including the installation of its line revenues of million and an earnings loss of per share,better than the analysts consensus estimate.the next trading day allegiance stock rose,from to per share,but remained volatile,falling to per share by february,the day before the curative statements of the announcement.
on february,allegiance announced its results,including a restatement of the total count from to,a difference of missed analysts expectations on and earnings per share greater ebitda loss than some analysts expected and a very thin margin of error for meeting revenue covenants for.the next trading day allegiance stock continued its downward move,falling,from to per share.less than days later,allegiance missed its covenants putting its credit lines in default and on may,filed for bankruptcy.
six months after allegiance bankruptcy,plaintiffs filed this class action,alleging that allegiance officers misrepresented the number of installed lines in their,and announcements.plaintiffs moved for class certification,relying on the presumption for evidence of reliance.the district court certified the class and we granted interlocutory review.
the class certification determination rests within the sound discretion of the trial court,exercised within the constraints of rule a district court that premises its legal analysis on an erroneous understanding of the governing law has abused its discretion 
this dispute turns on whether the certification order properly relied upon the theory.this theory permits a trial court to presume that each class member has satisfied the reliance element of their claim without this presumption,questions of individual reliance would predominate,and the proposed class would fail 
the supreme court in basic adopted this presumption of reliance with respect to materially misleading statements or omissions concerning companies whose shares are traded in an efficient market reliance is presumed if the plaintiffs can show that the defendant made public material misrepresentations,the defendant shares were traded in an efficient market,and the plaintiffs traded shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.
we have observed that basic allows each of the circuits room to develop its own rules.this court has used this finkel abell nathenson and to tighten the requirements for plaintiffs seeking a presumption of reliance.we now require more than proof of a material misstatement we require proof that the misstatement actually moved the market that is,the plaintiff may recover under the fraud on the market theory if he can prove that the defendant materially affected the market price of the security.essentially,we require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the presumption our most recent statement of this rule was in greenberg,which held that to trigger the presumption of reliance plaintiffs must demonstrate that the cause of the decline in price is due to the revelation of the truth and not the release of the unrelated negative information.
this requirement was not plucked from the air.basic plainly states that the presumption of reliance may be rebutted by a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and the price received or paid by the plaintiff.this would include a showing that the market price would not have been affected by the alleged misrepresentations,as in such a case the basis for finding that the fraud had been transmitted through the market price would be gone.
quoting this very language,plaintiffs argue that our requirement improperly shifts the burden,from a defendant right of rebuttal to a plaintiff burden of proof.we disagree.as a matter of practice,the defensive move is to make any showing that severs the link between the misrepresentation and the plaintiff loss to do so rebuts on arrival the plaintiff theory.in nathenson,the link was severed by publicly available information that the misrepresentation did move the stock price in greenberg,it was severed by publicly available evidence that the corrective disclosure was buried in other bad news hence,in cases like this one,we have required plaintiffs invoking the fraud on the market theory to demonstrate loss causation 
the contours of this the fraud affect the stock the gist of this appeal.it is a requirement complicated here by the fact that multiple items of positive information were released together with the alleged inflation,and further complicated by the fact that multiple items of negative information were released together with the corrective disclosure.in such inquiries,the legal standard,at least,is well established greenberg requires that plaintiffs prove that the negative truthful information causing the decrease in price is related to an allegedly false,positive statement made earlier and that it is more probable than not that it was this negative statement,and not other unrelated negative statements,that caused a significant amount of the decline.
neither party disputes greenberg relevance.instead,this appeal raises the question of whether we ought to apply greenberg requirement at the stage,as well as the subsidiary question of the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the requirement.on the first question,defendants urge that the district court must consider all evidence,both for and against loss causation,at the class certification stage.on the second question,defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiffs made a showing sufficient to establish loss causation.we agree with both contentions.
first we address the question of whether loss fraud on the market properly be addressed at the class certification stage.the district court ruled that the class certification stage is not the proper time for defendants to rebut lead plaintiffs presumption,and suggested that basic held that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable,but only as related to a summary judgment motion.plaintiffs defend the court ruling,noting that greenberg was a case and urging that proof of loss causation at this stage improperly combines the market efficiency standard with actual proof of loss causation.
there is widespread confusion on this point.as we will explain,the confusion arises from an outdated view that fails to accord this signal event of the case its due.under this earlier view,class certification was to be made as soon as practicable after the commencement of the action,mindful that the decision was tentative.it could be tailored to facts emerging in discovery,and with subclasses built around awkward difficulties of showings that cut across only part of the class first certified.in short,class certification was a light step along the way,divorced from the merits of the claim.whatever reality this treatment was responsive to,it is not that of a class exceeding purchasers of millions of shares in a volatile and market over a period,claiming injury from one of several simultaneous disclosures of negative information.
the power of the doctrine is on display here.with proof that these securities were being traded in an efficient market,the district court effectively concluded that if plaintiffs can establish at trial that defendants acted with the requisite intent in counting its installations then defendants would be liable for millions of dollars in paper losses on the day following the filing date,less the amount the defendant may be able to persuade a jury was caused by other the purchaser held on and later sold at a higher price or rode the stock down to bankruptcy.in short,the efficient market doctrine facilitates an extraordinary aggregation of claims.we can not ignore the in terrorem power of certification,continuing to abide the practice of withholding until trial a merit inquiry central to the certification decision,and failing to insist upon a greater showing of loss causation to sustain certification,at least in the instance of simultaneous disclosure of multiple pieces of negative news.nor is there sound reason for an early tentative certification,which leaves loss causation for later more focused examination.it is not the need for discovery.little discovery from defendants is demanded by the regimen.its proof is drawn from public data and public filings,as in this case.it is largely an empirical judgment that can be made then as well as later in the litigation.
these concerns have shaped the evolution of class certification and rule.rule c a no longer demands that the district court rule on class certification as soon as practicable,but instead insists only upon a ruling at an early practicable time.and although rule still recognizes that a class may be altered or amended,it no longer characterizes the class certification order as conditional,explaining,in the advisory committee notes,that a court that is not satisfied that the requirements of rule have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.these subtle changes,as well as the pslra,recognize that a district court certification order often bestows upon plaintiffs extraordinary leverage,and its bite should dictate the process that precedes it.these changes are the product of years of study by the advisory committee on civil rules,including many open hearings and symposia.this collective wisdom must not be brushed aside.that there are important due process concerns of both plaintiffs and defendants inherent in the certification decision,can not be gainsaid thus,in unger,a similar case,we held that t he plain text of rule requires the court to find,not merely assume,the facts favoring class certification.and we concluded that b ecause rule mandates a complete analysis of indicators,district courts must address and weigh factors both for and against market efficiency.this conclusion,that courts must examine factors both for and against,applies to the determination of all rule requirements.
relatedly,rule requirements must be given their full weight independent of the merits.district courts often tread too lightly on rule requirements that overlap with the merits,out of a mistaken belief that merits questions may never be addressed at the class certification stage this is a misreading of eisen,an early decision by the supreme court the eisen court stated,we find nothing in either the language or history of rule that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.as judge jon newman of the second circuit recently explained,this statement has led some courts to think that in determining whether any rule requirement is met,a judge may not consider any aspect of the merits,and has led other courts to think that a judge may not do so at least with respect to a prerequisite of rule that overlaps with an aspect of the merits of the case.
eisen did not drain rule of all rigor.a district court still must give full and independent weight to each rule requirement,regardless of whether that requirement overlaps with the merits the statement in eisen is troublesome only if read without the light of its facts.in eisen,the district court improper merits inquiry was unrelated to the rule requirements.and the same was true in our miller decision,which was relied upon by eisen,and which also held that a district court could not deny certification based on its view of the merits both eisen and miller stand for the unremarkable proposition that the strength of a plaintiff claim should not affect the certification decision.as the second circuit recently concluded,a district court must 
resolve factual disputes relevant to each rule requirement and find that whatever underlying facts are relevant to a particular rule requirement have been established t he obligation to make such determinations is not lessened by overlap between a rule requirement and a merits issue,even a merits issue that is identical with a rule requirement 
the answer to our first question,then,lies at the intersection of greenberg and unger.greenberg holds that loss causation is a prerequisite.unger mandates a complete analysis of indicators at the class certification stage,insisting that district courts find the facts favoring class certification.we hold hence that loss causation must be established at the class certification stage by a preponderance of all admissible evidence 
plaintiffs respond that the question of loss causation requires only a generalized inquiry into whether the misrepresentation moved the stock,an inquiry common to all members of the class.pressing this point at oral argument,plaintiffs urged that it was inappropriate to address loss causation at the stage because loss causation necessarily predominates,unlike individualized questions of reliance.
we might agree,if loss causation were only empirical proof of materiality,unmoored from the question of classwide reliance.yet we have explained that the refutation of loss causation more appropriately relates to the element of reliance.this is because loss causation speaks to the efficient market hypothesis on which classwide reliance depends,as we will explain.
the assumption that every material misrepresentation will move a stock in an efficient market is unfounded,at least as market efficiency is presently measured.there are two additional explanations,besides immateriality,for why a misrepresentation might fail to effect the stock price,both relevant to classwide reliance.first,it might be that even though the market for the defendant shares has been demonstrated efficient by the usual indicia the market is actually inefficient with respect to the particular type of information conveyed by the material misrepresentation,analysts and market makers do poorly at digesting information.thus our approach gives effect to inefficiencies,recognizing that the market price of a security will not be uniformly efficient as to all types of information.a second possible explanation for a misrepresentation failure to move the market is that the market was efficient with respect to that type of information,due to insider trading,the restated line count was reflected by the stock price well before the corrective disclosure.both explanations resist application of the hypothesis,the theory on which the presumption of classwide reliance depends.this court honors both theory and precedent in requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate loss causation before triggering the presumption of reliance.the trial court erred in ruling that the class certification stage is not the proper time for defendants to rebut lead plaintiffs presumption.
the legal error immediately identified,however,does not alone dictate vacatur in this case,as the trial court,out of caution perhaps,did not premise its analysis on its misunderstanding of the law.indeed,the trial court memorandum opinion applies greenberg and weighs all evidence,both for and against loss causation,in concluding that it is more likely than not that a significant part of the stock decline causing the putative class loss is attributable to the line count corrective disclosure.we vacate because this factual conclusion is untenable.the plaintiff expert report did not establish loss causation,and the district court abused its discretion in certifying the class.
as we explained above,when unrelated negative statements are announced contemporaneous of a corrective disclosure,the plaintiff must prove that it is more probable than not that it was this negative statement,and not other unrelated negative statements,that caused a significant amount of the decline.we will not attempt to quantify what fraction of a decline is significant.we note only that,under these circumstances,proof of a corrective disclosure significant contribution to a price decline demands a peek at the plaintiff damages inquiry,not speculation about materiality alone.yet plaintiffs evidence on this point consists chiefly of analyst commentary.for example,after the restatement,james ott at hibernia southcoast capital cautioned,
unfortunately,bears will have additional fodder during,as allegiance scrubbed their databases and found some differences in line count between billing and order management platforms in light of,we believe an increasingly skeptical market will have a negative view of this adjustment unfortunately,the line revision will cloud the company otherwise strong performance.
and at capital markets,an analyst groused,
the magnitude of this line count adjustment of total makes it difficult to swallow given the issues surrounding accounting today,the timing of such an adjustment could not be worse.
plaintiffs cite several other such calls the restatement a yellow flag,and another suggests that the street is completely unwilling to listen to management explanations.
defendants respond in kind,with more analyst quotes,including one from lead plaintiff brett messing,who reported in a may,column for that allegiance stocks and bonds are trading at distressed levels because of fears of a revenue covenant violation a more hostile regulatory environment,and customer churn.notably messing did not mention the restatement and named allegiance management team the industry best.similarly,danny zito at lehman brothers was concerned not with the adjustment,which he opined was troubling only because it raised concerns with allegiance back office operations,but with allegiance potential revenue covenant violation risk.finally,james ott at hibernia,the same analyst quoted extensively by the plaintiffs,also reported that n o material change ha d occurred fundamentally in algx business,and explained that the vast majority of the revisions were definitional rather than functional.
the plaintiffs have the better of this exchange,but nonetheless,their evidence is little more than speculation.to prove loss causation,and thereby trigger the presumption of reliance,plaintiffs must do better.the plaintiffs expert does detail event studies supporting a finding that allegiance stock reacted to the entire bundle of negative information contained in the announcement,but this reaction suggests only market efficiency,not loss causation,for there is no evidence linking the culpable disclosure to the movement.when multiple negative items are announced contemporaneously,mere proximity between the announcement and the stock loss is insufficient to establish loss causation.
plaintiff expert,in her rebuttal,disagrees,but offers as evidence only the raw opinion of analysts,without supporting study of the market at as now common use of basic principles of econometrics.the expert own concluding paragraph advised that her work was incomplete it is possible with further analyses to quantify the portion of the decline caused by the restated line count.however,counsel has advised me that the quantification of damages is not appropriate at this stage of the litigation.so this is less of a dispute over what showing must be made,and more a dispute over when.
something like the expert further analyses is what is missing.while counsel is correct that quantification of damages is presently proof that some percentage of the drop was attributable to the corrective plaintiffs must,in order to establish loss causation at this stage,offer some showing that the corrective disclosure was more than just present at the scene and this burden can not be discharged by opinion bereft of the analysis plaintiff own expert conceded was necessary,albeit in her counsel view at a later stage.the class certification decision bears concerns for both plaintiffs and defendants and an empirical inquiry into loss causation better addresses these concerns than an impenetrable finding akin to a reasonable man assessment.and analyst speculation about materiality,while better informed than a layman,more closely resembles the latter.at least when multiple negative items are contemporaneously announced,we are unwilling to infer loss causation without more.in sum,only a medical doctor who has either conducted a or reviewed the work of another who did so,may credibly opine about the cause of death.we do not insist upon event studies to establish loss causation,helpful though they may be.we hold only that the opinions of these analysts,without reference to any data they have reviewed or conducted,is insufficient here.
because plaintiffs have failed to trigger the presumption of reliance provided by the theory,the class fails and we must vacate the order of certification.
we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent.
in this appeal from the district court order granting class action certification,the majority departs drastically from the supreme court decision in basic,levinson,d,which held that securities class action plaintiffs are entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reliance,or transaction causation,if the plaintiffs traded in the stock at issue during the proposed class period in reliance on the integrity of the price set by an open and efficient market.the majority instead holds that plaintiffs are entitled to basic presumption of reliance only if they also prove loss causation,that is,if they prove by a preponderance of all admissible evidence that the defendants alleged misrepresentations were the proximate cause of the plaintiffs economic loss.the majority decision is,in effect,a breathtaking revision of securities class action procedure that eviscerates basic presumption,creates a split from other circuits by requiring on the merits of cases at the class certification stage,and effectively overrules legitimately binding circuit precedents.
i also respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in certifying this class action.the majority found that the plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to establish that the decline in allegiance share price was related to allegiance disclosure that it had overstated its line count figures,but the majority conducted what appears to have been a de novo,rather an abuse of discretion,review of the evidence in order to make that determination.in my opinion,the district court did not abuse its discretion in making the factual findings necessary to its certification of the case.
the majority opinion relies heavily on this court earlier decision in greenberg crossroads systems,cir,which,the majority urges,establishes that we require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the presumption.supra at see also supra at.as i discuss in greater detail below,greenberg says no such thing.neither greenberg nor any other decision of this court holds that proof of loss causation is part of the presumption.the majority holding to the contrary amounts to a profound modification of greenberg.see infra part ii.
moreover,by its decision today the majority aggravates the already serious and unwarranted departure that greenberg made from both basicand prior circuit precedent in basic,the supreme court held that securities plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of a section b claim through the theory.see basic,at.the theory essentially permits plaintiffs to establish the element of reliance by showing that the market for the securities in question was efficient and that they traded in reliance on the integrity of the market price for the securities.see id.at.the fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.quoting peil speiser,cir id.at.w here materially misleading statements have been disseminated into an impersonal,market for securities,the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed.
the basic court also held that the presumption is rebuttable,but it made it plain that the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the presumption should not apply 
a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff,or his decision to trade at a fair market price,will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.for example,if defendants could show that the market makers were privy to the truth about the merger discussions here with combustion,and thus that the market price would not have been affected by their misrepresentations,the causal connection could be broken the basis for finding that the fraud had been transmitted through market price would be gone.
id.at emphasis added.
up until our decision in greenberg in,this court consistently recognized basic holding that the defendant has the burden of rebutting the presumption.see nathenson zonagen,cir fine am.solar king,cir see also lehocky tidel.two years after basic,this court held that there are three ways in which a defendant can rebut the presumption by showing that the nondisclosures did not affect the market price,or that the plaintiffs would have purchased the stock at the same price had they known the information that was not disclosed or that the plaintiffs actually knew the information that was not disclosed to the market.fine,at.
the greenberg panel itself began by correctly describing basic presumption of reliance in favor of the plaintiff and recognizing that basic places the burden of rebutting the presumption on the defendant see greenberg,at.later in its opinion,however,the greenberg panel erroneously concluded,contrary to both basic and this court prior decisions that securities plaintiffs can not invoke the presumption unless they first affirmatively show that the market price of the stock actually moved in response to either the defendants alleged misrepresentation or a corrective disclosure.see greenberg,at noting that plaintiffs must show actual movement of the stock price in order to trigger the presumption.thus,instead of recognizing,in accord with basic,that the plaintiffs were entitled to a presumption of reliance by virtue of simply trading in an efficient market,greenberg placed on the plaintiffs the additional burden of showing that the misrepresentation or the corrective disclosure moved the market price.
the conflict between basic and greenberg is inescapable.under basic,the court is to presume that the defendant material misstatement distorted the market price of the stock at issue.see basic,at.because most publicly available information is reflected in market price,an investor reliance on any public material misrepresentations,therefore,may be presumed for purposes of a rule action.nathenson,at t here is generally a presumption that potentially significant publicly disseminated information is reflected in the price of stock traded on an efficient market.greenberg,however,subverts the presumption by requiring the plaintiffs to prove,as a precondition to the application of the presumption,the very facts that are to be presumed under basic,that the defendant material misrepresentation was reflected in the stock price.as a result,greenberg effectively relieves the defendant of its burden under basic to rebut the presumption.see regents of the of,dennis,concurring in the judgment.
confronted with the argument that greenberg improperly shifts the basic burden,changing it from a defendant right of rebuttal to a plaintiff burden of proof,the majority makes a meager effort to claim that both greenberg and today decision are somehow compatible with basic command that it falls to the defendant to rebut the presumption of reliance.the majority attempts to recharacterize the basic presumption as a sort of bursting bubble presumption,one that disappears if anything to the contrary is placed before the court.united states zavala,cir black law dictionary ed defining the bursting bubble theory as t he principle that a presumption disappears once the presumed facts have been contradicted by credible evidence.the majority posits that a s a matter of practice,the defensive move is to make any showing that severs the link between the misrepresentation and the plaintiff loss to do so rebuts on arrival the plaintiff theory.supra at.although the majority conspicuously neglects to explain what type of evidence a defendant would have to produce to meet its standard,the clear implication is that,in the majority view,the basic presumption evaporates as soon as a defendant simply introduces a mere possibility the defendant material misrepresentation might not have affected the market price.
the majority can not outflank basic so easily,however.as noted above,basic expressly states that the defendants can rebut the presumption only if they could show that the market price would not have been affected by their misrepresentations.basic,at.emphasis added.basic thus clearly places the burdens of both producing evidence and persuasion on the defendant and requires an actual showing that the defendant misrepresentation did not,or could not have,affected the market price of the stock.fine,at the presumption of reliance can be rebutted by showing that the nondisclosures did not affect the market price see also abell potomac ins,cir stating that basic shift s the burden of persuasion,as to reliance,onto securities fraud defendants,vacated on other grounds sub,fryar abell,d.under no reasonable reading can that standard be met,as the majority suggests,by simply asserting that a particular change in the market price could have been related to something other than the defendant misrepresentations.
for the reasons stated above,i continue to believe that greenberg conflicts with binding precedents of both the supreme court and this court,and i do not therefore regard that case as binding or persuasive on the point at issue.see modica taylor,cir when panel opinions appear to conflict,we are bound to follow the earlier opinion.quoting tire,pitney bowes,cir.consequently,the majority was not bound to repeat the greenberg panel error.instead,it should have adhered to basic and this court jurisprudence,rather than repeating i discuss greenberg flaws.
even setting aside the preceding discussion of greenberg conflict with basic,greenberg simply does not stand for the principle the majority purports to draw from it,that we require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the presumption.supra at.
in greenberg,the court stated that in order to merit a presumption of reliance under the theory,
a causal relationship between the statement and actual movement of the stock price is still required it is this actual movement of stock price which must be shown by plaintiffs 
greenberg,at the greenberg panel later explained how plaintiffs could satisfy this requirement of showing actual price movement 
the main concern when determining whether a plaintiff is entitled to the presumption of reliance is the causal connection between the allegedly false statement and its effect on a company stock price.nathenson makes it clear that to establish this nexus the plaintiffs must be able to show that the stock price was actually affected.this is ordinarily shown by an increase in stock price immediately following the release of positive information.we read nathenson to also allow plaintiffs to make this showing by reference to actual negative movement in stock price following the release of the alleged truth of the earlier misrepresentation.
greenberg,at.assuming for the sake of argument that greenberg is correct,then,a plaintiff could satisfy greenberg in the typical securities fraud case involving allegations that the defendant misrepresentations artificially inflated the issuer stock price by showing that the market price of the stock moved either upward at the time of the defendant alleged misrepresentation or downward at the time that the truth was disclosed.
the majority,however,disregards the part of greenberg that states that the actual price movement component of its version of the theory can be satisfied by showing an increase in the stock price on the heels of the misrepresentation.instead,the majority erroneously reads greenberg to require the plaintiffs to establish the conceptually distinct element of loss causation,proximate cause of economic loss,by showing that the stock price declined in response to a corrective disclosure,to trigger the presumption.the majority rule finds no support in greenberg.this new rule directly conflicts with the language from greenberg,and nothing in greenberg so much as suggests that the showing it requires as a condition to a presumption of reliance somehow includes proof of the distinct element of loss causation.
accordingly,because the rule that the majority purports to derive from greenberg has no basis in that case,i could not join the majority opinion even were i not convinced that greenberg conflicts with basic and this circuit precedent 
whatever the merits of the majority belief that private securities class action procedure is in need of drastic change and revision,today reform is,in my opinion,and can not be justified under current law.
under the majority approach,basic fraud on the market presumption is essentially a dead letter,little more than a quaint reminder of earlier times,and its primary holding is supplanted by extensions of the policy considerations that the majority sees reflected in the enactment of the pslra and in recent amendments to rule neither of which actually purports to alter basic or to speak directly to the issue in this case.such policy considerations,however,no matter how sincerely interpreted or applied,do not give this court the authority to overrule the supreme court decisions or to change the recognized elements of a section b claim,both of which the majority effectively does today.see unger amedisys,cir i t is the supreme court job to overrule basic,in the absence of outright conflict with the private securities litigation reform act.
the majority states that its approach is unaffected by the supreme court recent and very narrow decision in dura pharms,broudo,d.see supra at.although dura was indeed a narrow decision,it nevertheless undercuts the majority position in several respects.the dura court reaffirmed basic,repeatedly citing it with approval,and it expressly recognized that reliance and loss causation are separate and distinct elements of the section b cause of action and that basic presumption relates only to the former.see dura,at.
the majority approach simply disregards this distinction and takes the novel step of making proof of loss causation a prerequisite to the establishment of reliance through the presumption for purposes of certification.as neither basic nor any authority supports the majority decision to conflate these two elements,i can not subscribe to the majority unwarranted realignment of securities class action procedure.
because,as the above sections demonstrate,plaintiffs are not required to prove loss causation as part of the presumption and because defendants make no other plausible arguments for why plaintiffs should be required to prove loss causation at the class certification stage,the majority decision dramatically expands the scope of class certification review in this circuit to effectively require a on the merits of plaintiffs claims at the certification stage.in so doing,the decision contradicts both this circuit rule case law and the decisions of other circuits concerning the scope of the class certification inquiry.
before certifying a class action,the district court must ensure that the proposed class satisfies all of the requirements of rule.see,unger,at t he supreme court requires district courts to conduct a rigorous analysis of rule prerequisites.we must be ever mindful,however,that class certification hearings should not be on the merits of the class or individual claims.id.at citing eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.a court must conduct an intense factual investigation,robinson texas automobile dealers association,cir,yes,and in doing so the district court must often go beyond the pleadings and understand the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.castano am.tobacco,cir.the district court can not,however,go beyond those issues necessary to decide whether the requirements of rule are satisfied and rule on merits issues that are unrelated to rule.see in re initial pub.offering sec,cir a district judge should not assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a rule requirement.emphasis added see also szabo bridgeport,cir a court may not say something like let resolve the merits first and worry about the class later or i not going to certify a class unless i think that the plaintiffs will prevail.
like the district court,we must restrict our review of the merits to encompass only those issues necessary to determining whether the proposed class satisfies the requirements of rule.see bell ascendant solutions,cir stating that rule f permits a party to appeal only the issue of class certification no other issues may be raised quoting bertulli indep.ass of cont l pilots,cir.
proof of loss causation is not related to the rule inquiry through the presumption,and it will not,in the ordinary case,be otherwise relevant to the district court rule inquiry the majority decision to require proof of loss causation at class certification in securities class actions therefore represents a drastic departure from this circuit settled limitations,laid out in unger and bell,on the scope of the class certification inquiry.furthermore,
