this appeal arises from litigation centering on defendant alleged practice of failing to disclose discounted wireless telephone rates for customers with impaired hearing.a demurrer without leave to amend was sustained by the trial court on the ground it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cause.we agree the threshold jurisdictional question is dispositive and affirm.
the controlling issue may be framed as follows.in a suit under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et based on the public utilities commission puc authority to regulate disclosures by wireless telecommunications providers to consumers regarding services and rates,how far must the commission have proceeded to exercise its regulatory powers over the subject matter of the lawsuit before jurisdiction to award relief is preempted by section of the public utilities code,plaintiffs tell us that lower courts lack jurisdiction to hear cases such as this one only where the effect of the litigation would actually interfere with an existing puc policy.and,plaintiffs argue,because the commission has not yet proceeded to exercise its regulatory authority over service disclosures to consumers by wireless telecommunications providers,the superior court had jurisdiction to determine their claims for relief under section and the ucl.
defendant,on the other hand,argues the preemptive force of section is broader,extending to circumstances in which the exercise of jurisdiction under section would hinder,frustrate or obstruct an ongoing commission inquiry aimed at formulating policies underlying the subject matter of this lawsuit.because the commission is currently pursuing rulemaking proceedings into the scope and content of disclosures to consumers by cellular telecommunications providers,defendant contends,our that of the superior court before preempted by section.
applying an intelligible standard derived from case law that has been uniform over the past years,we conclude defendant has the better of the argument.we therefore affirm the order of the trial court sustaining the demurrer to the amended complaint without leave to amend.
background 
we draw the facts from the amended complaint.plaintiffs are george eckert and larry card.eckert hearing is permanently and substantially impaired card sells and services hearing aids to customers who need them,doing business as american hearing aid center.the two filed an amended complaint for monetary and related class action and equitable relief against defendant and others in january.defendant is a general partnership composed of cellular telecommunications firms,with its principal place of business in south san francisco it does business under the name cellular one.
the amended complaint alleged that since,defendant has offered to its customers with permanently impaired hearing a rate for cellular telephone services that is significantly below the prevailing commercial rate available to those customers without such impairments.plaintiffs allege that defendant has failed to distribute notice of its reduced rate called to those who,like eckert,are in need of it.moreover,the amended complaint alleged,as a condition of participation in its plan,defendant has imposed requirements that exceed those established by its tariffs filed with the commission in the exercise of its regulatory authority over wireless telecommunications the program requires applicants to have a physician certification that their hearing impairment is such that it can not be corrected by use of a hearing aid.this requirement,the complaint alleged,is wrongful within the ucl because it violates a predicate enactment,section,requiring disclosure of service terms to consumers see,bus,barquis merchants collection cal d.
preemption of subject matter jurisdiction under section.prior authorities.
in san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,covalt,our supreme court considered whether a claim for damages and related relief brought against a southern california public utility by homeowners,stemming from fears that nearby electrical high transmission lines exposed them to the threat of cancer,was preempted by section.the utility had set up that statute as a jurisdictional defense,arguing that the suit was barred by the puc statutory jurisdiction to regulate electrical powerlines.the trial court overruled a demurrer to the complaint,but the court of appeal reversed.granting review,the supreme court affirmed the appellate ruling ordering the demurrer sustained without leave to amend.cal th at,d.in a pellucid statement of the governing rule,the covalt court built on its prior decision in waters pacific telephone cal d.under the waters rule the court wrote,an action for damages against a public utility pursuant to section is barred by section not only when an award of damages would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,when it would reverse,correct,or annul that order or decision,but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission,when it would hinder or frustrate or interfere with or obstruct that policy.covalt,supra,cal th at,d.
in a footnote,the supreme court said o ther courts have used other synonyms to express the same idea the puc has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation and control of utilities,and once it has assumed jurisdiction,it can not be hampered,interfered with,or by a concurrent superior court action addressing the same issue.barnett delta lines,d.still other synonyms could be invoked,impair,impede,inhibit,or encumber.the point is clear.covalt,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics omitted.the point is clear.and it can be stated as a rule a superior court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for private damages relief against a public utility when factual or legal determinations likely to be required therein would conflict with or undermine ongoing commission efforts to formulate policies within its jurisdiction.following the supreme court practice in covalt,supra,cal th at pages,d,a review of recent court of appeal precedent illustrates how the rule of subject matter preemption under section applies in concrete cases.
the opinion in cellular plus,superior court th,d,is an instructive example of circumstances under which judicial jurisdiction is not ousted by section.there,plaintiffs alleged price fixing claims against two cellular telephone service companies,asserting an unlawful antitrust conspiracy in violation of the cartwright act bus,et see th at,d.in sustaining defendants demurrer to the complaint,the trial court ruled the utilities were immune from cartwright act liability because of the puc exclusive jurisdiction over utility ratemaking.relying on the jurisdictional formulation in waters,supra,cal d,the court of appeal reversed.we can not conceive,it wrote,how a price fixing claim under the cartwright act could hinder or frustrate the puc supervisory or regulatory policies.the only apparent policy of the puc that could be affected is its regulation of rates charged by cellular telephone service providers.however plaintiff does not dispute that the puc has jurisdiction over rates,nor does it seek any relief requiring the puc to change any rates it has approved.plaintiff is merely seeking treble damages and injunctive relief for alleged price fixing under the cartwright act.cellular plus,superior court,supra,th at,d.
again,in stepak american.d,plaintiffs were minority shareholders of a public utility that had merged with another utility.alleging the merger was unfair to them,plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction halting the merger.the utilities moved to dismiss,asserting the commission not only had exclusive jurisdiction to approve the merger,but in administrative proceedings had determined that it was fair to minority shareholders.reversing a trial court order dismissing the suit on jurisdictional grounds,the court of appeal relied,in this decision,on waters,supra,cal d,our case is distinguishable from waters and other cases where the subject of the superior court action is addressed by commission regulation.citations.we are aware
