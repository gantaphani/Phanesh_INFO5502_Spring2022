tatel,circuit judge 
in an effort to speed implementation of enhanced services for wireless phones,the federal communications commission removed a provision conditioning wireless carriers obligation to purchase and install the necessary technology on guaranteed state or local government funding.the carriers challenge this decision,arguing that,among other things,it contravenes the cost causation principle adopted by this court in competitive telecommunications association fcc,comptel,is arbitrary and capricious,a,violates the regulatory flexibility act,and amounts to an unconstitutional taking.finding petitioners arguments either without merit or not properly before us,we deny the petition for review in its entirety.
over the last thirty years,service has spread across the nation and become synonymous with emergency assistance.in re revision of the comm s rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced emergency calling,fcc rcd first report order.at its most basic,service involves routing calls to state or local governmental entities responsible for coordinating emergency response,known as public safety answering points psaps,which dispatch emergency assistance to callers.most psaps now provide for calls placed from traditional landline phones,using automatic numbering identification ani to determine a caller phone number and automatic location identification ali to pinpoint a caller location.for landline calls,ali information is typically determined by looking up the caller phone number in an number database.
although wireless callers place a large number of calls,implementing services for wireless phones has proven more difficult.in june,a group of public safety organizations including the association of communications officials apco,intervenor here issued an emergency access position paper highlighting the need to make services available to wireless callers to facilitate rapid and effective contact with emergency services,when and where needed.shortly thereafter,the commission issued a notice of rulemaking to ensure that,over time,wireless callers would have the same level of access to emergency services as landline callers,and proposed requiring wireless carriers to make both ani and ali information available to psaps.in re revision of the comm s rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced emergency calling,fcc rcd.
after the comment period ended,apco and two other public safety bodies,together with the cellular telecommunications industry association ctia,a trade association of wireless industry participants,filed with the commission a consensus agreement addressing wireless implementation.among other things,the agreement proposed a cost recovery mechanism to fund carrier and psap investment in technology,asking the commission to condition the obligation to make these investments on a guarantee of state or local government funding.the commission also sought public comment on this consensus agreement.
after receiving comments on its proposal and the consensus agreement,the commission adopted its first report order,which established a plan for wireless implementation.phase i,to have been completed in eighteen months,required wireless carriers to enable psaps to determine a caller ani and the location of the base station or cell site receiving the call.first report order,fcc rcd at.wireless carriers had five years to complete phase ii,which required them to enable psaps to identify a caller ali within a specified range.id.wireless carriers can implement phase ii in at least two ways.one is,determining a caller location by triangulating signals from several different cell sites or base stations.in re revision of the comm s rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced emergency calling,fcc rcd third report order.the other is it incorporates locating functionality such as global positioning system technology into the telephone itself.id.at.
under the commission order,carriers phase i and phase ii obligations would not be triggered until two conditions were met the carrier had to receive a request for these services from a psap capable of receiving and utilizing the data and,responding to the consensus agreement cost recovery provision,a mechanism for the recovery of costs relating to the provision of such services had to be in place.first report order,fcc rcd at.the commission prescribed no particular cost recovery mechanism,however,because n o party dispute d the fundamental notion that carriers must be able to recover their costs of providing services and because an inflexible federal prescription would deny carriers and government officials the freedom to develop innovative cost recovery solutions.id.at.
the commission also responded to comments by rural wireless carriers that providing ali in rural areas may not be technologically and economically feasible,id.at,and that carrier cost recovery mechanisms might not fully reimburse these higher implementation costs.according to the rural carriers,a method of providing ali would be difficult because,given the configuration of many rural providers towers as a string of pearls along a highway,triangulation would require a large number of additional towers and equipment.petitioners opening br.at third report order,fcc rcd at.they also claimed they had no alternative,because the solution was not yet technologically available.the commission concluded that these problems need not delay adoption of the general rule because i n cases where the cost recovery mechanism for service uniquely disadvantages a particular carrier,we will consider waiver requests.first report order,fcc rcd at.
reconsidering the first report order,the commission reaffirmed its decision not to prescribe a particular cost recovery mechanism.in re revision of the comm s rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced emergency calling,fcc rcd.ctia filed for a second reconsideration,asking the commission to clarify that state and local governments could not satisfy the carrier cost recovery requirement by asking carriers to recover their own costs directly through charges to wireless customers,and to mandate that the cost recovery mechanisms states and localities adopt be competitively neutral.in response,and after receiving a joint status report filed by the consensus agreement parties joined by the wireless consumers alliance,revealing that phase i implementation was proceeding more slowly than planned,the commission issued a public notice seeking information on whether the carrier cost recovery requirement was responsible for the delay,and if so,how to address this problem.public notice,comm seeks to facilitate wireless implementation and requests a report,fcc rcd.petitioners united states cellular association us cellular and the rural cellular association rca submitted comments.
in the resulting second reconsideration order,the commission found that the prerequisite that there be a carrier cost recovery mechanism has not expedited the delivery of service and,if anything,has become and will continue to be an impediment of service.in re revision of the comm s rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced emergency calling,fcc rcd second recons.order.although states had enacted some sort of phase i cost recovery legislation,id.at,these services were scarce,and,in most parts of the country,nonexistent,id.at.states had no phase i cost recovery mechanism in place,and even in the states that had enacted legislation,the commission found that disputes about the adequacy and administration of cost recovery interfered with phase i implementation.id.at.the commission further agreed with apco that,because few state and local governments had enacted phase ii legislation,and because the costs of doing so would likely exceed phase i costs,carrier cost recovery threatened to become an even greater obstacle to phase ii implementation.id.at.
to alleviate these delays,the commission dropped the carrier cost recovery requirement,noting that wireless carriers are not subject to rate regulation,and may adjust their rates to reflect the cost of providing services without commission intervention.id.at.according to the commission,passing costs on to consumers is the normal way that costs of doing business,including the costs of complying with requirements,are recovered in an industry free of rate regulation.id.at.
addressing comments that eliminating the carrier cost recovery requirement would unfairly discriminate against rural carriers,the commission concluded that the record contained insufficient evidence to support the claim that rural carriers implementation costs are higher,and that,even if they are,it is not clear that such costs should be pooled for recovery in this competitive,deregulated industry.id.at.
petitioners rca and corr wireless communications corr sought further reconsideration of the second reconsideration order,contending that the commission had improperly disregarded rural carriers concerns about cost recovery.corr,a rural carrier,submitted detailed information on its phase ii implementation costs.the reconsideration petitions also argued that the commission action violates universal service requirements under and amounts to an unconstitutional taking in violation of the fifth amendment.although petitioners had not made these claims in the proceedings leading to the second reconsideration order in fact,corr had not even participated in those proceedings,corr argued that its failure was excusable because the commission had not given adequate notice of the possibility that it would abandon the carrier cost recovery requirement.disagreeing,and finding that commenters had presented no new or persuasive evidence to justify reopening the proceedings,the commission denied reconsideration.in re revision of the comm s rules to ensure compatibility with enhanced emergency calling,fcc rcd fifth memorandum order.
rca and corr have now filed a petition for review of the commission decision to deny reconsideration of the second reconsideration order.all three petitioners also challenge the second reconsideration order itself,arguing that the commission decision to eliminate the carrier cost recovery requirement violates this circuit cost causation principle.see comptel,at.they also argue that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the administrative procedure act and violated both the regulatory flexibility act and the takings clause of the fifth amendment.
we begin with petitioners contention that eliminating the carrier cost recovery requirement runs afoul of this circuit cost causation principle.in comptel,we held that when the commission sets rates,it must specifically justify any rate differential that does not reflect cost.at.in that case,the commission had established a rate structure that essentially required large long distance carriers to subsidize smaller ones.concluding that the attempt to recover costs from long distance carriers that did not cause those costs to be incurred would impart the wrong incentives,id.at,we vacated the commission order.comptel based its cost causation principle on both apa section a,which makes unlawful arbitrary and capricious agency actions,a,and versions of communications act sections and,which presently provide that charges for and in connection with a communication service,shall be just and reasonable,b,and that i t shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges for or in connection with a communication service,id.a.see comptel,at.petitioners here argue that neither they nor their customers caused the costs,and therefore that comptel prohibits the commission from requiring them to pay for the cost of implementation.
the commission argues that petitioners may not rely on the cost causation principle because they failed to raise communications act sections and in the proceedings before the agency.see a bartholdi cable fcc,interpreting section a as requiring that the commission be afforded an opportunity to pass on an issue as a condition of judicial review.alternatively,the commission argues,even if the cost causation principle were properly raised,it applies only when the commission is setting rates.petitioners concede their failure to cite communications act sections and in the proceedings before the commission,but claim that they have not waived reliance on these sections because the issue was necessarily implicated by the argument made to the commission.time warner entm t fcc.additionally,they argue that because the cost causation principle also rests on the apa prohibition against arbitrary and capricious agency action,it applies whether or not the commission is setting rates.we need not resolve these disputes,however,because even if the cost causation principle applies outside industries and is properly before us,petitioners argument fails.
petitioners claim that the cost causer for wireless is clearly the psap capabilities are not necessary to provide wireless service.rather,carriers are forced to install these capabilities at the instigation of and for the use of the psaps in their provision of emergency services.petitioners opening br.at.compelling carriers rather than psaps to bear financial responsibility for wireless implementation by passing some or all of the costs on to their customers,petitioners claim,violates the cost causation principle.we disagree.
for one thing,psaps are not the cost causers for wireless implementation.as the commission points out 
wireless services are provided for the benefit of all subscribers,to enable them to call and receive prompt attention from public safety agencies it is entirely rational for subscribers to wireless services to pay through their charges for the costs the commission has required the carriers to incur to upgrade their systems to include services.subscribers,after all,are the ultimate beneficiaries when calls go through and public safety agencies respond.
respondent br.at.
petitioners argument to the contrary rests on a profound misunderstanding of psaps and their public safety function.petitioners seem to think that psaps are private commercial ambulance makers,to use petitioners own services to the public.if this were true,petitioners might have a point.but psaps are governmental entities playing a critical role in the provision of public safety services in larger urban areas,they are organizations in smaller rural areas,they may be local law enforcement offices.psaps themselves derive no benefit from wireless services rather,they provide safety services to benefit the public.under the commission order,it is the beneficiaries of these services who ultimately pay most if not all of the cost of wireless implementation.
petitioners argue that wireless customers have not directly requested carriers to provide them with services.this is certainly true,but the commission,as their governmental representative,has made this request on their behalf.thus,in a sense,the commission itself is the cost is the commission order that requires wireless carriers to provide services in the public interest.whether the commission or the wireless customer is the cost causer,we need not decide.what important is that on no plausible theory are psaps the cost causers their only role is providing service.true,a psap request is a precondition of a wireless carrier obligation to implement technology,first report order,fcc rcd at,but the obligation itself results from the commission order,and the beneficiary of that obligation is the public.
the public nature of wireless services distinguishes this case from comptel.there,the commission had required some private businesses large carriers to subsidize others smaller carriers.this produced competitive distortion in the private market,insulating some inefficient smaller firms from the pressures of the marketplace.comptel,at.in this case,by contrast,eliminating the carrier cost recovery requirement produces no such inefficiencies it merely imposes the cost of service on its beneficiaries.
disagreeing,petitioners claim that eliminating the carrier cost recovery requirement will lead to inefficient economic behavior,because the government is not required to internalize the costs of building capabilities.petitioners opening br.at.petitioners apparently think that,if governmental ent
