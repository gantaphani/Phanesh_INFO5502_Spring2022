sprint communication company lp and its affiliates collectively,sprint appeal from a final decision of the united states district court for the district of delaware finding that the asserted claims of patent and collectively,the asserted patents are invalid as indefinite under.because processing system does not prevent the claims,read in light of the specification and the prosecution history,from informing those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty,we reverse.
background 
the asserted patents relate to developments in technology.allows telephone calls to be transmitted over the internet,instead of through traditional telephone lines.has the ability to work with traditional telephone lines,however,such that calls initiated on a traditional telephone can be converted to packets of information and transmitted over the internet.at the receiving end,they are converted back to a traditional voice signal.
the asserted patents discuss the between traditional telephone lines a network or network and a data network a broadband network or network,such as the internet.they can be divided into two groups patent patent patent patent and patent collectively,the control patents share a specification,and patent patent and patent collectively,the atm interworking patents share a different specification.
both sets of patents describe the use of a processing system,which receives a signal from a traditional telephone network and processes information related to that voice call to select the path that the voice call should take through the data network.in the control patents,a communications control processor ccp selects the network elements and the connections that comprise the communications path,patent ll.in the atm interworking patents,a signaling processor or,in preferred embodiments,a manager ccm selects the virtual connections by which the call will pass through the atm network and performs other call processing functions,such as validation,echo control,and billing.patent ll,ll,ll.both specifications disclose that logic for selecting a communication path resides in,which the ccp or ccm relies on in making selection s,patent ll,patent ll.
at issue in this appeal is the definiteness of processing system as it is used in the context of the patents.among the control patents,the independent claims at issue are claim of the patent,claim of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claim of the patent.claim of the,patent is exemplary 
a method of operating a processing system to control a packet communication system for a user communication,the method comprising 
receiving a signaling message for the user communication from a narrowband communication system into the processing system 
processing the signaling message to select a network code that identifies a network element to provide egress from the packet communication system for the user communication 
generating a control message indicating the network code 
transferring the control message from the processing system to the packet communication system 
receiving the user communication in the packet communication system and using the network code to route the user communication through the packet communication system to the network element and 
transferring the user communication from the network element to provide egress from the packet communication system.

among the atm interworking patents,claim of the patent and claim of the patent are the independent claims at issue.claim of the patent is exemplary 
a communication method for a call comprising 
receiving signaling associated with the call into a processing system 
processing the signaling in the processing system to select a connection 
generating a message identifying the connection 
transmitting the message from the processing system 
receiving the message and an asynchronous communication associated with the call into an interworking unit 
in the interworking unit,converting the asynchronous communication into a user communication and 
transferring the user communication from the interworking unit to the connection in response to the message.

procedural history 
this case rests against the backdrop of litigation between these parties and others.on december,sprint sued cox communications,and cox communications kansas,llc in the district of kansas,asserting infringement of twelve patents,which included the six patents at issue here.that same day,sprint also filed suit against comcast cable communications,comcast,cable one,cable one,and time warner cable time warner cable in the district of kansas asserting the same twelve patents.
on april,cox communications,cox communications kansas,llc,and thirty of their affiliates collectively,cox initiated the instant case,filing a complaint in the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that sprint twelve patents were invalid and not infringed.cox filed a motion to transfer the kansas action to delaware,which was granted on september.sprint consequently counterclaimed for infringement of the twelve patents and several others.
sprint actions against comcast,cable one,and time warner cable remained in the district of kansas and were consolidated for discovery purposes.these cases proceeded to claim construction,where on october,the district court decided,among other things,that the term processing system was not indefinite,but did not warrant a construction.
approximately four months later,on february,cox moved for partial summary judgment in the instant case on the grounds that the claim term processing system rendered the asserted patents indefinite under.on may,the district court granted cox motion,finding that the claims were indefinite because they contain a structural limitation,processing system,which is functionally described by the claims and in the specifications and these descriptions do not pass muster under nautilus as a person of ordinary skill in the art is not provided with the bounds of the claimed invention.the district court also found that extrinsic evidence did not save the claims,because there is no established meaning in the art for processing system,because other patents use this term in different ways and because the parties did not provide nor could the district court discern,looking at computer dictionaries a definition for processing system.

discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment that a claim is indefinite de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.ethicon endo surgery,surgical,fed.cir.the ultimate conclusion that a claim is indefinite under,is a legal conclusion,which we review de novo.eidos display,llc au optronics,fed.cir.as in claim construction,we review a district court underlying factual determinations for clear error.see teva pharm.usa,sandoz,d.any fact critical to a holding on indefiniteness must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing evidence.intel via,fed.cir.if indefiniteness can be determined based solely on intrinsic evidence,our review is de novo.see teva pharm.usa.at.
at the outset,we note that the parties have agreed that processing system is not a term.accordingly,we confine our review to the same question presented to the district court whether processing system renders the asserted patents indefinite under.
section requires that t he specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.this provision strikes a delicate balance which recognizes that,although the definiteness requirement must tolerate s ome modicum of uncertainty as the price of ensuring the appropriate incentives for innovation,nautilus,biosig instruments,d quoting festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d internal quotation marks omitted,a patent must nevertheless be precise enough to afford clear notice of what is claimed,thereby apprising the public of what is still open to them.id.quoting markman westview instruments,d internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims,read in light of the specification delineating the patent,and the prosecution history,fail to inform,with reasonable certainty,those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.id.at.
this case presents a peculiar scenario the sole source of indefiniteness that cox complains of,processing system,plays no discernable role in defining the scope of the claims.all of the asserted claims are method claims,and the point of novelty resides with the steps of these methods,not with the machine that performs them.processing system is merely the locus at which the steps are being performed.the plain language of the claims proves this point if claim of the patent which the parties agree is exemplary for the control patents were revised to remove the word processing system,the meaning would not discernably change 
this modification removes the clarification that the processing system is what performs the processing and receives and sends certain signals,but even without this clarification,the same steps would have to be performed.and,from the nature of the invention,they would have to be performed on some kind of computing device.the same is true of claim of the patent which the parties agree is exemplary for the atm interworking patents 
if processing system were not omitted but replaced with computer,a similar conclusion results.indeed,at oral argument,both parties agreed that substituting computer for processing system would not change the scope of the claims.oral argument at,available at hereinafter oral argument see also oral argument at,acknowledging that processing system is a general purpose computer.
if processing system does not discernably alter the scope of the claims,it is difficult to see how this term would prevent the claims the remainder of which cox does not challenge on indefiniteness grounds from serving their notice function under.as nautilus instructs,the dispositive question in an indefiniteness inquiry is whether the claims,not particular claim terms,read in light of the specification delineating the patent,and the prosecution history,fail to inform,with reasonable certainty,those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.at.to be sure,we have generally acknowledged that an indefiniteness analysis under,is inextricably intertwined with claim construction.atmel info.storage devices,fed.cir.accordingly,the common practice of training questions of indefiniteness on individual claim terms is a helpful tool.indeed,if a person of ordinary skill in the art can not discern the scope of a claim with reasonable certainty,it may be because one or several claim terms can not be reliably construed.see,interval licensing llc aol,fed.cir.finding the phrase unobtrusive manner rendered claims indefinite because,even after consulting the claims,specification,and prosecution history,a skilled artisan would be left to consult the unpredictable vagaries of any one person opinion citations and internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,indefiniteness under,must ultimately turn on the question set forth by nautilus whether the claims,read in light of the specification delineating the patent,and the prosecution history,fail to inform,with reasonable certainty,those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.id.at emphasis added.applied here,processing system does not prevent the claims from doing just that.
cox nevertheless contends that processing system is indefinite because the asserted claims only describe it in functional terms.we disagree.claims are not per se indefinite merely because they contain functional language see also microprocessor enhancement.instruments,fed.cir.citing halliburton energy,m i llc,fed.cir.a pparatus claims are not necessarily indefinite for using functional language.indeed,here,functional language promotes definiteness because it helps bound the scope of the claims by specifying the operations that the processing system must undertake.all of the asserted claims are method claims,so it makes sense to define the inventive method as a series of functions.
further,cox can not complain that the specific functional limitations that describe the operation of the processing system in the asserted patents fail to provide sufficient clarity under nautilus.for example,in the control patents,claim of the patent requires that the method of operating a processing system process es the signaling message to select a network code that identifies a network element to provide egress from the packet communication system for the user communication.the specification discloses,as an embodiment of a processing system,the ccp and provides details about how it functions to select the network elements and the connections that comprise the communications path.patent ll.notably,the specification provides certain algorithmic details,including that selections are made through table and scp queries,id.at ll,and provides detail about how these queries are constructed,see,id.at ll,and the types of information that are used to determine these mappings,see,id.at ll.these disclosures are sufficiently detailed such that,reading claim in light of the specification,a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand claim requirement that the method of operating a processing system process es the signaling message to select a network code with reasonable certainty.
as another example,in the atm interworking patents,claim of the patent requires the step of processing the signaling in the processing system to select a connection.in the specification,the patent discloses the ccm as an embodiment of a processing system and provides details about how it receive s and process es signaling to select connections,and to generate and transmit signaling identifying the selections.patent ll.similar to the specification of the control patents,the specification of the patent describes that t he selection process can be accomplished through table,ll,and provides detail about how the process happens,see id.at ll.accordingly,a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand claim step of processing the signaling in the processing system to select a connection with reasonable certainty.
in sum,processing system does not render the claims indefinite because it does not prevent the claims,read in light of the specification and the prosecution history,from informing those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.although the asserted patents describe the operation of the processing system in largely functional terms,the recited steps,read in light of the specification,provide sufficient detail such that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand them with reasonable certainty.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court conclusion that the term processing system renders the asserted claims indefinite under.
i agree with the court holding that the claims are not invalid on the ground of indefiniteness.however,the court creates an interesting,but flawed,new mode of analysis,whereby the adjudicator first removes the challenged term from the claim,then decides whether the claim has the same meaning without the challenged term,and if the answer is yes,rules that the claim is not indefinite as a matter of law.op.at.this new style of claim construction will confound the already confused determination of patent rights.i write to protest this further inroad on a reasoned and reliable law of patents.
no precedent supports the court new protocol of claim construction,whereby definiteness of the claim is deemed proved because if claim of the patent were revised to remove the term processing system,the meaning would not discernably change.op.at.the court criticizes the parties for arguing about the indefiniteness of processing system as resulting in a peculiar scenario,since,in the majority view,the term processing system,despite its presence in three clauses of claim and other claims,plays no discernable role in defining the scope of the claims.id.however,claim is for a
