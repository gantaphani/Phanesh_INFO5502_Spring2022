defendant bellsouth appeals from the portion of a decision of the middle district of north carolina denying dismissal and remanding one of plaintiff tomi bryan three claims to state court.bryan bellsouth,wl.the court concluded that certain of bryan claims arose under federal law and were subject to dismissal under the doctrine.it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and remanded to state court a single claim that it determined did not raise a federal question.bellsouth maintains that the court erred in failing to conclude that all of bryan claims posed federal questions and were barred by the doctrine.for the reasons explained below,we vacate and remand.
bellsouth,as a provider of interstate public telecommunications services,is required by law to contribute a portion of its revenues to the federal universal service fund usf to ensure affordable telecommunications services to rural and areas,schools,hospitals,and the like.see a.the percentage of its revenues that a carrier must contribute to the usf is established by the federal communications commission fcc and is adjusted on a quarterly basis to ensure sufficient funding of the usf.see a.
the fcc permits telecommunications carriers such as bellsouth to recover the costs of their contributions to the usf from their customers,either through increased rates or through a separate line item on the customers bills.see in the matter of joint board on universal service.prior to april,certain carriers who recovered their usf contributions through line items would charge customers significantly more than the contribution required based on their bills.id.these carriers attributed the need for such marking up to the lag between the reporting and assessment of revenues,uncollectibles,and administrative costs.id.in an effort to address consumer concerns regarding disparate contributor recovery practices,id,the fcc forbade marking up the charge,effective april.id.
billing practices such as recovery of usf contributions are established in a carrier schedule of charges,see,also known as its tariff.a carrier tariff must be filed with the fcc and kept open for public inspection id.a.in addition,a carrier may not charge more or less than the rates set forth in its tariff,and it may not refund or remit to a customer any of the charges contained in the tariff.id.c.
as reflected in its tariff,bellsouth chooses to recover its usf contribution from its customers through a line item on the customers bills,which it denotes as the federal universal service charge fusc.the applicable tariff establishes the portion of bellsouth usf contribution that will be recovered from customers,and it calculates,based on the number of telephone lines and the amount sought to be recovered,that the end user of each line will be charged an fusc of per month.
on february,bryan filed suit against bellsouth in the superior court of guilford county,north carolina,seeking to represent a class of individuals who are bellsouth customers and who paid the fusc.bryan alleged that the fusc was excessive and that had failed to disclose certain information pertaining to the fusc,in violation of north carolina unfair trade practices law.
on march,bellsouth removed the suit to the middle district of north carolina,pursuant to and,on the basis that bryan claims raised federal questions by challenging bellsouth tariff.on june,bryan filed her first amended complaint the complaint in federal court,seeking to sue on behalf of all north carolina bellsouth customers who paid the fusc.the complaint alleged that bellsouth imposes an fusc that exceeds its required contribution to the usf,that bellsouth does not disclose how it calculates the fusc,and that bellsouth use of the term federal universal service charge is misleading.
based on these allegations,bryan asserted three separate causes of action.in count a,she claimed that bellsouth committed unfair and deceptive trade practices,in violation of north carolina general section,by failing to disclose how it calculates the fusc that it charges customers an amount well in excess of its contribution to the usf for north carolina services and that the fusc includes administrative expenses,costs,and profits count a further alleged that bellsouth use of the term federal universal service charge is unfair or deceptive,as is its representation to customers that the fusc is paid to the usf.in count b,bryan brought a claim for unjust,contending that bellsouth unjustly enriched itself by imposing an excessive and unlawful fusc.in count c,bryan alleged breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on bellsouth charging an excessive fusc and failing to make the disclosures described in count based on these claims,the complaint sought damages in an amount exceeding but less than per class member 
on june,bryan filed a motion to remand the complaint to state court,see,and,on july,bellsouth filed a motion,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.in support of its motion to dismiss and in opposition to bryan motion to remand,bellsouth maintained that all of bryan claims were barred by the doctrine in that they challenged bellsouth filed tariff or,in the alternative,that they should be heard first by the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.
on february,the court issued its memorandum opinion addressing the parties contentions.bryan,wl the opinion.on that same date,the court entered the order from which this appeal is taken the order.in its opinion,the court first concluded that removal was proper because bryan presented a federal question by directly challenging the terms of a tariff in her allegations that bellsouth fusc was excessive.opinion at.the court then turned to bellsouth motion to dismiss,explaining that the doctrine,also known as the doctrine,prohibits suits that would have the effect of altering the rates set forth in a carrier filed tariff.id.at.based on this doctrine,the court dismissed those claims that it concluded arose under federal law by challenging the tariff.id.at.the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and remanded to state court those remaining claims that did not challenge the tariff and thus did not present federal questions id.at.bellsouth appeals from the portion of the court order denying dismissal of count a and remanding it to state court,maintaining that count a,like bryan other two claims,challenged the tariff,arose under federal law,and should have been dismissed.
we turn first to bryan assertion that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.bryan maintains that jurisdiction is lacking because the order was,in that one of her claims was not dismissed.see generally the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.for this proposition,bryan relies on federal rule of civil procedure b,which provides that,w hen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action,the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.fed.civ.b emphasis added.bryan maintains that,as the court made no such express determination,its order was not final and is not appealable.
bryan assertion does not withstand scrutiny.admittedly,d provides that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise however,as the supreme court explained in quackenbush allstate insurance,d,d refers only to those situations in which a court has directed a remand for the reasons set forth in c that is,a defect in removal or lack of subject matter jurisdiction.quackenbush,at.the court went on to explain that,where a district court has remanded a lawsuit to state court based on abstention principles,the remand is considered a final order appealable under.id.at.
in this situation,the district court explicitly based its remand of count a on abstention principles,relying on c.opinion at.that section provides,the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection a providing for supplemental jurisdiction over all claims forming the same case or controversy district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction c.and we have recognized that a remand order based on c is appealable as a final order pursuant to.see battle seibels bruce ins,cir explaining that,under precedent,remands based on c are appealable final orders under see also hinson norwest fin,cir.because the court remanded count a pursuant to c,its decision constitutes an appealable final order,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
in this matter,the district court remanded count a to state court because it determined that count a did not give rise to federal question jurisdiction,and the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.a district court determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.yarnevic brink,cir.
turning to the issues on appeal,our task is twofold.first,we must determine whether bryan north carolina unfair trade practices claim arises under federal law,in which event the court erred in remanding it.see battle seibels bruce ins,cir concluding that the district court erred when it remanded the remaining claims based upon its mistaken belief that it had otherwise dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction.and if remand was error,we must determine whether count a is barred by the doctrine.
first,with respect to the existence of federal jurisdiction,we recognize that when,as here,state law creates the plaintiff cause of action,the lower federal courts possess jurisdiction to hear only those cases in which a complaint establishes that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d see also mulcahey columbia organic chems,cir and we are further cognizant that a filed tariff carries the force of federal law.see mci telecomms.garden state inv,cir observing that federal tariffs are the law,not mere contracts.as one of our sister circuits has explained,a tariff filed with a federal agency is the equivalent of a federal regulation,and so a suit to enforce it,and even more clearly a suit to invalidate it as unreasonable under federal law arise s under federal law.cahnmann sprint,cir internal citations omitted a claim that seeks to alter the terms of the relationship between carrier and consumer set forth in a filed tariff therefore presents a federal question.see fax telecommunicaciones v.at t,cir explaining that a claim seeking to enforce the filed tariff provides a basis for federal question jurisdiction.
additionally,the doctrine mandates that the rate of the carrier duly filed is the only lawful charge.at t cent.office,d quoting louisville nashville maxwell.the doctrine purpose is twofold to prevent discrimination among consumers and to preserve the authority of federal agencies see hill bellsouth,cir marcus,cir.as the eleventh circuit recently observed,the doctrine serves the purpose of by prohibiting a court from entering a judgment that would serve to alter the rate paid by a plaintiff.hill,at.even if such a challenge does not,in theory,attack the filed rate,the court explained,an award of damages to the would,effectively,change the rate paid by the customer to one below the filed rate paid by other customers.id.we therefore can not permit any claim to go forward that,if successful,would require an award of damages that would have the effect of imposing different rates upon different consumers.see marco supply,v.at t communications,cir a regulated carrier must charge the tariff rate established with the appropriate regulatory agency to do otherwise would be giving a preference to and discriminating in favor of the customer in question.similarly,authorizing a court to award damages that would effectively impose a rate different from that dictated by the tariff would usurp the fcc authority to determine what rate is reasonable.see hill,at.in sum,we must determine whether count a of the complaint would require the court to determine a reasonable rate for the fusc,thereby presenting a substantial question of federal law and contravening the doctrine 
against this backdrop,we now assess whether count a of the complaint effectively challenges the reasonableness of bellsouth filed rate,giving rise to federal question jurisdiction and requiring dismissal pursuant to the doctrine.because only the fcc may decide what charge is lawful,it is beyond dispute that the court was correct to exercise jurisdiction and dismiss bryan claims complaining that the fusc was excessive.the parties disagree,however,as to whether count a also presents a forbidden challenge to tariff.bellsouth maintains that it does,asserting that,because count a seeks damages,the court,were bryan successful,would be put in the position of effectively refunding a portion of the fusc to bryan.in the circumstances presented,we are constrained to agree.
in count a,bryan alleges that bellsouth charging and collecting of the fusc and its failure to make certain disclosures in connection therewith constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices under north carolina general statute section.in part v of her complaint,titled damages,bryan alleges,bellsouth actions and omissions have been an actual,producing,direct and proximate cause of damages to plaintiff and to bellsouth other north carolina customers in an amount exceeding.complaint.bryan prayer for damages draws no distinction between her separate counts.with no indication to the contrary,we must view part v as seeking monetary damages for the acts alleged in count 
bellsouth asserts that the monetary remedy bryan seeks is a refund of that portion of the fusc that she considers she was wrongfully induced to pay and that,in seeking such a remedy,bryan runs afoul of the doctrine.in actuality,bryan does not specify the nature of her damages in count nonetheless,bellsouth maintains that any award of damages flowing from bellsouth to bryan,no matter how calculated,would violate the doctrine by refunding a portion of the fusc to some consumers but not to others and by requiring the court to determine a reasonable rate.certainly,this proposition finds support in the decisions of our sister circuits.see,hill,at hill two remaining claims implicate the filed rate doctrine because she seeks purely monetary damages as relief.marcus,at barring claim for compensatory damages because plaintiffs would effectively receive discounted rate and because award would undermine authority of fcc,which had approved billing practice in question.in the circumstances presented here,we need do whether every award of compensatory damages would serve to challenge a carrier tariff.
in our view,the in the light most favorable to the purports to seek any form of damages other than a refund of some portion of the fusc.and it pleads no facts that would put bellsouth on notice that bryan intends to seek damages resulting from any injury other than paying the fusc.in the facts section of the complaint,bryan alleges only that she is a bellsouth customer who was charged and paid the fusc,that charged an fusc that was excessive,that it failed to disclose how the fusc was calculated,and that its use of the term fusc was misleading.complaint 
at argument,bryan asserted that one could envision an award of damages that would not challenge the filed tariff.she posited that if bellsouth had fully disclosed all information pertaining to its fusc,she might have chosen a different carrier that would have charged a lower fusc,and therefore she would have been damaged in the amount of the difference between the two carriers fuscs.such an award of damages,bryan maintained,would not require the court to determine the reasonableness of bellsouth fusc and therefore would neither present a federal question nor be barred by the doctrine.this example is purely hypothetical,however,and nothing in the complaint suggests such an injury 
in sum,we conclude that the only plausible reading of the complaint is that count a,like the other counts,seeks a refund of a portion of the fusc because the amount of the fusc is determinatively set forth in bellsouth tariff,which carries the force of federal law,an action seeking to alter that rate presents a federal question.the district court therefore erred in remanding count a to state court.and because count a would require the court to determine a reasonable rate for the fusc,that claim must be dismissed pursuant to the doctrine.
pursuant to the foregoing,we vacate the district court order with respect to count a and remand for that count to be dismissed.
vacated and remanded 
the majority holds that the plaintiff state law cause of action against bellsouth for violation of the north carolina unfair trade practices act,arises under federal law within the meaning of because it effectively challenges the rates set in bellsouth filed tariff with the fcc.ante at.because this standard has no basis in the supreme court precedent for determining whether statutory arising under jurisdiction exists,and because neither the plaintiff right to relief nor the remedy that the plaintiff has requested entails resolution of any question of federal law,much less necessarily depend s on the resolution of such a question,i dissent.
a state law claim arises under federal law within the meaning of in only two circumstances.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vac.trust,d.the first circumstance,commonly referred to as complete preemption,exists when federal law so completely sweeps away state law that any action brought under state law is transformed into a federal action that can be brought originally in,or removed to,federal court.king marriott int l,cir citing metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.our court has recently explained that in such cases,in actuality,the plaintiff simply has brought a mislabeled federal claim,which may be asserted under some federal statute.king,at see also franchise tax,at.describing such state law claims as really one s of federal law.the second,and more common,circumstance under which a state law claim can arise under federal law is if a complaint establishe s that the plaintiff right to relief under state law necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax,at.dixon coburg dairy,cir.merrell dow,thompson,d holding that,even where the plaintiff right to relief required the resolution of a federal question,the district court did not have statutory federal question jurisdiction where the adjudication of the federal question would not serve congressional purposes and the federal system.
because the majority finds jurisdiction under the second of these circumstances,it does not address the question of whether complete preemption is present.see ante at.there is simply no argument in this case,however,that federal jurisdiction through complete preemption exists.as we recently explained,the touchstone of complete preemption is whether congress intended the federal cause of action to be the exclusive cause of action for the type of claim brought by a plaintiff.king,at quoting beneficial bank anderson,d marcus,cir a fter metropolitan life,it is clear that the complete preemption doctrine applies only where congress has clearly manifested an intent to disallow state law claims in a particular field.for this reason,
a vital feature of complete preemption is the existence of a federal cause of action that replaced the preempted state cause of action.where no discernable federal cause of action exists on a plaintiff claim,there is no complete preemption,for in such cases there no federal cause of action that congress intended to be the exclusive remedy for the alleged wrong.
king,at emphasis added.in light of this direction,the absence of a federal cause of action analogous to the plaintiff state law ncutpa claim is fatal to any argument for complete preemption.as the second circuit has concluded,while the fca does provide some causes of action for customers,it provides none for deceptive advertising and billing.marcus,at compare,c,authorizing suit in federal district court to challenge carrier collection of tariffs which are greater or less or different than those filed with the fcc.
furthermore,even if the fca did provide a cause of action for deceptive and misleading billing,complete preemption would still be lacking,because congress clearly intended for there not to be complete federal preemption of plaintiff state law causes of action.indeed,the fca contains a savings clause that provides that nothing in the fca shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.see also metropolitan life ins.taylor,d stating that even with the existence of a cause of action under a of erisa,the court would be reluctant to find that extraordinary power that converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim,without explicit evidence of congressional intent from the legislative history marcus,at finding that t he fca not only does not manifest a clear congressional intent to preempt state law actions prohibiting deceptive business practices,false advertisement,or common law fraud,it evidences congress intent to allow such claims to proceed under state law.
accordingly,if the district court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff remaining state law claim,it must be on the more narrow ground that the plaintiff right to relief,as set forth in her complaint,necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax,at.interstate petroleum morgan,cir en banc.
the majority refuses even to apply this established standard for determining federal jurisdiction and adopts instead the different standard of whether a complaint effectively challenges a filed rate,see ante at emphasis added inquiring whether count a of the complaint effectively challenges the reasonableness of bellsouth filed rate,a standard derived from cases that considered the applicability of the doctrine as a defense to a particular claim,see,brown mci worldcom network,cir noting that the doctrine also bars suits challenging services,billing,or other practices when such challenges,if successful,would have the effect of changing the filed tariff fax telecommunicaciones v.at t,cir noting that i f this court were to enforce the promised rate and award damages on that basis,we would effectively be setting and applying a rate apart from that judged reasonable by the fcc,in violation of the nonjusticiability strand of the filed rate doctrine.the primary case on which the majority relies for its adoption of this standard,hill bellsouth,cir,commits without discussion the same mistake as the majority,using,for determination of the existence of federal jurisdiction,the standard developed to evaluate applicability of the doctrine as a defense.id.at focusing its discussion on the applicability of the doctrine,and noting simply that federal question jurisdiction should have attached to hill two remaining causes of action because they implicated the filed rate doctrine.
this is error plain and simple.notwithstanding the majority obvious belief as well as its disclaimer that it so believes,the doctrine is not coterminous with the scope of federal question jurisdiction under section it is significantly broader.see fax telecommunicaciones,at holding that the plaintiff breach of contract claim did not arise under federal law for the purposes of removal but that it was barred by the doctrine.it is one thing to provide that arising under jurisdiction exists in that narrow class of cases where the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on the resolution of a substantial federal question or congress has preempted state court jurisdiction.it is quite another to provide that jurisdiction is present so long as the plaintiff request for relief constitutes an effective challenge to the rate set by federal law.indeed,as this case demonstrates,a claim can easily be characterized as an effective challen
