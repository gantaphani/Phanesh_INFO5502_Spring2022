in the past three decades,satellite television programming has grown from nonexistence into a booming business,and piracy of such programming has grown apace.this case involves the attempts of a satellite programming provider to fight piracy among of pirating technology through use of e of the federal communications act.
appellant directv,directv furnishes satellite television programming in subscription and formats to customers who have purchased both the programming and the necessary equipment.in order to watch the encrypted directv programming,a customer must acquire a satellite dish,an integrated receiver decoder,and a smart card,which directv calls an access card.the satellite dish receives directv encrypted signals and transmits them to the receiver,which decrypts the signal and sends it to the customer television.software in the access card directs the receiver to decrypt only the signals conforming to the customer subscription package.
individuals who seek to watch directv programming without payment pirates have developed methods of decrypting directv signals without subscription.by reprogramming or replacing legitimate access cards with illicit decoder technology,pirates have managed to gain unauthorized access to all of directv programming.
directv fights pirates by transmitting electronic ecms that disable illegally modified access cards by sending their access software into a loop.once an ecm has disabled,or looped,an illegal card,the card will not direct its receiver to access directv programming unless the access card is reprogrammed.one such reprogramming device,and the device relevant on this appeal,is an unlooper,a printed circuit board that restores functionality to a disabled access card by resolving the software loop created by the ecm.as amicus acknowledges,most unloopers currently are configured exclusively for pirating directv satellite signal.
directv fight against piracy makes frequent use of the courts.see http www.hackhu.com website maintained by directv chronicling litigation actions against defendants.in the consolidated cases at bar,directv brought claims against two of pirating technology,hoa huynh and cody oliver.the complaints allege that the defendants each purchased one unlooper and used it to illegally modify directv access cards.complaint at,directv,huynh,see also complaint at,directv,oliver,according to the complaints,these actions constituted conversion and violated both the federal communications act of,as amended,a,e and the electronic communications privacy act.
defendants failed to appear or otherwise respond to directv complaints in defaulting,defendants are deemed to have admitted all factual allegations contained in the complaints.see.a benny pipes,cir.directv moved for a default judgment and in statutory damages against each defendant for violations of e,or alternatively,for violations of a,or alternatively,for violations of a.the district court issued two separate orders in which it granted directv motions for default judgment as to liability and damages under a,declined to grant default judgment pursuant to e,and declined to reach the issue of liability under a.directv appeals from the district court decision not to grant default judgment as to liability under e 
in oliver case,the district court the honorable saundra armstrong presiding stated that e is meant to target upstream manufacturers distributors of illegal pirating devices.directv,oliver,wl,at.may,order granting default judgment pursuant to a,but not pursuant to e.stating that a showing that defendant distributed or sold equipment was necessary to establish a violation of e,id.at,the district court concluded that the complaint lack of any allegation that oliver had sold or distributed pirating devices meant that directv had pled insufficient facts to establish a violation of e.the court,therefore,declined to grant a default judgment against appellees on that ground.id.
in huynh case,the district court the honorable charles breyer presiding dismissed the allegation that huynh insertion of a modified access card into a directv receiver constituted assembl ing a piracy device,stating that a contrary ruling would totally destroy the distinction between e and a.directv,huynh,at.may,memorandum and order granting default judgment pursuant to a,but not pursuant to e.the court next concluded that e did not apply to allegations that huynh programmed and reprogrammed a smart card.id.at noting statutory damages range of for violations of a and range of for violations of e.finding significance in congress decision to create different liabilities for users and manufacturers of pirating devices in a and e respectively,the district court determined that applying e to huynh alleged conduct would nullify the distinction built into the statute.accordingly,the district court concluded that directv did not plead a violation of e.id.

home reception of satellite television programming began in,one year after home box office,hbo began satellite transmissions of its movies to cable television providers.ii,at,reprinted in.at that time,home reception of such signals was of questionable legality,as of the federal communications act outlawed the unauthorized reception of radio communications.see also chartwell commc ns group westbrook,cir holding the unauthorized reception of television signals intended for cable television operators violated.congress clarified the legality of home reception of satellite television programming in the cable communications policy act of cable act by outlawing the unauthorized reception of satellite programming unless the programming was not encrypted or a subscription process had not been created,stat.codified at a b.the cable act substantially increased penalties for unauthorized signal reception by pirates seeking commercial advantage or private financial gain.id.codified at d.it subjected to penalty the importation,manufacture,sale,or distribution of equipment to be used for unauthorized signal reception,id.codified at d in,congress added prohibitions on the assembly or modification of equipment to be used for unauthorized signal reception,stat.codified at e.the amendments again increased the penalties for unauthorized signal reception while maintaining the cable act system of authorizing harsher punishment for pirates motivated by commercial gain.id.at,codified at e.for example,while of pirating technologies faced criminal sanctions of a fine of up to or imprisonment for up to six months,e,pirates motivated by commercial gain faced criminal sanctions of a fine of up to,imprisonment for up to two years,or both,e.the civil penalties reflected this punishment rubric of pirating technology faced statutory damages of to per violation,while upstream programmers and sellers of pirating statutory damages of to per violation.e c i ii.this damages provision has not been substantively changed since.see e.
the question presented in these appeals is whether appellees use of the unloopers constituted assembly and modification of piracy devices in violation of e.
specific allegationsa.assembly 
the complaints assert that by removing and inserting into directv receivers access cards that had been restored by an unlooper,appellees illegally assembled piracy devices in violation of subsection e.complaint at,directv,huynh,no.complaint at,directv,oliver,no.we reject the premise because this interpretation of assembly would sweep into the ambit of subsection e even the minimum actions necessary to intercept a satellite signal that are violations of subsection a.adopting this interpretation would destroy the approach established by congress and would render subsection a redundant.we must make every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provision
