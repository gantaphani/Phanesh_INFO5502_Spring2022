phillip wolfson,a judgment creditor,appeals the bankruptcy appellate panel bap decision affirming the cancellation of his judgment lien on debtors ronald gary watts and yee kome kathy watts collectively,debtors declared homestead.at the time wolfson recorded his abstract of judgment,the value of the preexisting lien on debtors homestead,together with the homestead exemption,exceeded the fair market value of debtors real property.the bankruptcy court canceled wolfson judgment lien in an avoidance proceeding pursuant to f under the rationale of jones heskett in re jones,cir.
in jones,we held that,under california code of civil procedure ccp c,a judgment creditor lien does not attach to a declared homestead unless surplus equity exists in the homestead at the time the creditor records an abstract of judgment.after jones,two california appellate courts rejected our interpretation of section c and concluded that a judgment creditor is entitled to surplus equity that accrues after the abstract of judgment is recorded.in light of the intervening california authority,which the california supreme court would likely follow,we overrule jones.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural history 
in,debtors recorded a declaration of homestead,which protected of equity in their principal residence from execution by creditors.ccp c defining homestead,a.in,wolfson recorded an abstract of judgment against debtors real property for.at the time wolfson recorded the abstract of judgment,the sum of the debt on the first deed of trust and the homestead exemption exceeded the fair market value of debtors home.thus,there was no surplus equity at that time to satisfy the judgment.
when debtors filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in,however,there was surplus equity.at that time,the fair market value of the house was and the debt on the first deed of trust was.thus,there was in surplus equity unencumbered by the first deed of trust and the homestead exemption.
in,debtors moved to avoid wolfson judgment lien in the bankruptcy court pursuant to f following jones interpretation of section c,the bankruptcy court found that wolfson judgment lien had not attached and could never attach to debtors residence because there was no surplus equity in the residence when wolfson recorded the abstract of judgment.accordingly,the bankruptcy court canceled wolfson lien under f.the bankruptcy court,however,expressed its disapproval of the result,explaining that it agreed with two subsequent california appellate court opinions,smith merrill,th,d,and teaman wilkinson,th,d,both of which disagreed with jones interpretation of section c.
on appeal,the bap agreed with the bankruptcy court that it could not cast off the bonds imposed by jones.the bap reasoned that the california supreme court,which had not had the opportunity to interpret section c,could conceivably disagree with the california appellate court rulings in smith and teaman.accordingly,the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling.
this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
a.the california homestead exemption in federal bankruptcy law 
federal bankruptcy laws provide debtors with various exemptions,which exclude certain property from the bankruptcy estate.kendall pladson in re pladson,cir d.pursuant to b,california opted out of the federal exemptions and enacted its own exemptions.ccp little reaves in re reaves,cir.
a california debtor in bankruptcy must elect between two sets of exemptions under california law,one which applies to debtors generally and the other which applies to debtors in bankruptcy.ccp a farrar mckown in re mckown,cir.the homestead exemption available to judgment debtors,ccp,is more generous than the exemption that applies to debtors in bankruptcy,id.b.here,prior to filing for bankruptcy,debtors recorded a declaration of homestead available to judgment debtors,thereby entitling debtors to a homestead exemption,id.a,which remained effective after they filed their bankruptcy petition 
after filing for bankruptcy,debtors sought to avoid wolfson judgment lien pursuant to f on the ground that it impaired their homestead exemption.to determine whether or to what extent wolfson judgment lien could be avoided under f because it impaired debtors homestead exemption,the bankruptcy court had to apply california law to determine whether wolfson lien attached to debtors residence,and if the lien attached,determine under federal bankruptcy law whether or to what extent the lien impaired debtors homestead exemption.see wiget nielsen in re nielsen,cir see also bank of am.trust sav.ass hanger in re hanger,cir holding that the bankruptcy court must determine the extent to which a lien impairs the exemption and that only that amount must be avoided.we address only the first inquiry here.
attachment of a judicial lien on a declared homestead under california law 
prior to,if a homeowner recorded a declaration of homestead in california,the california homestead exemption protected the entire value of the residence.jones,at.thus,no judgment lien could attach,and a creditor only option to enforce his judgment was to seek a judicial sale of the property.id.in,however,the california legislature enacted the enforcement of judgments law,ccp,which amended the declared homestead provisions.pursuant to section,judgment liens could now attach to declared homesteads if there was surplus equity in excess of the total amount of liens and encumbrances and the homestead exemption.section provides in pertinent part 
a except as provided in subdivision c,a judgment lien on real property does not attach to a declared homestead if both of the following requirements are satisfied 
a homestead declaration describing the declared homestead was recorded prior to the time the abstract or certified copy of the judgment was recorded to create the judgment lien.
the homestead declaration names the judgment debtor or the spouse of the judgment debtor as a declared homestead owner.
c a judgment lien attaches to a declared homestead in the amount of any surplus over the total of the following 
all liens and encumbrances on the declared homestead at the time the abstract of judgment or certified copy of the judgment is recorded to create the judgment lien.
the homestead exemption set forth in section 
in jones,without the benefit of any california cases to guide our interpretation of section c,we addressed whether a judgment lien could attach to a declared homestead if there was no surplus equity at the time the abstract of judgment was recorded.we held that a judgment creditor lien attaches only if surplus equity exists at the time the creditor records the abstract of judgment,or the creditor executes on the judgment,thereby creating a lien that has a life.at.thus,under jones,even if surplus equity accrues after a creditor records an abstract of judgment,the judgment creditor,confronted with a bankruptcy petition,is not entitled to any surplus equity.
we reasoned in jones that the california homestead exemption laws were designed to prevent individuals from losing their homes,and thus the homestead laws should be liberally construed in favor of homesteaders.id.at.we reviewed the history of the legislative amendments to the homestead statutes as reflected in the comment of the california law revision commission,cal.revision comm reports comment.the comment explained that judgment liens do not attach to property that is subject to a prior homestead declaration,but that,similar to the law prior to the amendments,a judgment creditor could reach any equity value in excess of the homestead exemption by levy of execution on the property.jones,at.we specifically noted that the comment was not revised to reflect the addition of subdivision c to section.id.thus,we concluded that subsection c was an afterthought and that it carve d out a narrow exception to the general and california rule that judgment liens do not attach to a declared homestead.id.judge ferguson dissented for several of the reasons later adopted by the california appellate courts,discussed below.
under jones,wolfson judgment lien,created by recording the abstract of judgment,did not and could never attach to debtors residence because there was no surplus equity when he recorded the abstract of judgment.the only way that wolfson could reach any surplus equity would be to rerecord the abstract of judgment when surplus equity accrued.
after jones,the california court of appeal in smith,d at,and teaman,d at,disagreed with our interpretation of section c,holding that a judgment creditor is entitled to surplus equity that accrues in a declared homestead after an abstract of judgment is recorded we find smith and teaman persuasive.
both california courts rejected jones interpretation of section c,noting that it leads to an anomalous result.it requires judgment creditors to continually rerecord their abstracts of judgment to ensure that their lien attaches if surplus equity has accrued,and it cripple s the doctrine of priority of liens.teaman,d at citing jones,at ferguson,dissenting.this continual rerecording of an abstract of judgment conflicts with ccp,which grants priority to liens based on the date that they are recorded.the interpretation of section c by the smith and teaman courts correctly avoids giving much greater significance to the act of recordation than what it was designed provide notice.jones heskett in re jones,cir,overruled by jones.
the california courts interpretation of section c also follows from the statutory text.the clause at the time the abstract of judgment is recorded modifies only a ll liens and encumbrances,but not the amount of any surplus.thus,the surplus equity may be calculated at a later date,such as at the time the judgment debtor files a bankruptcy petition.jones,at ferguson,dissenting.
two other statutory provisions,ccp and a,support the smith and teaman interpretation of section c.see teaman,d at.section provides that,e xcept as provided in section,a judgment lien attaches to both present and future interests in real property.thus,a creditor can reach property that the debtor did not own when the abstract of judgment was recorded,such as future increases in the equity value of real property.id.citing kinney vallentyne,cal d,cal.accordingly,despite the exception for section,none of the provisions of section can be reasonably read to prevent section from applying to an increase in equity in homestead property.id.
teaman also relied on section a,which provides that homesteaded property may not be sold if there is no surplus equity.if a creditor attempts to execute on his judgment lien and the homestead is not sold because of lack of surplus equity,the judgment creditor must wait one year before attempting to subject the property to another judicial sale.ccp a.section a demonstrates the legislature intent that if a judgment creditor lien d oes not initially attach because there i s no surplus equity when his abstract of judgment i s recorded,the creditor has later opportunities to execute on the lien if equity develops.teaman,d at.
had the bankruptcy court here followed the rationale of smith and teaman instead of jones,it would have concluded that wolfson lien had attached by the time debtors filed their chapter bankruptcy petition,and thus the lien could not have been avoided on this basis.we adopt that approach here.
we are bound to follow smith and teaman absent convincing evidence that the california supreme court would reject the interpretation of section c by these two courts.see owen ex rel.owen united states,cir.in reexamining our interpretation of section c in light of smith and teaman,we conclude that,if confronted with the issue,the california supreme court would follow the rationale of smith and teaman and not the approach that we adopted in jones.as we explained in owen 
these recent decisions by the california courts of appeal that have appeared subsequent to our commercial union decision require us to reconsider the proper interpretation of.our interpretation in commercial union was only binding in the absence of any subsequent indication from the california courts that our interpretation was incorrect.the recent decisions from the courts of appeal cast a new light on the question.in the absence of a pronouncement by the highest court of a state,the federal courts must follow the decision of the intermediate appellate courts of the state unless there is convincing evidence that the highest court of the state would decide differently.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis added holding that convincing evidence existed that the california supreme court would not follow the state appellate courts decisions stephan dowdle,cir concluding that an earlier panel decision was no longer binding and must be overruled because the arizona court of appeals had subsequently interpreted the relevant arizona statute to the contrary see also tworivers lewis,cir applying federal law to decide the issue in the case but explaining that,had the panel applied state law,it would be bound by a state appellate court opinion that conflicted with an earlier panel opinion absent convincing evidence that the state supreme court would disagree with the appellate court fdic mcsweeney,cir explaining that,in the absence of an intervening california supreme court opinion concerning the relevant issue or an appellate court opinion at odds with the prior ninth circuit opinion,the panel was bound by our prior decisions interpreting state as well as federal law.accordingly,as in stephan,at,we overrule jones and hold,consistent with the intervening california case law,that a judgment creditor is entitled to surplus equity that accrues in a declared homestead after an abstract of judgment is recorded 
reversed and remanded.
i find myself in the perplexing position of being bound by a precedent counseling that i need not be bound by a precedent.
although there is much in the court fine opinion with which i agree would have no quarrel with its analysis of california law were the issue one of first am profoundly troubled by the notion of reaching this result by our overruling,as a panel,the precedent set by an earlier panel in jones heskett in re jones,cir.
it is a bedrock principle of our court that the published decision of one panel binds every other panel from that day forward put another way,one panel may not overrule another the power to overrule is confided to the en banc court,and the en banc court alone panels may distinguish they may question they may deploy virtually any of the other verbs in the shepard vocabulary.but they may not overrule.
there are exceptions.we need not convene the en banc court when the supreme court reverses us directly.nor must we do so when that court,in reviewing a case from another circuit,knocks the props out from under one of our decisions.see,le vick skaggs,cir piedmont label sun garden packing,cir see also,circuit city stores,najd,cir noting that duffield robertson stephens,cir,has likely been implicitly overruled.this practice represents our confidence,as a court,that our panels are able to tell the difference between a supreme court ruling that rips one of our decisions from the federal reporter altogether and one that leaves at least a hanging chad behind.but it also represents our confidence that the supreme court stands ready to review and to reverse us when necessary a proposition for which,i think,no citation is required.
we also permit our panels to use the big eraser when the earlier decision is based on state law that has demonstrably changed in the intervening period.herein lies the rub.a proposition demonstrability depends on the audience receptivity.how skeptical must we ask our panels to be when they are urged to exercise the power to overrule in light of a supervening change in the underlying law 
to my mind,a panel must not act in contravention of our precedent without being highly certain of its authority to do so.and that certainty is not easily obtained when,as here,the alleged change in state law comes from case law rather than statutory law.
when it is a
