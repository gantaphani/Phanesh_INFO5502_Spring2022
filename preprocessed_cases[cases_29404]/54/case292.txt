on learning that plaintiff fidelity national title insurance company fidelity was about to file an abstract of judgment as a lien against his real property,defendant gordon schroeder gordon deeded his interest in a fresno home that he with defendant toni richardson,aka toni schroeder toni,over to toni.the trial court found that gordon intended to defraud fidelity,but the transfer was not set aside under the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta et because no recoverable value remained in the real property after deducting existing encumbrances and gordon homestead exemption.the trial court also rejected fidelity other causes of action,including that of resulting trust.fidelity appeals,contending the trial court failed to correctly apply the law when it denied relief under the ufta and the resulting trust cause of action.we agree with the trial court that fidelity was not entitled to relief under the ufta,but disagree with its conclusion that fidelity could not maintain a resulting trust cause of action.accordingly,we reverse and remand for the trial court to determine,under the facts and circumstances of this case,whether toni holds gordon interest in the fresno property as a resulting trust for the benefit of gordon.if the trial court so finds,fidelity judgment lien will attach to gordon equitable interest,effective on the date fidelity recorded its abstract of judgment.
facts and procedural history 
gordon failed to pay spousal support and his former wife,elizabeth schroeder elizabeth,obtained a judgment against him in the amount of.in,the judgment was duly recorded in fresno county.years later,gordon and toni purchased a home on north brunswick avenue in the city of fresno,which home became their residence the fresno property.the vesting deed to the fresno property placed title in both of their names,as joint tenants,and it also stated they were husband and wife,even though they were not legally married 
in,gordon and toni refinanced the loan on their fresno property.fidelity was the title insurance company on behalf of the new lender,long beach mortgage company,in connection with the loan refinance.fidelity failed to discover or disclose the existence of elizabeth prior judgment lien against gordon interest in the property,and consequently fidelity became obligated under the title insurance policy to pay off the judgment lien.in may of,fidelity paid to elizabeth,and obtained an assignment of all rights under elizabeth judgment and lien.thereafter,in early,fidelity inadvertently released the judgment lien,leaving it as holder of an unsecured judgment against gordon.
fidelity filed its original complaint against gordon and toni on december,alleging causes of action for unjust enrichment,money paid,and equitable subrogation.gordon and toni answered the complaint on february.in june of,fidelity filed its motion for summary judgment.in opposition to the motion,gordon and toni disclosed for the first time that they were not legally married.since fidelity had premised its summary judgment motion partly on gordon and toni status as husband and wife,on august,fidelity counsel agreed to withdraw its motion for summary judgment and,instead,informed opposing counsel it would attempt to secure a new judgment lien on the fresno property.
a few days later,on september,gordon and toni executed a grant deed conveying the property from gordon schroeder toni richardson to toni richardson for no consideration.the grant deed was recorded on september.fidelity abstract of judgment was recorded on october.
on december,fidelity filed its first amended complaint asserting the following causes of action declaratory relief,to obtain a judicial declaration that gordon and toni were putative spouses and that fidelity was entitled to collect its judgment from both gordon separate property and toni property fraudulent conveyance,pursuant to the ufta,seeking to have the september,grant deed to toni set aside as a fraud upon fidelity rights as a creditor constructive trust,against toni,seeking a determination that based on fraud or other wrongdoing,she holds the fresno property as a constructive trustee for fidelity and resulting trust,against toni,to obtain a ruling that the september,grant deed was merely to shield gordon ownership interest from creditors,and that gordon and toni true intention was she would hold legal title in trust for gordon while he retained his equitable interest in the fresno property.under this theory,fidelity judgment lien would attach against gordon equitable interest.
following a bench trial,the trial court took the case under submission and ultimately issued a decision rejecting all four causes of action.of interest to this appeal,the trial court denied relief on the ufta cause of action because there was a failure to demonstrate any injury,since there was no value or equity in the fresno property that fidelity could reach.the trial court concluded there was no injury because gordon share in the equity of the property was exceeded by existing encumbrances and the automatic homestead exemption.the trial court denied relief on the constructive trust and resulting trust causes of action on the ground that there is no claim that fidelity is entitled to claim a interest in the property as opposed to a judgment lien on.judgment was entered in favor of gordon and toni on september.fidelity timely appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the ufta cause of actiona.standard of review 
as noted,the trial court found that fidelity was not entitled to relief under the ufta because there was no recoverable equity in the property in light of existing encumbrances and gordon automatic homestead exemption.on appeal,fidelity claims the trial court erred because the automatic homestead exemption was inapplicable to the ufta claim.as this raises a question of the correct legal standard to apply under undisputed facts or of statutory interpretation and application to such facts,we undertake a de novo review.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
overview of the ufta 
the ufta permits defrauded creditors to reach property in the hands of a transferee.mejia reed cal th,d.a fraudulent conveyance under the ufta involves a transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.citation.filip bucurenciu th,d.a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made,if the debtor made the transfer as follows with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor,subd.a.civil code section sets forth a creditor remedies under the ufta,including avoidance of a transfer,attachment,and the equitable remedies of injunction and receivership as well as a ny other relief the circumstances may require.filip bucurenciu,supra,at,d,subd.a.
in order for a fraudulent transfer to occur,among other things,there must be a transfer of an asset as defined in the ufta,see,in re valente cir,valente no transfer of asset for purposes of the ufta if encumbrances exceed value of property at time of transfer.in the definitional section of the ufta,a transfer is defined as every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset,subd.i.asset means property of a debtor,but the term does not include,the following property to the extent it is encumbered by a valid lien.property to the extent it is generally exempt under nonbankruptcy law,subd.a.
the above definitions are relevant to the question of whether any injury occurred to the creditor as a result of the transfer,which is a necessary element for relief under the ufta.a principle of the law of fraudulent transfers is,a transfer in fraud of creditors may be attacked only by one who is injured thereby.mere intent to delay or defraud is not sufficient injury to the creditor must be shown affirmatively.in other words,prejudice to the plaintiff is essential.it can not be said that a creditor has been injured unless the transfer puts beyond her reach property she otherwise would be able to subject to the payment of her debt.citations.mehrtash mehrtash th,d mehrtash.
in mehrtash,the plaintiff sued under the ufta to set aside the defendant transfer of his home to his two stepsons.the plaintiff claimed the transfer was a fraud on her rights as a creditor under a money judgment for spousal support.in,the plaintiff obtained a writ of execution to enforce her judgment against the real property,and she sought to set aside the transfer under the ufta.the trial court denied relief under the ufta on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove the value of the property exceeded the sum of existing encumbrances and senior liens,therefore no injury was shown.mehrtash,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal affirmed because the record supported the trial court finding that the plaintiff was not injured by the transfer.id.at,d.
in so holding,mehrtash noted that at the time of the subject transfer in,the dwelling had recently been purchased by the defendant for and the property was subject to first and second trust deed encumbrances totaling plus two judgment liens totaling about.mehrtash,supra,th at,d.there was no evidence that the plaintiff recorded an abstract of judgment to obtain a lien securing her judgment,therefore the two judgment liens were prior in time to the plaintiff execution lien obtained in.ibid.in addition,since the defendant was over years old,the sale of his dwelling to enforce a money judgment would be subject to a homestead exemption of.id.at,d citing code civ,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a.in light of these facts,mehrtash concluded the trial court correctly ruled that no injury was shown to plaintiff even assuming the allegedly fraudulent conveyance were set aside and the property were hypothetically available to enforce the plaintiff money judgment,it could not be sold without a court order because it is the debtor dwelling,and could not be sold without a minimum bid equal to all encumbrances and senior liens plus the homestead exemption.citations.the p laintiff produced no evidence that the value of the property could support any net recovery for her in the event the conveyance were set aside.mehrtash,supra,at,d.
trial court denial of the ufta claim 
here,the trial court expressly followed the mehrtash decision in concluding that fidelity cause of action under the ufta failed.the trial court reasoned that even if the transfer were set aside,a sale of the fresno property would not satisfy any portion of the judgment,therefore no injury was shown.the facts relevant to the trial court analysis were not in dispute.after deducting the amount owed on the existing encumbrance,the total equity in the fresno property was,and thus gordon share of that equity was only.the trial court held this minimal equity could not be reached by fidelity because it did not exceed gordon homestead exemption of under section.the trial court concluded,t he undisputed evidence demonstrates that fidelity title was not injured by the fraudulent transfer since gordon transfer of his interest in the property to toni did not put beyond fidelity reach property that could satisfy a portion of the judgment owed by gordon.
fidelity argues the trial court should not have applied the automatic homestead exemption to its evaluation of the ufta claim.in support of its position,fidelity cites reddy gonzalez th,d reddy.in that case,the defendant transferred his interest in his home to his wife for the purpose of shielding the property from the plaintiff,a judgment creditor.the plaintiff sued to set aside the transfer as a fraudulent conveyance under the ufta,and the trial court granted that relief.on appeal,the defendant claimed that his transfer to his wife could not have been fraudulent because the property was subject to a homestead exemption.that is,the defendant argued the plaintiff would have been unable to obtain satisfaction of his judgment from the sale of the residence due to application of the homestead exemption and hence the conveyance did not shield any asset from creditors.reddy,supra,at,d.the case did not involve a declared homestead exemption pursuant to sections through.rather,as here,the defendant relied solely on the automatic homestead exemption provided at sections through we shall explore the two types of homestead exemptions presently below.the court of appeal upheld the trial court judgment granting relief under the ufta because,unlike the former law relating to declared homesteads,the automatic homestead exemption did not insulate the homestead property from attachment of judgment liens or from a sale.reddy,supra,at,d.therefore,a transfer of such property with intent to shield it from creditors is a fraudulent conveyance.id.at,d.
as highlighted in reddy,there are significant differences between the protections afforded by a declared homestead exemption and an automatic homestead exemption.under law,a declared homestead effectively shielded the dwelling from the reach of judgment creditors no judgment lien could attach,even if there was surplus equity.smith james merrill,th,d engelman gordon d.swearingen byrne d.the only means for a judgment creditor to reach the surplus equity above the amount of the declared homestead and prior encumbrances was by levy of writ of execution.smith james merrill,supra,at,d.since a declared homestead was beyond the reach of creditors judgment liens,no such lien could attach,a transfer of the homestead property was not a fraudulent conveyance.montgomery bullock cal d.current law continues to protect declared homesteads from judgment liens see witkin,cal.procedure ed.enforcement of judgment,with the exception that a judgment lien may now attach to a declared homestead in the amount of any surplus over the total of prior liens and encumbrances plus the amount of the homestead exemption,subd.c smith james merrill,supra,at,d.
in contrast,the automatic homestead exemption does not prevent the attachment of judgment liens against a dwelling reddy,supra,th at,d,but affords protection when a judgment creditor seeks a sale of the dwelling after a notice of levy.see amin khazindar th,d the automatic homestead only entitles the debtor to protection from a forced execution sale.a hearing is held at that time to confirm whether the dwelling is exempt as a homestead,and to determine the amount of the exemption and the fair market value of the property,subd.b.at the hearing,the court will order the sale of the dwelling,subject to the homestead exemption,unless the court determines that the sale of the dwelling would not be likely to produce a bid sufficient to satisfy any part of the amount due on the judgment pursuant to section,subd.b.under section,unless a bid exceeds the amount of the homestead exemption plus all liens and encumbrances on the property,the homestead shall not be sold and shall be released and is not thereafter subject to a court order for sale upon subsequent application by the same judgment creditor for a period of one year,subd.a see rourke troy th,d,fn.omitted the bid must exceed the amount of the homestead and the balance due on the deed of trust,and after the defendant wife receives her share,there must be some amount remaining to partially satisfy the plaintiffs judgments.
fidelity argues,based on reddy,that since a lien securing its judgment would have attached to the fresno property but for the fraudulent conveyance,fidelity was prejudiced by that conveyance,even though it could not have immediately forced a sale of the property that would have resulted in satisfaction of any portion of the judgment.fidelity notes that if its judgment lien had attached,fidelity could have waited for the property to appreciate in value before seeking a sale.gordon counters,based on mehrtash,that unless the transfer puts beyond reach property that fidelity could presently subject to payment of the debt,in a sale,there is no injury under the ufta,and further,that fidelity can not show the transfer resulted in injury by speculating about possible future appreciation.we conclude that gordon position is the correct one.
first,mehrtash rightly affirmed the longstanding principle that is an essential element of a claim under the ufta mehrtash,supra,th at,d,and we follow that principle in the present case.a creditor has not been injured unless the transfer puts beyond reach property the creditor could subject to payment of his or her debt.haskins certified escrow mtge.d.the trial court below correctly held there was no injury to fidelity because a sale of the fresno property would not have satisfied any portion of the judgment.moreover,we reject fidelity position that the injury element may be determined based on speculation about possible future appreciation of the property.
second,the injury requirement is built into the express terms of the ufta,which not only require that we exclude prior encumbrances from the definition of asset for the purpose of determining if a fraudulent transfer of an asset occurred,but also property to the extent it is generally exempt under nonbankruptcy law,subd.a,italics added.we believe the automatic homestead protection is such an exemption.the automatic homestead exemption and the declared homestead exemption are contained in the chapter of the enforcement of judgment law that specifically addresses exemptions.see tit,div,ch.of code civ,including.section,subdivision a,states the rule that unless otherwise provided by statute,t he exemptions provided by this chapter or by any other statute apply to all procedures for enforcement of a money judgment.in section,pertaining to homestead exemptions including the automatic homestead exemption,it clearly states that a homestead is exempt from sale under this division the enforcement of judgment law to the extent provided in section,subd.a,italics added.thus,the legislature has plainly categorized the automatic homestead protection as an exemption we conclude that in the ufta definition of what constitutes an asset,the exclusion therein of exempt property was intended to include the exemption applicable to a dwelling under the automatic homestead exemption.accordingly,the trial court correctly applied the law when it considered the automatic homestead exemption in evaluating fidelity claim under the ufta 
we reject fidelity contention that the holding in reddy precluded the trial court in the instant case from considering the automatic homestead exemption on the issue of whether any injury occurred for purposes of fidelity claim under the ufta.reddy accurately observed that a judgment lien attaches against a debtor residential property notwithstanding the automatic homestead exemption,and that a judgment creditor may apply for a forced sale of the property.in these respects,as reddy acknowledged,the dwelling is not insulated from creditors as was largely the case under the former declared homestead law,and thus a transfer of such dwelling is subject to being set aside as a fraudulent conveyance under the ufta.however,reddy did not directly address the issue of or the definition of asset in the ufta,which excludes exempt property.c ases are not authority for propositions not considered therein.roberts city of palmdale cal th,d.in any event,to the extent reddy may be read as holding that the automatic homestead exemption can not be considered in connection with determining whether there was injury or whether an asset was transferred,we respectfully disagree.
rather,we reiterate and adopt the following language of the mehrtash opinion even assuming the allegedly fraudulent conveyance were set aside and the property were hypothetically available to enforce the plaintiff money judgment,it could not be sold without a court order because it is the debtor dwelling,and could not be sold without a minimum bid equal to all encumbrances and senior liens plus the homestead exemption.citations.the p laintiff produced no evidence that the value of the property could support any net recovery for her in the event the conveyance were set aside.mehrtash,supra,th at,d.here,likewise,the evidence at trial showed that fidelity could not have obtained any net recovery if the transfer were set aside and a forced sale of the property was sought 
we conclude that the trial court applied the correct legal standard,its decision was supported by the evidence,and no error has been shown.the trial court conclusion that fidelity had no right to set aside the transfer under the ufta is accordingly affirmed.
ii.the resulting trust cause of action 
fidelity also claims the trial court erred in denying relief under the resulting trust cause of action.we begin with a brief summary of the nature of a resulting trust.
a resulting trust arises by operation of law from a transfer of property under circumstances showing that the transferee was not intended to take the beneficial interest.citations.such a resulting trust carries out and enforces the inferred intent of the parties.citations.lloyds bank california wells fargo bank d.it has been termed an trust,to distinguish it from the other type of implied trust,the constructive or trust.the resulting trust carries out the inferred intent of the parties the constructive trust defeats or prevents the wrongful act of one of them.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts,see also calistoga civic club city of calistoga d.a resulting trust is,like the constructive trust,a creature of equity.it differs from an express trust in that it arises by operation of law,from the particular facts and circumstances,and thus it is not essential to prove an express or written agreement to enforce such a trust.witkin,supra,d trusts.the trustee has no duties to perform,no trust to administer and no purpose to carry out except the single task of holding onto or conveying the property to the beneficiary.bainbridge stoner cal d,citing fulton jansen cal,trusts,bogert on trusts trustees.
here,fidelity complaint alleged that gordon conveyance of the fresno property to toni was intended only as a transfer of legal title,which she held as trustee for gordon,and that gordon retained his equitable interest in the property.following trial of the case,the trial court rejected fidelity resulting trust theory solely on legal grounds,not on factual grounds specifically,the trial court ruled that because fidelity did not claim it was entitled to a interest in the property but only sought to impose a judgment lien on gordon alleged interest in the property,fidelity failed to state a cause of action for a resulting trust.since the trial court denied the resulting trust cause of action on said legal grounds,it did not make factual findings regarding gordon and toni intent with respect to legal and equitable title for purposes of the alleged resulting trust.
fidelity contends the trial court legal conclusion barring relief was in error.fidelity points out that a judgment lien attaches to all interests in real property,including equitable interests,subd.a,and therefore the trial court should have recognized under a resulting trust theory that gordon retained an equitable interest in the fresno property,thereby allowing fidelity abstract of judgment recorded on october,to attach as a lien against gordon equitable interest.
as support for the legal viability of its position,fidelity relies on valente,supra,a federal court of appeals decision that carefully analyzed the doctrine of resulting trust under rhode island common law and held that a creditor may pursue a resulting trust theory in the manner suggested by fidelity as a form of common law,equitable relief that would supplement the state ufta.valente,supra,at.valente gave legal effect to the inferred intent of the debtor as transferor and his son as transferee by declaring under a resulting trust analysis that the debtor retained his equitable interest in the property,thus the creditor prior execution lien was deemed to have attached to the debtor equitable interest.id.at.in effect,the creditor was allowed to step into the debtor shoes for the purpose of establishing the existence of a resulting trust in order to allow the creditor execution lien to attach to the debtor equitable interest in the property.the equitable interest found by the courts in these cases sufficed to provide the creditors relief from the debtors fraudulent attempts to avoid attachment.id.at.
