for many years,american express has offered credit cards in the color of money.when it added a blue card during the,trademark litigation erupted.the blue cross and blue shield association uses a blue card with a registered blue card service mark for its insurance and related products it maintained that american express blue card would be confused with its offerings.a settlement was reached in american express acknowledged the association senior rights in the term blue card and promised not to use the word blue in connection with any or insurance products.it also promised not to refer to its customers as blue cardholders the association agreed that in promotional materials american express could use blue credit cardholder or a similar expression as long as a word separates blue from card.paragraph of the agreement,now the bone of contention,reads in full american express shall not use the word blue on its credit cards.
the settlement provided that the association would dismiss its suit with prejudice but that the district court will retain jurisdiction to enforce this agreement in the event of an allegation of its breach.a provision of this sort logically implies entry of a consent decree,for the settlement contemplates undertakings.instead,however,the court dismissed the suit and asserted a right to enforce the settlement.the only pertinent language is this court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter for purposes of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement.
the district court did not set out those terms,so the order did not serve as an injunction under.d.thus when the association contended that in american express reneged on its promise by issuing a blue credit card prominently emblazoned blue cash,american express denied that the district court declaration of intent to retain jurisdiction had any effect.relying on kokkonen guardian life insurance,d,american express maintained that a district court may retain jurisdiction only by incorporating the settlement into a judgment.see lynch samatamason,cir dictum to the effect that incorporation is essential engle foley lardner,llp,cir same but see hill baxter healthcare,cir dictum to the effect that a bare declaration of intent to retain jurisdiction suffices.
the district judge sought to secure its jurisdiction by amending the judgment.although the time for revision under.b had long passed,and the sort of arguments the association advanced would not have justified resort to rule b anyway,see gonzalez crosby,d,a clerical error may be corrected at any time under.a.the judge declared the order failure to incorporate the settlement terms to have been a clerical error and purported to correct that error by entering a new judgment reading in full nunc pro tunc,the stipulated motion for dismissal with prejudice,pursuant to frcp a,and with each party bearing its own costs and attorney fees is granted.the parties are directed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement,which is hereby incorporated into the judgment.the court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement.see.
neither the district judge nor the parties paid any attention to the fact that the revised judgment,which is a form of injunction the parties are directed to comply,still does not satisfy rule d,which provides among other things every order granting an injunction shall be specific in terms shall describe in reasonable detail,and not by reference to the complaint or other document,the act or acts sought to be restrained emphasis added.nor does the amended order satisfy lynch.if the order failure to spell out the enforceable terms is a jurisdictional defect,the order is no better.but kokkonen and lynch were not the main hurdles rule d was.it is an old rule,easy to understand and easy to follow that it should be ignored repeatedly by both the judge and counsel in commercial litigation is unfathomable.see dupuy samuels,cir.disdain for this simple requirement,compliance with which would have made the continuation of federal jurisdiction clear,has led to years of complex,costly,and wasteful maneuvering.
as soon as the district court amended the judgment in,american express filed a notice of appeal,which was docketed as.it insisted that rule a does not authorize a change in the,far from being a clerical error,used precisely the language that the district judge had instructed the clerk to employ.there may have been a legal association and the district judge failed to appreciate kokkonen rule a can not be used to change language that was poorly chosen,as opposed to incorrectly transcribed.see united states griffin,cir.the past can not be rewritten rule a allows a court to correct records to show what was done,rather than change them to reflect what should have been done.the association nonetheless defended the district court decision and asked us to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,contending that it was interlocutory the only point of the amendment was to set up a hearing on the association motion for enforcement and,if not interlocutory,that the time to appeal had expired in.
while the parties prepared and filed the normal set of appellate briefs,plus supplemental jurisdictional memoranda at the court direction,the district court proceeded with the hearing.once again both the district court and the parties seemed oblivious to an important procedural rule a notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over the issues presented on the appeal.see,griggs provident consumer discount,d.there is an exception for frivolous interlocutory appeals,see apostol gallion,cir,but to use this exception the district judge must certify that the appeal is frivolous and allow the aggrieved party time to seek a stay from the appellate court.the association,which had contended that the appeal was outside our jurisdiction,did not avail itself of this procedure.at the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing the district court found a that american express had not violated of the agreement,and b that relief would be barred by laches even if a violation had been established.dist.lexis.
at this point the parties nimbly switched positions in,then only a few days away from oral argument so that three judges already had invested substantial work on the appeal.american express proposed to dismiss its appeal in order to reap the benefit of victory in the district if we were to accept its argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction,the decision would be vacated and the parties would have to start over in state court.for its part,the association,which had supported the rule a order,now cast about for ways to restart the litigation.because the association did not agree to the it asked for attorneys fees on the theory that the appeal had been court was entitled to impose conditions.fed.b.to ensure that the parties did not adopt inconsistent positions before a new panel assigned to the second appeal which the association was sure to file we conditioned dismissal of the first appeal on the parties undertaking to address in the second appeal a series of jurisdictional questions.
by the time the association appeal had been briefed,this court began to wonder what the fight had been about.when the parties are citizens of the same state,or the stakes are less than,then only an exercise of the supplemental jurisdiction allows federal litigation to enforce a financial settlement of a case under the jurisdiction as the association trademark suit was.the parties and the district court had devoted substantial energy to the question whether their disagreement about the blue cash logo may be resolved under the supplemental jurisdiction.yet the stakes substantially exceed,and a check of public records led this court to conclude that the parties are of diverse indeed the association complaint had alleged.
so the court directed the parties to file memoranda addressing still more jurisdictional questions,including the availability of jurisdiction under.the parties agree that complete diversity exists.american express insists that the association had to file a fresh suit under the diversity j
