roger moore and several were cast in judgment in march,the judgment by the united states district court for the district of south carolina the rendering court.although he did not appeal that judgment,two of his did,and it was affirmed.moore now appeals from a judgment rendered a decade later by the district court for the western district of louisiana,denying moore motion to dismiss two petitions filed simultaneously on march,by home port rentals,home port,the successful plaintiff in the rendering court which sought to register and enforce the judgment in the district court for the western district of louisiana the registration court,and declaring the judgment enforceable in the western district of louisiana until april,the tenth anniversary of the judgment finality on appeal.we affirm the registration court denial of moore motion to dismiss we modify that court declaration of enforceability in the western district of louisiana by changing the commencement date of the applicable period of limitation louisiana liberative prescription for enforcement of judgments from april,the date that the judgment was affirmed by the fourth circuit to march,the date it was registered in the registration court and,as thus modified,we affirm the registration court declaration of enforceability of the judgment in the western district of louisiana.
facts and proceedings 
in,the rendering court held moore and his liable to home port for in compensatory damages and in punitive damages for securities fraud,common law fraud,and breach of contract.by an order dated march,and entered march,the rendering court directed its clerk of court to enter judgment for home port,which the clerk did on march.this judgment,the judgment,was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit,and that court mandate issued on april.ultimately,the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari.
fast forward to.on march of that days shy of the tenth anniversary of the rendering court entry of the port simultaneously filed two petitions in the registration court.one seeks registration of a foreign judgment,pursuant to the other seeks to enforce that judgment in the western district of louisiana.
after moore filed a motion to dismiss home port two petitions,the registration court referred the case to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation,which was prepared and filed in due course.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny moore motion to dismiss home port petitions and that the court declare the judgment enforceable in the western district of louisiana until april,years after the issuance of the fourth circuit mandate affirming the appealed judgment.
both moore and home port filed written objections to the magistrate judge recommendations.moore faulted the report for failing to apply louisiana civil code in its entirety and for finding the judgment enforceable until april,rather than until march,only.moore contended that the earlier date,years after the judgment was entered by the rendering court,was the last date on which south carolina law would permit that judgment to be enforced,regardless of appeal,insisting that south carolina law should control 
home port objection criticized only the magistrate judge legal conclusion that the running of louisiana prescriptive period for an action to enforce a registered judgment commenced to run on the day the underlying judgment was affirmed on appeal.home port contended that louisiana liberative prescription,which applies to money judgments in federal district courts located in the state,commences to run not from either the date on which the original judgment was entered in the rendering court or the date on which it was affirmed on appeal,but from the date it was registered in the registration court.specifically,home port faulted the report conclusion that,for purposes of enforcement in the registration court district,registration under is not governed by the same prescriptive period as would be applicable to a plenary judgment of a federal district court grounded on a foreign judgment and that rather than louisiana law governs the commencement date for the running of prescription on a judgment of the registration court.
over those objections,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and ruled accordingly.moore timely filed a notice of appeal,and home port timely filed such a notice for its.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the denial of moore dismissal motion de novo as the material facts of this case are undisputed,the issues presented on appeal,including interpretation of state and federal statutes and jurisprudence,and determining which among those are applicable,are issues of law so we also review them de novo 
background 
when,on march,the rendering court money judgment was registered in the registration court,it was still live applicable south carolina law likewise,as of its registration on march,the judgment would still have been enforceable under louisiana law thus,at a time when it remained enforceable in both the rendering and the registration jurisdictions,the judgment was registered,and enforcement proceedings were commenced execution issue d in south carolina the registration court.even if measured from the entry date of march,and not the date of finality under louisiana law or,neither state bar date had yet arrived when registration was accomplished.
the judgment was registered pursuant to,which provides for the registration of one federal district court money judgment in another federal district court as the precursor to enforcement of the original judgment in the latter court prior to the adoption of,a judgment creditor from one federal district court who wanted to enforce a money judgment in another district had to bring suit in the other federal district court and obtain a new judgment of the second court a.section was enacted in large part to assist judgment creditors by making it possible for them to pursue the property of a debtor in satisfaction of a judgment by the ordinary process of levying execution on a judgment in any district where the judgment is registered.an express reason for congress enacting was to spare creditors and debtors alike both the additional costs and harassment of further litigation which would otherwise be required by way of an action on the judgment in a district court other than that where the judgment was originally obtained.thus,the question we are asked today is strictly for purposes of enforcement within the registration court district,precisely what are the effects of registration of a money judgment that is still enforceable in the rendering court district as well as in the district where registered 
we are aware of no supreme court authority on point,and of very little pertinent jurisprudence from federal appellate or district courts still,we are not wholly without jurisprudential guidance.the landmark case in this area is stanford utley,authored by judge later justice blackmun for the eighth circuit court of appeals the stanford court was called on to consider the enforceability,in a federal district court in missouri,of a judgment that had been rendered by a federal district court in mississippi,then registered the next day,pursuant to,in a federal district court in missouri.obviously,then,the judgment from mississippi had been registered in missouri at a time when that judgment was still enforceable in both mississippi and missouri.the kicker in stanford is that,following registration pursuant to,no proceedings to enforce the registered judgment from mississippi were instituted in missouri until more than seven years after that judgment had been rendered in mississippi and registered in missouri.in the meantime,mississippi statute of limitations for enforcing judgments in that thus in federal courts located expired but missouri limitation period had not.
in concluding that the expiration of the rendering state statute of limitations for enforcement of judgments had no effect on enforcement proceedings commenced in the court of registration at a time when the registration state statute of limitations for enforcement of judgments had not yet expired,the stanford court recapped its analysis with the following pronouncement 
we have concluded that is more than ministerial and is more than a mere procedural device for the collection of the foreign judgment.we feel that registration provides,so far as enforcement is concerned,the equivalent of a new judgment of the registration court.in other words for enforcement purposes,the registration state federal registration equated with a new registration state federal judgment on the original rendering state federal judgment,that is,it is no different than a judgment timely obtained by action in the registration state federal court on that rendering state judgment 
stanford express recognition of the applicability of missouri statute of limitations and the inapplicability of mississippi,for purposes of enforcement in missouri,underpins that court holding that,as far as enforcement in the registration court district is concerned,a live judgment duly registered there is the full legal equivalent of a.
this holding in stanford makes obvious the legal truism that once a money judgment of the rendering court is timely registered in another district court pursuant to at a time when enforcement of that judgment is not in either jurisdiction,the subsequent expiration of the rendering court statute of limitations has no effect whatsoever on enforcement of the judgment in the district of the registration court.after registration,time of enforcement is controlled solely by the statute of limitations of the state where the registration court is domiciled.
we have neither been cited to a case nor found any on our own that questions stanford holding that,when a money judgment rendered in one federal district court is registered in another federal district court at a time when the original judgment is still enforceable under the laws of both states,registration truly is the equivalent of a new judgment of the registration court for purposes of enforcement in the registration district.that the registered judgment might not be congruent with a new judgment of the registration court for every purpose other than possibility recognized in stanford and of no moment to the instant inquiry.we are concerned with only the narrow,question,which state statute of limitations applies for enforcement purposes in the registration court,and when does that state applicable limitation period for enforcement in the registration court start to run 
we have not previously addressed this precise question,but in our otherwise distinguishable case of united states kellum we expressed agreement with stanford core pronouncements.after quoting stanford holding that r egistration provides the equivalent of a new judgment of the registration court and is no different than a judgment timely obtained by action in the registration court on the rendering court judgment,we stated in kellum that w e agree with the holding in stanford there,we admittedly in dicta voiced our approbation of stanford recognition that,for purposes of enforcement,registration is the equivalent of a new judgment of the registration court.kellum even states that,despite agreement with stanford holding,it is inapposite to the precise issue presented in kellum.nevertheless,stanford remains good law lo these years and,unlike in kellum which dealt with a judgment in favor of the united states that was exempt from the local statute of limitations,is pertinent to the issue we decide today.
enforceability 
the first prong of the question here presented is not seriously challenged on appeal,nor was it in the district court.section concludes with the statement that a judgment so registered shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.specifically,none here seriously question that,particularly when read in context with stanford,includes applicability of the registration court limitation period among same effects,or that such period is an integral element of the like manner for enforcing both registered judgments and new judgments of the registration court.as the stanford case holds,if a judgment is properly registered in one state,it may be enforced within the limitation period of that state even though the time for enforcement has run in the rendering state.moore contention that south carolina statute of he insists expired ten years after entry of the judgment,on march,and not ten years after it was affirmed on thus clearly specious.even more specious is moore suggestion that south carolina statute of limitations had any effect on enforcement of the judgment in the western district of louisiana once that judgment was timely registered there.
our inquiry does not end,however,with our determination that louisiana liberative prescription on enforcement of the judgment in the western district of louisiana is the applicable limitation law.we must also determine when louisiana prescription clock started to tick was it on march,when the judgment was entered,as moore contends,or april,when the fourth circuit mandate affirming that judgment issued,as the district court held,or march,when the judgment was registered in the registration court,as home port contends this issue was not raised in stanford because the judgment at issue there was registered in missouri only one day after it was rendered in mississippi.section strongly implies the answer by equating the registered judgment with a new judgment of the registration does stanford and even our opinion in kellum,at least enforcement.but,one federal circuit court has addressed and answered the question directly marx go publishing,
in marx,the ninth circuit couched the issue precisely as whether registration under creates a new judgment for statute of limitations purposes,giving the ten years in that case,the registration state period of limitation from the date of registration in which to satisfy the judgment.analogizing to california sister state foreign money judgments act the marx court found that statute to be the state analog of and noted that california limitation period runs anew from the time of registration,provided the judgment is not then and the other requisites of the statute are fulfilled thus,in the only circuit that has squarely held just when it is that the statute of limitations applicable to registered judgments commences to run,the date on which a live judgment is registered was determined to be the appropriate date,irrespective of the date of entry of the underlying judgment or the date it became final.
despite the magistrate judge report and recommendation rejection of marx as instructive on the ground that its reasoning is extended by analogy to the registration state statute governing enforcement of foreign judgments rather than by analogy to that state statute of limitations on enforcement of domestic judgments,we find marx quite persuasive.moreover,we are reluctant to create a circuit split by holding differently,particularly when we agree with the ninth circuit holding despite getting there via a slightly different route.given the pronouncements in marx stanford and kellum and the plain language of,we join the ninth circuit in holding that when a money judgment is rendered in a federal district court located in one state,and is duly registered in a district court located in another state,at a time when enforcement of that judgment is not in either state,the applicable limitation law for purposes of enforcement of the registered judgment in the registration district is that of the registration,louisiana liberative it starts to run on the date of registration.
this accords with the stanford court further statement 
it seems to be conceded that the purposes of were to simplify and facilitate the enforcement of federal judgments,at least those for money,to eliminate the necessity and expense of a second lawsuit,and to avoid the impediments,such as diversity of citizenship,which new and distinct federal litigation might otherwise encounter 
thus,once a money judgment of a federal district court in one state is re
