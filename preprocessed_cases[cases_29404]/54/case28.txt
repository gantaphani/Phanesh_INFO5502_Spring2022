this appeal raises issues concerning the release of security when an appellant has previously been ordered to post that security as a condition for obtaining an injunction pending appeal.see.c.in this case,the district court released the security after this court had rejected the appeal and dissolved the injunction.
we affirm the district court release of million in security to appellee verizon new england,verizon,over the protests of appellant global naps,gnaps.in order to maintain the status quo pending appeal,verizon had been enjoined from terminating its services to gnaps for failure to pay access fees gnaps,in turn,had been ordered to provide security for the costs and damages verizon would incur during the period of the injunction.our analysis construes federal rule of civil procedure c and adopts standards for the release of security under this rule.
background 
this marks the third time that aspects of this dispute have appeared in our court.see global naps,verizon new,gnaps i,cir,cert.denied,d global naps,verizon new,gnaps ii,cir.the parties underlying litigation pertains to gnaps failure to make payments to verizon,notwithstanding a december order from the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte which required these payments.as reflected in a subsequent interconnection agreement between verizon and gnaps,the dte order had required gnaps to pay verizon for virtual nxx vnxx calls originated by verizon massachusetts customers and delivered to gnaps see gnaps ii,at.
in gnaps i,we rejected a particular argument from gnaps that it did not need to comply with the dte december order.see gnaps i,at.this resolved only part of the dispute.in gnaps ii,we rejected gnaps remaining arguments that the dte rulings conflicted with and were preempted by federal law,and so we affirmed the dte order.see gnaps ii,at.the current dispute pertains to a security posted after our decision in gnaps i,and which was released to verizon after our decision in gnaps ii.
a.the remand after gnaps i 
after our ruling in gnaps i,verizon notified gnaps on march,that gnaps had accrued more than million in access charges excluding late payment charges.verizon further informed gnaps that it would terminate services to gnaps on april,if payments were not made.the companies later agreed to postpone the termination date to may,in order to explore settlement possibilities.when the settlement discussions failed,gnaps moved for a tro preliminary injunction to prevent disconnection while it litigated the gnaps ii case.see id.at.
on may,the district court indicated that it would maintain the status quo pending a resolution on the merits of gnaps preemption argument the court stated at a hearing that it would grant gnaps motion,subject to gnaps posting appropriate security.on june,the court entered the preliminary injunction which gnaps had requested,conditioned on gnaps providing security in the amount of million a condition that gnaps fulfilled.the court also expedited the briefing schedule for the parties for summary judgment.on september,the district court denied gnaps motion for partial summary judgment,and it granted verizon and the dte for partial summary judgment.
in light of its success in the district court,verizon again notified gnaps this time by letter dated september,that it would soon terminate service for.gnaps sought clarification from the district court on whether the preliminary injunction had been dissolved by the court opinion,and the court confirmed that its decision had that effect.gnaps then stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of its remaining challenges to the dte decision,thereby freeing gnaps to pursue an appeal.
gnaps ii and the injunction pending appeal 
gnaps next sought an injunction pending appeal,first from the district court,and then from this court,in order to prevent verizon from terminating service.see id.at.gnaps represented to both courts that without such an injunction it would suffer a fatal revenue loss,and in its motion to this court it characterized the litigation as an dispute.gnaps also represented that it had offered to pay verizon,over time,the more than million verizon claimed was now due,which gnaps asserted would fully pay the access charges,if verizon prevails here.that offer,according to gnaps,required only that verizon agree to refrain from cutting off service,and agree to return the sums paid if gnaps prevailed on appeal.
the district court denied gnaps request for additional injunctive relief.but this court granted gnaps motion on november,and we enjoined verizon from terminating service pending gnaps appeal.this injunction was contingent on gnaps providing additional security in an amount to be set by the district court,and we remanded the issue of the amount and form of the security.in the district court,gnaps proposed that the court set the million gnaps had already posted as security for the first the amount of.gnaps further stated that it would post that amount by assigning funds that verizon affiliates,most of which operated in other states and were not parties to the underlying suit,had withheld from gnaps or its affiliates to secure debts in what verizon claims are unrelated disputes.not coincidentally,those withheld funds totaled.
the district court ordered gnaps to post an additional million in security.this was roughly million less than the in additional security that gnaps had itself proposed as appropriate.over verizon objection,the district court also permitted gnaps to satisfy that requirement by assigning funds withheld by verizon affiliates.
on april,this court issued its ruling on the merits in gnaps ii,and we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment.see id.at.this court rejected gnaps claim that the federal communications commission,in a decision known as the isp remand order,had altered the preexisting intercarrier payment rules for all calls delivered to isps.we instead agreed with verizon that the isp remand order preempted payment rules only for calls where the caller and the isp are located in the same local calling area.see id.at.
dissolution of the injunction and release of the security 
on april,verizon moved this court to issue its mandate in gnaps ii early in the alternative,it asked for an order lifting the injunction pending appeal,as either relief would permit verizon to terminate services to gnaps for of access charges.
gnaps opposed verizon motion on april.it contended for the first time that if access charges were due at all,gnaps actually owed verizon only about million in total damages in the case.this amount was far less than the million gnaps had earlier offered to pay verizon,and was also lower than the million in security that gnaps had previously posted.gnaps new argument was that the fcc isp remand order capped verizon access charges for vnxx calls to isps at per minute.
we granted verizon motion in part,vacating the injunction pending appeal later that same day,april,
after this court vacated the injunction,and still on april,verizon moved in the district court for the release of the million in security.its motion was supported by affidavits evidencing that the harm to verizon from issuance of the injunction exceeded million.
on may,the day gnaps opposition to verizon motion was due in the district court,gnaps moved for leave to oppose that motion only after this court issued its mandate in gnaps ii.until that happened,gnaps contended,the district court lacked jurisdiction.gnaps requested that the district court give it leave to submit the grounds for its opposition three days after the district court regains jurisdiction upon issuance of the mandate.verizon opposed gnaps motion on may,contending that the mandate issuance was not necessary for the district court to release the security.
gnaps did file an opposition in the district court on may,contesting verizon motion for release of security.gnaps continued to press its argument that the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider verizon motion until after this court mandate had issued.gnaps also made three substantive arguments that release of the security was improper because this court injunction pending appeal had not expressly stated that the amount gnaps posted is for payment for such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by the enjoined party,if found to have been wrongfully enjoined that this court dissolution of the injunction pending appeal did not compel the conclusion that verizon had been wrongfully enjoined and that due process entitled gnaps to a full and fair opportunity to litigate the invoice amounts that verizon had used as evidence of its harm from the injunction.gnaps provided little elaboration of,and no affidavit support for,its arguments disputing verizon proof 
on may,this court issued its mandate in gnaps ii.that same day,gnaps filed a motion in the district court seeking leave until may,to file a motion for an evidentiary hearing and discovery.the next day,may,the district court granted verizon previously filed motion and ordered the release to verizon of the full million in security.simultaneously,the court issued an order denying gnaps may motion for leave to wait until issuance of the mandate in order to oppose verizon request for the security,but granting gnaps may motion.
gnaps responded with two more motions in the district court.on may,gnaps moved for a stay of the district court order releasing the security.but on may,the district court clerk office released the security to verizon,mooting the motion.then,on may,gnaps moved for reconsideration of the district court may order,styling its motion as one seeking the return of property previously deposited in c ourt,and also requesting discovery and an evidentiary hearing.gnaps also,for the first time in the district court,attached two affidavits to its motion.the affidavit of michael couture purported to demonstrate that gnaps owed verizon only for access charges accrued during the pendency of the two injunctions.the affidavit of robert fox was to similar effect.the district court denied gnaps motion on june.
gnaps separately appealed two of the district court orders its may order granting the release of security,and its june order denying gnaps request for reconsideration.this court consolidated those appeals.
these consolidated appeals embody the latest efforts by gnaps to delay or avoid payment of the sums past due to verizon.the district court rejected those efforts and so do we.
ii.gnaps mandate argument 
gnaps first argument is procedural it contends that the district court could not act on verizon motion to release the security until the mandate issued in gnaps ii.see united states ferris,cir explaining that during the pendency of an appeal,a district court lacks jurisdiction to proceed with respect to any matters involved in the appeal.the district court implicitly found that it had jurisdiction to act as it did,and we review that conclusion de novo.see hulsey,cir.
the short answer to gnaps argument is that the district court in fact did not act to release any funds until after the mandate was issued.if there is anything to gnaps argument,it can not be that the district court lacked jurisdiction to release the funds.rather,gnaps only plausible grievance can be with the fact that the district court accepted verizon arguably premature motion,an acceptance which then triggered an impending deadline for gnaps to respond.
we see no jurisdictional problem with the district court acceptance of verizon motion.there are some exceptions to the rule that only one court at a time has jurisdiction,such as for transparently frivolous appeals,see,united states brooks,cir,certain modifications of forfeiture orders,see united states hurley,cir,and the posting of a supersedeas bond,see trs.of the chi.truck drivers,helpers warehouse workers union indep.pension fund cent,cir,among other ancillary matters.as these examples illustrate,and as the seventh circuit has recognized,the proposition that only one court at a time has jurisdiction is a qualified rule designed to prevent conflict among tribunals,as well as to prevent the waste of time and money that occurs if a court changes a judgment while a case is pending in another court.mutual ins.united states,cir see also hurley,at explaining that the purpose of the rule is to avoid interference and inconsistency,and suggesting that it is unwise to extend this rule further than its own rationale.
the key point of verizon april motion was that it sought to demonstrate its damages from the injunction.that damages calculation involved no conflict with the appeal that was still technically pending in this court.
gnaps nonetheless contends that verizon motion did present a conflict,because irrespective of the amount of damages,gnaps could not be deemed liable on the security until it was determined that gnaps in fact owed access charges to issue that gnaps says was pending in this court until we issued the mandate in gnaps ii.but we had vacated the injunction before the mandate issued there was no realistic potential conflict.gnaps could have been expected to treat gnaps ii as good law,notwithstanding the ministerial fact that the mandate had not yet issued.wedbush,noble,cooke,sec,cir explaining that a court of appeals decision has stare decisis effect even before the mandate issues in a case.it is well established in this circuit that a district court can proceed,notwithstanding the technical pendency of an appeal,when it is clear that the appeal constitutes a transparently frivolous attempt to impede the progress of the case.brooks,at.by like token,the district court could easily have concluded that gnaps procedural objection its refusal to contest verizon calculations until the mandate issued was an effort to delay.
if we thought that gnaps had been disadvantaged somehow by the district court acceptance of verizon filing on april,after we had vacated the injunction,that might be another issue although not a jurisdictional one.but gnaps was well aware from the date of our decision in gnaps ii,april,that it most likely would have to pay up on the security it had posted.gnaps had adequate time to prepare its evidence and argument,and in fact it had over three weeks to prepare the opposition it did file on may.
iii.compliance with rule c 
gnaps next argues that the district court failed to comply with the federal rules when it released the full million in security to verizon.
a.the legal backdrop 
we start our analysis with the basic law.the security was given,under federal rule of civil procedure c,upon the issuance of a preliminary injunction which restrained verizon from terminating service to gnaps pending the appeal in gnaps ii.rule c states 
no restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant,in such sum as the court deems proper,for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.no such security shall be required of the united states or of an officer or agency thereof.
the provisions of rule apply to a surety upon a bond or undertaking under this rule.
the terms of rule c do not,in so many words,explicitly discuss how dissolution of the injunction affects payment of the security.but the rule does implicitly address this when it states that the security is held for payment of costs and damages suffered by a party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined.see capital dev,cir.the implication is that when a party has been wrongfully enjoined,it may collect some or all of the security.
our understanding of rule c is also informed by the fact that if a bond had been posted as the security,recovery would be governed by rule.rule in turn provides a summary procedure for the enforcement of liability against a surety.see.such enforcement may be done on motion,without the need for filing an independent action.id.although the terms of rule apply only to sureties,courts have applied that rule procedures when imposing liability on a principal as well.see,at.the key inference is that when an injunction does cause damages,the principal or the surety is normally required to pay the damages,at least up to the limit of the bond.id.
the operation of rule is also informative rule grants the district court power to protect an enforceable judgment,which includes the power to protect the winner from any subsequent harm suffered through appellate delay.perez,united states,cir quoting redding russwine constr.our situation is analogous to security issued under rule,insofar as the preliminary injunction was issued to preserve the status quo,and gnaps was required to post security pending appeal.
the fifth circuit,in continuum incepts,cir,has provided a generally accepted explanation of the purposes served by requiring security pending appeal pursuant to rule c 
i t assures the enjoined party that it may readily collect damages from the funds posted or the surety provided in the event that it was wrongfully enjoined,without further litigation and without regard to the possible insolvency of the assured,and it provides the plaintiff with notice of the maximum extent of its potential liability,since the amount of the bond is the limit of the damages the defendant can obtain for a wrongful injunction,provided the plaintiff was acting in good faith.
id.at footnote omitted omissions in original quoting,at see also sprint commc ns cat commc ns int l,cir note,security for interlocutory injunctions under rule c exceptions to the rule gone awry,hastings.the important points are that the security is generally destined for a wrongfully enjoined party,and also that the party seeking the injunction has had fair notice of the costs that are likely to be paid for the injunction issuance 
these principles have important implications for the dispute before us.this court previously determined that an injunction was appropriate to preserve the status quo pending appeal,in light of gnaps argument that it would be forced out of business unless an injunction was entered.gnaps made a business judgment that it was willing to incur the cost of a possibly wrongful injunction in order to take its appeal.yet gnaps now seeks to avoid payment of most of the security which had been entered to secure verizon against the injunction.
before explaining why gnaps can not avoid this payment,we clarify one more important point about the applicable law.what is at issue in this case is not security for the payment of damages on an ultimate judgment on the merits.rather,we are concerned with security issued for interim harms suffered by an appellee,when the appellee has been enjoined in order to preserve the status quo pending appeal.as justice stevens explained in edgar mite,d 
since a preliminary injunction may be granted on a mere probability of success on the merits,generally the moving party must demonstrate confidence in his legal position by posting bond in an amount sufficient to protect his adversary from loss in the event that future proceedings prove that the injunction issued wrongfully.the bond,in effect,is the moving party warranty that the law will uphold the issuance of the injunction.
id.at.stevens,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment footnote omitted see also northeast airlines,nationwide charters conventions,cir explaining that a security issued under rule c protects against damages suffered by reason of the wrongfulness of a preliminary injunction.both gnaps and verizon agree that the security in this case was designed to protect verizon from the interim harms caused by the injunction.
b.the district court compliance 
with these background principles of law clarified,we consider the parties areas of contention.gnaps presents three categories of arguments.first,gnaps argues that the district court made no finding,as required by rule c,that verizon was wrongfully enjoined.second,gnaps argues that verizon has not shown its entitlement to the full security.third,gnaps asserts it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to contest verizon claimed damages.
wrongfully enjoined 
on the first point,gnaps basic proposition is that under rule c,an injunction can not be wrongful unless it is shown that issuance of the injunction was an abuse of discretion at the time it was issued.almost every other circuit to have considered this issue has rejected gnaps interpretation.see sprint,at nintendo of,lewis galoob toys,cir blumenthal merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir atomic oil of bardahl oil,cir,at implicitly rejecting gnaps argument,although indicating that certain considerations may nonetheless justify withholding some or all of a security from a wrongfully enjoined party.but see h r block,mccaslin,cir per curiam.this court has not construed the term before.
we now adopt the majority position,and we hold that under rule c,a party is wrongfully enjoined when it had a right all along to do what it was enjoined from doing.see nintendo,at see also slidell,millennium inorganic,cir blumenthal,at.
applying that rule to this case is quite simple.the issue of whether verizon was wrongfully enjoined was determined when we issued our opinion in gnaps ii and rejected gnaps arguments on the merits of its position.we then vacated the injunction because verizon was entitled,and had been entitled all along,to cut off services to gnaps.
determining the entitlement to security 
gnaps second point is that verizon presented insufficient evidence of its entitlement to the full security.we disagree and think it helpful to split this point into two smaller issues whether verizon had established it was entitled to provable damages,and whether verizon had in fact proved the amount of damages it suffered.
on the first issue,while there is a split of authority,we adopt the majority rule that there is a rebuttable presumption that a wrongfully enjoined party is entitled to have the security executed so as to recover provable damages up to the amount of the security.see milan express,averitt express,cir nintendo,at kidney patients ass sullivan,at.but see h r block,at.under this presumption,a district court must have a good reason to depart from the preference for recovery of security granted under rule c,at.
as judge posner put it in,not only is this rule implied by the text of rule c,but it makes the law more predictable and discourages the seeking of preliminary injunctions on flimsy though not necessarily frivolous grounds.id.at.and as several circuits have pointed out,there are ancillary benefits to adoption of the presumption.see nintendo,at kidney,at see also note,recovery for wrongful interlocutory injunctions under rule c,harv,note,interlocutory injunctions and the injunction bond,harv.
applying this presumption requires slightly more explanation.earlier,this court avoided stating a standard of appellate review of the district court release of the security.it is often said,sometimes loosely,that appellate review of this release is for abuse of discretion.see,milan express,at kidney,at.but since we have adopted a presumption,that presumption in turn affects how we apply the abuse of discretion standard.this amounts to stricter review along the sliding scale of the abuse standard.see,at when rules prescribe a course of action as the norm but allow the district court to deviate from it,the court discretion is more limited the judge must have a good reason for departing from the presumption of recovery in a particular case.
here,the district court correctly concluded that it had no good reason to refrain from releasing the security to verizon so long as verizon could prove the damages it suffered.perhaps if there had been a demonstration that verizon had failed to mitigate its damages,gnaps would have had a stronger case that verizon was not entitled to all of the damages it had suffered.see id.at.but no such showing was made here.there was no abuse of discretion 
that brings us to the second question,whether verizon in fact adequately proved its damages.we note that the issue of the amount of appropriate security was litigated when the district court set the amount that previously determined amount was the amount which the court more,not less.of course,verizon was still required to establish that the predicted harm was the actual harm.but that proof did not need not to be to a mathematical certainty.see nintendo,at.from our point
