appellant danning,gill,diamond kollitz dgdk,a law firm,and respondent credit suisse first boston mortgage capital,llc credit suisse filed for summary judgment.the trial court denied and granted,respectively,dgdk and credit suisse motions.the fundamental question is whether a lien that arises upon service of an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination,referred to by the parties as an orap lien,applies to funds acquired by dgdk from the judgment debtor not a party to this appeal after the orap lien came into existence.the trial court concluded that the orap lien applied to funds acquired by dgdk and therefore entered judgment for credit suisse.
in the trial court,dgdk relied on a certain statutory provision,discussed at length in this opinion,that provides for an exception to the imposition of an orap lien.we raised on our own motion the question whether the exception in question is limited to letter of credit transactions,an inquiry that was entirely new to the case.we asked for and received supplemental briefing on this issue.we conclude that the exception in question is limited to letter of credit transactions.because the record does not unequivocally show that there was no letter of credit transaction in this case,we remand with directions for further proceedings that are consistent with this opinion.it is therefore necessary to reverse the judgment.
on september,credit suisse obtained a judgment of approximately million against ronald anson,among others.this judgment was registered in the united states district court for the southern district of california on october.on the same day,credit suisse served anson with an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination in accordance with california code of civil procedure section 
under subdivision d of section,service of the notice to appear created a lien on the personal property of the judgment debtor,anson as one court has explained the rule,u nder the debtor examination statute,the lien upon all nonexempt property is created at the time the judgment debtor is served with notice of the examination.citations.unlike the third party examination case where the property must be adequately identified for the lien to attach,the lien on the judgment debtor property attaches whether or not the property is described in the notice in sufficient detail to be reasonably identifiable.imperial bank pim electric,th,d.
on october,anson had an account of at least million at value home loan.the law firm of bird,marella,boxer,wolpert,nessim,drooks linceberg,pc bird,marella held a security interest in this account.on or about november,anson instructed value home loan to pay bird,marella from anson account.in turn,bird,marella paid dgdk on or about december.this sum was deposited by dgdk in the client trust account.
credit suisse characterizes this payment as a retainer.while dgdk disputes that it was a retainer,dgdk did not offer any evidence to support its claim that this was not a retainer.in fact,it appears that as of november,anson owed dgdk only and that the was deposited in the client trust account on december.thus,credit suisse seems to have the better side of this dispute,which,in light of our analysis of the section,subdivision j exemption see,post,is not material.
on or about july,anson instructed value home loan to wire to dgdk bird,marella released its lien on anson value home loan account to the extent of this payment.dgdk applied this sum to fees and costs incurred by anson.
dgdk learned of the existence of the orap lien sometime between october,and december,it is of some interest that this is not a disputed fact.
dgdk contends that the trial court erred in handling the procedural aspects of the for summary judgment.we therefore set forth the sequence of events,as well as the salient aspects of these motions.
it began with a stipulation between dgdk and credit suisse,filed on february,that their motions for summary judgment could be filed on or before march.at this time,trial was set for april.thus,the parties needed relief from the rule requiring days of notice for the hearing,as well as from the rule providing that motions for summary judgment have to be heard no later than days before trial 
it also appears that,at least when the stipulation was filed,both sides agreed that a central issue,if not the central issue,in the case was whether dgdk could assert the exemption from the orap lien set forth in subdivision j of section.as we discuss below,subdivision j exempts from an orap lien a person who acquires any right or interest in letters of credit,advices of credit,or money.we will refer to this provision from time to time as the subdivision j exemption.in substance,dgdk claimed that it had a right or interest in money because of the attorney fees generated for work performed on behalf of anson.credit suisse argued,as it does in this appeal,that the money referred to in subdivision j of section has to be currency and coin and not rights to payment of checks or the proceeds of a wire transfer.
the trial court denied the stipulation without prejudice,the minute order stating that the court would consider adjustment of dates once the motions have been served and filed,and a hearing date reserved.
dgdk reactions to this order are somewhat murky.stated to its best advantage in the appellate opening brief,dgdk reasons are said to have been that the delay caused by the rejection of the stipulation placed the parties in a position in which the motions for summary judgment no longer offered any real utility and that dgdk no longer agreed with setting other dates for the motions.
the next move was credit suisse and that was to file its motion for summary judgment on march.dgdk countered by filing a motion to strike credit suisse summary judgment motion.the latter motion was denied without prejudice and the matter was deferred by the court to a postmediation status conference.
according to dgdk,the court ruling put dgdk in a position where it had to choose between participating in the cross motions originally anticipated or simply defend against credit suisse motion.it dgdk therefore responded to credit suisse motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment.
dgdk filed its motion for summary judgment on march,and set it for the same date scheduled for credit suisse motion.in addition to relying on the subdivision j exemption,dgdk motion also claimed that it qualified for an exemption under subdivision d of section because it was a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument.we note here that the trial court rejected the latter argument because dgdk was on notice of the orap lien dgdk does not renew this contention on appeal.
at a status conference on march,the trial court noted that the trial date was april,and that there were motions for summary judgment set for march.the following ensued the court was that by stipulated shortened notice,oetzell counsel for dgdk oetzell your honor,it was.the court okay.that all i need to know 
the for summary judgment were heard and decided on april.
the trial court ruling 
in substance,the trial court ruling on the applicability of the subdivision j exemption is predicated on the supposed difference between legal fees for services already rendered,on the one hand,and a retainer for services to be rendered in the future,on the other.that is,the trial court reasoned that under the subdivision j exemption dgdk became entitled to a right or interest in money only upon having performed services,but not before.
the trial court declined to address the clashing definitions of money as immaterial to its decision.but the court nevertheless rejected as hypertechnical credit suisse contention that money means currency and coins.
we do not agree with the trial court that the word money in subdivision j of section can be read in isolation and without reference to letters of credit and advices of credit,which precede the word money.we also disagree with the view that the availability of the subdivision j exemption depends on whether the money has or has not been earned.in our opinion,the subdivision j exemption addresses letter of credit transactions,and entitl
