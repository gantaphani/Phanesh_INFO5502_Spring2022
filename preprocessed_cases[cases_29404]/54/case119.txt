jalapeno property management,llc brought suit to enforce a judgment against defendants appellees george and justine dukas for liability on a defaulted promissory note,which the dukases had guaranteed.the district court dismissed jalapeno claim as barred by the applicable state statute of limitations,and refused to apply a longer federal statute of limitations found in the federal debt collection procedures act,fdcpa,et.jalapeno appeals the district court dismissal.for the following reasons,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
this case revolves around a promissory note which was executed on september,by a political campaign committee,tennesseans for tyree,and signed by the campaign chairman,douglas morrison,for the purpose of funding candidate randy tyree gubernatorial race in tennessee.in exchange for the note,which was payable on demand or,in the event of no demand,within days after execution of the note,the united american bank uab loaned tennesseans for tyree on november,george and justine dukas,tyree,signed a broadly worded continuing guaranty,which guaranteed all of tennesseans for tyree debts now existing or hereafter arising for an unlimited sum of money.uab subsequently failed in may,and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,acting in its corporate capacity,purchased the defaulted promissory note and other assets of the bank from the bank receiver.the continuing guaranty was found in uab files with the note apparently,it had been included in the file to support the loans to tennesseans for tyree when the bank was being investigated by federal banking officials.
this litigation began on november,when the fdic filed a complaint in federal district court against tennesseans for tyree,randy tyree,douglas morrison,and george and justine dukas as members of the political campaign seeking to enforce the defaulted promissory note the fdic also sought to hold the dukases liable as guarantors of the note.the parties filed for summary judgment.on july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of tyree,morrison,and the dukases as members of the political campaign committee.the district court refused,however,to grant summary judgment for the dukases in their role as guarantors of the note on february,the district court granted the fdic motion for summary judgment against the dukases as guarantors of the note.judgment was entered for the fdic in the amount of,plus interest and attorney fees in accordance with the terms of the note.on march,the fdic filed a notice of appeal,stating that it appealed the district court july,judgment upon the conclusion of the action by the february,judgment.the dukases from the district court judgment of february.
in an unpublished opinion,fdic morrison,wl cir,a panel of this court affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment for the fdic as to its claim against george and justine dukas,but reversed the grant of summary judgment for tyree and morrison and remanded for further proceedings the fdic then filed a motion for entry of judgment specifying sum certain in the district court in the amount of,which included the principal amount of the loan plus interest and attorney fees.the motion averred that t he time for any further appeal on this matter has expired and that the judgment is final.at.on september,the district court entered a judgment for sum certain for the amount requested.on may,the fdic applied for a writ of execution to satisfy the judgment against the dukases,which was granted by the district court and executed upon local banks.the writs were never satisfied.
on august,in accordance with this court mandate,the district court held a bench trial on the fdic claims against tennesseans for tyree,morrison,and tyree,in which the fdic sought to hold the latter two defendants personally liable for the promissory note.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court found that neither tyree nor morrison were liable for the note,nor had they intended to mislead banking authorities the district court also entered a default judgment against tennesseans for tyree,finding it liable on the promissory note in the amount of,plus for attorney fees,expenses,and costs.
the fdic then filed a notice of appeal as to the judgment entered in favor of tyree and morrison.another panel of this court affirmed the judgment of the district court in fdic tennesseans for tyree,cir the mandate for that decision issued on october.
on july,almost ten years after this court last mandate in the litigation,the fdic filed a motion to renew judgment,claiming that the judgment entered by the district court against the dukases on september,had not been satisfied.citing ann.the fdic asserted that t he statutory period of ten years since the entry of the judgment has not expired,due to the fact that this matter was appealed and the time during which the appeal was pending is not counted for purposes of determining the expiration date of a judgment.at.
the dukases failed to respond to this motion because it was not served on their current counsel.on august,the district court determined that the judgment against the dukases had not expired and that the fdic was owed plus interest,as was entered in the september,judgment the court then ordered that the judgment against the dukases be renewed and the lien continued for another ten years.on october,the dukases filed a motion to set aside order renewing judgment,on the ground that the applicable statute of limitations under tennessee law had expired and that the court therefore lacked jurisdiction over them.
on october,the fdic filed a notice that it had transferred and assigned its right,title,and interest to the judgment entered on september,including the promissory note and the continuing guaranty which were the basis of that judgment,to jalapeno property management,llc.on october,jalapeno filed an application for writ of execution to satisfy the judgment against the dukases for the amount of,which included the amount of the original judgment plus interest from august.
in response to the dukases motion to set aside order,jalapeno advanced two alternative arguments first,that the judgment against the dukases did not expire prior to the fdic filing of its motion to renew judgment because the judgment did not accrue until october,when this court issued its mandate affirming the district court dismissal of the remaining claims against tyree and morrison and the rights of all parties had been adjudicated and,in the alternative,that the fdcpa statute of limitations governed jalapeno claim.
on february,the district court granted the dukases motion to set aside order,pursuant to its authority under.b.the district court first determined that the fdcpa,which provides for a statute of limitations on the recovery of all judgment liens owed to the united states under the act,did not govern jalapeno claim.the district court agreed with the dukases that,because the original debt arose between two private parties uab and tennesseans for tyree,the fdcpa statutory exclusion for debts owing under the terms of a contract originally entered into by only persons other than the united states,b,rendered the statute inapplicable.at.the district court then held that the fdic did not move to renew the judgment within the statute of limitations period provided by state law.the court reasoned that because the judgment against the dukases became final on october,thirty days after the district court september,judgment against them,and the fdic did not file its motion to renew until after october,which was the expiration date,the fdic motion was untimely.the district court specifically rejected jalapeno argument that,pursuant to.b,final judgment was not entered until october,this court ultimate disposition of the case.
jalapeno timely appealed the district court judgment.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court granted the dukases motion to set aside order renewing judgment pursuant to.b.preliminarily,we note that it is unclear under which provision of rule b the district court relieved the dukases from its original judgment.based on several oblique references in the district court opinion to rule b,we presume that the district court acted pursuant to that provision,which grants the district court power to relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment for any reason,other than the first five reasons enumerated in the rule,which justif ies relief from the operation of the judgment.b.
typically,a district court may grant relief under rule b only for exceptional or extraordinary circumstances which are not addressed by the first five numbered clauses of the rule.blue diamond coal trustees of the umwa combined benefit fund,cir quoting olle henry wright,cir.neither party has briefed or argued to this court that the district court erred by granting the dukases motion pursuant to the extraordinary circumstances requirement inherent in rule b relief instead,jalapeno and the dukases both address the merits of the claims that were before the district court.therefore,we will not consider whether the district court judgment was based on an improper use of rule b,but instead will turn our attention to the merits of this litigation although we review a district court grant of a motion to reconsider under rule b for an abuse of discretion,see blue diamond,at,we treat the district court interpretation and application of the federal rules of civil procedure as a question of law and,as with all legal questions,review this analysis de novo.see indiana lumbermens mut.ins.timberland pallet lumber,cir.
tennessee statute of limitations 
jalapeno claims that the district court erred by measuring the start of tennessee statute of limitations from october,thirty days after judgment was imposed against the dukases.according to jalapeno,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until october,when this court mandate issued as to the last of the claims in the litigation.calculated from that later date,jalapeno argues that the fdic motion to renew must be considered timely under tennessee law.
jalapeno grounds its argument in the language of.b,which governs judgment upon multiple claims or involving multiple parties.the rule provides 
when more than one claim for relief is presented in an action,whether as a claim,counterclaim,or claim,or when multiple parties are involved,the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.in the absence of such determination and direction,any order or other form of decision,however designated,which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties,and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.
b.rule a states that a judgment includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.a.jalapeno argues that the september,order could not have been a final appealable judgment because when multiple parties are involved and a court order does not resolve all of the parties claims,the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.b emphasis added.in this case,the district court september,order did not resolve the litigation as to all parties it ordered judgment only against the dukases,but did not terminate the litigation as to plaintiff claims against tennesseans for tyree,tyree,or morrison.the district court order also failed to comply with rule b,in that it lacked a certification of finality and it failed to find that there was no just reason for delay.therefore,according to jalapeno,the september,judgment as to the dukases was not a final judgment for purposes of appeal.
the district court rejected jalapeno argument,relying upon king instrument otari,for the principle that rule b has no application after a claim has been heard on appeal.according to the district court,rule b does not apply since the rule concerns the power of the trial court before appeal and the court of appeals had already reviewed the original decision in this case.at.
in king,the federal circuit permitted otari,the defendant,to appeal the district court entry of judgment,without rule b certification,for partial damages for the plaintiff.the federal circuit had,in a prior appeal,affirmed one award for damages for the plaintiff but had reversed and remanded a related damages award.on remand,the district court entered and executed the portion of the damages award which had been affirmed continued an injunction but did not resolve the plaintiff remaining claim for damages.addressing the question whether it had jurisdiction to entertain otari second appeal prior to the district court disposition of the remaining damages claim,the federal circuit determined that jurisdiction was proper under both a because the district court order continued an injunction,and the federal circuit found jurisdiction under the latter statute pursuant to the forgay doctrine,which,the federal circuit held,allows for immediate appeal from an order executing the immediate transfer of property.see king,at discussing forgay conrad,how.once the king court determined that it had jurisdiction over the appeal,it then held that it could affirm the district court grant of damages as to part but not all of the plaintiff claim,despite otari complaint that this would violate rule b.the court,in rejecting otari argument,held that rule b was inapplicable because it only concerns the power of the trial court before appeal.id.at.
jalapeno attempts to distinguish king by arguing first,that the case is not applicable because it involved multiple claims,not multiple parties as in the instant case,and second,that king was wrongly decided because it contravenes the express language of the rule.we agree with jalapeno that king was wrongly decided.indeed,we decline to follow king because we conclude that the federal circuit analysis of its jurisdiction was erroneous on several levels.first,the king court confused the distinction between a finding of jurisdiction under pursuant to the forgay doctrine and the purpose of rule b.assuming,arguendo,that the federal circuit correctly found jurisdiction under pursuant to the forgay doctrine,which point we later dispute,the court had no need to consider whether the district court order failed to comply with rule b.this is so because rule b certification is an alternative means of conferring jurisdiction upon an appellate court under.see sears,roebuck mackey.noting that rule b does not supersede any statute controlling appellate jurisdiction and that the rule scrupulously recognizes the statutory requirement of a final decision under as a basic requirement for an appeal to the court of appeals.therefore,the king court discussion of rule b is arguably dicta,because,in light of its finding of jurisdiction pursuant to the forgay doctrine,it was unnecessary to the court analysis.
although we can not discern from the king court opinion whether the case involved an appeal from a partial award of damages for a single claim,as opposed to an appeal from the disposition of one of many claims,we note that if the case involved the former procedural posture,then rule b would be completely inapplicable to the court jurisdictional analysis,as the rule does not apply to litigation.because we suspect that the original litigation in king instruments involved a single claim for patent infringement which had been partially adjudicated,we believe that on this basis also,the federal circuit improperly invoked rule b 
whether or not the federal circuit discussion of rule b was dicta,we believe that its analysis is unsupportable by the language of the rule and runs contrary to the rule manifold purposes.as to the latter point,rule b permits immediate review of certain district court orders prior to the ultimate disposition of a case.acquisition,cir.it is designed to strike a balance between the undesirability of piecemeal appeals,with their attendant delay and duplication of appellate review,and the need to make the appellate process available in or litigation to serve the best interests of the parties.see good ohio edison,cir acquisition,at.rule b also eliminates doubt about when a party must file an appeal.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice procedure at if the court does not enter a rule b order,the litigant knows that waiting until the disposition of the entire case before seeking an appeal will not lose the right to have the order reviewed.by creating guidelines,parties can be certain of the timing of their appeals and will refrain from unnecessary filings in the appellate courts.indeed,to facilitate rule b purposes,we require strict compliance with the rule.see acquisition,at stating that for rule b certification,district court must expressly direct the entry of final judgment as to one or more but few than all the claims or parties,must express ly determin e that there is no just reason to delay appellate review,and must provide reasoning to support its conclusions internal quotation marks omitted knafel pepsi cola bottlers of akron,cir rejecting district court rule b certification because court failed to consider properly the factors relevant to the certification decision.
neither of the purposes of the balance judicial efficiency with the parties interests and to eliminate confusion over the timing of diminished by the circumstance that a case has already been heard once on appeal.indeed,in complex litigation,it is not improbable that the action will advance to the appellate stage more than once.in such circumstances,as in the instant case,strict compliance with rule b is essential for ease of administration both for the courts and for the parties.
not only,therefore,does the king court rule conflict with rule b aims,but it also conflicts with its language.rule b clearly states that i n the absence of such certification,any order or other form of decision,however designated,which adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties,and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.nothing in this language,nor in any controlling precedent we were able to uncover,encourages us to believe that the rule is any less applicable to proceedings in the district court after the case has been heard in a first appeal than before it.therefore,we reject the king court interpretation of rule b,and hold that the rule must be complied with during all stages of litigation in the district court,not just the period before a first appeal.
applying this principle to the instant case,we conclude that the district court september,judgment did not begin the running of the statute of limitations for purposes of appeal.the order did not adjudicate the rights and liabilities of all the parties,nor was it certified pursuant to rule b,as it could have been had the dukases sought the appropriate certification.therefore,the judgment did not terminate the action as to any of the parties and the judgment was subject to revision by the district court until the termination of the litigation against the remaining defendants when viewed in this light,it becomes clear both that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until after this court had issued its second mandate on october,which concluded the litigation as to the rights and liabilities of all the parties,and that jalapeno motion to renew was timely filed.
iii.conclusion 
because we conclude that the district court improperly calculated the running of the state statute of limitations,we need not address the parties alternative argument about the applicability of a federal statute of limitations under the fdcpa.for the forgoing reasons,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i join the majority in concluding that the district court committed reversible error by granting the dukases motion for reconsideration and setting aside the judgment against them.because i reach this result through somewhat different reasoning than the majority,i concur separately.
as the majority states,neither the parties nor the district court made clear under which provision of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure the dukases brought the motion to set aside the order renewing judgment.like the majority,i do not doubt that the district court acted pursuant to rule b.unlike the majority,however,i think that because the particular provision that ultimately governs the dukases motion will determine the standard of review and the substantive legal rules for application in this appeal,the parties failure to argue whether the district court improperly used rule b can not simply be ignored.in fact,the majority failure to examine this question leads to the incongruous result that,although this court normally reviews a district court grant of a motion to reconsider under rule b for abuse of discretion,the majority proceeds directly to a de novo review of the merits of the litigation.such a course invites this court and litigants to overlook the procedural posture in which cases present themselves for appellate review,subjects judgments of the district court entitled to deference to inappropriately exacting scrutiny,and runs counter to the accepted principle that a rule b motion does not bring the underlying judgment up for review.hood hood,cir per curiam citations omitted.
the majority could readily avoid the unusual course of reviewing de novo a question normally committed to the sound discretion of the district court by simply recognizing the dukases motion for what it is a motion under rule b.in attempting to discern the clause of rule b under which the dukases brought their motion,this court looks to the substance of the relief requested.see futernick sumpter township,cir sunfire coal united mine workers of,cir.accord prudential real estate affiliates,ppr realty,cir t he label attached to a motion does not control its substance.quoting united states state of oregon,cir.in their motion,the dukases sought to set aside the order of the district court renewing the fdic judgment against them on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction to renew the judgment because it had expired by operation of law prior to entry of the order.emphasis added.although not doing so expressly,this claim invokes rule b,which allows a court to relieve a party of a judgment if that judgment is void.therefore,because the dukases motion invokes one of the more specific subsections of rule b for granting relief,the standards of rule b should guide the majority review rather than the more amorphous and concerns behind rule b.blue diamond coal trustees of the umwa combined benefit fund,cir quoting olle henry wright,cir
