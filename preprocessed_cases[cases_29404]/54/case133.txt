background 
lmc was an illinois company that sold confectionary cooking and processing machines.lmc outstanding shares were wholly owned throughout its existence by cic,a delaware holding company.the outstanding shares of cic stock were owned by barry carroll and a trust of which carroll is the sole beneficiary.carroll is also the president and chairman of cic and was the ceo and chairman of lmc.defendant james elsen was the vice president and chief operations officer of cic and the of lmc from to.defendant roger hohberger began working for lmc in after the company acquired the assets of his candy machinery manufacturing company.from to he was the vice president of sales at lmc.
in the fall of,cic began trying to sell lmc assets.elsen and lmc president at that time,peter loveland,attended a candy machinery trade show in germany.there they met arminder dhiman,the owner of dhiman industries.in october,dhiman paid to acquire two of lmc product groups,the hohberger products group and the latini products group.after the sale,hohberger went to work for dhiman industries,which subsequently was named dhimantec,dhimantec.hohberger also purchased percent of dhimantec stock for,making him one of that company two shareholders.
some of lmc remaining equipment was sold to deister products,a cic subsidiary,for unknown consideration.another cic subsidiary,carroll manufacturing,also purchased some of lmc equipment.in,via an assignment for the benefit of creditors,lmc assigned its remaining assets to james lindeman for the purposes of liquidation and payment to its creditors.lmc is no longer in business.
in the context of these transactions,lmc was engaged in litigation with judson atkinson in federal court.over the years lmc had sold several machines to judson atkinson.in,judson atkinson filed suit against lmc in texas claiming that one of the machines it had purchased from lmc was defective.lmc did not appear for the trial and in,judson atkinson obtained a default judgment against lmc for breach of contract in the amount of almost.lmc never disclosed to judson atkinson prior to trial that it had ceased operations and conveyed its assets to other entities.judson atkinson subsequently filed the present lawsuit in the district court for the western district of texas to collect the underlying judgment.that court transferred the case to the northern district of illinois on forum non conveniens grounds.see a.judson atkinson alleged that lmc had fraudulently transferred its assets to the defendants in order to avoid its judgment debt in violation of texas uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.judson atkinson also asserted and breach of fiduciary duty theories of liability under which,it contended,cic and the individual defendants should be found liable for lmc judgment debt.
after extensive discovery,judson atkinson,cic,elsen,carroll and hohberger filed for summary judgment.carroll also moved to strike exhibits filed with judson atkinson motion for summary judgment,including exhibits and.these exhibits were lists that judson atkinson had prepared that supposedly summarized transfers from cic bank account to various individuals and entities.judson atkinson had labeled the transfers fraudulent on the theory that the funds transferred from cic were actually lmc funds that were distributed to the transferees to ensure that judson atkinson could not recover its judgment.carroll argued that the exhibits lacked a proper foundation and had not been authenticated,and therefore were improper summaries,inadmissible under federal rule of evidence.in addition,cic and elsen filed a motion for sanctions alleging that judson atkinson had violated federal rule of civil procedure by failing to serve notice on the defendants of subpoenas issued to two financial financial and northern trust failing to timely disclose the documents it received in response to the subpoenas.cic also filed a motion to compel the return of a memorandum prepared by its attorneys,seyfarth shaw seyfarth shaw memorandum.it alleged that the memo,which was filed as an exhibit to one of judson atkinson filings,had been produced inadvertently to judson atkinson and was covered by the privilege.
the district court granted carroll motion to strike exhibits and and the defendants motion for sanctions.the court also granted cic motion to compel the return of the seyfarth shaw memorandum,concluding that cic had not waived the privilege.in addition,the court concluded that judson atkinson had not presented evidence supporting its argument or its fraudulent transfer claims.the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of all defendants,including dhimantec and lmc,which had not filed motions for summary judgment.
judson atkinson appeals the entry of summary judgment in favor of dhimantec,lmc,cic,hohberger,elsen and carroll,as well as the district court grant of the defendants motion to strike,motion for sanctions and motion to compel the return of the seyfarth shaw memorandum.
ii.discussion 
initially this lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the western district of texas.that court determined that it was not the most appropriate venue for resolution of the lawsuit and that venue was most appropriate in illinois.pursuant to a,it transferred the lawsuit to the northern district of illinois,eastern division.the district court to which the case was transferred should have applied texas rules.see ferens john deere,d a transfer under a does not change the law applicable to a diversity case.nelson sandoz pharm,cir int l,cir.ultimately,however,the district court application of illinois rules yielded the same results as the application of texas rules would have produced.thus,we analyze judson atkinson claims under the same substantive law as the district court applied.we address each of judson atkinson theories of liability in turn.
texas has the same rule for claims as illinois,namely that the law of the state of incorporation governs such claims.see alberto diversified group,cir citing.bus.act.ann.west supp.lmc was incorporated in illinois and cic in delaware.thus,the district court correctly applied the laws of illinois and delaware to judson atkinson claims.
judson atkinson claims that lmc corporate veil should be pierced to hold cic,carroll,elsen and hohberger liable for the default judgment.under illinois law,a corporation is presumed to be separate and distinct from its officers,shareholders,and directors,and those parties will not be held personally liable for the corporation debts and obligations.tower investors,llc chestnut consultants,d.a corporation veil of limited liability will be pierced only when there is such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual or other corporation no longer exist,and when adherence to the fiction of separate corporate existence would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.van dorn future chem.oil,cir quoting macaluso jenkins,d,alteration in original.piercing the corporate veil is not favored and in general,courts are reluctant to do so.see in re kzk livestock,citing cm oberer dev,cir in re kevin emerick farms.accordingly,a party bringing a claim bears the burden of showing that the corporation is in fact a dummy or sham for another person or entity.jacobson buffalo rock shooters supply,d.
illinois courts consider the following factors when determining whether there is sufficient unity of interest to justify disregarding the corporate form 
inadequate capitalization failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities nonpayment of dividends insolvency of the debtor corporation nonfunctioning of the other officers or directors absence of corporate records commingling of funds diversion of assets from the corporation by or to a stockholder or other person or entity to the detriment of creditors failure to maintain arm length relationships among related entities and whether,in fact,the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant stockholders.
fontana tld builders,d.judson atkinson argues that several of these factors are present lmc was undercapitalized,lmc failed to observe corporate formalities and lmc funds were commingled with those of cic and carroll.
judson atkinson argues that because lmc was losing money,it was undercapitalized.but a court will find a corporation to be undercapitalized only when it has so little money that it could not and did not actually operate its nominal business as its own.firstar bank,faul chevrolet,d,quoting indus.of,ter maat,cir.the fact that a corporation is losing money does not show that it is undercapitalized.see firstar bank,d at t he evidence that the dealership was losing money has no probative value in showing that the corporation was undercapitalized.judson atkinson provided no evidence that lmc maintained a lower capitalization than the law required.indus.of,at.
judson atkinson also alleges that lmc failed to observe corporate formalities.it is undisputed that lmc was incorporated in illinois,that it filed annual reports with the illinois secretary of state and that it held annual meetings,pl resp.to cic facts.in addition,lmc issued stock certificates to cic,conducted board meetings and entered into contracts in its own name.the only evidence judson atkinson points to as proof of lmc failure to observe corporate formalities is the company failure to file tax returns since.this is not enough to justify treating lmc as a mere shell.see jacobson,at m erely missing one annual meeting is not a sufficient showing of failure to observe corporate formalities.people v m,d,failure to hold regular meetings,take minutes,maintain corporate records showed failure to observe corporate formalities ted harrison oil,dokka,d,finding a complete lack of corporate formalities where n o records were kept and the company did not hold formal shareholder or director meetings.
finally,judson atkinson alleges that lmc funds were commingled with those of cic and carroll,stating that an outside consultant concluded that lmc did not have a separate bank account,that transfers were made between lmc and cic and that proceeds of loans to lmc were deposited into accounts owned by cic.ultimately,judson atkinson intermingling argument is based on cic use of a cash management system.but the use of a cash management system alone is not evidence that funds are being improperly commingled.see fletcher atex,cir courts have generally declined to find alter ego liability based on a parent corporation use of a cash management system.in re acushnet river new bedford harbor proceedings,a centralized cash management system where the accounting records always reflect the indebtedness of one entity to another,is not the equivalent of intermingling funds.japan petroleum nigeria ashland oil,arrangements by a parent and subsidiary for economy of expense and convenience of administration may be made without establishing the relationship of principal and agent.judson atkinson has not cited any evidence to counter cic assertions that it maintained a strict accounting of each subsidiary balance.in addition,judson atkinson does not point to any evidence supporting its blanket assertions that lmc funds were used to pay cic expenses.nor does judson atkinson offer proof to support its allegation that advances carroll received from cic were made from funds belonging to lmc.thus,the district court correctly concluded that judson atkinson failed to present sufficient proof that improper commingling occurred.
where judson atkinson has cited specific,verifiable facts to support its argument,those facts do not come close to making a substantial showing that the corporation is really a dummy or sham for a dominating personality.rosier cascade mountain,d,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.judson atkinson argues that carroll control of both cic and lmc weighs in favor of finding a unity of interest.it points to cic ownership of lmc stock and carroll ownership of cic stock.but t he separate corporate entities of two corporations may not be disregarded merely because one owns the stock of another hornsby hornsby stores,quoting sumner realty willcott,d.in illinois,the principle that a corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its shareholders,directors,and officers applies even where one corporation wholly owns another and the two have mutual dealings.joiner ryder,internal quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in original.see also plastic film of,unipac,d,t he fact that a corporation has only one single shareholder is not proof that the corporation is the alter ego of that shareholder.melko dionisio,d,noting that the mere allegation that defendant was a dominant or sole shareholder is insufficient to enable a court to disregard the separate corporate existence.judson atkinson also points out that carroll was an officer of both cic and lmc.while having common officers and directors is generally a prerequisite to piercing the corporate veil,this factor is insufficient to justify disregarding the corporate form because it is a common business practice that exist s in most parent and subsidiary relationships.c m,at citation omitted.the fact that carroll owned the outstanding shares of cic,lmc parent company,only shows that he may have had the opportunity to create a unity of interest,not that he actually did so.firstar bank,d at.judson atkinson has failed to show that lmc is an alter ego of cic or carroll and thus,the district court properly entered summary judgment for those defendants 
judson atkinson claims against elsen and hohberger appear to be baseless.the evidence supporting judson atkinson claim against hohberger seems to consist of nothing more than the fact that hohberger was employed by lmc and was aware of the company financial difficulties.the evidence judson atkinson offers against elsen is that he was an officer of lmc and cic and had knowledge of the corporations respective finances.under illinois law,it is possible for a to be found personally liable under a theory.see fontana,at.but judson atkinson has failed to provide any evidence that either elsen or hohberger exercise d ownership control over lmc to such a degree that the separate personalities of lmc and the defendants did not exist,and that lmc was a business conduit of elsen and hohberger.macaluso,at.
finally,judson atkinson argues that the district court erred in refusing to pierce cic corporate veil to hold carroll and elsen liable.since judson atkinson has a judgment against lmc alone,whether or not cic veil could ever be pierced to hold carroll or elsen liable for an obligation owed by cic is irrelevant.we have determined that judson atkinson did not show that lmc was an alter ego of cic.since lmc veil can not be pierced to hold cic liable for the default judgment,liability for the default judgment can not be imposed on carroll or elsen by piercing cic corporate veil.
fraudulent transfer claims 
next we address judson atkinson argument that the district court erred when it entered judgment in favor of cic,carroll,dhimantec and hohberger with respect to its fraudulent transfer claims.judson atkinson asserts that texas law applies to its fraudulent transfer claims and that the district court erred in applying illinois law.texas courts apply the most significant relationship test to decide issues.see hughes wood,wagner,gutierrez collins.this is the same rule used in illinois.see esser mcintyre.therefore the district court choice of law would have been the same if it had applied texas principles.illinois has the most significant relationship to the case and thus,illinois law should apply to judson atkinson fraudulent transfer claims.
exhibits and 
because judson atkinson relies on exhibits and,which the district court struck,to support its fraudulent transfer claims,we address whether the court erred in striking those exhibits before deciding whether there was sufficient evidence for judson atkinson to have moved forward on its fraudulent transfer claims.exhibits and are charts that judson atkinson prepared that summarize allegedly fraudulent transfers from lmc and cic to third parties.we review the district court decision to strike judson atkinson exhibits for abuse of discretion.winfrey city of chicago,cir.under the local rules of the northern district of illinois,a party filing a motion for summary judgment under.must serve and file a statement of material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the moving party to a judgment as a matter of law.koszola bd.of educ.of city of chicago,cir quoting.local a.the evidence supporting a factual assertion must represent admissible evidence.malec sanford.judson atkinson argument that the exhibits were admissible summaries under federal rule of evidence is unavailing.the admission of a summary under.requires a proper foundation as to the admissibility of the material that is summarized and a showing that the summary is accurate united states briscoe,cir quoting united states driver,cir alteration in original.judson atkinson did not address these requirements.it did not establish the admissibility of the records on which the summaries were allegedly based or authenticate the summaries in any way.see needham white laboratories,cir before a summary is admitted,the proponent must lay a proper foundation as to the admissibility of the material that is summarized and show that the summary is accurate.because judson atkinson failed to properly authenticate the summaries in exhibits and,the district court acted within its discretion by striking them 
fraudulent transfer claims 
under illinois law,a fraudulent transfer claim requires a relationship.see aps sports collectibles,sports time,cir citing properties,goshinsky.lmc is the debtor in this case.judson atkinson argues that carroll,acting through lmc and cic allegedly his alter egos,made fraudulent transfers in violation of the ufta.because,as we have already determined,judson atkinson can not pierce lmc corporate veil,it can not maintain its fraudulent transfer claim against carroll based on the theory that carroll is lmc alter ego and therefore is a debtor under the ufta.
judson atkinson argues on appeal that its fraudulent transfer claims do not depend on accepting an alter ego theory of liability and it offers a theory of liability based on the defendants status as first transferees and subsequent transferees lmc made fraudulent transfers to cic and dhimantec,who are first transferees.they,in turn,made transfers to carroll and hohberger,who are subsequent transferees.to support its fraudulent transfer claims,judson atkinson cites cic use of a sweep account system,which we have already stated is not evidence of commingling or fraud.judson atkinson makes blanket assertions that lmc funds were used to pay bills for other entities without citing any evidence in the record supporting these charges.it asserts that cic made transfers to insiders without providing any proof showing that the funds allegedly transferred by cic belonged to lmc.judson atkinson further claims that the alleged transfers from lmc to cic and from cic to various individuals were made without receiving reasonably equivalent value but again,cites no evidence to support this claim.the only evidence judson atkinson offers to support its fraudulent transfer claims against dhimantec and hohberger is the fact that cic sold some of lmc assets to dhimantec for.but judson atkinson fails to provide any evidence suggesting that the assets were more valuable than the price that was paid,making only the curious argument that because hohberger purchased percent of dhimantec stock for after dhimantec bought assets from lmc,the assets lmc sold dhimantec must have been worth at least.if dhimantec had not had any assets at all before the sale,this argument might hold water.but judson atkinson has not offered any evidence of dhimantec value prior to the transaction and there is no indication that it was not an operating company with assets of its own prior to buying assets from lmc.in light of judson atkinson failure to show that any particular transfers were in fact fraudulent,the district court properly granted the defendants motions for summary judgment with respect to these claims.
breach of fiduciary duty 
under texas rules,the state of incorporation governs claims for breaches of fiduciary duties.see king douglass.illinois law thus governs judson atkinson claim that lmc officers breached their fiduciary duties.judson atkinson contends that carroll,elsen and hohberger,as officers of lmc,owed fiduciary duties to judson atkinson because judson atkinson is a creditor of lmc and that they breached those duties.the defendants assert that judson atkinson lacks standing to bring such a claim.in general,the officers and directors of a corporation do not owe fiduciary duties to creditors of the corporation.see macaluso,at.but in special circumstances,such as insolvency,directors do owe a duty to creditors.see technic eng g,basic envirotech,d.some courts have found that the special circumstance fiduciary duty runs to all creditors as a group,and not to any individual creditor,and therefore that only the corporation or its representative in bankruptcy can maintain a claim for an alleged breach of this duty.prime leasing,kendig,d,applying delaware law see also north am.catholic educ.programming,gheewalla,the creditors of a delaware corporation that is either insolvent or in the zone of insolvency have no right,as a matter of law,to assert direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty against its directors.although the illinois supreme court has not addressed whether a corporation creditor may bring a direct claim for breach of special circumstance fiduciary duty,several courts have found that under illinois law,creditors can sue for such a breach.see technic eng g,d at pharmaco,d,circle sec.agency,ross,d.even if we were to assume that judson atkinson has standing to sue for a breach of special circumstance fiduciary duty,however,judson atkinson breach of fiduciary duty argument is mainly a rehashing of its argument.judson atkinson does not cite the elements of a breach of fiduciary duty claim or show how any evidence in the record tends to support such a claim.as a result,it has waived this argument.see united states dunkel,cir a skeletal argument,really nothing more than an assertion,does not preserve a claim.citation omitted.
d.the district court grant of summary judgment sua sponte in favor of dhimantec and lmc 
judson atkinson contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of lmc and dhimantec,with respect to its alter ego and fraudulent conveyance claims,because neither of them filed a motion for summary judgment.district courts have the authority to enter summary judgment sua sponte so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.celotex catrett,d.in addition,we have held that if a district court grants one defendant motion for summary judgment,it may sua sponte enter summary judgment in favor of defendants if granting the motion would bar the claim against those defendants.malak associated physicians,cir see also acequia,prudential ins.of,cir sua sponte grant of summary judgment appropriate where one defendant succeeds in winning summary judgment on a ground common to several defendants,if the plaintiff had an adequate opportunity to argue in opposition.
in order to show that dhimantec is an alter ego of lmc,judson atkinson would have had to show that lmc is a sham corporation by considering such factors as whether lmc observed corporate formalities,was adequately capitalized or maintained corporate records.in short,it would have to show the same things it would have to establish in order to pursue its alter claims against cic and carroll.having found that judson atkinson failed to present evidence sufficient to justify disregarding lmc corporate form,the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of all defendants with respect to judson atkinson alter ego claims.judson atkinson was also on notice that it had to come forward with evidence establishing lmc fraudulent conveyance of its assets to dhimantec because the legitimacy of that sale was asserted in the summary judgment motions of carroll,cic and hohberger.in its responses to those motions,judson atkinson failed to provide any evidence showing that the sale of lmc assets to dhimantec was not for reasonably equivalent value.thus,we affirm the district court sua sponte grant of summary judgment in favor of dhimantec.
judson atkinson also argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment sua sponte in favor of lmc.lmc did not appear and the district court entered a default against it.the district court subsequently entered summary judgment for lmc when it granted the other defendants motions for summary judgment.although the district court entered a default against lmc,it did not enter a default judgment.see united states hansen,cir a n order of default is not a final judgment,though a default judgment is.united states borchardt,cir a lthough a default may serve as the basis for a default judgment,the entry does not of itself determine rights.citation omitted.federal rule of civil procedure c allows a court to set aside an entry of default for good cause and to set aside a default judgment under rule b,which states that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment on motion.while relief from a default judgment is usually granted on a motion filed by the defaulting party,a majority of circuits to have considered the power of a district court to vacate a judgment under rule b have concluded that district courts have the discretion to grant such relief sua sponte.see pierson dormire,cir,vacated in part on rehearing on other grounds by wl cir golden blount,robert peterson,fort knox music baptiste,cir noting that while relief from judgment is usually sought by motion of a party,nothing forbids the court to grant such relief sua sponte kingvision lake alice bar,cir mcdowell celebrezze,cir united states jacobs,cir.but see united states pauley,cir reasoning that because rule b explicitly requires relief under the rule to occur on motion,courts may not grant such relief except upon a motion from the affected party citation omitted dow baird,cir.unlike rule b,rule c does not refer to a motion but simply states that a court may set aside an entry of default for good cause.in addition,we believe that a district court that has entered a default against a party retains the power to act in the interest of justice in an unusual case in which its attention has been directed to the necessity of relief by means other than a motion,pierson,at quoting kingvision,at,particularly since rule c does not require a motion.without deciding whether a district court could set aside a default judgment sua sponte,we believe that the district court had the authority to set aside sua sponte an entry of default against lmc for good cause.in the present case,it seems that the district court did just that when it granted summary judgment for lmc.however,the district court did not make clear that it was setting aside the entry of default for good cause or explain its decision to grant summary judgment for lmc.therefore,we vacate and remand to the district court for an explanation of its decision.
e.the district court imposition of sanctions 
we review a district court imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion.cleveland hair clinic,puig,cir.we will only reverse a district court imposition of sanctions if one or more of the following is true the record contains no evidence upon which the court could have rationally based its decision the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law the decision is based on clearly erroneous factual findings or the decision clearly appears arbitrary.gile united airlines,cir citing haworth,herman miller.judson atkinson contends that the district court findings that judson atkinson acted in bad faith and that the defendants were prejudiced were clearly erroneous.we disagree.
a court,under its inherent powers,may sanction conduct that it finds to be an abuse of the judicial process.chambers nasco,d.in order to impose sanctions pursuant to its inherent power,a court must find that the party acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons methode,adam,cir quoting chambers,at,d.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure governs the use of subpoenas.a party must serve each party with prior notice if the subpoena commands the production of documents.b.prior notice is required in order to afford other parties an opportunity to object to the production or inspection,or to serve a demand for additional documents or things.committee note,amendments.the requirements of rule are clear.equally clear is the fact that judson atkinson violated these requirements.
we have stated that a district court deciding whether to impose sanctions for discovery violations should consider 
the prejudice or surprise to the party against whom the evidence is being offered the ability of the party to cure the prejudice the likelihood of disruption to the trial and the bad faith or willfulness involved in not disclosing the evidence at an earlier date.
david caterpillar,cir.although david dealt with the imposition of sanctions for a violation of rule those factors are equally applicable to considering the imposition of sanctions for a violation of rule.the facts strongly suggest that judson atkinson was less than forthright in its use of subpoenas.first,defense counsel was not provided with copies of the subpoenas.then,although judson atkinson began receiving documents in response to the subpoenas in october,it did not provide copies to the defendants until november,ten days after the last installment was received.see murphy bd.of educ.of rochester city sch,where attorney issued subpoenas without notifying opposing party,failure to share information obtained pursuant to subpoena weighed in favor of imposing sanctions.when defense counsel finally received the documents and contacted counsel for judson atkinson to protest the fact that judson atkinson failed to provide the defendants with copies of the subpoenas,judson atkinson misrepresented the time that it had received responses to the subpoenas,stating that no documents were received from either bank until after the close of discovery on november.this was simply untrue.judson atkinson received some documents in october.judson atkinson blatant misrepresentation supports the district court finding that it was not acting in good faith.
in addition,judson atkinson violation of rule deprived the defendants of the opportunity to object to the subpoenas.judson atkinson contends that any prejudice to the defendants was negated by its offer to stipulate not to use some of the subpoenaed documents.but a party may not ignore rule requirements and then,when caught,dictate the terms under which the subpoenaed materials will be used.rather,it is within the court inherent powers to assess the appropriate sanctions for violations of discovery rules.chambers,at,d.judson atkinson argument that the subpoenaed documents had been produced in the underlying litigation does not cure the prejudice to the defendants since they were not parties to the breach of contract lawsuit between judson atkinson and lmc.the district court did not clearly err in finding evidence of bad faith and prejudice to the defendants and hence,we affirm its imposition of sanctions 
seyfarth shaw memorandum 
judson atkinson final challenge is to the district court determination that the seyfarth shaw memorandum is covered by the privilege.we review a district court findings of fact regarding claims of privilege for clear error.see bland fiatallis,cir.we sh
