this bankruptcy case requires us to decide whether the sale of the debtor home,for which he had obtained a homestead exemption under the law of massachusetts protecting it from creditors,causes the proceeds of the sale to lose their exempt status under the bankruptcy code and become subject to,nondischargeable debt.we conclude that the proceeds from the sale of the home retain the exempt status of the home itself.we therefore affirm the district court ruling that the proceeds from the sale of maurice cunningham homesteaded property can not be liable for his debt to william pasquina.
pasquina hired cunningham,a former high school classmate,to work in his legal practice in.in,pasquina was injured in a car accident and was unable to continue to practice law.therefore,pasquina wanted to sell his legal practice to cunningham,but they were unable to come to an agreement.pasquina then entered unsuccessful negotiations with pierce associates pierce for the sale of his practice.during the course of pasquina negotiations with pierce,cunningham misled both pasquina and pierce into believing that he would join pierce.instead,cunningham secretly removed clients files from pasquina records,covertly opened his own practice,and continued to represent pasquina former clients without paying pasquina his share of the earned legal fees or reimbursing him for the expenses he had advanced the clients.in response to pasquina lawsuit,the massachusetts superior court entered its initial judgement of on june,having found that cunningham breached his fiduciary duties to pasquina during the period after the accident 
in november,by filing a declaration of homestead with the commonwealth of massachusetts registry of deeds,cunningham designated his residence at johnson street in north andover,massachusetts as his homestead.once property is properly claimed as a homestead pursuant to the massachusetts homestead act,it is shielded from most of an owner creditors 
an estate of homestead to the extent of in the land and buildings may be acquired pursuant to this chapter by an owner or owners of a home or one or all who rightfully possess the premise by lease or otherwise and who occupy or intend to occupy said home as a principal residence.said estate shall be exempt from the laws of conveyance,descent,devise,attachment,levy on execution and sale for payment of debts or legacies except in certain listed exceptions.
laws ch,soon after cunningham declaration of homestead,pasquina attempted to collect upon his superior court judgment on december,by obtaining a writ of attachment against the johnson street property.
on february,cunningham filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et,and claimed in the bankruptcy proceedings a homestead exemption on the johnson street property pursuant to b.he also disclosed pasquina lien on the residence 
under f a debtor can avoid the fixing of a judicial lien on property that is exempted from the bankruptcy estate therefore,before the bankruptcy court,cunningham moved pursuant to f for an order avoiding pasquina writ of attachment on february,pasquina filed an objection to cunningham motion to avoid the writ of attachment and cunningham claim of a homestead exemption.the bankruptcy court denied pasquina objections both on the merits and because the objections were thereby allowing cunningham to avoid the lien on the johnson street property.
subsequently,pasquina filed a timely motion in the bankruptcy court requesting that the court determine that cunningham debt to him was nondischargeable.in july,the court found that the debt should not be discharged because cunningham acted fraudulently while in a fiduciary capacity,see a,and because cunningham caused willful and malicious financial injury to pasquina,see a on september,the bankruptcy court closed its adversary proceedings.
meanwhile,pasquina learned that cunningham had listed his johnson street property for sale.on august,pasquina filed a motion in the massachusetts superior court arguing that the homestead exemption for the johnson street property would terminate upon the sale of the property.moreover,he claimed that the proceeds that would belong to cunningham wife,which pasquina alleged would constitute at least half of the total proceeds,would not be protected by the homestead exemption.in response to this motion,the superior court enjoined cunningham and his wife from distributing or using any of the sale proceeds if they were to sell the johnson street property.then,pasquina filed an emergency motion with the superior court arguing that if the johnson street property was sold,the proceeds from the sale of the johnson street property should be available to satisfy pasquina debt because the homestead exemption would be terminated.
on november,cunningham filed in bankruptcy court a motion for order confirming sale proceeds as exempt,asking the bankruptcy court to rule that the proceeds from the sale of the johnson street property were exempt from nondischarged debt just as the homestead had been exempt.on november,cunningham and his wife sold the johnson street property and moved to a condominium in florida net proceeds from the sale of the homestead property were about.
on december,the bankruptcy court ruled on cunningham motion,deciding that under c the sale proceeds from the homestead were exempt from liability for pasquina debt.that provision states 
p roperty exempted under this section is not liable during or after the case for any debt of the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case,except for certain debts,such as tax and child support obligations.
the bankruptcy court also found that it could not adjudicate the rights of cunningham wife because it had no jurisdiction over her.
pasquina appealed to the district court.in a thorough and opinion,the court found that the conversion of the homestead property into proceeds by means of voluntary sale does not remove the protections of c from the property.in re cunningham.on appeal to us,pasquina claims that the district court incorrectly applied federal bankruptcy law to protect funds that should have been available to satisfy a nondischargeable debt.he argues that massachusetts state law governs the disposition of the proceeds from the voluntary sale of a homestead and that these proceeds became subject to debts for which the debtor remains liable.as the relevant facts are undisputed and the issue before us turns entirely on the interpretation of law,our review is plenary.see united states hyde,cir.
the bankruptcy estate,created upon the filing of a chapter petition,is comprised of a debtor legal and equitable interests in property at the time of the petition.owen owen,d.typically,assets in the estate are distributed to creditors pursuant to a statutory scheme that assigns priorities to various types of debt.however,particular assets,including a homestead,may be exempted from the bankruptcy estate and retained by the debtor in accordance with the federal bankruptcy code.an exemption is an interest withdrawn from the estate and hence from the creditors for the benefit of the debtor.id.under b,a debtor can choose to use either the federal list of exemptions set forth in d or the exemptions provided by his state see b,d owen,at.cunningham opted to use massachusetts exemption list.
pasquina objected to cunningham claim of a homestead exemption and his motion to avoid pasquina judicial lien,c the bankruptcy court properly rejected pasquina claims,thereby permanently immunizing the homestead from debt by withdrawing the property from the bankruptcy estate.property that is properly exempted under is immunized against liability for prebankruptcy debts,subject only to a few exceptions.those exceptions include debt from certain taxes and customs duties,debt related to domestic support obligations,liens that can not be avoided or voided,including tax liens,and debts for a breach of fiduciary duty to a federal depository institution.see c in re weinstein,cir.
pasquina claim that the voluntary sale of the exempt property makes the proceeds of the sale available to satisfy a nondischargeable debt is at odds with th
