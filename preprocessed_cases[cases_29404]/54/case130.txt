this is an appeal from a collateral order issued in an enforcement action brought by the securities and exchange commission sec against a investment firm and its principals.for more than twenty years,wealth management llc handled client accounts for hundreds of investors.many were retirees,so wealth management usually stuck to traditional safe,investments.that changed in when wealth management set up six unregistered investment to hedge began investing heavily in unconventional and illiquid assets.the six funds failed,and the sec filed an enforcement action against wealth management and two of its principal officers alleging a host of violations.at the sec request,the district court froze wealth management assets and appointed a receiver to perform an accounting and fashion a plan to distribute whatever assets could be recovered.the receiver faced a daunting task.of the approximately million wealth management had under management,only about million was recoverable.
the receiver proposed to distribute the diminished assets to investors on a pro rata basis and also imposed a cutoff date after which any redemption distributions would be offset against the investor total distribution.certain investors filed objections to the proposed plan.the district court overruled the objections and approved the plan,and two objecting investors have appealed.
after filing their notice of appeal,the objectors asked the district court to stay the receiver distribution until the resolution of the appeal.the district court denied this request.the objectors brought the stay motion to this court,and again it was denied.then,after briefing was completed but prior to oral argument,the receiver went forward with a distribution of about million of the recovered assets.on the heels of this distribution,the receiver moved to dismiss the appeal or summarily affirm because unwinding the distribution would be inequitable to the nonobjecting investors and create administrative difficulties.we said we would take the motion with the merits.
we now affirm.the district court decision to approve the plan was fair and reasonable and withstands scrutiny under the deferential applicable to decisions of this kind.where a receivership trust lacks sufficient assets to fully repay investors and the investors funds are commingled,a distribution plan may properly be guided by the notion that equality is equity,and pro rata distribution is appropriate.cunningham brown.in approving the receiver proposed plan for distribution,the district court properly considered and rejected the objectors contrary particular,their argument that they were really creditors and not equity holders and therefore entitled to preferential treatment.
background 
wealth management and its investors 
wealth management llc was a firm located in appleton,wisconsin.as of may,it managed client accounts and had approximately million under management.many of its clients were retirees seeking safe,investments,so from until,client assets were held in segregated accounts,separately managed,and typically invested in common instruments such as stocks,bonds,and highly liquid stock and bond funds.in,however,wealth management altered this model by establishing six unregistered investment pools that were similar to hedge funds.these six funds,which are relief defendants in the underlying sec action,are wml gryphon fund llc gryphon wml watch stone partners,watch stone wml pantera partners,pantera wml palisade partners,palisade wml llc and wml quetzal partners,quetzal.gryphon was established as a wisconsin company was a delaware company,and the other four were delaware limited partnerships.wealth management served as general partner or managing member for each of the six funds.complete authority to select and manage the investments in these funds resided in two wealth management officers james putman,the firm founder,chief executive officer,and chairman and simone fevola,its president and chief investment officer.of the roughly million under management in,about million was invested in these six lion share,approximately million,in gryphon and watch stone.
the offering documents for gryphon and watch stone represented that these funds would invest primarily in investment grade debt securities.this made sense given wealth management client who depended on their wealth management assets as a primary source of income and therefore required safe,investments.but this representation was far from the truth.although putman and fevola told clients that the funds were safe and profitable,they were actually investing client assets in risky and illiquid subfunds and other alternative investments such as financing funds,financing funds,and a water park.
yet wealth management investors thought all was well.not only did the firm communicate to its clients that their investments were stable and conservative,but it also issued monthly reports suggesting that the new wealth management funds were instruments that were exceeding industry benchmarks.the illusion ended in february when wealth management sent a letter to gryphon investors saying that there was not enough money to pay redemptions in full and that redemptions would be limited to two percent per quarter of the value of each individual investment 
at this point things began to unravel.in june putman and fevola informed wealth management board that they had received kickbacks for steering assets to a financing fund,and investors learned that the sec was investigating wealth management investment practices.these revelations led to a rash of employee resignations,and in december wealth management provided written notification to investors of its decision to completely suspend redemptions and liquidate the wealth management funds.
two investors in gryphon are the objectors in this.edwin wilson and james and sandra verhoeven after receiving the february letter limiting redemptions to two percent of an investor equity,wilson notified gryphon of his intent to redeem his entire investment it appears that wilson received a redemption in the spring of.similarly,on may,the verhoevens asked to fully redeem their equity.wealth management noted this request in its records,and the verhoevens received partial redemptions in june and september.
court proceedings 
on may,the sec commenced an enforcement action against wealth management,putman,and fevola in federal court in the eastern district of wisconsin.the thrust of the multicount complaint was that putman and fevola misled investors regarding the safety and liquidity of the subject wealth management breach of their fiduciary duty to investors who sought that wealth management communications to investors were based on inflated values reported by managers,which wealth management failed to independently investigate.the complaint also alleged that putman and fevola had received roughly million in kickbacks for investing in two financing funds that were managed by an individual who had previously been the subject of an sec enforcement action.
the sec asked the court to freeze wealth management assets and appoint a receiver for the firm and the funds.the court granted both motions,and attorney faye feinstein was appointed as receiver.in addition to managing the liquidation of wealth management assets,feinstein was tasked with preparing an independent accounting of the individual funds assets,identifying any that could be recovered,and developing a plan for distribution to wealth management creditors and equity investors.the receiver accounting revealed that the funds had only million in recoverable assets to distribute,so most investors stood to recover only pennies on the dollar.
in september the receiver submitted her proposed distribution plan to the district court for approval.as relevant here,the plan sought to distribute wealth management assets to investors on a pro rata basis.feinstein had concluded that no investors were creditors of wealth management,and thus her plan treated all investors equally as equity holders,regardless of whether an investor had submitted a request to redeem his or her interest.the proposed plan also imposed a may,redemption cutoff date.redemption distribtions received after the cutoff date would be offset against the investor total distribution redemption distributions received prior to that date would not.the receiver said she selected may,as the cutoff date because the sec investigation become public in june and triggered a spike in redemption requests.
six investors,including wilson and the verhoevens,filed objections to the plan.they claimed that their requests to redeem their shares required that they be treated as creditors with priority over nonredeeming investors.the district court disagreed.on november,the court issued an order overruling the objections and approving the receiver distribution plan.the judge agreed with the receiver that a pro rata distribution among of whether a request for redemption had been a fair and equitable method of distributing the funds diminished assets.in reaching this conclusion,the judge analogized to the bankruptcy doctrine of equitable subordination giving a preference to investors who submitted redemption requests would elevate form over substance.
the judge also rejected the objectors related contention that the receiver was required to follow wisconsin law in classifying investors claims.in the alternative the court held that under wisconsin law,the objectors would not qualify as creditors with priority over nonredeeming investors.the court concluded that the distinction between redeeming and nonredeeming investors was relevant to the question of offset but did not affect an investor priority status.after considering various alternatives,the court approved the receiver proposal to use may,as a reasonable offset cutoff date.
the objectors appealed from the november order and moved to stay any distributions under the plan the district court denied this motion.the objectors then asked this court to stay distributions pending resolution of their appeal a motions panel likewise denied the stay.the receiver then distributed approximately million of the roughly million trust balance,holding back the remainder to cover accrued and ongoing administrative costs.this took place after briefing was complete but about three weeks before oral argument,so the receiver moved to dismiss the appeal or to summarily affirm.she invoked the doctrine of equitable mootness,arguing that unwinding the distribution would be inequitable to investors and pose administrative problems.we ordered a response and said we would consider the motion with the merits of the appeal.
ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
the district court order affirming the receiver distribution plan is not a final order,so we can not exercise jurisdiction under.see sec forex asset mgmt.llc,cir concluding that an order approving a plan of distribution is not final because it does not end the litigation on the merits but is only one part of the overall litigation by the sec quotation marks omitted.jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal is premised on the doctrine though a question of first impression in this circuit,the fifth and sixth circuits have held that the doctrine permits interlocutory review of a order approving a receiver plan of distribution.see sec basic energy affiliated,cir forex asset,at.we agree 
the doctrine permits interlocutory review of that small class of decisions which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen beneficial indus.loan.to fall within the scope of this doctrine,the order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the underlying action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.mohawk indus.carpenter.
the order approving the receiver plan of distribution satisfies all three criteria.first,the order conclusively determines the disputed the recovered assets in the receivership will be distributed.see forex asset,at.second,the manner in which the assets will be distributed is important to the defrauded investors and is independent of the merits of the underlying sec enforcement action against wealth management,putman,and fevola.see id.finally,the order will be effectively unreviewable after the court enters a final judgment because the assets will have been distributed by that point,see interlocutory review makes sense out of fairness to the investors and as a matter of judicial economy.
federal rule of appellate procedure c 
although we can properly exercise jurisdiction over the objectors appeal,there is one more procedural wrinkle we must iron out.federal rule of appellate procedure requires a notice of appeal to specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice.fed.c a.rule c specificity requirement exists to give fair notice of the specific individual or entity seeking to appeal.torres oakland scavenger.this requirement is not a mere formality the supreme court has instructed that t he failure to name a party in a notice of appeal constitutes a failure of that party to appeal.id.at.the rule also provides,however,that a n appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal,or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.fed.c.accordingly,we have held that an appeal should not be dismissed if the notice as a whole is not misleading.bradley work,cir see also torres,at noting that dismissal is not appropriate if the notice of appeal informs the court and interested parties who is filing the appeal.
the notice of appeal in this case names the james and sandra verhoeven revocable trust as an appellant.the verhoevens trust was not the objector below,however the verhoevens objected as individuals.this technical discrepancy does not warrant dismissal.there is no real confusion as to the identity of the appellants.whether the verhoevens appear before this court through their trust or as individuals is not relevant to the facts or merits of their position they are united as parties in interest.see united states segal,cir noting that a technical failure does not warrant dismissal if the appellees have not been misled.
c.the receiver motion to dismiss 
as we have noted,the receiver moved to dismiss the appeal or summarily affirm in light of her distribution of most of the receivership assets after the objectors stay requests were denied.she argues that unwinding this distribution would be inequitable to innocent investors and create administrative difficulties to boot.this argument is premised on an equitable doctrine in bankruptcy referred to as equitable mootness that essentially derives from the principle that in formulating equitable relief a court must consider the effects of the relief on innocent third parties.in re envirodyne,cir.the doctrine has been applied in the context of receiverships,see sec wozniak,cir noting in dicta that the doctrine would govern the decision of whether to undo a distribution by a receiver,overruled on other grounds by sec enter.trust,cir sec capital consultants,llc,cir applying the doctrine when considering whether to unwind a receiver distribution plan in a case see also segal,at invoking the doctrine when evaluating whether to undo a business transaction resulting from a rico forfeiture,and is properly invoked here.
two factors are key to resolving the receiver motion the legitimate expectations engendered by the plan and the difficulty of reversing the consummated transactions.see in re envirodyne,at considering whether a modification of a plan of reorganization would upset legitimate expectations in re unr,cir noting that the court examines the reliance interests engendered by the plan,coupled with the difficulty of reversing the critical transactions.the inquiry is and weighs the virtues of finality,the passage of time,whether the plan has been implemented and whether it has been substantially consummated,and whether there has been a comprehensive change in circu
