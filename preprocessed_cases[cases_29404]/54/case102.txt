ingrid felderhof appeals the district court denial of her motion,filed pursuant to.b,to vacate the default judgment entered against her.for the following reasons,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
during,john felderhof and his wife,ingrid felderhof,were under investigation by the canadian government and the united states securities and exchange commission regarding the development of gold mining prospects by minerals.felderhof was a director and senior executive with.in response to the investigations,the felderhofs obtained legal representation from jenkens and gilchrist jenkens.worried that the felderhofs assets may be frozen or seized as a result of the investigations,jenkens entered into the modified legal representation agreement the agreement with the felderhofs.aside from payment for hourly fees,the agreement provided that jenkens was to be paid a retainer.this retainer was to be paid in cash or valuable assets.around the same time that she entered into the modified agreement,felderhof transferred to jenkens all of the shares of travis close.the sole asset of travis close was a home in williamsburg,virginia 
in,after jenkens completed its work for the felderhofs,felderhof sent a letter to her counsel at jenkens suggesting that they arrange to transfer the williamsburg home back to her.her letter claimed that jenkens only agreed to hold the home as caretaker,and that once all fees were paid that the home would be returned to her.counsel from jenkens responded,explaining that jenkens was not merely caretaker of the home,and that because there were competing claims to the home,jenkens could be forced to commence an interpleader action.
jenkens subsequently filed an interpleader complaint in the southern district of texas to finally resolve ownership of travis close,and the williamsburg home.the complaint named groia company a canadian law firm that had represented the felderhofs and claimed an interest in proceeds from the sale of the residence,john felderhof,and ingrid felderhof as defendants.groia and john felderhof filed answers admitting most of the factual allegations in jenkens interpleader complaint.felderhof did not file an answer.the facts surrounding felderhof failure to file an answer are as follows.
on november,in the cayman islands,felderhof was personally served with a packet of papers including jenkens complaint.the parties dispute whether these papers included a summons as required under fed.civ.upon receiving these papers,felderhof took them to the offices of her lawyer,john chapman,in grand cayman.chapman was out of the country and did not return until november.upon return,he reviewed the papers brought to his office by felderhof.
subsequently,felderhof was served with a copy of the district court order for conference and disclosure of interested parties.the order required counsel to appear for a conference and file a certificate of persons or entities with a financial interest in the litigation within fifteen days.felderhof never filed the requisite certificate.
because felderhof never filed an answer,jenkens filed a motion for entry of default as to felderhof which was granted by the district court.jenkens,groia,and john felderhof then filed a joint motion for summary judgment seeking to have the court declare,inter alia,that jenkens is the sole and lawful owner of the stock of travis close,and its sole asset,the williamsburg home.the district court granted the joint motion and entered final judgment declaring jenkens the sole owner.
after learning of the default judgment against her,felderhof filed a motion in the district court to have the default judgment set aside pursuant to fed.civ.b and fed.civ.b.rule b provides that a party may be relieved from a final judgment for mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.felderhof argued that her neglect in failing to answer was excusable under fed.civ.b because she was never served with a summons,or in the alternative because the summons was lost prior to her or her attorney ever seeing it and that she never learned of her duty to answer.rule b provides that a party may be relieved from a final judgment if it is determined that the judgment is void.felderhof argued that the default judgment was void under fed.civ.b because she was never served with a summons,and thus,the court never had personal jurisdiction over her.after receiving briefing,affidavits,and documentary evidence,the district court summarily denied felderhof motion.
the district court order provided no factual finding as to whether felderhof was served with a summons.nor did the district court address any of the factors traditionally considered in determining whether relief from a default judgment is proper under rule b.
we review de novo a district court conclusion as to whether a judgment is void for lack of personal jurisdiction under rule b.see goetz synthesys technologies,cir.we review the district court denial of relief under rule b for abuse of discretion.see lacy sitel,cir.because of the seriousness of a default judgment,and although the standard of review is abuse of discretion,even a slight abuse of discretion may justify reversal.lacy,at.we normally review the district court factual conclusions for clear error.see lacy,at noting that factual determinations underlying a b denial are reviewed for clear error goetz,at noting that clear error applies to factual findings related to b rulings.however,in this circumstance,we analyze the district court denial of relief under rule b and b in light of the lack of findings provided by the district court.
we turn first to felderhof argument under rule b.on appeal,felderhof argues that the district court judgment was void under rule b because she was not served with a summons as required under rule.see fed.civ.c a summons must be served with a copy of the complaint.recreational,southwest mortgage serv,cir if a court lacks jurisdiction over the parties because of insufficient service of process,the judgment is void and the district court must set it aside.while the district court failed to resolve the disputed facts surrounding the service of summons.a indicates that a district court is not required to state findings or conclusions when deciding a rule b motion.moreover,even where findings are specifically required at the conclusion of a bench trial,under.a,we have recognized that a remand for specific findings is unnecessary if a complete understanding of the issues may be had without the aid of separate findings.armstrong collier,cir.a remand is often deemed unnecessary if all the evidence is documentary and the appellate court can pass upon the facts as well as the trial court,or if all the facts relied upon to support the judgment are in the record and are undisputed,or if the record as a whole presents no genuine issue as to any material fact.id.we have also stated that a remand is not necessary if the record would not support a finding in the appellant favor,and if such a finding would be deemed clearly erroneous had it been made.see kratzer capital marine supply,cir.applying the above rule to determine whether a remand is necessary in this instance,we ask whether the record could support a finding in felderhof favor as to the service of the summons.
the evidence before the district court concerning service of the summons was as follows.jenkens submitted a copy of a signed return of service form.jenkens also submitted two affidavits from the process server.the process server averred that he personally served the complaint and summons on felderhof at a grand cayman shopping mall on november.finally,jenkens submitted a copy of a summons directed to felderhof that had been issued by the district court on november,and initialed by the process server.the process server averred that he initialed a copy of the summons upon serving felderhof.felderhof submitted affidavits from herself and chapman,her attorney in the cayman islands.felderhof admitted that she was served with a bundle of what looked like legal papers while at a shopping mall on november.however,she averred that she did not review the papers served on her.instead,she took them to chapman office on november.chapman was out of the country until november.chapman averred that upon returning to his office he reviewed the papers that had been dropped off by felderhof twelve days prior.his affidavit states that,on november,there was no summons amongst the papers he reviewed.
the only evidence that could support felderhof position is the averment by her attorney that,days after service,the summons was not in the pack of papers in his office.the statement of her attorney regarding the content of the pack of papers on november does not rebut the process server affidavit,and it does not create a material issue of fact as to whether felderhof was served with a summons on november.the record can not support a finding in felderhof favor,and had the district court concluded that felderhof was not served with the summons,such a finding would have been clearly erroneous.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying felderhof relief from the default judgment under rule b based on her claim that she was not served with a summons.
we next consider felderhof claim for relief from the default judgment under rule b.in determining whether good cause exists to set aside a default judgment under rule b we examine the following factors whether the default was willful,whether setting it aside would prejudice the adversary,and whether a meritorious defense is presented.in re dierschke,cir.courts may also consider whether the public interest was implicated,whether there was significant financial loss to the defendant,and whether the defendant acted expeditiously to correct the default.see id.at.the district court need not consider all of the above factors in ruling on a defendant b motion the imperative is that they be regarded simply as a means of identifying circumstances which warrant the finding of good cause.id.at.
however,two of the above factors carry special significance.a district court has the discretion to refuse to set aside a default judgment under b if the defendant fails to present a meritorious defense sufficient to support a finding on the merits for the defaulting party.lacy,at.also,if a district court finds a defendant default to be willful,then the district court need not make any other finding.see dierschke,at.
the district court reached no finding as to willfulness,prejudice,or the merit of felderhof asserted defenses.nor did the district court provide any indication as to whether the remaining factors favor granting or denying relief from the default judgment under rule b.again applying the rule that remand is unnecessary where the record would not support a finding in felderhof favor,we examine the above factors to determine whether the district court b denial may be affirmed despite the lack of specific findings by the district court 
we first address whether felderhof has presented a meritorious defense.in her motion to set aside the default judgment,felderhof most basic defense on the merits was to deny jenkens factual allegations regarding the transfer of the travis close stock and the williamsburg home.jenkens claimed that the stock and home were part of its million retainer under the modified agreement.felderhof claimed that the parties reached a different agreement which provided that jenkens held the stock and the home to secure payment of fees,and that jenkens would return the home to her once jenkens fees were paid.
to support its claim to the residence,jenkens submitted to the district court the modified agreement.the modified agreement was signed by the felderhofs on may,but was intended to memorialize the revised agreement the parties reached conceptually on may.the modified agreement does not,by its terms,refer to the stock of travis close or the williamsburg home as being part of the million retainer.the modified agreement simply states that the retainer can be paid with cash or other valuable assets.the agreement states that jenkens had received certain assets of uncertain value but does not identify the stock or the home as part of the valuable assets used to satisfy the retainer.jenkens also provided the affidavit of andrius kontrimas,a jenkens attorney,who served as felderhof counsel.kontrimas averred that the stock transfer was part of the consideration for the modified agreement and that felderhof agreed to transfer the residence free and clear of any liens or encumbrances.an affidavit from joseph groia,the felderhofs canadian counsel states that a t the time of entering into the agreement with heenan blaikie the predecessor law firm to groia company,the felderhofs agreed to assign a asset for both the benefit of jenkens and heenan blaikie.the asset was the stock of travis close.jenkens submitted two stock dated january,indicating felderhof ownership of the travis close stock,and another dated december,indicating jenkens ownership of the travis close stock.jenkens also submitted what appears to be a blank stock transfer agreement signed by felderhof on may.the blank agreement does not contain any information other than the date and felderhof signature.finally,jenkens argued that its payment of income tax on the home in,and its maintenance of the home over ten years show that felderhof intended to transfer full ownership of the travis close stock and the williamsburg home.
to support the factual allegations in her defense,felderhof presented her own affidavit,as well as letters exchanged between her and kontrimas in regarding the williamsburg home felderhof affidavit states that andrius assured me that my house in virginia would be maintained by his firm and returned to me after the firm engagement was concluded if all outstanding bills to his firm were paid in full.it was andrius promises to maintain the house and return it to me if and when i paid all of his firm legal fees that led me to transfer the house to his firm.prior to jenkens filing its interpleader complaint,felderhof wrote two letters to kontrimas.they reinforce her alleged understanding of the agreement regarding the travis close stock and the williamsburg home.in the letters,felderhof requests that jenkens arrange to transfer the home back to her.in response to felderhof letters,kontrimas wrote that there was never a caretaker arrangement.however,his letter also states that i did tell you that my firm and i would do the right thing regarding travis close,and that other than reimbursement of the fees,expenses,and income tax associated with jenkens holding the house for the previous ten years,my law firm is not claiming any interest in the house or proceeds of sale.his letter continues,we have attempted to follow what i thought was the right thing to do under the terms of our agreement and current circumstances.unfortunately,there does not appear to be an agreement with my suggested course of action.finally,kontrimas indicates in his letter that if a law suit was commenced,he would likely be a fact witness in the litigation to testify as to the facts surrounding the legal engagement and continuing representation.felderhof argues that kontrimas letter supports her contention that there was an agreement regarding transfer of the stock and the home that did not involve the assets becoming part of jenkens retainer.felderhof also argues that jenkens holding the home for ten years without selling it provides circumstantial support for her understanding that jenkens only held the home as security until all fees were paid,when it would be returned to her.
the record clearly supports the fact that felderhof transferred the stock of travis close to jenkens.however,with regard to the details of the transfer of the travis close stock and the williamsburg home,the record on appeal essentially reduces to a swearing match by affidavit.kontrimas and groia aver that the stock and home were transferred outright to fulfill the retainer obligation set forth in the modified agreement,while felderhof avers that the assets were transferred merely as security to ensure payment of fees.felderhof motion and the evidence submitted to the district court provided definite factual allegations,as opposed to mere legal conclusions,in support of her defense
