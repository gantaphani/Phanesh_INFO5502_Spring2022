introduction 
appellant is the former owner of a residence located at van buren street in san mateo.respondents wells fargo bank wfb and phh mortgage corporation phh are two of the former three holders of deeds of trust on that property.respondent robert curtis,an attorney,was the foreclosure trustee for the property,which was sold at public auction in march to wfb.subsequent to that sale and the payment of the sum owing to the third lien holder,a dispute arose as to the proper allocation of the remaining funds,some.appellant claimed that most of those funds should be distributed to him,but respondent lien holders disagreed.respondent curtis accordingly filed a petition for instructions to determine the priority of the liens in the san mateo county superior court.the trial court determined that the remaining funds were properly allocated to the other two lien holders,a determination which left nothing for appellant.he appeals,claiming he was entitled to those funds and respondent curtis was not entitled to his attorney fees and costs.we disagree with both contentions and thus affirm the trial court.
ii.factual and procedural background 
as of march,there were three deeds of trust on appellant property.the first in point of time was to secure a loan of payable to american express centurion bank amex and recorded in january as of march,the sum of was owed on it.the second in point of time was to secure a loan of payable to wfb and recorded in september as of march,the sum of was owed on it.the third was a deed of trust recorded in november to secure a loan made by phh in the amount of as of march,the sum of was payable on it 
as a part of the phh loan transaction in november,amex expressly subordinated its lien to the phh obligation but,importantly,did not subordinate its loan to the wfb obligation.additionally,wfb was not a party to the subordination agreement between amex and phh and,thus,never consented to subordinate its second priority lien to the phh mortgage lien as a result,an inconsistent status of liens resulted,the third lien in point of time,the phh mortgage lien,became senior to the amex lien yet remained junior to the wfb lien,and the first lien in point of time,the amex lien,became junior to the third lien,the phh lien,but remained senior to the wfb lien.
on march,a foreclosure sale was held on the property.wfb purchased the property for at that sale it did so,apparently,to protect its own economic interest since it now held a subordinate lien possibly subject to elimination.the debt then owing amex as noted,was paid from those funds,leaving a little over left over.after the deduction of trustee fees and expenses,this sum was reduced to approximately.
appellant,the homeowner,contended that,after the approximately owing to wfb was paid,the balance of the surplus funds belonged to him,whereas lien holder phh contended that its loan should be paid off from those funds.respondent curtis,the foreclosure trustee designated by amex,was uncertain as to how to resolve this dispute and so,on august,he filed a petition and declaration regarding unresolved claims and deposit of undistributed surplus proceeds in san mateo county superior court,pursuant to civil code section,subdivision c curtis office served copies of this petition on appellant and respondents wfb and phh 
the petition was assigned to superior court judge steven dylina.on march,he issued a minute order requiring phh to file a memorandum in support of its position regarding its entitlement to any surplus funds,and then asked all parties to file legal memoranda regarding whether the case of bratcher buckner th,d bratcher was controlling regarding how such surplus funds should be distributed in a case such as this.such memoranda were filed and a hearing on the legal issue held on march.at the conclusion of that hearing,the court held that bratcher was,indeed,dispositive of the issue before it,and hence barred appellant from recovering any of the surplus funds.subsequently,the two remaining unpaid lenders,respondents wfb and phh,stipulated regarding both the distribution of the remaining surplus funds and the payment of attorney fees and costs to respondent and trustee curtis.a judgment consistent with the court verbal ruling of march and that stipulation was filed on july.
appellant filed a timely notice of appeal the following month.
iii.discussion 
clearly,and as the parties agree in their briefs to us,the issue before us is purely and simply a legal one,and our standard of review de novo.but,as the trial court aptly observed during the course of its march,hearing,the legal issue presented in this case involves an abstract and obtuse area of the law.reduced to the simplest description we can fashion,it is did the failure of the three lenders to make clear the relative priority of all three liens at the time of the subordination agreement mean that,as a matter of law,appellant is entitled to most of the funds left over from the foreclosure sale,and one of the three phh entitled to only a continuing lien on the real property we agree with the trial court that the answer to this question is in the negative,and that it is appellant who is entitled to none of the surplus funds.
appellant makes essentially these arguments in favor of reversal the statutory system applicable in a case such as this was and is civil code section et,the statutes governing foreclosure sales of real property,and not code of civil procedure hereafter,ccp section et,the statutes governing the enforcement of liens on real property via foreclosure the statutes implicated in bratcher section et apply to voluntary lien cases,such as this case,whereas the ccp sections involved in bratcher involved involuntary liens thus,the trial court was wrong to apply the circuity of liens concept discussed and applied in bratcher to a foreclosure of voluntary liens such as was involved here the bratcher court relied substantially on a decision of the texas supreme court,itt diversified credit first city capital itt,but that case dealt with enforcement of liens on personalty under texas statutes identical with sections and of california commercial code,statutes which deal exclusively with liens on personalty,not realty trustee and respondent curtis was wrong in filing the petition for instructions because the whole matter could and should have been resolved under section et thus,the trial court erred in awarding curtis law firm its claimed fees and costs.
respondents counter that because of the failure of phh and amex to deal with the relative priority of the phh and wfb liens in their subordination agreement,that agreement was incomplete,and created a manifest inconsistency in the priority of liens applicable to this real property this inconsistency can and should be dealt with via the circuity of liens doctrine applied in bratcher and cases relied on in that decision,including the itt case section et do not deal with the subject of inconsistent lien status and especially not the priority of real property liens when there is,as there was here,an insufficient subordination agreement thus it is imperative for a court to adapt and apply a rule of law to such cases the rule applied by the bratcher court makes perfect sense in the present context,even if the facts there were slightly different,the fact that this case involved three voluntary liens and the bratcher case involved a combination of voluntary and involuntary liens is irrelevant,as is the fact that this case,unlike bratcher,involved a foreclosure and if appellant prevails on his appeal,he would effectively get a windfall,as he would receive over of surplus funds and one of the three on his property,phh would have only a continuing lien on the property after the foreclosure sale.
we agree with the trial court resolution of these issues and thus rule in respondents favor.in so doing,we start with the same statute the bratcher court started with in its analysis,section other things being equal,different liens upon the same property have priority according to the time of their creation.
but,of course,other things are not equal when there is,as here,a later subordination agreement.as the bratcher court explained,such an agreement is one whereby a party agrees to subordinate the priority of his or her lien to another and cited black law dictionary for the definition of subordination as t he act or process by which a person rights or claims are ranked below those of others a second mortgagee rights are subordinate to those of the first mortgagee.bratcher,supra,th at,d,quoting black law dict.ed,see also miller starr,cal.real property ed et as the bratcher court noted,citing a decision by division four of this court,such agreements must be interpreted to enforce the objective intent of the parties.bratcher,supra,th at,d,citing klingele engelman d.
the parties agree that a deed of trust and the subordination agreement were executed on november,and recorded in the san mateo county recorder office on november.the phh deed of trust imposed a new and large lien on the.the parties to the subordination agreement were phh and amex.by it,amex agreed to subordinate its originally the first lien to the phh lien.in so doing,according to wfb,the creditor left out of the transaction,the parties made what wfb argued to the trial court was a highly unorthodox move.this is so because,absent the subordination agreement,the priority of the parties was,as specified by section,in chronological order,amex,wfb and then phh.but,as a result of that agreement,phh lien became superior to the first lien,that of amex.but,because wfb was not a party to the subordination agreement,its lien continued to have priority over phh lien.similarly,amex lien became,per the subordination agreement,junior to phh lien,but remained senior to wfb second lien.the bratcher court,and the court below,referred to this confusing circumstance as circuity of liens.see bratcher,supra,th at,d.a more understandable,albeit wordier,way of describing it is an inconsistency regarding the priority of real property liens created by successive deeds of trust plus an intervening and incomplete subordination agreement.
a california real estate text cited in bratcher discusses this situation in the context of real estate loans as follows a legal puzzle arises when,by agreement or otherwise,a superior mortgage is subordinated to another mortgage that is subject to intervening liens to which the subordinated superior lien is otherwise paramount.circuity of lien results because the prior mortgage is displaced by the subordinating lien while apparently retaining its priority over the intervening liens.thus,a situation is created in which each is simultaneously prior and subordinate to the other.to illustrate,an admittedly first and prior mortgage on clear and vacant land is subordinated by express agreement to a later mortgage given to secure a construction loan.the loan is not recorded,however,until construction begins,thus automatically preferring mechanics liens.the mortgage is then subordinate to the construction loan but prior to mechanics liens the construction loan is prior to the mortgage but subordinate to mechanics liens and the mechanics liens are prior to the construction loan but subordinate to the mortgage.bratcher,supra,th at,d,quoting bowman,ogden revised cal.real property law mortgages and trust deeds.
as noted above,after the subordination agreement,the order of priority of the three lenders liens was,clearly,inconsistent per that agreement,phh was superior to amex but still junior to wfb,whereas amex was junior to phh,but still senior to wfb.as a result,and following the holding of the bratcher court,the trial court ruled that from the of surplus funds deposited by trustee curtis with the court,would be paid to his office for trustee fees and expenses,and the balance distributed as follows to wfb and to phh.this apparently left phh over short of the amount owed to it,and it also left nothing to be paid to the trustor,appellant.
to explain the result and its bases further,we will quote the holding of bratcher but substitute in place of that court hypothetical parties a,b and c the parties here and the results thus applicable to them thus,phh by virtue of the subordination agreement,is paid first,but only to the amount of amex claim,to which wfb was in any event junior.wfb receives what it expected to receive,the fund less amex prior claim.if amex claim is smaller than phh,phh will collect the balance of its claim,in its own right,only after wfb has been paid in full.amex,the subordinator receives nothing until wfb and phh have been paid,except to the extent that its claim,entitled to first priority exceeds the amount of phh claim,which under its agreement,is to be first paid.see bratcher,supra,th at,d.
appellant objects to this result,arguing that,because what was involved here was a foreclosure initiated under section et,rather than a judicial foreclosure such as was involved in bratcher,the logic of and legal authorities cited in that case are not applicable here.the provisions of section et are,he contends,so comprehensive that,in interpreting and applying them,there is no need to import legal authority such as bratcher arising under and applying different statutes there,the judicial foreclosure provisions of the ccp.
appellant agrees that,after the foreclosure sale,respondent wfb could have and should have received the balance payable on its outstanding loan,about,but no more,and that the original third lien holder in terms of chronology,phh,should not have been allowed to receive any of the surplus funds but,rather,should have been left with its lien on the property.thus,per appellant,the buyer at the foreclosure sale of the amex loan took title to the property subject to the phh senior deed of trust.
appellant also argues that the priorities to be utilized in disposing of funds secured in a sale where the property is subject to multiple liens is adequately dealt with via section,subdivision a,and that the application of the circuity system used in bratcher in the context of foreclosures would necessarily have the effect of chilling the bidding process and thus disadvantaging trustors such as himself.
we disagree with these arguments for a number of reasons.in the first place,nothing in bratcher limits its reasoning regarding the solution to a circuity of liens problem to liens,to the sort of enforcement of judgment process involved in that case.second,bratcher did indeed involve voluntary liens there were two such on the property involved there.third,appellant argument that,because it involved personal property,the itt decision of the texas supreme court is not relevant here is also unpersuasive.as the bratcher court noted for purposes of application of subordination agreements to lien priority,there is no valid basis for a distinction between real property and personalty.bratcher,supra,th at,d see also pacific loan management superior court d,fn.to the same effect is a recent law review article on the subject of lien subordination and the sometimes resulting confusion regarding priorities it urges that there is no reason to limit the itt holding to estate transactions.nation,supra.at,fn.see also duraflex sales service mech.contractors cir.
fourth,and most importantly,the civil code provisions appellant argues are applicable here indeed,per him,totally controlling,section et,do not specify how a court with which funds from a foreclosure sale are deposited should resolve the sort of inconsistent priority situation posited here.
we thus agree with respondents wfb and phh that there needs to be a rule for deciding on the priority of real property liens when an inadequate incomplete subordination agreement creates an apparent inconsistency as regards priorities,and that there is no reason why that rule needs to be,or should be,different when the foreclosure process involves,as it did here,entirely voluntary liens and,thus,the foreclosure process dictated by section et versus when it involves the judicial foreclosure process set forth in the ccp.indeed,as respondent wfb contends in its brief to us,such a consistency in the prioritization process will clearly help,not hurt as appellant argues in his brief,the foreclosure process.
