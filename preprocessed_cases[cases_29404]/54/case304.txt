statement of the case and facts 
the factual background of this case is recited at length in our first opinion,munoz city of union city th,d munoz i.in brief,lucilla amaya was shot and killed in by union city police officer tod woodward,who had been summoned to the house in which lucilla,under the influence of methamphetamine and armed with two knives,was located with her daughter and father.woodward shot lucilla when she made a movement that he testified led him to believe she was going to kill her daughter and father.
at the jury trial,plaintiffs claimed woodward was negligent both because of the manner in which he supervised the police response and because he personally used deadly force.munoz i,supra,th at,d.they also sought to hold union city liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability,based on woodward fault,and separately for the city direct negligence in selecting,training,supervising and disciplining police officers,and failing to promulgate procedures to guide police response to situations such as presented here.id.at,d.the jury returned a verdict against both defendants,apportioning the fault percent to woodward,percent to the city and percent to lucilla.id.at,d.judgment was entered on may.ibid.
the majority in our prior opinion affirmed the judgment against woodward on the basis of the jury finding of unreasonable use of force.munoz i,supra,th at,d.it was conceded that union city was liable for the judgment against woodward under the doctrine of vicarious liability.id.at,d.we held,however,that the judgment against union city based on its direct negligence could not be sustained because this theory of liability was not grounded upon a violation of a statutory duty by the public entity.id.at,d eastburn regional fire protection authority cal th,d,eastburn.
on remand,plaintiffs argued to the trial court that munoz i removed union city from the universe of tortfeasors because of its sovereign immunity,requiring the portion of fault erroneously allocated to the city to be allocated between the remaining tortfeasors,woodward and lucilla.munoz city of union city th,d munoz ii.union city argued that its percent portion of the liability could not be reallocated to woodward and the plaintiffs judgment had to be reduced by that amount.id.at,d.the trial court ultimately agreed with the city,reasoning that,although sovereign immunity limited the plaintiffs ability to collect damages from the city for policy reasons,this did not change the fact that the city was responsible for part of what occurred at the amaya residence.id.at,d.the trial court entered a revised judgment against woodward for percent of the plaintiffs damages.id.at,d.union city paid the judgment against woodward with interest from the date of the original judgment.
in munoz ii,we held that the trial court erred in reducing plaintiffs judgment because,under eastburn,supra,cal th,d,in the absence of a statutory basis for liability,the city was not a tortfeasor,meaning there was no basis for allocating a portion of the plaintiffs damages to the city.munoz ii,supra,th at,d.union city urged us to remand for retrial on the allocation of damages,arguing that this court could not speculate as to how the jury would have allocated fault if woodward had been the only defendant.id.at,d.we concluded,however,that there was no rational basis upon which the jury could have viewed the presence or absence of union city as a defendant as altering woodward and lucilla respective responsibility.id.at,d.since the jury allocation of percent of the liability to woodward and percent to lucilla reflected a determination that woodward was times more responsible than lucilla,we held the plaintiffs damages should be allocated in the same ratio,percent to woodward and percent to lucilla.ibid.our disposition stated the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court,with directions to enter a new judgment apportioning liability percent to lucilla and percent to woodward.munoz ii,at,d.
back in the trial court,plaintiffs filed their motion for entry of a new judgment,seeking postjudgment interest from may,the date of the original judgment.union city opposed the motion with respect to the start date for the interest award.on december,the court granted the plaintiffs motion and awarded interest from the date of the original judgment.notice of entry of judgment was served on january.
union city and woodward filed a timely notice of appeal on march.
discussion 
a judgment bears legal interest from the date of its entry in the trial court even though it is still subject to direct attack.bellflower city school dist.skaggs cal d.when a judgment is modified upon appeal,whether upward or downward,the new sum draws interest from the date of entry of the original order,not from the date of the new judgment.beeler american trust cal d,barnhart edwards cal.on the other hand,when a judgment is reversed on appeal the new award subsequently entered by the trial court can bear interest only from the date of entry of such new judgment.cowdery london.bank cal.stockton theatres,palermo cal d,stockton.the question when interest begins depends on the substance of the order and not mere formalism.snapp state farm fire cas.cal d,snapp state farm.thus,a reversal that practically and legally is a modification,should be treated for purposes of the accrual of interest as a modification.id.at.
in stockton,the trial court had allowed certain costs on appeal sought by the plaintiff but disallowed one item,the cost of a surety bond.the plaintiff successfully appealed.the reviewing court held the bond premium could be included in costs if it was reasonably necessary to preserve appellate rights.the trial court order was reversed and the court directed to determine whether the bond was necessary and,if so,include the premium as an item of costs.stockton,supra,cal d at.after a hearing at which both parties offered evidence,the trial court concluded the bond was not necessary and again denied the item of costs.a second appeal was again successful,the appellate court ruling that the evidence demonstrated as a matter of law that the bond was necessary.id.at.the trial court order was reversed and the trial court directed to allow the bond premium as a cost on appeal.ibid.the trial court did so,providing for interest from the date of its order.on yet another appeal,it was held that interest should have been awarded from the earlier date of the trial court order,finding the bond unnecessary and denying it as an item of costs.id.at.
stockton explained that interest would not run from the original costs order because that order was not modified but rather was reversed with directions for the trial court to hold a hearing
