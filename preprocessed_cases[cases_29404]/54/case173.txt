garnishment of tribal accounts 
the tribe appeal case 
the district court issued writs of garnishment against tribal accounts utilizing the act this legislation was enacted in to address the need for a uniform procedure to collect over five billion dollars worth of related civil debts.see seth katz,federal debt collection under the federal debt collection procedures act the preemption of state real estate laws,emory.the federal government now enforces all related civil debts under the act.id.at.
when faced with these court orders,the tribe claimed some specific exemptions as permitted by the act and also filed a motion to quash all of the writs.this was done pursuant to d,a provision of the act which contains procedures for evaluating exemptions,quashing postjudgment garnishments and requesting a hearing.after an evidentiary hearing,the court found that out of of the accounts were lawfully seized,and the tribe appeals the findings as to fifteen of these rulings.the government argues that the district court properly applied a rebuttable presumption that accounts bearing the tribe federal tax identification number belonged to the tribe.we agree with this contention.not only did the accounts bear the tribe federal tax identification number but the individuals who established each account acknowledged the accuracy of such designation and certified under penalty of perjury that this was the proper identification number for the particular account.accordingly,we find that the district court did not err in applying a presumption of tribal ownership.
given this rebuttable presumption,the district court applied the analysis set forth in b of the act.that section states in pertinent part that u nless it is reasonably evident that the exemption applies,the debtor shall bear the burden of persuasion.id.
the tribe argues that the district court should have instead applied the general rule of presumptions found in federal rule of evidence because,while it did request a hearing,it did not actually claim an exemption under section instead,it alleges that the accounts either were not owned or controlled by the tribe or that it lacked any substantial interest in the accounts.since section b applies only to debtors claiming exemptions,which the tribe alleges it was not doing,the tribe contends that the burden of proof in section does not apply.
we first note that the tribe did actually claim an exemption with regard to two of the accounts.it claimed the money in one account was held in trust by the united states for the benefit of an indian tribe or individual indian.the tribe claimed the money in a second account was received pursuant to the mississippi sioux judgment funds act.thus,for these two accounts,the analysis in section clearly applies.
next we turn to whether the tribe also bore the burden of proof with regard to the remaining accounts.we find that it did have the burden of proving that it did not have a substantial interest in these deposits 
in general,the law places the burden of proof on the party asserting a contention and seeking to benefit from this contention.martinelli bridgeport roman catholic diocesan,cir.furthermore,when true facts relating to a disputed issue lie peculiarly within the knowledge of one party,it is fair to assign the burden of proof to that party.itsi tv productions,agricultural ass ns,cir.here the tribe seeks to benefit from the assertion that it does not have a substantial interest in the subject accounts.the tribe likewise has within its possession the peculiar facts related to its claim.thus,the burden of proof is properly with the tribe,especially given the policy established by congress in section b.
with this determination made,we turn to the question of whether the tribe met its burden of proof on the disputed accounts.we agree with the district court that the tribe clearly failed to do so with regard to the fifteen accounts awarded to the government.to rebut the presumption,the tribe showed that none of the tribal council members were listed as signatories on the accounts.as previously stated,however,the signature cards certified that the accounts bore the correct identification number and that number was the tribe tax identification number.in re clary,evidence as a whole established that corporation,and not corporate owner personally,was obligor on debt where contracts and credit applications were signed utilizing corporate federal tax identification number.the fact that the signature cards were signed by members does not preclude the district court finding.the tribe did not submit evidence that tribal council members were the only members of the tribe with authority to open tribal bank accounts and there was no evidence that a tribal council member must have signature authority on all tribal accounts again,the tribe bore the burden of presenting such evidence.thus,each of these accounts bearing the tribe federal tax identification number is included in the broad definition of property subject to garnishment under the act.
finally,it is arguable that if the tribe does not own or have a substantial interest in these accounts,as it contends,it does not have standing to complain about the garnishment of the accounts.see warth seldin,d plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties united states bmw i convertible,cir in forfeiture context claimant must first show an ownership interest in the property united states in united states currency,cir in governmental forfeiture contest claimant must have colorable ownership,possessory,or security interest in property to have article iii standing.
at oral argument the tribe asserted that the tribe,even without a substantial interest,has standing to protect the constitutional rights of tribal members who were signatories to the accounts.assuming the tribe is attempting for the first time at oral argument to assert parens patriae standing,this argument fails.the doctrine of parens patriae allows a sovereign to bring an action on behalf of the interest of all of its citizens.louisiana texas.however,this doctrine is reserved for actions which are asserted on behalf of all of the sovereign citizens.see united states hooker chemicals plastics,cir.the parens patriae doctrine can not be used to confer standing on the tribe to assert the rights of a dozen or so members of the tribe.see,navajo nation superior court of state of for yakima county,d,tribe lacked st
