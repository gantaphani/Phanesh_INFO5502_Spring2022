gianelli now appeals a may district court order reinstating an october,order imposing payment plan aimed at collecting the remaining amount of restitution owed.gianelli contends that the government is barred from enforcing the restitution judgment because ten years from the date of that judgment passed on may,and california state law precludes enforcement of a judgment after that period of time.he further argues that the original restitution amount was improper because it was not predicated upon the government actual loss,as required by hughey united states,d.
we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that gianelli waived the right to appeal the amount of the restitution order by failing to file a direct appeal,and we affirm the district court may,order reinstating the october,payment plan.
background 
an indictment filed on july,in the united states district court for the northern district of california charged gianelli with six counts of mail fraud,conspiracy to defraud the united states,and counts of receiving kickbacks on subcontracts for defense department procurement contracts.gianelli pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud.the remaining counts were dismissed.he was sentenced on may,to five years of imprisonment,with all but six months suspended,and ordered to pay in restitution to the united states.the remaining counts were dismissed.
on october,while gianelli was on probation,he entered into an agreement with the probation office that he would make payments of per month toward the satisfaction of his restitution debt.gianelli substantially made the payments as agreed.then,on december,in an attempt to satisfy the outstanding balance of,the government applied for a writ of execution under the federal debt collection procedures act.the government wanted to levy the writ on a house and acres of land belonging to gianelli.after numerous objections,the district court,by a september,order,adopted the magistrate judge finding that the united states was entitled to issuance of the writ,but the court suggested an alternative payment plan by which in lieu of execution it would be just to allow gianelli to pay his debt in monthly installments,including interest so as to provide the united states with the full value to which it is entitled 
on september,gianelli agreed to the installment payment alternative,but expressly reserved his objection to the government right to collect his restitution obligation.on october,the district court entered the installment payment order.on october,gianelli timely filed his notice of appeal from that order.gianelli argued that the district court lacked authority to order him to make further payment on his restitution obligation because under california state law that obligation expired in,ten years after the restitution judgment in the case.
on february,we vacated the district court october,installment payment order,and remanded for further proceedings to determine whether restitution was ordered under the federal probation act fpa or the victim witness protection act vwpa see united states gianelli,cir.we did not reach the question whether the restitution obligation was still extant.id.
on remand,the district court determined that the statutory basis for the restitution order was the vwpa.the district court then entered its may,order,reinstating the october,payment plan.the district court found that gianelli had waived his argument as to the propriety of the amount of restitution by failing to appeal the judgment.the district court thus declined to consider gianelli argument that the original restitution amount was not the government actual loss as required by the vwpa under hughey.the district court determined that the vwpa did not at the time of defendant offense limit the time in which restitution could be enforced.the district court also noted that d uring the pendency of this remand the united states received payment of from the voluntary escrow sale of gianelli real property and t he parties have stipulated that if the court finds that the restitution order is not these funds will be applied to and fully satisfy defendant restitution debt,absent a contrary order from the court of appeals.gianelli now appeals this may,order.

we review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.united states horvath,cir.whether an appellant has waived his statutory right to appeal is also a matter of law reviewed de novo.united states shimoda,cir internal citations omitted.
iii.discussion 
enforcement of restitution under the vwpa 
on remand,the district court determined that the restitution order was predicated upon the vwpa.gianelli does not dispute this determination.he argues that,under the then existing version of the vwpa,the government is forbidden from collecting the balance of his restitution debt because under california state law the ability to collect the restitution balance expired ten years after the date of his conviction 
gianelli is correct that california law typically precludes the issuance of a writ of execution to enforce a judgment when years has passed since the judgment was entered.the vwpa provides that a judgment under that act may be enforced by the united states or a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.h,renumbered by sentencing reform act of,a,stat,repealed by antiterrorism effective death penalty act of,a,stat.as gianelli points out,according to federal rule of civil procedure a federal enforcement by writ of execution must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located.a.
although federal rule of civil procedure a provides that the federal government enforcement by writ of execution must accord with the procedures of the state where the court is located,that rule goes on to provide that notwithstanding this directive,a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.fed civ.a.the federal debt collection procedures act of fdcpa is such a statute.the fdcpa provides that,with the exception of conflicting federal law,it provides the exclusive civil procedures for the united states to recover a judgment on a debt.debt includes an amount that is owing to the united states on account of restitution b see also united states mays,cir concluding that the fdcpa civil enforcement remedies may be used to enforce orders of restitution entered under the mvra.the fdcpa further provides that it shall preempt state law to the extent such law is inconsistent.d.
contrary to gianelli argument,the california state law at issue,california civil procedure code section,which would preclude enforcement of a restitution judgment after ten years from the entry of that judgment,is such an inconsistent state law and is,therefore,preempted.the fdcpa provides no time limit for the collection of debts by writ of execution.see.further,because the purpose of the fdcpa is to create a comprehensive statutory framework for the collection of debts owed to the united states government and to improve the efficiency and speed in collecting those debts,at,a state law limiting such collection is inconsistent with the purpose of the act and is,therefore,preempted.see mays,at noting that the fdcpa was enacted to give the justice department uniform federal remedies and postjudgment collect debts owed the united states nationwide.quoting,at.
although not binding upon us,the reasoning of united states pierce,supports our conclusion.in pierce,the district court rejected the argument that where the government proceeded to enforce a judgment under the fdcpa,federal rule of civil procedure a inco
