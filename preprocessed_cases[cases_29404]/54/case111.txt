bank bank,an agency of the united states,was the holder of a promissory note by advanced polymer sciences,aps and of guaranties by donald keehan and arlene keehan guaranteeing the entirety of the aps obligation.bank obtained the note and the guarantees by assignment from bank one,which had originally extended credit to aps.both the note and the guarantees contained cognovit provisions,allowing the beneficiary to confess judgment against the obligor in the event of default.aps defaulted on the debt while the note and the guarantees were in the hands of bank one.several years later,bank,as bank one assignee,confessed judgment in the principle amount of against aps and the keehans.the keehans moved to set aside the judgments in the district court,alleging as meritorious the defenses of laches,res judicata,and that the guarantees were unenforceable due to a fatal conflict among contractual terms.the district court declined to set aside the judgments.bank of the advanced polymer,d.the keehans now appeal,asserting that the applicable statute of limitations had run before bank obtained the judgments and that an arbitration provision in the documents conflicts with the cognovit provision.we affirm.
in the late,aps took out a series of loans from bank one.these loans were typically documented by promissory notes from aps.in august of,the keehans executed a blanket commercial guarantee in which they each personally guaranteed all debts from aps to bank one.there are several important provisions in the guarantees.first,the guarantees contain a confession of judgment,that the parties refer to as cognovit,provision 
guarantor hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers any to appear in any court of record and to confess judgment against guarantor for the unpaid amount of this guaranty,plus attorneys fees as provided in this guaranty,plus costs of suit,and to release all errors,and waive all rights of appeal.
guaranty at.second,the guarantees contain an arbitration provision 
lender and guarantor agree that upon the written demand of either party,whether made before or after the institution of any legal proceedings,but prior to the rendering of any judgment in that proceeding,all disputes,claims and controversies between them,whether individual,joint,or class in nature,arising from this guaranty,any related document or otherwise,including without limitation contract disputes and tort claims,shall be arbitrated pursuant to the commercial rules of the american arbitration association.
id.third,the guarantees contain a broad waiver of defenses 
guarantor also waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of d any defenses given to guarantors at law or in equity other than actual payment and performance of the indebtedness.
id.finally,the guarantees provide that they are governed by ohio law.id.
one of the loans from bank one was an export line of credit to aps,which was originally extended in in the amount of.bank guaranteed the line of credit,presumably as part of a federal trade program.in june of,the line of credit was increased to and,by its terms,became due and payable on november.aps failed to make payment in full on the line of credit and several other obligations to bank one,and the keehans did not step in to pay the debt on aps behalf.
on march,counsel for bank one sent a letter to donald keehan declaring aps in default of all of its obligations to bank one and demanding payment from aps and the keehans.when aps and the keehans failed to make payment,bank one confessed judgment against aps and the keehans in ohio state court on november,on all of the aps obligations except for the line of credit.
the line of credit was excluded from bank one confession of judgment because it was guaranteed by bank.so,instead of confessing judgment against aps on the line of credit note and against the keehans on the guarantees,bank one made demand on the bank guaranty on october,in the amount of.once bank made good on its guaranty to bank one,bank one transferred its interest in the line of credit note and the guarantees to bank by assignment dated january.
bank did not immediately pursue its claim against aps and the keehans,either formally or informally.instead,bank,by the united states attorney for the northern district of ohio,filed suit as assignee of the cognovit note and guarantees in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio on april.the record does not reveal what occurred,if anything,between bank and the keehans in the period between the january assignment and the april confession of judgment.
the district court entered judgment on may,against aps and the keehans,jointly and severally,in the principal amount of,plus interest and the costs of suit.after obtaining the judgment,the government began negotiating with the keehans.when the negotiations proved unsuccessful,the moved on march,to vacate the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
as the basis for their rule b motion,the keehans asserted three purportedly meritorious defenses to the confessed judgments.first,they argued that,because bank one could have sued on the line of credit when it sued on all of aps other obligations,the doctrine of res judicata barred bank,as bank one assignee,from suing later on the line of credit.second,they argued that the arbitration provision in the guarantees conflicted with the confession of judgment provision and,because contracts are construed against the drafter and because federal law favors arbitration,the confession of judgment provision must give way to the arbitration provision,rendering the cognovit judgments invalid.third,they argued that the government failure to act in the more than four years that elapsed between the assignment of the guarantees and filing suit on the guarantees gave rise to the defense of laches.notably,in addressing the laches argument,neither party discussed the applicable or most analogous statute of limitations.
the district court denied the rule b motion in an opinion and order dated march.d.the court focused on the requirement of a meritorious defense in seeking to vacate a judgment under rule b.as relevant to this appeal the court first found that,as a matter of ohio law,res judicata and laches are not meritorious defenses to cognovit judgments.it found that,under ohio law on confessed judgments 
for purposes of a rule b motion a meritorious defense is one that goes to the integrity and validity of the creation of the debt or note,the state of the underlying debt at the time of confession of judgment,or the procedure utilized in the confession of judgment on the note.a judgment on a cognovit note will generally not be vacated for reasons which do not encompass such matters of integrity and validity.
id.at quoting first bank of pandora freed,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.july.from this,the court reasoned that laches and res judicata do not fit within the narrow class of defenses to confessed judgments,as neither defense affects the validity of the underlying debt,the validity of the agreement at issue,or the procedures used to confess judgment.id.
the court then proceeded to address the merits of the laches argument and found them lacking.among other reasons for this finding was that the keehans could not show that bank lacked diligence in waiting several years to confess judgment.in so doing,the court looked to the applicable statute of limitations as a guidepost in determining whether bank had acted in a timely fashion.importantly,the court found that ohio limitation period for actions on written contracts,was the applicable limitations period.with that in mind,the court found that bank approximately delay in confessing judgment did not rise to the level of lack of diligence necessary to support a laches defense.d at.
finally,the district court found that the keehans argument regarding the supposed inherent conflict between the arbitration provision and the cognovit provision could be a meritorious defense to a cognovit judgment,as it went to the validity and integrity of the cognovit provisions themselves.the court acknowledged that the cognovit provision rendered the arbitration pro
