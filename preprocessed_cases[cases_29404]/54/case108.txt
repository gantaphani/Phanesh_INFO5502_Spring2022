this case arises from a statutory interpleader class action brought to determine the rights of various private counsel to certain attorney fees awarded in the nationwide tobacco litigation of the late.several major tobacco companies and a class of private counsel involved in the litigation entered into a settlement agreement that was approved in a final judgment entered by the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.in that judgment,the court enjoined the parties and class members from bringing any further claims relating to the subject matter of the settlement agreement.one of the class members,who had participated in the tobacco litigation in florida,later filed a complaint in a florida state court that raised matters relating to its entitlement to the funds at issue in the interpleader action.
the district court enjoined the parties to the litigation from proceeding with that action,concluding that they were prohibited from doing so by the permanent injunction entered in the interpleader case.florida counsel appeals,claiming that the new injunction exceeds the scope of the settlement agreement and violates the act.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the order of the district court enjoining the parties from proceeding in the litigation.
background 
prior appeal 
this case is on appeal to the sixth circuit for the second time.the relevant factual and procedural background was set forth in the prior decision,lorillard tobacco chester,willcox saxbe,llp,cir,and is reproduced below.
the fee payment agreements 
in the,a number of states filed lawsuits against tobacco companies,seeking damages for the states treatment of illnesses.in and,plaintiffs lorillard tobacco company,philip morris usa,and reynolds company entered settlement agreements with the states,many of which were represented by private counsel.mississippi,texas and florida were the first states to initiate the suits and the first states to settle,and as part of these first three settlements,plaintiffs entered fee payment agreements with the private counsel representing the three states mtf counsel.in september,florida outside counsel entered a florida fee payment agreement florida fpa with plaintiffs.like the fee payment agreements entered by counsel for mississippi and texas,the florida fpa called for a panel of arbitrators to determine the fee award for florida outside attorneys.pursuant to the three fee payment agreements,in december,a panel of arbitrators awarded a total of approximately billion to mtf counsel,including a fee award for florida outside counsel of approximately billion.the three fee payment agreements anticipated that private counsel from other states would have to be paid once those states settled the agreements therefore required plaintiffs to make quarterly payments of million until the fees of all states private counsel were paid,including the billion owed to mtf counsel.each counsel would receive a pro rata share of each quarterly payment,based on the outstanding balance owed to the counsel as a percentage of the total outstanding balance of fees owed to all private counsel.
in november,plaintiffs entered a master settlement agreement msa with states and territories to settle the remaining tobacco lawsuits.pursuant to the msa,plaintiffs entered a model fee payment agreement model fpa with the states to structure the payment of attorneys fees to outside counsel for the jurisdictions.under the terms of the model fpa,each jurisdiction private counsel could either receive a negotiated payment from plaintiffs up front a liquidated fee,or elect to arbitrate and be paid an arbitration award by receiving a pro rata share of the million quarterly payments which plaintiffs had already committed to paying.the model fpa required plaintiffs to set aside billion for the private counsel who negotiated liquidated fees,and to pay in full all liquidated fees by the end of.
plaintiffs negotiated liquidated fees with counsel from approximately jurisdictions,while counsel from the remaining jurisdictions opted for arbitration and a pro rata share of the quarterly payments.counsel from the states and territories that opted for arbitration received a total award of approximately billion including the fee awards to mtf counsel,plaintiffs total arbitration fee payments totaled approximately billion.plaintiffs liquidated fees to the jurisdictions that negotiated such fees totaled approximately million.pursuant to the model fpa,plaintiffs were required to use the remaining million of the billion that it had earmarked for liquidated fees as supplemental payments to the arbitration fee award recipients,in addition to the million quarterly payments.plaintiffs were to make the supplemental payments in five annual installments of million in the fourth quarter of every calendar year beginning in.all of plaintiffs payments were to be made without interest and were unsecured.
in,rather than accept periodic,unsecured,bearing payments,florida counsel terrell hogan ellis yegelwel,fonvielle hinkle lewis,law office of gentry,maher,guiley maher,and nance,cacciatore,hamilton,barger,nance cacciatore sold their interest in the fee award for a lump sum at a discounted price.as part of this transaction,each florida counsel formed a limited liability company llc and assigned its interest in the fee award to the llc.the llcs then issued and sold secured notes to public investors,with the proceeds going to florida counsel in exchange for their interest in the attorneys fees.additionally,the llcs pledged their interest in the fee payments to deutsche bank,the indenture trustee,as collateral to secure payment of the principal and interest on the notes.upon forming the llcs,each florida counsel sold its interest in its llc to an outside investor lester fant,iii and his llcs.
the interpleader action 
in,a dispute arose concerning the supplemental payments that plaintiffs were required to make to arbitration fee award recipients in the fourth quarters of through.to resolve the dispute,plaintiffs filed a class action suit for interpleader relief on august.the complaint alleged that mtf counsel claimed a right to the supplemental payments,even though the fee payment agreements with mississippi,texas and florida did not mention the supplemental payments.the complaint further alleged that the counsel who had entered the model fpa and received fee awards in arbitration claimed that mtf counsel were not entitled to the supplemental payments.the complaint named,as the two classes of defendants,mtf counsel and the counsel who were entitled to arbitration fee awards.upon filing their complaint,plaintiffs deposited approximately amount of the supplemental payment claimed by mtf counsel as their pro rata the district court registry.
on september,florida counsel filed an answer in which they argued that 
f or the protection of the plaintiffs and for the benefit of all private counsel retained by states and territories in connection with any tobacco case defined as any tobacco and health case,the mississippi,texas and florida fee payment agreements set forth a national single payment schedule with quarterly aggregate national caps and the allocation of such proportionally between all private counsel having unpaid fees.in essence,the combination of provisions treats all private counsel equally and,therefore,operates as a most favored nations clause for the benefit of all private counsel.
citing the model fpa,florida counsel noted that any portion of the billion that was not used to liquidate fees was expressly designated to be paid into the arbitrated fee fund for payment of fees of each private counsel who elected for arbitration.florida counsel contended that because private counsel is defined in the model fpa as all private counsel for all plaintiffs in a tobacco case including state outside counsel,florida counsel were entitled to a share of the supplemental payments,based on the combined structure of the florida fpa,the msa and the model fpa.
in the alternative,florida counsel asserted a counterclaim against plaintiffs,alleging that if the district court found that florida counsel were not entitled to share in the supplemental payments,then plaintiffs have breached their express agreement as well as their implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with florida counsel in promising that florida counsel would share equally in all future attorneys fee payments.
in december,the parties reached a settlement in the interpleader action the settlement agreement.mtf counsel agreed to be paid half of the million that they claimed from the supplemental payment and half of their pro rata share of the next four supplemental payments,with the remainder paid to the other states private counsel who took arbitration awards.the district court granted plaintiffs motion for certification of the two classes of defendants and plaintiffs motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement.on january,following a fairness hearing,the district court granted final approval of the settlement agreement.pursuant to the settlement agreement,all parties claiming a share of the settlement fund then filed acknowledgment forms with the district court.
deutsche bank and fant llcs,contending to be the assignees of the entirety of florida counsel fee award,filed acknowledgment forms.florida counsel objected,contending that deutsche bank and fant llcs were not entitled to the supplemental payments because the supplemental payments did not arise specifically from the florida fpa.the district court overruled the objection on the ground that florida counsel were judicially estopped from denying that fant llcs and deutsche bank were entitled to the supplemental payments under the florida fpa florida counsel now timely appeal.

resolution of the first appeal 
in the first appeal of this case,we determined that the district court erred in concluding that judicial estoppel barred florida counsel claim of entitlement to the supplemental payments pursuant to the model fpa.id.at.florida counsel prior argument was that their right to equal treatment with all of the other private counsel who received an arbitration award arose from the florida fpa,and florida counsel later argument was that the supplemental payment did not become due under the florida fpa,but rather under the model fpa.id.because there was no clear inconsistency between the two arguments,judicial estoppel was found not to apply.id.we declined to decide the merits of florida counsel arguments,however,and remanded the case for further development of the record in the district court.id.at.
instant dispute 
while the first appeal to this court was pending,one of the florida and phillips,which appears to have changed names on several occasions,along with its wholly owned subsidiary,gp fl funding iii,suit in a florida state court against lester fant,iii gp fl funding ii,llc galway,llc galway ii,and galway partners,llc.we will refer to the plaintiffs in the florida action collectively as gentry and to the defendants in that action collectively as fant.according to the allegations of the complaint in the proceeding,fant is the founder and principal of each of the three galway defendants galway,llc,galway ii,and galway partners,llc.fant allegedly develops,markets and sells complex financing and securitization transactions which offer lump sum payments discounted from the fee income stream to those who are entitled to incremental payments of money over an extended period of time,such as the attorneys who have received fee awards through the tobacco litigation class settlements.
the complaint states that fant approached florida counsel in late and early with a proposed securitization plan,in which florida counsel 
would receive an immediate lump sum payment of their attorney fees instead of payments over potentially years or more by a form of of their respective rights and interest in all the attorney fees from the tobacco litigation to limited liability companies funding llcs and then by transferring all ownership rights and interests in the funding llcs to the galway defendants.
the immediate lump sum payment allegation is not an entirely accurate characterization of the fant proposal because the agreement called for at least two payments for the florida fpa award and,as discussed below,quarterly payments for any award of supplemental payments.in any event,the complaint further states that the funding llcs would i ssue and sell secured bonds to investors investor bonds,p ledge their interests in the attorney fees to an indentured trustee deutsche bank as collateral to secure payment of the principal and interest on the investor bonds,and u se the proceeds from the sales of the investor bonds to purchase florida participating counsel interest in the attorney fees at a discount.this agreement was formalized between gentry and fant in january through the florida membership interests purchase agreement purchase agreement.
the purchase agreement provides,in section f,for the possibility that gentry would be awarded a share of the supplemental payments discussed above.although these payments would not increase the total fees paid to florida counsel,they would accelerate the distribution schedule and provide for payment of a larger share of the attorney fees sooner than previously expected.the value of the sale of florida counsel interests in these fees,therefore,would increase.if florida counsel were to be awarded a share of the supplemental payments,the purchase agreement provides that the sales price would increase by approximately and that an amount equal to the amount of the increase in each quarterly payment will be payable by the funding llc to florida counsel upon the funding llc receipt of such increased quarterly payment until the redetermined purchase price has been paid in full.
according to gentry complaint,fant told gentry that fant funding llcs would purchase gentry right to the supplemental payments for fant own investment versus for securitization to others.emphasis in original.therein lies the rub.according to gentry,fant misrepresented his plans and instead intended to use the right to the supplemental payments as collateral for a personal loan from deutsche bank to pay for the second lump sum already due to gentry under the purchase agreement.in other words,fant allegedly used the right to the supplemental payments as collateral to pay gentry the discounted balance fant owed on the original,undisputed award under the florida fpa which purportedly did not include the right to the supplemental payments.
the problem caused by fant pledge of the supplemental payments to deutsche bank is twofold.first,fant allegedly conveyed the supplemental payments back to gentry via a new company owned entirely by fl funding iii,order to obtain more time to pay the second lump sum due under the purchase agreement.he also purportedly agreed to protect and assist gentry right and entitlement to the supplemental payments and to indemnify gentry if he failed to protect and preserve gentry title and ownership of the supplemental payments.gentry contends that fant never intended to honor this agreement,but instead purported to pledge gentry interest in the supplemental payments to deutsche bank as collateral for fant the galway defendants personal loan.because fant allegedly assigned the supplemental payments to both deutsche bank and gentry,either the pledge to deutsche bank was invalid or the conveyance to gentry was fraudulent.
the second problem caused by this arrangement is that deutsche bank holds the supplemental payments in trust for the holders of the subordinated investment bonds and will not release the payments until after the maturation date of these bonds in approximately.this means that the supplemental payments will not be immediately released to the funding llcs and therefore will not be distributed as a quarterly payment to gentry.although gentry will still receive the additional purchase price,it will be received as a lump sum in rather than in the fourth quarters of through.
in its complaint,gentry contends that fant breached his fiduciary duty by pledging gentry right to the supplemental payments as collateral for a personal loan,and fraudulently induced gentry to convey its right to the supplemental payments to fant.gentry seeks damages for this allegedly tortious conduct.in addition,gentry seeks a decree that fant llc transferred all rights,title and interest in the supplemental payments to gentry llc,and that gentry is entitled to indemnity from fant for gentry efforts in establishing entitlement to the supplemental payments in the district court.
after gentry brought suit in the florida state court,fant filed a motion in the district court to enjoin gentry from prosecuting the action.fant argued that an injunction was proper under the all writs act,a,because it was necessary to protect the district court judgment and was also necessary in aid of the court jurisdiction.at that time,the first appeal to this court described in part above had not yet been decided.accordingly,the district court determination that deutsche bank was entitled to receive the supplemental payments rather than florida counsel generally,and gentry specifically,was binding on the parties.fant contended that the litigation attacked this decision regarding entitlement to the supplemental payments by,for example,seeking a declaration that fant had assigned the right to these payments back to gentry.he further asserted that the settlement agreement and final judgment in the interpleader action barred gentry litigation.
the settlement agreement between the parties to the interpleader action provides for 
the entry of an injunction by the ohio court,the federal district court enjoining any and all mtf and msa counsel class members from instituting or further asserting any claim in any court or in arbitration against each other or plaintiffs in any proceeding relating to the supplement,future supplements,seeking to reform,discharge or otherwise amend the terms of this settlement agreement,directly or indirectly.
this agreement was reflected in the final judgment entered by the district court,which enjoins the parties from instituting or further asserting any claim relating to any matter set forth in the amended complaint the settlement agreement or seeking to reform,discharge or otherwise amend the terms of the settlement agreement,directly or indirectly.in addition,the settlement agreement provides that t he ohio court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over any and all disputes relating to this settlement agreement,the enforcement of this settlement agreement and any monies to be allocated,advanced or recouped pursuant to this settlement agreement.
gentry responded to fant motion by asserting that,among other things,an injunction would violate the act,because the issues raised in the litigation are allegedly distinct from those raised in the federal action.the district court ultimately agreed with fant,however,and issued the injunction.in reaching its decision,the court reasoned 
now,gentry has changed course yet again,asserting that the florida lawsuit,which seeks damages for the wrongful and illegal pledge of a portion of the supplement payment to deutsche bank,does not relate to matters set forth in the settlement agreement.without regard to the merits,it is plain on the face of the florida lawsuit that it implicates the provisions of the settlement agreement regarding ownership of and claims to the supplement payments.regardless of how gentry florida claims are captioned,or in what form gentry seeks payment of the supplements,the claims in the florida lawsuit relate to any matter set forth in the settlement agreement.gentry is therefore enjoined,based upon the terms of the permanent injunction to which they agreed,from proceeding with the florida lawsuit.

propriety of the district court injunction against the proceedings 
the present appeal raises the issue of whether the district court properly enjoined the parties from proceeding in the florida lawsuit.gentry argues that the district court misconstrued gentry state court action as seeking entitlement to the supplemental payments rather than damages against fant and his entities and,in any event,the district court injunction exceeds the terms of the settlement agreement and violates the act.in response,fant contends that the district court properly construed the claims as relating to the supplemental payments and correctly determined that the claims fall squarely within the scope of the settlement agreement and the district court permanent injunction.fant further asserts that the contested injunction is appropriate under the all writs act and the act because the injunction is necessary in aid of the district court jurisdiction.
general principles of law 
the all writs act provides that t he supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.when a federal court enjoins a proceeding,however,the act limits the scope of the federal court authority a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.as this court has previously recognized,the prohibition extends to indirect injunctions against parties.tropf fidelity title ins,cir.
the first exception to the act is particularly relevant to the instant dispute.congress has expressly authorized the issuance of injunctions against proceedings in cases brought as statutory interpleader actions pursuant to.in such cases,
a district court may issue its process for all claimants and enter its order restraining them from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in any state or united states court affecting the property,instrument or obligation involved in the interpleader action until further order of the court.such process and order shall be returnable at such time as the court or judge thereof directs,and shall be addressed to and served by the united states marshals for the respective districts where the claimants reside or may be found.
such district court shall hear and determine the case,and may discharge the plaintiff from further liability,make the injunction permanent,and make all appropriate orders to enforce its judgment.
this court has described interpleader actions as a recognized exception to the act.ngs,jefferson,cir.
rather than rely on the interpleader exception,fant focuses on the second exception to the act,the necessary in aid of its jurisdiction exception.this exception is applicable to a district court continuing authority to enforce a settlement agreement where the agreement is either incorporated into the court final judgment or the court expressly retains jurisdiction over the agreement in such judgment.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.so long as the court is acting pursuant to this authority,the all writs act authorizes a federal court to issue such commands as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of its orders it has previously issued in exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained.united states city of detroit,cir en banc alteration,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.such orders are excepted from the prohibition of the act.see,atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d acknowledging that the exceptions to the act imply that some federal injunctive relief may be necessary to prevent a state court from so interfering with a federal court consideration or disposition of a case as to seriously impair the federal court flexibility and authority to decide that case kline burke constr.it is settled that where a federal court has first acquired jurisdiction of the of a cause,it may enjoin the parties from proceeding in a state court of concurrent jurisdiction where the effect of the action would be to defeat or impair the jurisdiction of the federal court.
with these basic legal principles in mind,we now turn to the merits of this case,whether the district court injunction against the florida litigation is within the scope of the court permanent injunction in its final judgment and,if so,whether this action violates the act.
permanent injunction in the district court final judgment 
the injunction in the district court final judgment prohibits the interpleader class members from instituting or further asserting any claim relating to any matter set forth in the amended complaint the settlement agreement or seeking to reform,discharge or otherwise amend the terms of the settlement agreement,directly or indirectly.the relevant parties to the instant appeal are all interpleader class members.
in arguing that its complaint does not fall within the scope of the district court injunction,gentry asserts that the district court misconstrued gentry state court action as seeking entitlement to the supplemental payments rather than damages against fant and his entities.instead,according to gentry,the complaint seeks damages from fant for secretly entering into an agreement with deutsche bank that pledges the supplemental payments as collateral,which prevents the release of monies that would otherwise be released after one quarter.gentry complaint further alleges that fant pledge to deutsche bank was wrongful and illegal to the extent the pledge was inconsistent with fant promises and representations.the complaint,as described by gentry,assumes the validity of the distribution to deutsche bank and instead claims that gentry was duped by fant into assigning away gentry rights to these payments.even a cursory review of the complaint,however,belies gentry characterization of the claims actually asserted therein.
in the general allegations section of the complaint,which gentry incorporates into all three of its counts,gentry asserts no less than paragraphs,and it is entitled to the supplemental payments held by the district court because fant in fact conveyed back to gentry the right to these payments.gentry argues,however,that any factual allegations in the complaint regarding its entitlement to the supplemental payments are merely background to put the alleged breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentations in context.a review of the complaint again shows that gentry mischaracterizes its claims.allegations of gentry entitlement to the supplemental payments permeate all three of its asserted causes of action.
gentry first breach of fiduciary the allegation that fant breached his fiduciary duty to gentry by knowingly and intentionally pledging assets,which belonged solely and entirely to gentry and did not belong to fant or his defendant companies,as collateral to deutsche bank,by concealing this pledge from gentry,and by joining deutsche bank in its pursuit of the supplemental payments as pledged collateral.emphasis added.gentry claim for fraud in the inducement similarly states that fant,by and through the galway defendants,knowingly concealed from gentry his intentions to pledge the supplemental payments as collateral to deutsche bank despite the fact that neither fant nor gp ii had any ownership rights to the supplemental payments,and otherwise stripped gentry of its rights to the supplemental payments.emphasis added.finally,in gentry claim for declaratory judgment,gentry asks the state court to d etermine whether plaintiff gp ii fant llc transferred all rights,title and interest in the supplemental payments to gp iii gentry llc.emphasis added.
as demonstrated by these claims,gentry repeatedly seeks a determination from the state court that fant in fact conveyed the right to the supplemental payments back to gentry prior to pledging these payments as collateral to deutsche bank.gentry has therefore attempted to put its entitlement to the supplemental payments,which are under the exclusive control of the district court,at issue in the litigation.as aptly observed by the district court,without regard to the merits,it is plain on the face of the florida lawsuit that it implicates the provisions of the settlement agreement regarding ownership of and claims to the supplement payments.we agree.
gentry attempts to avoid this inevitable conclusion by arguing that the parties to the settlement agreement did not contemplate conferring exclusive jurisdiction of disputes between and among members of the mtf counsel class to the district court.emphasis in original.instead,according to gentry,the adversaries to the interpleader action agreed to settle and forego any further suit against each other as to the respective share of mtf counsel to the interpled funds and to not sue the tobacco companies because of such distribution.footnote omitted.but this argument directly conflicts with the expansive language used in the settlement agreement to describe its scope.for example,the parties expressly conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the district court over any and all disputes relating to the settlement agreement and involving monies to be allocated,advanced or recouped pursuant to the agreement.
in addition,the parties agreed that the only way for a class member who did not appeal the final judgment to receive a distribution from the settlement fund is to file an acknowledgment form with the district court.the court incorporated this provision into its final judgment where it states that the settlement fund shall remain under the control of this court and shall be disbursed pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.this language therefore brings the proper distribution of the fund at least initially from the court within the terms of the settlement agreement and the final judgment.
another section of the settlement agreement supports this interpretation,where the agreement recognizes that some of the class members participated in a transaction where some or all of the interests of one or more private counsel in and to their respective fee awards for such state were pledged or assigned in connection with a securitization transaction.this provision would be wholly irrelevant and unnecessary if it were not the parties intent for the settlement agreement to govern the distribution of the subject funds to those to whom the rights to the monies had been assigned.and in order to make a legally valid distribution,the district court must determine the propriety of the securitization transaction assignments,including gentry assignment to fant.gentry argument that the parties did not intend the settlement agreement to govern disputes between mtf counsel and their assigns therefore lacks merit.accordingly,gentry claims in the litigation fall squarely within the subject matter of the settlement agreement and the terms of district court permanent injunction.
injunction against the litigation 
we must next consider whether the injunction against the litigation nevertheless violates the act,as argued by gentry.fant contends that the injunction was permissible under the necessary in aid of its jurisdiction exception to the act.we agree with fant on this point for the reasons set forth below.
final judgment 
as detailed above,the district court in its final judgment enjoined the parties from bringing any claim related to the subject matter of the settlement agreement.and w hen a court issues an injunction,it automatically retains jurisdiction to enforce it.wesch folsom,cir see also peacock thomas,d describing a federal court inherent power to enforce its judgments in re diet drugs prods.liab,cir emphatically,the district court is empowered to protect its jurisdiction and effectuate the settlement agreement.the district court enjoining of the litigation,therefore,is a proper means of enforcing its previously entered permanent injunction.
gentry seeks to avoid application o
