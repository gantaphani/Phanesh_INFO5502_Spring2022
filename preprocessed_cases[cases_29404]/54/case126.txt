after obtaining a million judgment against peter rogan rogan,dexia cr√©dit local dexia instituted supplemental proceedings to locate rogan assets and satisfy its judgment.in the course of supplemental proceedings,dexia requested the turnover of assets held in trusts that rogan had established,including trusts in the names of each of his three adult children,robert,brian,and sara the rogan children.after the district court froze the trust assets in the course of preliminary proceedings,the rogan children intervened in the supplementary proceedings.the case advanced to a bench trial,and the district court concluded that the trust assets actually belonged to and were controlled by rogan.the court entered a final judgment ordering the turnover to dexia of nearly all the assets of the rogan children trusts,and terminating the rogan children interests in those trusts.the rogan children appealed.finding that none of the issues raised on appeal requires reversal,we affirm the decision below.
background 
a.the underlying lawsuit and judgment 
this case has its genesis in the medicare and medicaid fraud scheme that rogan perpetrated through edgewater medical center emc,a hospital on chicago north side,from at least to.see united states rogan,d rogan i,aff united states rogan,cir.in,an entity that rogan formed and controlled purchased emc.the entity managed and administered emc,and rogan served as emc chief executive officer.
in,emc was sold to northside operating company.to finance the purchase,rogan caused the illinois health facilities authority to issue approximately million in bonds.although he had sold emc,rogan retained control of the hospital after the sale through a series of transactions,and he then caused emc to enter into management contracts with two entities that he also controlled,braddock management,and bainbridge management.in,rogan arranged to refinance the bond debt,and to this end,in june,he secured a letter of credit from dexia guaranteeing emc repayment of the bonds.eventually emc fraud was discovered,and the government stopped medicare and medicaid payments to emc.this caused financial distress to emc and,eventually,required dexia to pay million on emc behalf to satisfy obligations to bondholders.dexia was unable to obtain reimbursement from emc.
in november,dexia sued rogan and his management company partners for fraud,conspiracy,and other torts.dexia alleged that,during the due diligence process that led to its issuance of the letter of credit and after dexia issued the letter of credit,rogan defrauded dexia by concealing that a significant portion of emc revenue was obtained through medicare and medicaid fraud.rogan vigorously defended against the lawsuit for numerous years,but then moved to canada and abandoned his defense.in may,dexia obtained a default judgment against rogan and his partner companies for million.
b.the government false claims act suit 
in,the federal government instituted litigation against rogan under the federal false claims act fca,for the submission of false medicare and medicaid claims for patients referred to emc in that case,the district court found that rogan conspired with another emc officer and physicians to pay kickbacks and other improper benefits to the physicians in return for patient referrals.these referrals resulted in substantial profits for rogan.see rogan i,d at.although the government lawsuit focused on particular false claims submitted from through,the district court found that t he conspiracy was evident in the early.id.the court also concluded that the conspiracy began albeit on an apparently smaller scale at least as early as.see id.findings related to dealings between roger ehmen and ravi barnabas id.at findings related to barnabas.the court concluded that the government proved that,from through,rogan caused emc to submit over million in false claims to medicare and medicaid.id.at.
c.the rogan children trusts 
in,rogan and his wife,judith,set up three trusts in florida for the benefit of their children the domestic trusts.the rogan children are the only named beneficiaries of the domestic trusts.a stock interest in emc was the initial corpus for each of the domestic trusts.after emc was sold in august,the domestic trusts received money in exchange for the emc stock they held.the domestic trusts also owned entities that,in turn,owned the management companies through which rogan continued to operate emc following its sale.during the period when rogan operated emc through these through domestic trusts received millions of dollars in distributions from the entities.fredrick cuppy,who also served as rogan lawyer,was the trustee.he was later removed as trustee by the district court as part of the supplemental proceedings.
in june,rogan formed three additional trusts for his children under belizean law belizean trusts and collectively with the domestic trusts,the trusts or rogan children trusts.he funded the belizean trusts with interests in several of his companies.a company owned by cuppy served as the trustee.
supplemental proceedings 
to collect its may judgment,dexia served peter rogan and judith rogan with citations to discover assets.see.ilcs.on september,dexia initiated supplementary proceedings against the rogan children trusts by serving a citation on cuppy,the trustee of those trusts.in february,dexia served citations upon the individual children.
as part of the proceedings,the district court granted various temporary restraining orders tros to freeze assets.before the court converted the tros into preliminary injunctions,the rogan children moved to intervene for the purpose of protecting their claimed beneficial interests in the trusts.the parties engaged in discovery related to the turnover proceedings,and the rogan children lodged various procedural and jurisdictional objections,none of which successfully ended the proceedings or removed the trust assets from consideration.
during the course of ruling on the various challenges lodged by the rogan children,the district court judge discovered that two of the defendants in dexia underlying lawsuit,bainbridge management,bainbridge lp and braddock management,braddock lp,were citizens of both illinois and belize.this dual citizenship destroyed diversity jurisdiction,which does not exist where the party on one side of a case is is a french the party on the other side is both domestic and foreign.see salton,phillips domestic appliances pers.care,cir.the district court dismissed bainbridge lp and braddock lp pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure as nondiverse,dispensable parties.the district court also discovered that the may default judgment,which had been issued as a final judgment,was not actually final because it did not dispose of claims against bainbridge lp which was in bankruptcy and subject to an automatic stay,and the district court had not otherwise made any findings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the court then ruled that the effect of dismissing the dispensable parties,including the one that had been in bankruptcy,was to make the may default judgment against the remaining defendants,rogan and bainbridge management,distinct from bainbridge lp,retroactively final as of may.
the district court conducted a bench trial on dexia motion for turnover.on july,the court issued a opinion granting dexia motion for turnover of assets,including those in the rogan children trusts,with the exception of from each trust that was gifted to the trusts by an individual named scott gross.this relief was predicated upon the court finding that the trust assets actually belonged to rogan.as alternative relief,the court imposed a constructive trust on the property held by the trusts.again,the court excluded the that dexia did not establish was the result of rogan fraudulent activities.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
subject matter jurisdiction 
the rogan children argue that the district court lacked and we lack subject matter jurisdiction over this case.they contend that dexia has formed an unincorporated association with lasalle bank,an illinois corporation,and that lasalle citizenship must be considered when determining whether the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to a.they assert that,because some of the defendants are also illinois citizens,dexia unincorporated association with an illinois citizen destroys complete diversity of citizenship.the rogan children claim that dexia and lasalle should be considered an unincorporated association is based on the following relationship more than one year after dexia issued emc the letter of credit,lasalle entered into a participation agreement with dexia to assume a portion of dexia risk.
we must resolve a recognized issue of subject matter jurisdiction before any other action is taken on a case,united phosphorus,angus chem,cir,and we review subject matter jurisdiction determinations de novo,sapperstein hager,cir.
in the proceedings below,the district court determined that only dexia,not lasalle,was the real party in interest under federal rule of civil procedure.the district court reasoned that lasalle act of taking on part of the obligations with respect to the letter of credit did not transform it into a real party in interest with regard to dexia tort claims against rogan.the rogan children do not challenge this finding on appeal.instead,they assert that the finding under rule has no bearing on their jurisdictional argument and that the narrow issue on appeal is whether dexia and lasalle,by sharing the profits and losses under the letter of credit,were operating as an unincorporated association citing our holding in indiana gas home insurance,cir,that all of the members belonging to a lloyd of london syndicate had to be considered for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,the rogan children criticize the district court for restricting its analysis to whether dexia and lasalle formed a joint venture or partnership,as opposed to some form of unincorporated association akin to a lloyd syndicate.thus,the rogan children frame the issue as whether dexia and lasalle operated as an unincorporated association,and they leave unchallenged the trial court determination that dexia sued on its own behalf and is the real party in interest.
it is true that when the question is how the citizenship of a single artificial entity is to be determined,the citizenship of that entity is not determined using the real party to the controversy test.carden arkoma.but this principle does not help the rogan children unless dexia was such an unconventional plaintiff,that is,someone or something other than either a natural person suing in his own rather than a representative capacity,or a business corporation,cosgrove bartolotta,cir,and not a corporate entity.if dexia is a corporate entity,the inquiry regarding its citizenship remains straightforward.a corporation is a corporation is a corporation,cote wadel,cir,and determining its citizenship is as simple as looking at the state where it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business,c.as we explained in society of lloyd estate of mcmurray,cir,a lawsuit does not raise the subject matter jurisdiction problem that we addressed in indiana gas when a corporation is the named party 
in indiana gas,we held that complete diversity did not exist between the parties because the complaint named as defendants certain underwriters at lloyd,london and certain london market insurance companies.see at.because these entities were not corporations,we treated them as partnerships for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,and since at least one lloyd name was domiciled in the same state as the plaintiff,complete diversity did not exist.see id.at.here,the plaintiff is the society of lloyd,a corporation incorporated under the laws of england,and there is no question that diversity jurisdiction exists.
estate of mcmurray,at citing indiana gas,at.likewise,dexia,the entity that initiated the lawsuit to recover for fraud,conspiracy,and other related torts,is a corporation incorporated under the laws of france and has its principal place of business in france.and the status of the named litigant that the litigant is an entity rather than a name for an unincorporated association such as a partnership.downey state farm fire cas,cir citing carden,indiana gas.
the rogan children can not escape the conclusion that this case did not involve an unconventional party that should have prompted the district court to take heed of a jurisdictional warning flag in relation to that entity.cosgrove,at.the rogan children claim that the district court should have entertained further notions that dexia cr√©dit local actually meant something akin to a lloyd of london syndicate or other form of unincorporated association is unfounded.complete diversity of citizenship exists,and we affirm the district court determination regarding subject matter jurisdiction.
finality of judgment 
in illinois,supplemental proceedings under are not available to creditors until after judgment capable of enforcement has first been entered in their favor.marble emporium,vuksanovic,citing cases discussing see also.a a supplemental proceeding authorized by section of the code of civil procedure may be commenced at any time with respect to a judgment which is subject to enforcement.ilcs a.the rogan children argue that,when dexia issued citations to discover assets in the supplemental proceedings,it held a judgment and that the citations were therefore invalid.they submit that although the district court entered a final judgment nunc pro tunc after dismissing nondiverse parties under federal rule of civil procedure,the remainder of the proceedings was void because no new citations based on the final judgment were issued 
in this appeal,the rogan children do not dispute that the district court dismissal of nondiverse parties was a proper exercise of its authority under rule.see,hurley motor coach,cir.we recently held,in a separate appeal filed by judith rogan challenging the district court issuance of a preliminary injunction in these same supplementary proceedings,that the district court properly dismissed the nondiverse parties under rule and preserved its jurisdiction.dexia credit local rogan,cir.
on the claim that they do the dismissal of parties was insufficient to retroactively render the may judgment disagree.the rogan children make no attempt to explain what purpose would be served by requiring that the discovery citations be.nor do they explain why it would be necessary.rule dismissals are retroactive,at,and the complaint is read as if the dismissed party had never been included,leblanc cleveland,cir.retroactive applications of rule have permitted appellate courts to affirm decisions of district courts on the merits despite the fact that the change in the parties did not occur until much later in the litigation,thereby avoiding the waste of time and resources that would be engendered by remanding to the district court or by forcing the parties to begin anew,at.the supreme court observed 
i f the entire suit were dismissed,would simply refile in the district court against the defendants remaining after the rule dismissal and submit the discovery materials in hand.the case would then proceed to a preordained judgment should not be compelled to jump through these judicial hoops merely for the sake of hypertechnical jurisdictional purity.
id.at citing,cir easterbrook,dissenting.the rogan children have offered us no answer to this rationale.their suggestion that dexia should be required to jump through the judicial hoop of refiling their citations,only to proceed in the district court to a preordained judgment,does not comport with the efficient administration of justice.
moreover,the district court actions were entirely consistent with considerations of finality in those situations where a judgment becomes final during the pendency of an appeal.see lovelette ry,cir t he failure to certify a judgment on a separate claim as final under rule b can be cured where the rest of the claims and parties are dismissed during the pendency of the appeal.just as in lovelette,w e see no reason not to extend an analogous principle to the present situation,particularly when we also allow nunc pro tunc orders to render orders final and confer appellate dismissal of the appeal or need to the notice of appeal,see local,amalgamated meat cutters and butcher workmen of am.thompson farms,f d,cir holding that a district court has the power to add a rule b certification to an order nunc pro tunc after the filing of a premature notice of appeal.see also king gibbs,cir.
once the district court properly dismissed the parties,only those parties against whom judgment had already been entered remained in the case.the retroactive application of rule rendered the judgment final and enforceable against these remaining parties,and the court did not err in allowing the matter to proceed upon the citations that had already issued.
scope of a district court authority in supplemental proceedings 
federal rule of civil procedure a provides that t he procedure on execution of a money judgment and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located.a.in illinois,ilcs and illinois supreme court rule govern supplemental proceedings.supplementary proceedings are processes that support the judgment creditor in asset discovery and final satisfaction of judgment.star ins.risk mktg.group,cir.the applicable statute provides 
a judgment creditor is entitled to prosecute supplementary proceedings for the purposes of examining the judgment debtor or any other person to discover assets or income of the debtor not exempt from the enforcement of the judgment,a deduction order or garnishment,and of compelling the application of assets or income discovered toward the payment of the amount due under the judgment.
ilcs a.the service of a citation to discover assets initiates supplemental proceedings.see also cacok covington,cir.
on appeal,the rogan children assert that the district court acted outside its authority in adjudicating the substantive property rights of third parties under equitable theories such as alter ego.they claim that an analysis of the scope of the proceedings is complicated by the fact that even though dexia was proceeding under an alter ego theory throughout the case,the district court ultimately analyzed the issue under an ownership theory pursuant to our opinion in star insurance.in that case,we held that the allegations that must be made to pierce the corporate veil do not fall within the scope of supplemental proceedings wherein the only relevant inquiries are whether the judgment debtor is in possession of assets that should be applied to satisfy the judgment or whether a third party is holding assets of the judgment debtor that should be applied to satisfy the judgment.star ins,at citing pyshos dev.the rogan children assert that regardless of the theory used by the district court,it did not have the authority to adjudicate their personal property rights.
although the rogan children contend that the district court altered the legal theory upon which it relied and thereby disadvantaged them,they do not clearly show what this means to their appeal.additionally,we do not agree with their characterization of how this case was framed or presented.the district court final order granting turnover of assets was issued on july.earlier,in a march,order denying summary judgment on the rogan children claim that dexia could not pursue sham trust,constructive trust,or alter ego theories without filing a separate claim,the district court wrote 
this argument misstates what dexia is attempting to accomplish in the supplemental proceedings.dexia has already prevailed on its claims against peter rogan.dexia now seeks to satisfy its judgment against rogan by collecting assets in the possession of the rogan domestic trusts that dexia contends are actually peter rogan assets based on the equitable theories listed above.dexia does not need to assert a new claim to engage in such proceedings to enforce its judgment against peter rogan.though the situation might be different were dexia seeking to hold the rogan domestic trusts directly liable to dexia in other words,irrespective of whether the trusts assets are actually peter rogan,dexia is not now attempting to do so.
dexia cr√©dit local rogan,d.in response to the rogan children argument that dexia could not use alter ego or veil piercing claims in a supplementary proceeding,the court explained that illinois allows a judgment creditor to reach assets of a debtor that are in the hands of third parties,which was what dexia was seeking.id.at t he rogan children place undue emphasis on the labels dexia has used to describe its equitable theories.in these supplementary proceedings,dexia does not attempt to impose liability directly on rogan domestic trusts.rather,dexia asserts that those trusts hold peter rogan assets.dexia may use equitable theories,including an alter ego theory or similar theories,to attempt to prove that assertion.in a much earlier order granting injunctive relief,the court similarly reasoned illinois supreme court rule a,which governs citation proceedings,likewise permits a proceeding to be against the judgment debtor or any third party the judgment creditor believes has property of or is indebted to the judgment debtor.that is the primary basis upon which dexia has proceeded in this contention that third parties hold property that actually is peter rogan,even though it is held under some other guise.
dexia cr√©dit local rogan,wl,at.consequently,the rogan children are the only parties who have attempted to construe dexia claim as one that is akin to piercing the corporate veil.
the rogan children have shown us nothing that convinces us that the district court granted relief outside the proper scope of supplemental proceedings.a district court may inquire as to whether third parties hold assets of the judgment debtor,and once it is discovered that a third party holds such assets,the court may order the third party to deliver up those assets to satisfy the judgment.pyshos,at see also dowling chi.options,the provisions of section are to be liberally construed,and the statute gives the court broad powers to compel the application of discovered assets or income in order to satisfy a judgment.kennedy four boys labor,stating that the illinois statute gives courts broad powers to compel the application of discovered assets or income to satisfy a judgment elmhurst auto parts,chevrolet.noting that the supplemental proceedings statute is not a mere discovery statute,but permits the court to determine the rights of third parties.as long as the action seeks the judgment debtor assets and does not concern personal liability,it falls within the scope of a supplemental proceeding.kennedy,d at explaining that a claim brought pursuant to the fraudulent transfer act was properly brought in supplementary proceedings because it did not concern personal liability,but attempted to avoid the transfer of assets,sought recovery of the actual assets transferred,and ordered that the property be returned.here,the district court determined that the children trusts contained assets of the judgment debtor,peter rogan.accordingly,it held that dexia was entitled to turnover of the assets of the children trust,terminated the interests of the rogan children in the trusts with the exception of,and ordered the trustee to turn over trust assets to dexia.following turnover,the trusts would continue to exist and hold any property that did not belong to peter rogan.in taking this action,the district court did not exceed the broad power and authority that is granted to courts in supplemental proceedings to apply assets to satisfy a judgment.
in their reply brief,the rogan children assert for the first time that the imposition of a constructive trust requires proof of elements that extend beyond the scope of supplemental proceedings the rogan children have not independently and sufficiently developed their theory challenging the district court authority to impose a constructive trust.see jtc petroleum co piasa motor fuels,cir warning that a litigant must do more than assert a novel theory that it wants us to buy see also long teachers ret.of,cir underdeveloped arguments are considered waived.moreover,as we have often noted,arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are waived.see hess mach.tool,cir.
right to a jury trial 
the turnover order challenged in this appeal was issued after a bench trial.the rogan children claim that they should have been granted a jury trial pursuant to the seventh amendment because the district court determination of the true ownership of trust assets is an action at law,not equity.
the right to a jury trial in federal court hinges on federal procedural law.int l fin.servs.chromas techs.canada,cir.federal rule of civil procedure a preserves to parties the right of a trial by jury as declared by the seventh amendment to the constitution or as otherwise provided by federal statute.the seventh amendment provides that i n suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.const.amend.vii.to determine whether a particular action will resolve legal rights and thus give rise to a jury trial right,we must examine both the nature of the claim for relief and the remedy sought.marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land water,cir.first,we must compare the action to actions brought in the courts of england prior to the merger of the courts of law and equity.second,we examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature.tull united states,citations omitted.the abstruse historical search for the nearest analog,id.at chauffeurs,teamsters helpers local terry,is less important than determining whether the remedy sought is equitable or legal in nature,see tull,at granfinanciera nordberg,marseilles,at.
here,the outcome of the second and more important inquiry regarding the nature of the remedy sought leads to the conclusion that the rogan children were not entitled to a jury trial.legal remedies traditionally involve money damages,while equitable remedies are typically coercive and enforceable directly on the persons or things to which they are directed.int l,f d at citing life annuity ins.knudson.a suit seeking only equitable relief is not a suit at common law,regardless of the nature of the issues likely or even certain to arise in the case.marseilles,at.in the supplemental proceedings,dexia sought the turnover of assets belonging to peter rogan,the judgment debtor.the district court explained 
the rogan children are the putative beneficiaries of those trusts.as such,their interests in the trusts are intangible assets.dexia is attempting to terminate the children intangible interests and obtain a turnover of the assets of the trusts,which are held not by the children,but by the trustees of the trusts.
order at.at no time did dexia seek derivative liability against the trusts themselves or money damages from the rogan children,and the relief ultimately obtained was enforceable directly on the trusts and was equitable in nature.see resolution trust ruggiero,cir holding that an order that property be turned over to the judgment creditor because it was actually the property of the judgment debtor was in the nature of specific performance in re estate of beckhart,describing the remedial and equitable character of constructive trusts see also people ex rel.hartigan candy club,d,describing a constructive trust as a device used by chancery to compel one who unfairly holds property to convey the property to the party to whom it justly belongs.the nature of the relief sought was purely equitable,thus it mattered not whether any of the issues were legal in their nature.
the rogan children were not entitled to have a jury decide whether rogan owned and controlled the assets that were held in the children trusts,and the district court decision to conduct a bench trial does not warrant reversal.
statutes of limitations 
under federal rule of civil procedure a,illinois procedural law applies to dexia effort to enforce its judgment,and illinois law imposes a limitations period.ilcs a except as herein provided,no judgment shall be enforced after the expiration of years from the time the same is rendered,except upon the revival of the same by a proceeding provided by section of this act.in may,the district court entered judgment against rogan.dexia filed its motion for turnover of assets well within seven years of this judgment.nevertheless,because dexia pursued the equitable remedy of a constructive trust on any assets belonging to rogan that were held in the children trusts,the rogan children claim that the statute of limitations does not apply and instead that illinois statute of limitations applies.see hagney lopeman,holding that,in illinois,a statute of limitations applies to an action for constructive trusts.they contend that the limitations period began to run in early when the federal bureau of investigation informed dexia that rogan was being investigated for medicare fraud or,at the latest,when dexia filed its own lawsuit in november.this,according to the rogan children,would have required dexia to file its claim for the imposition of a constructive trust by november.
we review statute of limitations determinations de novo.in re marchfirst,cir.dexia maintains that the rogan children have waived this statute of limitations argument.although the rogan children asserted as an affirmative defense in response to the citations that dexia claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations,they did not claim that the statute of limitations for constructive trusts barred dexia claim until they filed a brief on june.the only specific statute raised prior to trial was florida statute of repose.failure to argue a specific statute of limitations,even if others are argued,constitutes waiver.anderson flexel,cir.here,because the rogan children failed to identify the statute of limitations for constructive trusts before the trial,dexia had no notice that the rogan children were attempting to bar their claim on this basis,and it was thus prevented from defending against this limitation defense through the presentation of evidence.see,e,frederickson blumenthal,noting that the burden is on the plaintiff to show the application of illinois discovery rule to justify filing constructive trust action outside the statute of limitations.dexia does present argument in response to the rogan children belated statute of limitations claim that dexia initiated enforcement by serving citations in june and september,before the november limitations deadline proposed by the rogan children and that the limitations period was tolled under the discovery rule because cuppy obstructed dexia from obtaining critical information about the trusts.they contend that dexia november lawsuit only established that it was aware that rogan fraudulently induced it to issue the letter of credit by concealing fraud at emc and that the trusts received proceeds of the sale of emc,not that the transfers were part of rogan scheme to defraud creditors.the rogan children failure to raise the specific statute of limitations defense has limited dexia ability to fully develop the arguments against application of the statute of limitations and highlights why its failure should constitute waiver.for their part,the rogan children have not presented any excuse for waiting until after the trial to raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.
in any event,all of this is beside the point if the statute of limitations is inapplicable in this suit,as the district court held.the statute the rogan children cite states 
except as provided in section of the uniform commercial code,approved july,as amended,and section of the illinois public aid code,approved april,as amended,actions on unwritten contracts,expressed or implied,or on awards of arbitration,or to recover damages for an injury done to property,real or personal,or to recover the possession of personal property or damages for the detention or conversion thereof,and all civil actions not otherwise provided for,shall be commenced within years next after the cause of action accrued.
ilcs.the supplemental proceedings in this case were not an action on a contract or award of arbitration,an action to recover damages for injury to property or to recover the possession of personal property,an action for damages for detention or conversion of such property,or an action not otherwise provided by statute.the proceedings were initiated to enforce and satisfy a money judgment.thus,the statute specifically governing such proceedings determines the rights and liabilities of the parties.see.a ilcs a.dexia obtained a judgment and then issued citations to discover assets within seven years of obtaining that judgment,which is the recognized procedure in illinois to enforce a judgment and to discover and recover assets that may be applied in satisfaction of the judgment.see pontikes perazic.we find no error in the district court application of the statute of limitations.
the rogan children also argue that dexia motion for turnover of assets in the domestic trusts is barred by florida statute of repose.under florida law,an action based on fraud must be initiated within twelve years after the date of the commission of the alleged fraud,regardless of the date when the fraud was or should have been discovered.stat.a.the district court held,we believe correctly,that dexia action seeking turnover of rogan assets held in the trusts did not implicate florida limitations period for fraud,but was instead governed by the same limitation that applies to the enforcement of judgments.when dexia initiated supplemental proceedings,it had already obtained a judgment based upon rogan fraud.the rogan children provide no argument to persuade us that,merely because some of the assets amenable to turnover are held in trusts that were first established in florida,the nature of the citation proceedings has been altered or requires application of a separate statute of repose.the only choice of law analysis they make is under florida law,but rule a provides that proceedings supplemental must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located.the rogan children do not advance any choice of law analysis under illinois law.
we conclude that the statute of limitations and the statute of repose cited by the rogan children did not bar the supplemental proceedings.
district court findings of fact 
after a bench trial,a district court findings of fact may only be set aside if they are found to be clearly erroneous.a.we reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.rk see,wl,at cir,quoting anderson city of bessemer city.when there are two permissible views of the evidence,the district court choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.johnson doughty,cir.however,we review determinations regarding the application of issue preclusion de novo.see united states thyfault,cir.
the rogan children challenge the district court finding that rogan fraud began in the early,and no later than,a finding that was critical to the district court imposition of a constructive trust on the bond proceeds.this finding was not relevant to the district court determination that peter rogan owned the assets in the trusts.to make this finding regarding the beginning date of rogan fraud,the district court determined that findings from rogan i,d,precluded relitigation of the issue.
issue preclusion bars successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.taylor sturgell,holding that the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by federal common law.preclusion applies if the issue sought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the prior action the issue was actually litigated the determination of the issue was essential to the final judgment and the party against whom estoppel is invoked was fully represented in the prior action.restatement second of judgments bobby bies,defining the elements of issue preclusion in federal litigation chi.truck drivers,helpers warehouse union indep.pension fund century motor freight,f d,cir.the rogan children assert that issue preclusion does not apply because the propriety of the sale of emc was not at issue in rogan i,and because neither they nor the trusts were parties in that case.
rogan i did not concern whether the sale of the hospital or the financing of that sale involved fraud,but the court did consider and determine the latest possible starting point of rogan healthcare fraud scheme.d at.examining evidence related to the origins of the fraud and conspiracy,the district court in rogan i determined that rogan and several doctors conspired in the early to arrange referrals to rogan hospital in return for kickbacks,resulting in substantial profits for rogan.id.at see also id.at describing how from to rogan arranged for emc to enter into a series of teaching and contracts with physicians that violated the stark and statutes and thus knowingly caused emc to submit false claims to the federal government.that determination regarding rogan relationships with and the starting point of the fraudulent activity was essential to the decision that medicaid and medicare claims that rogan caused to be submitted in and later were false,a.it was also essential to the conclusion that he was a member of the charged conspiracy and committed numerous overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy,a,including negotiating and signing contracts.
it is true that the rogan children were not parties in the prior action.however,this does not end the inquiry as there are several recognized exceptions to the general rule that a person who was not a party to a suit has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate issues in that suit.the district court applied one such exception the adequately represented exception.see taylor,at recognizing that,in certain limited circumstances,a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because he was adequately represented by someone with the same interests who was a party to the suit.we agree with the district court reasoning that rogan had the same interests in rogan i as his children or the trusts had in defending against the imposition of a constructive trust in the supplementary,to persuade the trier of fact that rogan did not knowingly engage in healthcare fraud.had rogan not engaged in such fraud,the court could not follow to the present day the assets he originally obtained and put into the trusts,and could not impose a constructive trust.see schultz schultz,a constructive trust is an equitable remedy imposed against one whom,by some form of wrongdoing such as actual or constructive fraud,has been unjustly enriched.see also johnson la grange state bank,refusing to impose constructive trust on assets where fraud was not established.the government succeeded on its claims under the fca by showing that rogan engaged in fraud.rogan i,d at including as an element of a claim under the fca that the defendant caused to be presented to the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or made,used,or caused another to make or use a false statement of document id.at discussing proof that rogan caused emc to submit claims for reimbursement from medicare and medicaid for services that were not in compliance with the stark and statutes and were thus false.the government also established the elements of,and was entitled to recover damages for,common law fraud and unjust enrichment.id.at.issue preclusion prevents the rogan children from challenging the finding that rogan fraud began no later than.
in their opening brief on appeal,the rogan children list five of the district court factual findings related to rogan ownership of the trust property that they contend were not supported by competent evidence.however,they fail to make any attempt to show how these findings were clearly erroneous.we need not consider this undeveloped claim,especially in light of the burden a party alleging error bears to demonstrate that a particular factual finding is clearly erroneous.carnes stone creek,cir.
constructive trust 
the rogan children claim error with respect to the district court imposition of a constructive trust on the assets held in the trusts.they admit that the district court traced some property to the trusts,but argue that the court never determined whether the trusts still owned any of that property or received property from other sources aside from the in gifts that the court excluded from the turnover order.they contend that no one knows precisely what the trusts own and,therefore,what assets are subject to a constructive trust.appellant br.
under illinois law,a constructive trust is imposed to prevent unjust enrichment by imposing a duty on the person receiving the benefit to convey the property back to the person from whom it was received.martin heinold commodities,citing restatement of restitution.i t is a restitutionary remedy which arises by operation of law,and is imposed by a court in situations where a person holding money or property would profit by a wrong or be unjustly enriched at the expense of another if he were permitted to retain it.people ex rel.daley for use of cook county warren motors,inc,internal citations omitted see also ftc qt,d,n.stating that a constructive trust is created by the court to avoid unjust enrichment when a party has obtained money to which he is not entitled and in equity and good conscience ought not to retain citing smithberg.mun.ret.fund.the particular circumstances in which equity will impress a constructive trust are as numberless as the modes by which property may be obtained through bad faith and unconscientious acts.warren motors,at quoting county of cook barrett.a party seeking a constructive trust must establish the existence of identifiable property to serve as the res upon which a trust can be imposed and possession of that res or its product by the person who is to be charged as the constructive trustee.people ex rel.hartigan candy club.
the rogan children do not deny that dexia met its initial burden to trace the proceeds of fraud to the trusts.in other words,dexia showed that the rogan children trusts received money from the sale of emc and management fees for services provided by entities,or held stock in companies that received this money.on appeal,they argue that since all of the transfers occurred before,dexia was required to establish what happened to the sale proceeds and management fees after they were transferred to the trusts.the rogan children are,in essence,proposing that since,legitimate funds may have been commingled with the transfers.they do not point to evidence of such commingling or equivocally argue that commingling occurred.instead,they contend that nobody knows for sure.however,even if such commingling occurred,it would not impose an additional burden of proof on dexia.see in re estate of wallen,o nce claimant made a specific showing that the administrator commingled the assets of the corporation with those of the estate,the burden shifted to the administrator to sort out and account for those assets as he was in the best position to know of them.de fontaine passalino,holding that when a trustee commingles his own property with that of the beneficiaries,the burden rests on the trustee to show which property belonged to the trustee before the commingling.in addition,when a trustee has commingled trust funds with his own and subsequently withdrawn sums from the combined fund for his own use,the conclusive presumption is that the trustee withdrew his own funds first,leaving behind the trust funds.people barrett,see also in re comm r of banks real estate,stating that where a trustee commingles funds and later withdraws money from the commingled fund,the trust account holder is entitled to enforce his equitable lien upon the funds that remain.
the district court cited various examples of rogan manipulating trust assets for his purposes,drawing from the trusts as a single pool of assets without regard for any separation of title or identity of the named beneficiaries.with the exception of a gift to each of the domestic trusts by a third party,there is neither proof of any legitimate source for the assets of the trusts to counter the evidence presented by dexia nor evidence that any person other than rogan had control over trust assets.moreover,the reason that dexia evidence of transfers is not difficult to understand in the context of this case.in,emc terminated its contract with rogan management companies following its discovery of rogan fraud.additionally,emc closed in december,and the government initiated litigation against rogan in may.
the rogan children have not pointed to any evidence that would undercut the district court determinations that the trusts were funded by rogan fraud and not some legitimate contributor and that he continued to control those assets once deposited,either directly or through his agents.we find no error in the district court imposition of a constructive trust on all but of the trust assets.
citation respondents 
dexia served on peter rogan,judith rogan,and fredrick cuppy citations to discover assets.the rogan children argue that there was insufficient evidence that any of these citation respondents held rogan property.they assert that neither peter nor judith have been shown to be in possession of any assets held by the trusts which are the property of peter rogan.appellant br.likewise,they assert that no evidence was presented at trial showing that cuppy was in possession of such assets,and that he was removed as trustee of the domestic trusts by order of the district court.the rogan children argue that because these third parties did not possess assets of the judgment debtor,the district court had no authority to enter a judgment against them.
the rogan children argument is misplaced.the district court did not find that any of these respondents personally possessed assets of was not the relevant inquiry.in ordering the turnover of assets the court found that dexia was entitled to turnover of the assets of the trusts excluding because the trusts themselves held the property of rogan,the judgment debtor.he funded the trusts through money fraudulently obtained and never relinquished control of those assets once they were placed in the trusts.to effectuate turnover,the district court terminated any interests held by the rogan children in those trusts except for,ordered any existing trustee to turn over the assets to dexia,and directed dexia to file a motion for the appointment of a trustee for any trust that did not currently have a trustee so that the court could appoint a trustee who would be ordered to turn trust assets over to dexia.
this order against the trusts was consistent with the citation that dexia issued to cuppy.the citation stated that it was being issued to cuppy i ndividually,as partner in the law firm of burke costanza cuppy,and as an agent,trustee,lawyer for any identified in rider.rider a plainly identified the rogan children trusts as entities to which the citation applied.thus,the trusts themselves were respondents.in addition,rogan was a citation respondent.by serving these citations,dexia perfected its judgment lien on all personal property belonging to rogan that was in his possession or control,or in the possession or control of the trusts.ilcs m.
although the rogan children think it important that cuppy was removed as the trustee prior to the issuance of the turnover order,they present no authority showing that his removal as trustee meant that the trusts were no longer citation respondents,or that the district court was no longer empowered to compel assets within the trusts to satisfy the judgment.the district court specifically allowed for the appointment of a new trustee,upon which occurrence the court would order the new trustee to turn over the assets of the trusts.we find no error.
personal jurisdiction over robert rogan 
robert rogan argues that we should reverse the district court judgment against him because the court did not have personal jurisdiction over him.robert argues that he is a california citizen and has no contacts with illinois.
