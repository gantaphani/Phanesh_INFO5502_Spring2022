this case immerses us in the world of finance,shadowy relations among companies,and allegedly fraudulent transfers,all for the sake of jewelry boxes sold on the home shopping network.for your ease only,fyeo sells these jewelry boxes,and it pursued litigation against some of its competitors for patent misuse and tortious interference with business relations.although fyeo obtained a million default judgment against them in that suit,it has not managed yet to collect on its judgment.one mark schneider,moved to costa rica before the final judgment was entered,and schneider wholly owned company transferred its main right to payments from hsn,lp commonly called the home shopping network to an entity called sevenquest,llc,which not so coincidentally schneider also owns exclusively.sevenquest subsequently transferred the right to hsn payments to anewco,a company wholly owned by schneider,doug fournier.fyeo believes that these two transfers are voidable under the illinois uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,ilcs et,but the district court rejected its position.although hsn appeared only as an observer before the district court,it filed a motion in this court on april,for permission to intervene on appeal that motion was granted on april,and hsn has fully participated since then.the others have chosen to take a pass.we conclude that additional findings are necessary before it is possible to decide whether ufta gives fyeo a right to have the transfers set aside.we therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
six years ago,fyeo sued mark schneider,his wholly owned company product concepts company pcc,and calgon carbon corporation,for patent misuse and tortious interference.at some point,schneider and pcc stopped responding to the district court discovery orders their insouciance prompted the district court on june,to enter a default against them for.judgment was entered on the default on february,by which time accruing interest had increased the total amount to.
by the time fyeo judgment was entered,pcc main asset was the right to payments from hsn for the latter service in selling pcc jewelry boxes.schneider,in his capacity as owner of pcc,had executed an exclusive product merchandising agreement with hsn in.not long afterward schneider moved to costa rica.in,schneider transferred the right to the hsn business and payments from pcc to sevenquest.
judgment in hand,fyeo began to search for assets belonging to schneider or pcc.in december,it subpoenaed fournier,schneider.the subpoena informed fournier of the judgment against schneider and pcc and noticed fournier deposition it also required him to bring along any records relating to schneider,pcc,hsn,or sevenquest.after receiving the subpoena,fournier flew to costa rica to see schneider.on january,schneider gave fournier a letter addressed to hsn that letter purported to transfer sevenquest rights under the hsn agreement to fournier company,anewco.at that time,however,anewco did not exist.fournier established it shortly after his return to the united states.
as it began to learn about these transactions,fyeo took the position that the right to the hsn business is an asset of schneider and pcc and that it is entitled to reach the hsn payments to satisfy its judgment.any attempted transfer to anewco,it adds,was voidable under ufta.on april,fyeo served hsn with a citation order to discover assets of schneider and pcc.the citation prohibited hsn from transferring any property or paying any money over to the judgment debtors.an accompanying citation notice,which had been filed with the district court,informed hsn that the judgment debtors were schneider and pcc.the notice also listed one of schneider last known addresses as sevenquest.finally,in conjunction with the order and notice,fyeo petitioned the district court for an order restraining hsn from transferring property to the judgment debtors or their successor entities,including sevenquest and anewco.the petition asked the district court to require hsn to deposit any payments owed to schneider,pcc,sevenquest,or anewco with the district court.
fyeo initial efforts were unavailing.on may,hsn paid anewco.in response,on june,fyeo amended its petition to include a request for a turnover order for payments made by hsn to schneider,pcc,sevenquest,or anewco in violation of the citation.on june,hsn paid anewco another.
the district court held a hearing in october on fyeo petition for a turnover order and restraining order.the court noted that only if the payments to anewco were property of schneider and pcc could it find that hsn violated the citation.moreover,the only way that the payments could still be the property of schneider and pcc was if the transfers to sevenquest and anewco were voidable under ufta.the district court decided that the first transfer from pcc to sevenquest was voidable because it was fraudulent.see ilcs a.in support of that conclusion,the court found that the transaction possessed sufficient badges of fraud to justify a presumption of fraudulent intent the transfer was to an insider because schneider was the sole owner of both companies schneider retained control of the property the transfer was concealed by schneider efforts to avoid discovery schneider had been sued before the transfer the transfer was of substantially all of schneider assets schneider absconded by moving to costa rica and schneider was or became insolvent shortly after the transfer.neither hsn nor the schneider parties dispute this finding.
the district court then addressed the transfer from sevenquest to anewco.under ufta,a transfer made after a fraudulent transfer is voidable unless it is made to a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value.ilcs a.this standard is similar to the one for holders in due course of negotiable instruments,who must take for value,in good faith,and without notice of such problems as forgery,default,dishonor,or inauthenticity.see ilcs a.according to fournier,he and schneider had an oral agreement under which fournier would develop the business with hsn,and,in exchange,schneider would transfer the hsn business to fournier after three years.during that period,fournier would earn a small commission while schneider would receive the profits.they made this oral agreement in or,apparently because schneider expected his move to costa rica to hamper his efforts to fulfill the exclusive contract he had recently signed with hsn.the district court accepted fournier description of the transaction and found that fournier acted in good faith and paid reasonably equivalent value for the hsn rights.this is only partly true,at least as far as the finding of good faith is concerned fournier had more to say than this implies.
fournier testified that he knew of the judgment against schneider and pcc in december,after he received the subpoena from fyeo and before he accepted the transfer in january.during his deposition he admitted that he traveled to costa rica to effect the transfer of the business the main reason i went there was to conclude that i done my three years,this is what we agreed to,i sick of your problem,i want to go on my own,and you promised me this.avoiding the judgment also motivated fournier to form a new company,anewco,to hold the asset 
q but it was your purpose in forming anewco to attempt to try to isolate yourself from schneider legal issues,right 
a yes,sir.part of the reason anyway.
the district court decided that fournier acted in good faith because,at the time of the transfer,he did not have a legal or financial relationship with schneider.as the court noted,fournier did not funnel money to schneider and did not maintain a business relationship with schneider after the transfer.schneider,the court concluded,was not financially involved and did not have control over it the hsn payments.last,the court found that fournier efforts over three years to develop the hsn business constituted reasonably equivalent value for transfer from sevenquest.on this basis,the court held that the transfer to anewco was not voidable under ufta.the right to the hsn payments was held by anewco,not the judgmen
