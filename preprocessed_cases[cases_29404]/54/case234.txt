jmm corporation,the operator of an adult video store in the district of columbia,sued the district in federal district court,alleging that its zoning regulations for such establishments were unconstitutional.in light of ongoing district of columbia administrative and judicial enforcement proceedings against jmm,the district court dismissed the complaint under the abstention doctrine of younger harris,d.there is no doubt that the dismissal was appropriate if the district of columbia is entitled to the benefit of that doctrine.we are therefore required to decide whether younger is applicable to the district,a question this circuit has heretofore avoided.
jmm contends that,because the district of columbia is not a state,its enforcement actions do not merit the same protections as would a state.reply br.at.younger will apply,the appellant insists,only i f and when the district of columbia attains statehood.id.at.but the district does not have to wait until that day.we hold that the enforcement actions of the district of columbia are entitled to the same respect that the federal courts accord those of the states,and therefore affirm the dismissal of jmm complaint.
jmm,doing business as fun fair video,sells sexually explicit videos and provides booths for their viewing.fun fair is located in a community business center district in the district of columbia,an area that is not designated for business establishments sobes under the district zoning regulations nor does fun fair have the required certificate of occupancy to operate as a sobe.
in,the department of consumer and regulatory affairs dcra commenced the first of what became three sets of administrative enforcement actions against jmm.first,in april,the dcra issued jmm a notice of infraction for operating without a proper certificate of occupancy.in june,the matter was heard by an administrative law judge alj of the dcra office of adjudication.on june,the alj found that,while jmm had obtained a certificate of occupancy for a video store not sexually oriented a,it was in fact operating a sobe in a zone that was not designated for such use.the alj ordered jmm to cease doing business until it obtained a proper certificate.although jmm had the right to appeal the alj order to the board of appeals and review,see mun.regs.tit,and from there to the district of columbia court of appeals,see ann,it did not do so.
nor did jmm cease doing business.indeed,jmm continued to operate as a sobe throughout the course of the district court litigation,and is still doing so.it has not relocated,applied for a sobe license,or ceased its business activities.
in september,the dcra issued a second set of notices of infraction to jmm,again for operating without a proper certificate.these,too,were heard before an alj.on march,the alj again found the charges proven,imposed fines,and ordered jmm to cease operations until it obtained a proper certificate.this time,jmm did appeal to the board of appeals and review,where the matter is currently pending.
meanwhile,on february,the dcra instituted its third enforcement action,issuing notices of intent to revoke jmm certificate of occupancy as well as its mechanical amusement license.in october,an alj found in favor of the dcra.jmm again appealed to the board of appeals and review,where that appeal also remains pending.
on march,day of the alj hearing on the infractions and a week after the dcra issued its notices of filed the instant action against the district of columbia and the dcra in the united states district court for the district of columbia.jmm complaint,brought pursuant to,alleged that the district sobe regulations violate the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments because,inter alia,they are unconstitutional restrictions,and are vague and overbroad.jmm sought money damages,an order declaring the regulations unconstitutional,and an injunction against their enforcement.jmm also sought a preliminary injunction barring all pending enforcement actions.
on may,the district court denied the preliminary injunction,on the basis of the abstention doctrine of younger harris,d,and the absence of a risk of imminent irreparable injury.mem.op.order at may.two months later,on july,the dcra sued jmm in the superior court of the district of columbia to enforce the uncontested june,alj decision that had ordered jmm to cease doing business.on march,the district court dismissed all of jmm claims for injunctive and declaratory relief based on younger abstention.at the same time,the district court stayed jmm claims for money damages,pending jmm appeals of the dcra administrative enforcement orders and the district civil enforcement action in superior court.the parties do not dispute that the stay was appropriate if the younger doctrine was properly applied.see deakins monaghan,d.jmm now appeals the dismissal of its claims for injunctive and declaratory relief 
in younger harris and its progeny,the supreme court held that,except in extraordinary circumstances,a federal court should not enjoin a pending state proceeding including an administrative proceeding that is judicial in nature and involves important state interests.ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d younger,at.at this court has never decided,however,whether the district of columbia is a state for younger abstention purposes.bridges kelly.instead,every time the question has arisen,we have assumed that the doctrine applies to the district and nonetheless determined,in light of the facts of each particular case,that younger abstention has not been appropriate.id.quoting lashawn kelly,in this case,however,we can not simply assume the applicability of younger abstention,because if applicable it would be appropriate here.see infra part iii.accordingly,we must decide the question that this circuit has long avoided.
the younger court rested its abstention doctrine both on equitable principles and on concerns for comity and federalism.ohio civil rights comm n,at.at see new orleans public,council of new orleans,d huffman pursue,d younger,at.at.we consider below the applicability of each of these considerations to proceedings brought by the district of columbia.
the first source of the policy against federal interference with state court proceedings identified by younger was the basic doctrine of equity jurisprudence that courts of equity should not act when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.younger,at.at.in trainor hernandez,the court explained that these two classic preconditions for the exercise of equity jurisdiction no adequate remedy at law and irreparable injury assumed new dimensions in younger,d.the adequate remedy at law inquiry was to be broadened to focus on the remedies available in the pending state proceeding as compared to the federal action.id.and the other precondition for equitable not be satisfied unless the threatened injury was both great and immediate.id.at.at see younger,at.at.
these two principles apply in full measure to district of columbia enforcement proceedings.first,the defendant in district proceedings has an adequate remedy for its asserted constitutional violations because it has an opportunity to raise its constitutional claims as defenses,younger,at.at.where the proceedings begin in superior court,the defendant can raise any constitutional claims in that court appeal an adverse decision to the district of columbia court of appeals and if still dissatisfied seek review in the united states supreme court where the proceedings begin at the administrative level,the defendant can appeal to and make its constitutional challenges in the court of appeals and again seek further review in the supreme court whether or not the defendant can also raise its constitutional defenses at the administrative level,it is sufficient under younger that constitutional claims may be raised in judicial review of the administrative proceeding.ohio civil rights comm n,at.at 
second,the defendant in a district proceeding will not suffer irreparable injury by being foreclosed from obtaining an injunction in federal court.as trainor explained,the burden of defending an enforcement action is not sufficient to warrant interference by the federal courts with legitimate state efforts to enforce state laws only extraordinary circumstances would suffice.at.at such extraordinary circumstances include situations in which there is a showing of bad faith or harassment by state officials responsible for the prosecution,or where the state law to be applied is flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions.id.at.at quoting younger,at.at.there is no reason why these factors can not be applied to district proceedings as readily as to state proceedings,with injunctions being permitted only where the appropriate showings are made.accordingly,there is nothing about the equity source of the younger doctrine that precludes its application to the district of columbia.
the second source of the younger abstention as the more vital consideration was concerns for comity and federalism.ohio civil rights comm n,at.at quoting younger,at.at see quackenbush allstate ins,d new orleans,at.at.younger federalism concern does not apply per se to the district of columbia,because t he federal seat of government is constitutionally different from the states,madley united states parole comm n,and the superior court is a congressionally created court and,thus,federal in its creation.handy shaw,bransford,veilleux roth.but younger larger concern for respect for a coordinate legal does apply.
as the court explained in huffman,younger component requires courts to abide by standards of restraint that go well beyond those of private equity jurisprudence.at.at.comity includes the concern that interference with a state judicial proceeding prevents the state from effectuating its substantive policies,id.at.at,and disrupt s the state efforts to protect interests which it deems important,id.at.at.such interference,the court said,also results in duplicative legal proceedings,and can readily be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state courts ability to enforce constitutional principles.id.at.at quoting steffel thompson,d.as we said in family division trial lawyers moultrie,t he only justification for federal court interference during a state proceeding would be a premise that the state courts can not be trusted to adequately protect federal constitutional rights,a premise unequivocally rejected by the younger court.
all of these comity concerns apply with equal force to the district of columbia.see generally id.federal court interference with district enforcement proceedings may prevent the district from effectuating its substantive policies and disrupt its efforts to protect interests it regards as important.it will certainly result in duplicative legal proceedings and may be interpreted to reflect negatively on the district ability to enforce constitutional principles.but just as with a state,there is no reason to presume that the courts of the district can not be trusted to adequately protect federal constitutional rights.to the contrary,congress has created a trial and appellate court system of general jurisdiction for the district separate from the united states courts of which we are a part and intended to serve the district in much the same manner as the court systems of the various states.madley,at.
in,congress reorganized the courts of the district of columbia pursuant to its authority under article i,cl.of the constitution.see palmore united states,d ann.prior to passage of the district of columbia court reorganization act of dccra the local court system had limited jurisdiction,and the united states district court for the district of columbia had concurrent jurisdiction with the court of general sessions one of three local trial courts over most of the criminal and civil matters handled by that court.at.at citing ann.through.the dccra transferred all local jurisdiction from the federal courts to a new superior court of the district of columbia and the district of columbia court of appeals,at a substantial impetus for the total transfer of local jurisdiction out of the federal courts into the reorganized local court system was the overall problem of concurrent jurisdiction,which had produced a between the federal and local courts,particularly with respect to the disposition of criminal matters.id.at.
congress intent was to give the district a court system comparable to those of the states,at,one separate and apart from the united states district court and the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit,id.at.in constituting the lower trial court as a purely local court,similar to a state court,it follow ed that appeals from the local court should be treated like those in the state systems,and that the channel of appeals should be directly to the united states supreme court.id.at.thus,the reorganization made the district of columbia court of appeals the highest local court,id.at,similar to a state supreme court,id.at,and made its decisions reviewable by the united states supreme court,id.at the house report stated that,when the reorganization was complete,the united states district court for the district of columbia would be on a par with other united states district courts,exercising federal jurisdiction only,and the superior court of the district of columbia will have all purely local jurisdiction.id.at 
as both this court and the supreme court have noted,from the passage of the dccra onward,the relationship of the federal to the local judiciary was to be akin to that historically existent in the states.steorts american airlines,accordingly,both our case law and other federal statutes treat the courts like state courts.handy,at indeed,it should not escape notice that the very statute upon which jmm relies for its cause of action in this case,treats the district of columbia as if it were a state 
moreover,this circuit has treated the district of columbia courts as state courts in the application of two other abstention doctrines.one is pullman abstention,which holds that when a federal constitutional claim is premised on an unsettled question of state law,the federal court should stay its hand in order to provide the state courts an opportunity to settle the underlying question and thus avoid the possibility of unnecessarily deciding a constitutional question.harris county comm rs court moore,d citing railroad comm pullman.see justice superior of district of columbia,applying pullman to the district.like younger abstention,pullman abstention is based on considerations of both equity and comity the other abstention as colorado river discretionary abstention in light of parallel proceedings in another court.see colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d.in that context,we have reviewed dismissal in favor of parallel proceedings in superior court under the standard applicable to a parallel state court proceeding,see handy,at,rather than under the standard applicable to a parallel proceeding in another federal district court,see id.at finally,we note that the first circuit has applied younger itself to puerto rico local court system and administrative proceedings,see,cir,which are entitled to no greater comity than those of the district of columbia 
in sum,the general considerations of comity described in the younger line of cases apply with full force to the district of columbia.and while comity federalism component does not apply per se,congress has made clear that it intends federal courts generally to treat the district of columbia judicial system as if it were a state system,an intent that this circuit has long respected and effectuated.when these considerations are combined with the fact that the other source of the younger of equity also fully applicable to the district of columbia,the conclusion that this circuit should regard the district as a state for purposes of younger abstention is inescapable.
the remaining issue,the application of younger to this case,is straightforward and breaks no new ground.in younger,the plaintiff had been charged in state court with violating the california criminal
