after her employer enterprise recovery systems ers fired her,rhonda salmeron brought this qui tam action on behalf of the united states against ers alleging that it committed fraud in its student loan debt collection practices.salmeron subsequently amended her complaint three times to add usa funds,usa group guarantee services,usa servicing sallie mae,sallie mae servicing,and scott nicholson as defendants.during the lawsuit sojourn in the district court,salmeron attorney,jorge sanchez,engaged in what the judge described as a virtually unbroken pattern of dilatory and irresponsible conduct,consistently missing filing deadlines and failing to appear at status conferences.fed up with sanchez repeated flouting of the court rules,the district court dismissed the suit sua sponte.though ultimately persuaded to reinstate the action,the district court issued a final warning to sanchez that future misconduct would not be tolerated.only a short time later,however,sanchez breached an oral agreement he had with opposing counsel and leaked a document obtained through discovery to three separate sources.upon finding the document posted on an internet website,the defendants moved to dismiss the suit as a sanction for the unauthorized disclosure.the district court granted the motion,finding the leak willful and inexcusable.salmeron appeals,arguing that the punishment does not fit the offending conduct.we affirm.
in its opinion and order dismissing the suit,the district court extensively chronicled the transgressions of salmeron counsel,jorge sanchez,during the course of this litigation.the day after the deadline to respond to ers motion to dismiss,sanchez,citing his workload and personal issues as the reasons for the delay,filed a motion for permission to file the response late,which the district court granted.a few months later,sanchez missed the deadline to file a response to usa funds motion to dismiss.he again cited workload and family obligations and asked the court to excuse the late filing,which it did.a few months after that late filing,sanchez failed to timely respond to usa funds request for production of documents and interrogatories the responses to the interrogatories were not submitted until more than two and a half months after they were due.sanchez also failed to appear at a scheduled status conference.next,when responses to ers interrogatories and requests for production were already several weeks overdue,sanchez reneged on a promise that he would provide the information.the court had to order sanchez to comply.
sanchez dilatory conduct continued past the lawsuit second anniversary.nine days after salmeron response to ers motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was due,rather than belatedly attempting to respond,sanchez instead filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.the court applied ers motion to the third amended complaint and set a new deadline for sanchez response.true to form,sanchez missed that deadline.again citing his workload,sanchez moved for leave to file a response a week after the deadline had passed.the court and opposing counsel had been apprised of the motion only minutes before a scheduled status hearing.nevertheless,the court granted that motion and set a deadline for sanchez to file salmeron third amended complaint,which had yet to be filed.
sanchez could not meet that deadline and asked for an extension,which the district court granted.but the extended deadline passed without sanchez filing anything.although the court clerk called sanchez to inquire about the status of the filing and was told it was forthcoming,sanchez neither attended the status hearing scheduled shortly after the deadline nor filed the third amended complaint.only after the court ordered sanchez to file the third amended complaint or face dismissal did sanchez finally file that document.
despite these admonitions,sanchez continued.on march,in response to the defendants motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,the court entered a scheduling order requiring salmeron to respond by april.predictably,sanchez filed a motion for an extension on april,citing yet again his workload as a reason for delay.the court granted an extension until april,but that date passed without sanchez filing a response to any of the motions.on may,sanchez filed a motion to extend the filing date for the responses until may.the court granted that extension,but sanchez failed to meet that extended deadline as well.on may,sanchez contacted the court and requested a continuance of the status hearing scheduled for the next day,telling the court that the continuance was necessary so that he could file the delinquent responses before the hearing.sanchez promised to have the responses filed by the afternoon of the next day,so the district court agreed to postpone the hearing until may.when,five days later,sanchez still had not filed his responses,the district court finally got his attention it entered an order dismissing the action for want of prosecution.
sanchez moved to reopen the case,arguing that his failures as counsel should not be held against salmeron.at a hearing on the motion,the district court reinstated the suit while,at the same time,giving sanchez a stern warning about the consequences of future misconduct 
well,i guess the short answer is that with considerable diffidence,i going to grant the rule e motion and permit the case to get back into a live posture,but i want to tell you now you have really had what amounts to the final warning,and we not going to have any repetition of any of this,or it going to result in a conclusion that you certainly wo desire and that is really occasioned by this extended pattern of noncompliance.
despite the second chance,sanchez raised his misconduct to a more egregious level.on june,defendants usa funds,sallie mae,and ers learned that a scanned copy of the confidential document containing the guarantee services agreement between sallie mae and usa funds had been posted on a website known as wikileaks also posted was a summary of the document and inflammatory questions about the possible criminality of the arrangement.two days later,the chronicle of higher education published an online article about the leaked document captioned contract raises new concern over sallie mae ties to guarantor.the chronicle claimed it had obtained the document several days before it appeared on wikileaks and denied providing it to wikileaks.both the copy of the guarantee services agreement leaked to wikileaks and the copy provided to the chronicle bore bates stamps conclusively demonstrating that they originated from usa funds document production during this lawsuit.
usa funds then moved to dismiss the suit as a sanction for the disclosure of the guarantee services agreement mark sweet,usa funds counsel,signed an affidavit filed contemporaneously with the motion to dismiss asserting that sanchez had agreed to treat the confidential documents disclosed by usa funds during discovery as being for attorneys eyes only.this condition was to remain in place until such time as the existing protective order,entered earlier in the action when only ers was a defendant,could be modified to include all parties.usa funds also included the cover letter accompanying its first production of documents on january,wherein sweet,writing to sanchez,stated that usa funds intended to seek confidential treatment for the guarantee services agreement.sweet also wrote in that letter that he had circulated a draft joint motion for entry of a modified protective order and that usa funds would move for confidential treatment of the guarantee services agreement after the court entered that order.in a separate email communication with sanchez,sweet attached a draft protective order and asked sanchez to add his changes.sanchez had told sweet that he wished to modify the protective order to cover documents from salmeron home computer.sanchez replied that he would look over the proposed protective order and give any feedback or proposed modifications that he might have.two months later,in a cover letter accompanying usa funds second production of documents,sweet reminded sanchez that usa funds was going to seek confidential treatment for the guarantee services agreement and requested sanchez to provide his edits on the draft protective order so that the order could be entered.sanchez never provided his promised changes to the proposed protective order.at the time of the leak,no protective order was in place.
usa funds also included with its motion to dismiss an email exchange between its counsel and sanchez that occurred shortly after it discovered the leak.in that exchange,sanchez admitted that the document posted on wikileaks was the same version of the guarantee services agreement that usa funds had produced in the lawsuit,but he placed the blame on usa funds for never following up on the protective order with the district court.he also stated that usa funds failed to indicate which documents provided to plaintiff it considered to be confidential.
in his response to the motion to dismiss,sanchez stated that the document apparently ha d been leaked and published without plaintiff counsel knowledge or approval.at a hearing the next day,the district judge questioned sanchez about how the document could have been leaked without his knowledge when the version of the guarantee services agreement published on wikileaks had the same bates numbering as the version released during discovery.while denying giving the guarantee services agreement to wikileaks,sanchez nevertheless backtracked and admitted that he had leaked the document to three different,unauthorized sources his client,another attorney whom he was thinking about bringing on as,and a reporter for the chronicle.finding sanchez justifications for his actions unpersuasive,the district court nonetheless allowed sanchez to file a brief arguing why a sanction other than dismissal would be appropriate.
in that brief filed after the hearing,sanchez admitted that,had he referred to the cover letters accompanying usa funds document disclosures,he would have known that usa funds was seeking a confidential designation for the leaked document and would not have shared it with anyone,including the reporter for the chronicle,whom sanchez stated he had been put ting off for months before finally disclosing the document to him.however,sanchez claimed he misplaced the cover letters and did not refer to them when he disclosed the document.although he denied personally leaking the guarantee services agreement to wikileaks,sanchez admitted that the attorney to whom he leaked the document may have done so.he argued that his disclosure was inadvertent and that a monetary fine,and not dismissal,was the appropriate sanction.
the district court disagreed.in a comprehensive opinion,it found that sanchez violated the attorneys eyes only agreement he had reached with sweet by willfully disseminating the guarantee services agreement.the court also found that sanchez had never given a convincing explanation for doing so.the court rejected sanchez argument that he should not be sanctioned because no protective order was in place protecting the document,finding instead that the lack of a protective order was unquestionably due to sanchez s failure to provide a response as he had promised.relying on its inherent authority to rectify abuses to the judicial process,the court then decided that dismissal with prejudice was the proper sanction and dismissed the suit.salmeron appeals.
on appeal,salmeron challenges both the district court factual findings supporting the dismissal sanction and its power to issue that sanction.a district court has inherent power to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.chambers nasco,d.sanctions meted out pursuant to the court inherent power are appropriate where the offender has willfully abused the judicial process or otherwise conducted litigation in bad faith.maynard nygren,cir.though particularly severe,the sanction of dismissal is within the court discretion.montano city of chicago,cir quoting chambers,at.accord link wabash,d.while a district court must exercise caution and restraint in exercising its inherent power,schmude sheahan,cir,our review of the district court choice of sanction is deferential f indings of fact must stand unless clearly erroneous,and a district judge decision that a party misconduct is serious enough to justify dismissal with prejudice is reviewed for abuse of discretion.ridge chrysler jeep,llc daimlerchrysler fin.servs.ams.llc,cir.accordingly,w e will only reverse a district court imposition of sanctions if one or more of the following is true the record contains no evidence upon which the court could have rationally based its decision the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law the decision is based on clearly erroneous factual findings or the decision clearly appears arbitrary.judson atkinson candies,dhimantec,cir quoting gile united airlines,cir.
we begin with salmeron challenges to the district court factual findings,which we will reverse only if left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.nutrasweet eng g,cir.salmeron first attacks the district court finding that sanchez and usa funds counsel,mark sweet,had agreed to keep the guarantee services agreement for attorneys eyes only until the district court entered a protective order governing document disclosure between the parties.she does not dispute the existence of the attorneys eyes only agreement.rather,she argues that there is nothing in sweet declaration to support the district court finding that sanchez had agreed specifically to keep the guarantee services agreement confidential.the problem with that argument is that salmeron never seriously disputed in the court below that the guarantee services agreement was covered by the attorneys eyes only agreement.although sanchez at first claimed,in his email response to usa funds after the leak,that usa funds did not indicate which documents it considered to be confidential,he later admitted that the cover letters accompanying usa funds document productions clearly showed that usa funds was seeking a confidential designation for the guarantee services was all that was required to bring that document within the ambit of the attorneys eyes only agreement.
faced with that concession,salmeron changes course and attempts to refashion the agreement on appeal.she latches onto the phrase in sweet affidavit that usa funds wanted the same protections for its documents as those afforded by the protective order already in place between ers and salmeron.salmeron claims that phrase meant the ers protective order governed the attorneys eyes only agreement.following that logic,salmeron argues the guarantee services agreement was not protected because it was not stamped confidential and was not the subject of a motion seeking the lower court approval of the confidentiality of which,salmeron claims,are prerequisites under the protective order between ers and salmeron for confidential protection.
we reject the premise.sweet statement does not say anything about the attorneys eyes only agreement.the attorneys eyes only agreement required sanchez to treat the confidential documents of usa funds as for attorneys eyes only until such time as a protective order could be entered.that was the extent of the agreement it was merely a stopgap until the district court entered a protective order governing usa funds confidential documents.while the protective order eventually entered by the district court governing discovery between salmeron and usa funds set forth the same procedures for determining confidentiality as the ers protective order,sanchez unauthorized disclosure of the guarantee services agreement occurred before that order was in place.salmeron therefore can not now claim that usa funds was required to follow the provisions of an order that was not yet in because sanchez failed to return the draft protective order with his proposed changes to usa funds counsel,thereby preventing the protective order from being entered in the first place.
salmeron also claims that the district court clearly erred in finding that sanchez disclosure of the guarantee se
