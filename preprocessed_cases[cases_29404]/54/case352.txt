ii.discussion 
background 
in october,a default judgment was entered against defendant in an action brought by john white.white subsequently assigned the money judgment to fidelity creditor service,fidelity.in august,fidelity filed an application for renewal of the judgment.the renewal was entered,subd.a.on august,notice of renewal of the judgment was served on defendant by mail.
defendant filed a motion to vacate renewal of the judgment pursuant to section.defendant asserted he was never served with the summons and complaint.defendant declared he first learned of the lawsuit well after the default judgment was entered.defendant presented evidence in support of those claims.fidelity opposed the motion.significantly,fidelity conceded for purposes of defendant motion that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint.the proof of service in the record shows defendant was served with the summons and complaint by substituted service at a business address.however,there was no evidence valid substituted service was accomplished.further,there was no evidence defendant was ever personally served with a summons and complaint.fidelity stated in its trial court brief f or purposes of this motion only,fidelity will not dispute service of process.this is only because service was by substituted service and fidelity has no way of disproving d efendant claim that he did not reside at the place at which he was.the trial court denied the motion.the trial court ruled defendant had not established the judgment was void on its face and therefore could not seek relief under section.further,the trial court ruled defendant could not attack the judgment for improper service pursuant to section more than two years after it was entered.
standard of review 
the judgment debtor bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he or she is entitled to relief under section.tsakos shipping trading,juniper garden town homes,th,d tom thumb glove han d.same.on appeal,we examine the evidence in a light most favorable to the order under review and the trial court ruling for an abuse of discretion.tsakos shipping trading,juniper garden town homes,supra,th at,d 
in addition,we must interpret the provisions of section and related debt collection statutes.in doing so,we apply the following standard of statutory review described by our supreme court when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.citation.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d,people jones cal th,d.further,our supreme court has noted if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute delaney superior court cal d.however,the literal meaning of a statute must be in accord with its purpose,as our supreme court noted in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,we are not prohibited from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute citation.we must construe similar statutes,those in pari materia,to achieve a uniform and consistent legislative purpose.isobe unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d,accord people black cal d,fn.in lungren deukmejian cal d,our supreme court added the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme citation 
failure to serve the summons and complaint constitutes grounds to vacate renewal of a judgment 
a money judgment is enforceable for years from the date of its entry,green zissis th,d.however,there are two alternative methods to extend the life of a money judgment.first,a judgment creditor may file a separate action on the judgment.a judgment creditor may bring an independent action on a judgment even after the year enforceability period has expired if the statute of limitations in section has not yet run.green zissis,supra,th at,d pratali gates th,d cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.the law revision commission comment to section explains as follows section makes clear that the year period of enforcement prescribed by section and the renewal procedure provided by article commencing with section do not affect the right to bring an action on a judgment.the limitation period for commencing the action is prescribed by section.the period provided by section and the statute of limitations provided by section are not coterminous.the period prescribed in section commences on the date of entry and is not tolled for any reason.the statute of limitations commences to run when the judgment is final citation and may be tolled such as by the debtor absence from the state see section.cal.law revision com,west civ,supra,foll,green zissis,supra,th at,d pratali gates,supra,th at,d.alternatively,a judgment creditor may,as here,renew a judgment for an additional years.et.
the statutory renewal procedure enacted in stats,ch,et was not intended to replace the then existing method to extend the life of a independent action on the judgment.the statutory renewal procedure was intended to save time and money while remaining fair to the judgment debtor by affording him or her the opportunity to assert any defense that could have been asserted in an independent action.tom thumb glove han,supra,d at.silbrico raanan d,fn.accordingly,the legislature directed that a trial court may vacate renewal of a judgment on any ground that would be a defense to an action on the judgment,subd.a in re marriage of thompson th,d.
we turn to the question whether the complete failure to have ever served process on a defendant is a defense to an action on the judgment and therefore can be raised on a section motion.there are few published decisions construing section.none of those decisions address lack of service of the summons and complaint in connection with a section motion to vacate a clerk renewal of a judgment.see timberline,jaisinghani th,d suspended corporation can not renew a judgment in re marriage of thompson,supra,th at,d satisfaction of judgment is a defense to an action on the judgment in re marriage of henderson d.remand for determination of correct amount of renewed judgment brunzell construction,smith d.denial of motion to vacate renewal of judgment issue relating to application of california uniform commercial code.however,the supreme court has held,under circumstances indistinguishable from the present case,that the failure to have served the summons and complaint is a defense to an action on a judgment.hill city cab.cal.hill city cab,supra,cal.at page,was an action on a judgment in which the defendant asserted t
