background 
the relevant facts in this bankruptcy appeal are undisputed.on march,the nowaks executed a mortgage on their medina,ohio residence in favor of pcfs.three years later,the nowaks jointly filed for chapter bankruptcy relief.spragin was appointed as trustee for the nowaks estate and,in that capacity,she issued notices to the nowaks creditors to file proofs of claim.the bar date for filing such claims was july.at the time these notices were issued,pcfs was considered a secured creditor and therefore was not required to file a proof of claim.see fed.a requiring only unsecured creditors to file proofs of claim against bankruptcy estates.the nowaks received a discharge from the bankruptcy court in august.
on the day after all proofs of claim were due,spragin moved to employ an attorney for the purpose of voiding the lien of pcfs on the nowaks residence pursuant to a.the bankruptcy court granted this motion and,in october,spragin filed a separate adversary proceeding to void pcfs lien.spragin contended that pcfs mortgage was invalid under ohio law because the execution of the mortgage had not been witnessed by two people.
meanwhile,in the underlying bankruptcy case,spragin filed a notice of intent to sell the residence.she proposed the sale because pcfs lien on the residence was the subject of a bona fide dispute.pcfs objected,arguing that there was no bona fide dispute and that the proposed sale price would not satisfy the lien,but instead would create a deficiency.in addition,pcfs filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy code and for the abandonment of the nowaks residence by the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court overruled pcfs objection to the sale of the residence,and pcfs subsequently withdrew its motion for relief from the automatic stay.
at the conclusion of the bench trial in the adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of spragin and against pcfs.the court agreed with spragin that pcfs mortgage was not executed with the proper formalities.accordingly,the court entered an order voiding pcfs lien on june,causing pcfs to become an unsecured creditor.pcfs appealed that decision to the bap.
while pcfs appeal was pending in the adversary proceeding,spragin filed an amended notice of intent to sell the nowaks residence in the underlying bankruptcy case.pcfs did not file an objection to the notice.the residence was sold in the spring of for.in september,the bap affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court in the adversary proceeding,and pcfs did not appeal.
no documents were filed by the parties in the bankruptcy case during.in january,spragin filed a final report and accounting.she recommended the distribution of funds to all unsecured creditors who had filed allowed claims.because pcfs had not filed a proof of claim,however,spragin did not include pcfs as a creditor in the proposed distribution.
pcfs objected to spragin final report and moved the bankruptcy court to allow an informal proof of claim.the motion stated that t he filings made to the court,including the motion for relief from stay and documents filed within the adversary proceeding,and the debtors testimony collectively qualified as an informal proof of claim.spragin responded by arguing that pcfs claim should not be allowed because pcfs had ample opportunity to file a formal proof of claim but failed to do so.
the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of spragin.first,the court determined that pcfs various filings did not constitute an informal proof of claim because they did not contain a demand on the nowaks estate and did not express an intent to hold the nowaks liable for the debt.in the alternative,the court concluded that the equities weighed in favor of disallowing pcfs informal proof of claim.the court reasoned that pcfs had not filed anything prior to the deadline,that pcfs had not explained its failure to file a formal proof of claim,and that the allowance of pcfs claim would reduce the recovery of the other creditors from percent to percent.accordingly,the court overruled the objection of pcfs and denied pcfs motion to allow an informal proof of claim.
pcfs appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the bap.the bap majority concluded that pcfs filings in the bankruptcy court did in fact qualify as an informal proof of claim,but nevertheless deferred to the court discretion regarding the disallowance of the claim based on a weighing of the equities.in contrast,the bap dissent opined that the bankruptcy court decision to disallow pcfs claim lacked reasonable justification.pcfs appeals the decision of the bap,arguing that the bap erred in upholding the bankruptcy court conclusion that the equities weighed against allowing pcfs claim.
