this appeal calls upon us to address the scope of the doctrine,which provides that lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final judgments.lance dennis,d.the supreme court has only applied the doctrine as a bar to jurisdiction on two occasions,the first instance being rooker and the second instance being feldman.recently,in exxon mobil corporation saudi basic industries corporation,d,the supreme court addressed the scope of the doctrine,holding that it is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.id.at.
this case stems from a prior lawsuit in state court.in september of,appellants jeannette nicholson,and career assessment atlanta,appellants filed a lawsuit against appellees james shafe,career training concepts,and sales and management training institute of atlanta appellees in georgia state court,seeking an accounting of profits relating to a copyright claim under state law.appellants lost at trial.while an appeal to the georgia appellate court remained pending,appellants filed this declaratory judgment action,requesting,inter alia,an accounting under federal law.the district court dismissed the action sua sponte based on lack of jurisdiction,applying the doctrine,and ordered sanctions against the appellants.this appeal followed.
because we find that the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction exceeded the scope of the doctrine as clarified in exxon mobil,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
as is typical in cases implicating the doctrine,a state court action preceded the instant federal declaratory judgment action.on september,the appellants filed a verified complaint and demand for jury trial against the appellees in the superior court of gwinett county,georgia,asserting claims for,inter alia,an accounting for copyright profits under state law construing the federal district court ruling as establishing that the subject work constituted a joint work as a matter of law,the appellants argued that they were entitled to of the profits that arose from the joint work 
the appellants moved for summary judgment.the state court denied the motion,concluding that the district court ruling in the underlying federal action,that the subject work constituted a joint work,was dicta.the state court also found that the accounting claim sounded in georgia joint law,not federal copyright law.the case proceeded to trial and,on october,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the appellees.on november,the appellants filed an appeal 
on november,the same day that they appealed the jury verdict in the state court action,the appellants filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against the appellees in united states district court for the northern district of georgia,alleging two causes of action declaratory judgment to establish that the appellants and the appellees were equal of the subject work and that the appellants were entitled to an accounting and declaratory judgment to determine the applicability of federal preemption of copyright accounting matters.
on november,the appellees filed a motion to dismiss,asserting res judicata,collateral estoppel,and the statute of limitations.on january,the appellees filed a motion for sanctions.the appellants responded to both motions.on march,the district court granted both motions.nicholson shafe,civil action file,slip.op.at.march,order granting motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and motion for rule sanctions.as to the motion to dismiss,the district court,recognizing its ongoing duty to inquire as to jurisdiction,sua sponte found that it lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine.in light of its lack of jurisdiction,the district court declined to address whether the state court findings are barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel in this action because it lack ed jurisdiction to do so.id.at.as to the motion for sanctions,the district court found that appellants complaint warranted sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure and.as relief,the district court dismissed the appellants complaint,issued an injunction against the filing of additional complaints in that court based on the same facts without first obtaining a court order,and ordered the appellants to pay a fine as well as attorney fees.the appellants appealed.
jurisdictional question 
the district court march,order granted the following relief to the appellees dismissal of the complaint an injunction against the appellants,enjoining them from filing future lawsuits against the appellees in that court based on the facts underlying the case without first obtaining a court order a fine in the amount of and an order of attorney fees in an undetermined amount.on march,the appellants appealed.in response,we presented the following jurisdictional question to the parties,addressing only the order of attorney fees whether the district court march,order is final and appealable to the extent that it awarded sanctions but directed defendants to submit proof of their reasonable attorney fees,and,i f not,whether the notice of appeal is premature with respect to plaintiffs counsel.on may,the appellants submitted their appellants statement regarding jurisdictional questions,in which they assert that we retain jurisdiction over the entirety of the march,order.the appellees did not file a response.
subsequent events to the issuance of the jurisdictional question and the appellants statement have rendered moot any question with respect to the jurisdictional question.on may,the district court quantified the amount of attorney fees and costs,ordering the appellants to pay.in response to that order,the appellants filed a second notice of appeal on may.on june,the appellants filed appellants motion to consolidate appeals,which this court granted on august.because the appellants filed a second notice of appeal as to the may,order and subsequently consolidated that appeal with the first appeal,the jurisdictional question as to the appealability of the march,order as to the undetermined amount of attorney fees and costs is now moot.
discussion 
this appeal raises two separate yet related issues the dismissal of the appellants case for want of jurisdiction under the doctrine and the entry of sanctions against the appellants counsel.
we review dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.barbour haley,cir.we review a district court imposition of sanctions under rule and under section for an abuse of discretion.amlong amlong,denny,cir section anderson smithfield foods,cir rule.
a.the doctrine 
generally speaking,the doctrine bars federal district courts from reviewing state court decisions.the supreme court stated in exxon mobil that the doctrine has sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases and it should be confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name.exxon mobil,at.thus,we begin our analysis with the rooker and feldman cases.
in rooker,a plaintiff filed a bill of equity in federal district court seeking a declaration that an indiana circuit court judgment,which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state,be declared null and void.rooker,at.the plaintiff argued that the circuit court judgment contravened certain provisions of the united states constitution.the supreme court determined that the federal district courts lacked jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding to reverse or modify a state court judgment,even if said judgment was wrong.id.at.the jurisdiction of federal district courts,the supreme court explained,is strictly original and such courts may not exercise appellate jurisdiction over purported erroneous state court judgments.id.rather,congress empowered only the supreme court to do so.the supreme court affirmed the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.
approximately years after rooker,the supreme court decided feldman.there,two disappointed applicants to the district of columbia bar filed separate lawsuits in the united states district court for the district of columbia after the district of columbia court of appeals refused to waive a court rule that required district of columbia bar applicants to have graduated from an accredited law school approved by the american bar association.neither plaintiff graduated from an accredited law school.the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear their claims,but the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia reversed in part,concluding that the waiver proceedings in the district of columbia court of appeals were not judicial proceedings.the supreme court granted certiorari.
having determined that the proceedings surrounding the plaintiffs waiver petitions in the district of columbia court of appeals were judicial in nature,the supreme court concluded that a federal district court has no authority to review final judgments of a state court in judicial proceedings.feldman,at.review of such judgments may be had only in the united states supreme court.id.the supreme court drew a distinction between general challenges to the constitutionality of state bar rules and challenges to state court decisions in particular cases that raise federal constitutional questions,finding that a federal district court has jurisdiction to consider the former but not the latter.id.at.in other words,the supreme court determined that the federal district court had jurisdiction to consider the general attack on the constitutionality of the bar rule requiring graduation from an accredited law school but that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the allegations inextricably intertwined with the district of columbia court of appeals decisions,in judicial proceedings,to deny the respondents petitions.id.at.
and so the doctrine,as it came to be known,was born.underlying the analysis in rooker and feldman is the interpretation of two federal statutes and.first,section provides that federal district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under federal law,not appellate jurisdiction.second,section provides for supreme court review of state court judgments f inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had,may be reviewed by the supreme court by writ of certiorari when certain federal questions arise.a.taken together,the doctrine draws a negative inference from section because congress only provided for review of state court judgments by the supreme court,congress therefore intended to preclude lower federal courts from exercising such review.federacion de maestros de puerto rico junta de relaciones del trabajo de puerto rico,cir.see also dornheim sholes,cir the basis for the doctrine is that,other than in the context of habeas claims,federal district courts are courts of original jurisdiction,and by statute they are precluded from serving as appellate courts to review state court judgments,as that appellate function is reserved to the supreme court under.
building on this foundation,the eleventh circuit set forth a test to guide the application of the doctrine,finding that it bars federal court jurisdiction where 
the party in federal court is the same as the party in state court,see roe alabama,cir the prior state court ruling was a final or conclusive judgment on the merits,see david vincent,broward county,cir the party seeking relief in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise its federal claims in the state court proceeding,see dale moore,cir per curiam and the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or was inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment,see goodman ex rel.goodman sipos,cir.
amos glynn county bd.of tax assessors,cir the district court here applied the amos test,reasoning that we had applied the amos factors in cases after exxon mobil,albeit only in unpublished decisions.see morris wroble,cir herskowitz reid,cir mickens tenth judicial circuit,cir.neither of the parties cite to an eleventh circuit published decision after exxon mobil where we had occasion to apply amos see gamble pinnoak,llc,d,noting that the eleventh circuit has not determined whether exxon mobil necessitates modification of the amos test but anticipat ing that,in the appropriate case,the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit will modify the amos test based on the same rationale from the supreme court decision in exxon mobil madura countrywide home loans,wl,at,as of yet,the eleventh circuit has not published an opinion in which it has addressed the import of exxon mobil on its jurisprudence.by way of its unpublished cases,the eleventh circuit has thus far declined to decide whether exxon mobil requires it to modify its amos test.this appeal provides us with an occasion to consider the continued viability of the amos test,and to clarify our precedent.we begin by considering the guidance provided in exxon mobil.
in exxon mobil,two subsidiaries of exxon mobil formed a joint venture with saudi basic industries sabic to produce polyethylene in saudi arabia.a dispute arose regarding royalties charged by sabic.similar to our case,exxon mobil involved a state action and a federal action.in july of,sabic filed a declaratory judgment action in delaware state court,asserting that the joint venture agreements allowed the royalties.about two weeks later,exxon mobil and its subsidiaries filed an action in federal court,asserting that sabic overcharged the joint ventures.in january of,exxon mobil answered sabic state court complaint,asserting counterclaims mirroring their claims in federal court.in the federal action,sabic filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court denied,and sabic sought interlocutory appeal.meanwhile in the state court action,in march of,a jury found in favor of exxon mobil in the amount of million.sabic appealed.after the jury verdict in state court,the federal appellate court on interlocutory appeal raised jurisdiction sua sponte by way of the doctrine,reasoning that exxon mobil claims had been litigated in state court.the appellate court did not question subject matter jurisdiction at the outset of the suit,but rather held that federal jurisdiction terminated when the delaware state trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict.
noting that the doctrine has sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases,the supreme court found that it did not apply.id.at.the supreme court held that the doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.id.at.drawing on the facts of rooker and feldman,the supreme court delineated the scope of the doctrine when the the losing party in state court file s suit in federal court after the state proceedings end,complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.id.at.the court noted that parallel state and federal litigation does not trigger the doctrine simply by the entry of judgment in state court.id.at.rather,preclusion law would govern the federal action once the state court adjudication was complete.the supreme court further noted that does not prohibit a district court from exercising jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.id.at.turning back to the facts,the supreme court concluded that the doctrine did not prevent the district court from exercising jurisdiction when exxonmobil filed the federal action,and it did not emerge to vanquish jurisdiction after exxonmobil prevailed in the delaware courts.id.at.
the appellees argue that exxon mobil does not apply here because the plaintiff in exxon mobil filed the federal court action before the jury verdict in the state court action and the appellants here filed the federal action after the jury verdict in the state court action.in the appellees words,in order to fall within the scope of exxon mobil,the appellants should have filed their federal complaint before judgment was entered in the state court action.yet,nothing in exxon mobil indicates that the supreme court intended to limit its holding to its facts.instead,exxon mobil clarified the scope of the doctrine by returning it to its roots,the facts of the rookerand feldman cases.in doing so,exxon mobil casts doubt on the continued viability of the amos test.see united states mendez,cir when a prior panel decision conflicts with a subsequent supreme court decision,we must depart from the prior panel precedent and follow the supreme court decision.rather than apply amos,we adhere to the language in exxon mobil,delineating the boundaries of the doctrine cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil,at.because the appellants commenced the federal district court action before the end of state proceedings in georgia,we find that the doctrine does not apply here.we now turn to the inquiry.
exxon mobil made it clear that the state court must have rendered judgment before the district court proceedings commenced.in explaining the scope of,exxon mobil clarified that the doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name.exxon mobil,at.in saying so,the supreme court limited the doctrine to its unique facts of the rooker and feldman cases i n both cases,the losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended,complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.exxon mobil,at.
exxon mobil clarified that the federal action must be filed after the state proceedings have ended,which,in turn,begs the question when have state proceedings ended in particular,we must address whether the entry of judgment on a jury verdict in a state trial court pending appeal marks the end of state proceedings for purposes of the doctrine.save its reference to the facts of the rooker and feldman cases as guidance,exxon mobil provides little direction concerning when state proceedings end.mobil,we have not yet addressed when a state proceeding ends for purposes of.but,two of our sister circuits provide useful guidance.
first,in federacion,the first circuit addressed whether the doctrine applies to an interlocutory jurisdictional decision of the puerto rico appellate courts.the first circuit noted that,under exxon mobil,a state court is sufficiently final when state proceedings have ended.federacion,at citing exxon mobil,at.as such,will not bar subject matter jurisdiction where a plaintiff initiates the federal lawsuit before the state court proceedings have ended.generally speaking,the first circuit found that state proceedings have ended in three situations when the highest state court in which review is available has affirmed the judgment below and nothing is left to be resolved,if the state action has reached a point where neither party seeks further action,and if the state court proceedings have finally resolved all the federal questions in the litigation,but state law or purely factual questions whether great or small remain to be litigated.id.at.while neither the first nor the third situations apply here,the second situation implies that a state proceeding has not ended when a state court loser seeks further action,such as an appeal the first circuit elaborated on the second scenario,opining that if a lower state court issues a judgment and the losing party allows the time for appeal to expire,then the state proceedings have ended.id.at.conversely,logic dictates that if a state court issues a judgment and the losing party here,the appellants does not allow the time for appeal to expire but instead,files an appeal,then the state proceedings have not ended.see id.at while the state court judgment is pending on appeal,it carries preclusive effect,but in most cases the state proceedings have not yet ended.
second,in dornheim,the eighth circuit applied exxon mobil and federacion to facts chronologically indistinguishable from the instant case.in dornheim,a mother filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against various state actors involved in her state court custody dispute with her and juvenile deprivation proceeding.the state court issued judgments on august,divorce and august,juvenile deprivation.the mother appealed both state court rulings to the supreme court of north dakota,which affirmed the lower court judgment in each appeal on june.the mother,however,had commenced her civil rights action in federal court nearly a year before the state supreme court ruled,specifically on august.therefore,according to the eighth circuit,a t the time that the plaintiffs commenced this federal action,the state court adjudication was not complete insofar as the appeal remained pending before the supreme court of north dakota.dornheim,at.
applied here,the chronology of significant dates is as follows the jury in the state court action returned its verdict on october,the appellants filed the instant federal action and the appellants appealed the jury verdict in the state court action on november,and the georgia appellate court affirmed the state trial court rulings on november,nearly one year after the commencement of the federal proceedings.as such,because an appeal remained pending in the state court action at the time the appellants filed the instant case,the state court proceedings had not ended for purposes of as clarified by exxon mobil.
while the district court acknowledged federacion and dornheim,it was persuaded by another line of cases,holding generally that applies to state court trial judgments.first,the district court relied on our precedent from a mobil case.in powell powell,cir,in response to a state trial court decree awarding part of eugene powell naval retirement pay to his wife as alimony in a divorce proceeding,powell filed an action in federal court contending that the federal statute which applies community property and equitable distribution principles to military retirement pay violated the takings clause of the fifth amendment as applied to him.we found that the doctrine applied and,of particular relevance here,the court determined that a litigant may not escape application of the doctrine by merely electing not to appeal an adverse state trial court judgment.powell,at.
the district court determined that powell weighs in favor of applying to state trial court judgments.nicholson shafe,at.after exxon mobil,however,the relevant inquiry is not whether the doctrine applies to state trial court judgments but whether the entry of judgment in a state trial court marks the end of state proceedings for purposes of.in our view,powell cuts against the application of the doctrine in a case where an appeal is pending.powell stands for the proposition that the doctrine applies where the state court loser declines to appeal an adverse state trial court judgment in line with the reasoning espoused in federacion and dornheim.see powell,at.powell implies that the doctrine does not apply where a state court loser has appealed to the state appellate court.
next,the district court relied on two cases from the ninth and sixth circuits.first,in confederated tribes of the colville reservation superior court of okanogan county,cir,the ninth circuit found that the doctrine applies where a party sought a declaratory judgment from a federal district court that a state court interpretation of a federal statute was unlawful,before the intermediate and highest appellate courts of washington have had the opportunity to review that decision.second,in pieper american arbitration association,cir,the sixth circuit concluded that the doctrine does apply to interlocutory orders and to orders of lower state courts.comparing federacion and dornheim with confederated tribes and pieper,the district court implies that a circuit split exists on the issue of when state proceedings end for purposes of,in particular where a state trial court had issued a judgment but the state appeals court had not.nicholson shafe,slip op.at.however,we find that no such split exists.confederated tribes and pieper were decided before the supreme court clarified the scope of the doctrine in exxon mobil in.hence,the ninth and sixth circuits lacked the benefit of the analysis in exxon mobil,in which the supreme court confined the application of the doctrine to cases resembling rooker and feldman where the state proceedings have ended.exxon mobil,at.neither confederated tribes nor pieper contain any analysis of that inquiry.federacion and dornheim,on the other hand,addressed when state proceedings end for purposes of,the precise issue before us.the persuasive value of confederated tribes and pieper is uncertain,at best 
third,the district court relies on one mobil case.in field auto city,general motors,d,a state trial court entered judgment on may,and,while an appeal remained pending to the supreme court of virginia,the plaintiff who received the adverse judgment in state court filed an action in federal court.six days later,the supreme court of virginia rejected the plaintiff appeal.the federal court framed the issue this way which of the two decisions governs with respect to and if the supreme court of virginia decision governs,does,although not initially applicable at the time the federal suit is filed,nonetheless operate to bar jurisdiction once the supreme court of virginia decision becomes final.id.at.finding that the state trial court judgment governs,the district court determined that there is no sound reason to preclude the operation of where a state trial court has rendered judgment,but state appeals are not yet complete when the federal action is filed.id.at.we disagree.we do not hold that the doctrine can not apply to state trial court judgments or state appellate court judgments.rather,bringing us in line with exxon mobil,the relevant inquiry is whether the state court proceedings have ended and,at the time the appellants filed this federal action,we find that they had not 
our analysis finds additional support in the tenth circuit.in guttman,having lost his medical license before a state board,stuart guttman,appealed to state court,claiming that the state board decision violated his rights under title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.the state court denied his appeal and refused to consider his title ii claim.he appealed to the new mexico court of appeals,which denied his appeal on april.guttman then filed a petition for certiorari to the new mexico supreme court,but on april,before the new mexico supreme court acted,he filed a cause of action in federal district court,alleging violations of title ii of the ada and violations of his procedural due process rights under.the new mexico supreme court denied his petition for certiorari about one month later,on may.the federal district court dismissed his claims under 
on remand from the supreme court,the tenth circuit concluded that because guttman filed his federal suit while his petition for certiorari to the new mexico supreme court remained pending,h is state suit was not final.guttman,at see id.at providing that u nder exxon mobil,it is clear that the district court does have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case because,although guttman filed his claim after it was resolved by a new mexico court,it was filed before the end of the state courts appeal process,one month before the state supreme court denied a petition for certiorari.consequently,did not apply.
similarly here,because the appellants filed the instant federal action while the state court action continued in the appeals process in state court,the state proceedings had not ended.this narrow construction of the doctrine follows the lead of the supreme court.see exxon mobil,at.providing that the doctrine precludes a federal district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction in limited circumstances.the doctrine does not supplant preclusion law or augment other doctrines related to deference to state court actions.id.at.rather,d isposition of the federal action,once the adjudication is complete,would be governed by preclusion law.exxon mobil,at.
in exxon mobil,a unanimous supreme court warned the lower courts that we have extended far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases id.at.our decision here,confining the scope of the doctrine to instances where the state proceedings have ended,in line with both the rooker and feldman cases,heeds that warning.a year after exxon mobil,the supreme court referred to it as a limited doctrine.see lance,at.neither rooker nor feldman elaborated a rationale for a bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal courts,and our cases since feldman have tended to emphasize the narrowness of the rule.after all,s ince feldman,the supreme court has never applied to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.exxon mobil,at.
in conclusion,we agree with our sister circuits the first,eighth and tenth circuits and hold that state proceedings have not ended for purposes of when an appeal from the state court judgment remains pending at the time the plaintiff commences the federal court action that complains of injuries caused by the state court judgment and invites review and rejection of that judgment.at the time of the filing of this action,the state proceeding in the georgia courts had not ended but remained pending on appeal and therefore did not divest the united states district court for the northern district of georgia of jurisdiction 
after dismissing the appellants claims for want of jurisdiction,the district court imposed sanctions against the appellants counsel pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure and,stating that there is no legal theory on which the appellants had a reasonable possibility of success given the application of the doctrine and assuming arguendo that did not apply,the appellants claims would clearly be barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.nicholson shafe,slip op.at.considering exxon mobil and our finding that does not apply here,we can not say the same with respect to appellants claims.furthermore,while we do not condone a decision to file a complaint in federal court as an insurance policy,the supreme court in exxon mobil made it clear that t here is nothing necessarily inappropriate about filing a protective action.exxon mobil,at.
we also disagree with the district court alternative rationale for imposing sanctions.the application of res judicata in this case depends,in large part,on whether the state court claims were part of the same nucleus of operative fact as the federal court claims and therefore constitute the same cause of action.see trustmark ins.eslu,cir.though we do not express an opinion as to how the district court should ultimately rule on this issue,we note that the state trial court distinction between an accounting brought under georgia law and a federal copyright accounting makes it at least arguable whether the state court claims are the same as the appellants federal court claims.likewise,the application of collateral estoppel depends on the perhaps even closer question of whether the issues raised in the federal action were actually litigated and decided in state court.see csx,of maint.of way employees,cir.the district court ruling contained little analysis on these issues,and it abused its discretion by simply assuming that the two doctrines would apply if it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case.
accordingly,we reverse the district court imposition of sanctions 
conclusion 
we hold that,in light of exxon mobil,state proceedings have not ended for purposes of when an appeal from a state court judgment remains pending in state court at the time that the state court loser commences the federal court action.therefore,we reverse the district court dismissal of the appellants case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction by way of the doctrine.we also reverse the district court imposition of sanctions against the appellants counsel,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
