plaintiffs brought this quiet title action to extinguish a lien of deed of trust held by defendants against their property.plaintiffs claim the defendants lien expired under a statute of limitations triggered by defendant recording of a notice of default.defendants claim their notice of default did not trigger the statute,and their lien remains viable under a statute of limitations.
two appellate decisions addressed this issue and reached different results.slintak buckeye retirement,th,d slintak concluded a notice of default triggered the statute.ung koehler th,d ung determined a notice of default did not trigger the statute where the notice was recorded after the period had expired,and the statute applied.
the trial court here relied upon slintak and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.although the notice of default in this case was recorded before the period expired,we conclude ung is the better reasoned authority applicable here,and we reverse the judgment.
by means of a cashier check dated april,mary pearce loaned to her brother,robert maple.on january,mary recorded a deed of trust securing the debt.the deed of trust identified robert and his wife,stella maple,as trustors,and mary as the trustee.it encumbered real property owned by robert and stella located at and east indiana street in woodbridge,california.the deed did not include a copy of an underlying promissory note,nor did it indicate the date the obligation matured.
on january,mary recorded a notice of default.the notice indicated robert and stella owed as of december.the notice stated all sums secured by the deed of trust were immediately due and payable,and that mary intended to cause the real property to be sold to satisfy the debt.
however,after recording the notice of default,mary took no action to foreclose nonjudicially upon the property.no notice of intent to preserve the security interest was recorded pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a.

procedural history 
on august,more than years after the loan matured according to the date stated in the notice of default,plaintiffs filed this action against defendants to quiet title and to obtain a declaration that the deed of trust had been extinguished.
plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.they claimed enforcement of the deed of trust was barred under a statute of limitations contained in civil code section,subdivision a,as that statute read prior to january,under that statute,the lien of a deed of trust expires years after the last date fixed for payment of the debt if that date is ascertainable from the record.former,subd.a stats,ch,italics added.plaintiffs claimed the record included any recorded document that disclosed the debt maturity date,including a notice of default 
defendants argued enforcement was not barred,claiming a statute of limitations found at former section,subdivision a,applied.under that subdivision,if the last date fixed for payment of the debt is not ascertainable from the record,a lien of a deed of trust expires years after the date the deed of trust was recorded.former,subd.a,italics added.defendants argued the record was limited to the recorded deed of trust,which in this case did not disclose the debt maturity date.if that is so,the statute applied.
alternatively,defendants asserted that an amendment to section,effective january,was retroactive,and that it resulted in the statute governing enforcement of the deed of trust.by this amendment,the legislature rewrote the phrase ascertainable from the record in both subdivisions a and a to read ascertainable from the recorded evidence of indebtedness.italics added.defendants claimed the legislature,by this amendment,clarified that it originally intended the document recording the indebtedness,such as a deed of trust,to be what determined which statute of limitations applied,and a notice of default was not the recorded evidence of indebtedness referred to in section.
the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on october.relying on the second appellate district holding in slintak that for purposes of former section,the debt maturity date may appear in any recorded document,including a notice of default,the court held the recorded notice of default was sufficient evidence in the record to establish the debt maturity date,and it imposed the statute of limitations contained in former section,subdivision a.the trial court also determined the amendment,whatever its meaning,was not retroactive and did not apply.
on appeal,defendants claim the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.they assert slintak was wrongly decided and the statute applies under former section,subdivision a,or,alternatively,the amendment is retroactive and the statute applies under current section,subdivision a.
discussion 
iformer section 
defendants claim the slintak court reached the wrong result.that court determined the phrase the record in former section meant any recorded document.thus,if a recorded notice of default included the debt maturity date,it was sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations.defendants contend the record,interpreted correctly,means a recorded document reflecting the actual debt obligation,such as a deed of trust or a promissory note,and not a notice of default.we agree.interpreting the record to mean any recorded document would render the statute nugatory,an interpretation which statutory construction is designed to avoid.
in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.estate of griswold cal th,d.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute or of the voters in the case of a provision adopted by the voters.citations.lungren deukmejian cal d.
if we can not discern the legislature clear intent from the plain language of the statute,or if the language is susceptible to more than one interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.citation.granberry islay investments cal th,d.
the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
applying these rules to the case at hand,we part ways from slintak because that decision,unlike ung,relied solely on a literal interpretation of the phrase the record without paying any attention to the phrase context,the phrase possible other meanings,or the effect the court interpretation has on other related statutes.ung followed these rules of construction and reached a decision that compels our resolution of this case.
