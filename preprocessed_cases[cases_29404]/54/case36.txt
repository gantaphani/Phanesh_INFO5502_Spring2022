plaintiffs are direct or indirect victims of terrorist acts linked to the islamic republic of iran iran,against which they hold unsatisfied money judgments.plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to enforce these judgments against alavi foundation and fifth avenue company together,defendants pursuant to the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia and the terrorism risk insurance act tria.
this appeal requires us to determine whether defendants qualify,as a matter of law,as the foreign state of iran or an agency or instrumentality thereof,such that defendants properties may be turned over to help satisfy plaintiffs judgments against iran under the fsia.we are also called upon to determine whether,under the tria,defendants qualify,as a matter of law,as iran or an agency or instrumentality thereof insofar as iran is a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,and defendants properties are blocked assets that may be turned over to help satisfy plaintiffs judgments against iran.
we conclude that defendants in this case do not equate to the foreign state of iran for purposes of the fsia or the tria.we further conclude that defendants can not be deemed agencies or instrumentalities of iran under the fsia,but that defendants status as agencies or instrumentalities of iran under the tria and their properties status as blocked assets under that statute is not foreclosed as a matter of law.nevertheless,we identify questions of fact that prevent either of these tria questions from being decided on summary judgment.accordingly,we vacate the summary judgment award in favor of plaintiffs and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

overview of facts 
the background facts of this case are provided in detail in an accompanying opinion.in re fifth avenue and related properties,in re fifth.we assume familiarity with that opinion,and provide an abbreviated version of events here.
iran involvement with the alavi foundation and fifth avenue company 
the alavi foundation alavi or the foundation traces its origins to,when the shah of iran,mohammad reza pahlavi,incorporated the eponymous pahlavi foundation as a new york corporation,and endowed it with several million dollars.following the iranian revolution,the ayatollah khomeini ordered the formation of the bonyad mostazafan,an entity charged with managing property expropriated by the revolutionary government,and the pahlavi foundation was renamed the mostazafan foundation of new york.the foundation took on its present name in since its inception,alavi has purchased and maintained several properties in the united states,including a office tower at fifth avenue in new york city the building,the construction of which was financed by loans alavi received from bank melli,a bank wholly owned by iran.
fifth avenue company fifth or the partnership is a partnership created under new york law in as part of a plan to relieve alavi of tax obligations that it incurred as a result of the mortgages bank melli held on the building.specifically,alavi,together with the government of iran,the bonyad mostazafan,and bank melli,agreed to a plan whereby bank melli used a chain of straw companies to enter into a partnership with alavi.through a series of circular transactions,instead of holding mortgages on the building,bank melli became a and eventually owner of fifth and,thereby,a partial owner of the building.see in re fifth,at discussing details of tax transaction.alavi owns the other of fifth and,until,served as fifth managing partner,administering the affairs of the partnership.see id.at describing ownership and management of partnership.although assa corporation,which was owned by assa company limited collectively,assa,has always been alavi record partner in fifth,bank melli has owned the entities since their creation.see id.at explaining evidence of bank melli relationship with assa.
in addition to ample record evidence of bank melli involvement with alavi,assa,and fifth,as detailed in our accompanying opinion,the record also indicates that other iranian government entities and officials continued to exercise some control over alavi affairs after its creation in.as relevant to this action,record evidence shows that from to,a bonyad mostazafan employee sat on alavi board and provided reports about alavi to iran prime minister or the head of the bonyad mostazafan every three months,see in re fifth,at in the early,alavi board composition changed as directed by the supreme leader of iran,around that same time,iran ambassador to the united nations exercised a position of responsibility over alavi affairs,and in,certain alavi board members and alavi,farshid jahedi,met with iran ambassador to the united nations,mohammad khazaee,see id.at.other record evidence,however,suggests that,at least in the,alavi operated independently of iran.see,app x testimony of alavi board member abbas mirakhor that alavi decisions were made by alavi board and president without interference by iran app x declaration of alavi financial manager hanieh safakamal that alavi managed own assets and chose own employees app x declaration of alavi program coordinator confirming lack of iran participation in alavi affairs.
relevant sanctions against iran 
financial sanctions 
in march six years after fifth formation president clinton issued a series of executive orders pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act ieepa,formally declaring the government of iran a threat to this nation security and imposing broad financial sanctions.see exec.order,fed.reg,exec.order,fed.reg.may.those executive orders authorized the secretary of the treasury,in consultation with the secretary of state,to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the financial sanctions.
pursuant to that authority,the treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac determined that bank melli was owned or controlled by the government of iran,and thus subjected it to,among other things,limitations on the receipt of services from financial institutions beginning june,except as authorized by an ofac license.see implementation of executive order with respect to iran,fed.reg.ofac also subsequently promulgated a series of iranian transactions regulations itrs relevant to this action,which took effect on august,and which generally prohibit united states entities from conducting business with or providing services to the government of iran.the government of iran is defined in the itrs as t he state and the government of iran,as well as any political subdivision,agency,or instrumentality thereof,a ny person owned or controlled,directly or indirectly,by the foregoing,and a ny person acting or purporting to act,directly or indirectly,for or on behalf of the foregoing.see id.alavi and fifth are united states entities subject to these orders and regulations and prohibited thereby from conducting business with or providing services to bank melli or any other instrumentality owned or controlled by,or acting on behalf of,the government of iran.
in,after the first of the relevant executive orders imposing sanctions on iran was issued,bank melli formally divested its ownership of assa.our accompanying opinion,in re fifth,held that there was no genuine dispute of fact that assa was owned or controlled by the government of iran even after.we also held,however,that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether alavi provided services to assa after knowing it was so owned or controlled.
blocking regime 
in addition to conferring authority on the president to regulate and prohibit transactions to deal with threats to this nation security,foreign policy,or economy,the ieepa authorizes the president to block property to address such threats.see.in,president obama,acting pursuant to the authority conferred on him under the ieepa,issued executive order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in executive order of march,particularly in light of the deceptive practices of the central bank of iran and other iranian banks to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties.exec.order,fed.reg,hereinafter exec.order.as relevant here,that order states that a ll property and interests in property of the government of iran,including the central bank of iran,that are in the united states are blocked and may not be transferred,paid,exported,withdrawn,or otherwise dealt in.id.emphasis added see implementing blocking order.the order defines government of iran to mean the government of iran,any political subdivision,agency,or instrumentality thereof and any person owned or controlled by,or acting for or on behalf of,the government of iran.exec.order.
ofac periodically publishes a list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons sdn list,and since january,a list of persons whose property is blocked pursuant to executive order because they satisfy executive order definition of government of iran or iranian financial institution executive order list.see,note.defendants alavi and fifth have never been named on either list.bank melli and assa,however,have both been named on the sdn list in,bank melli was added to the sdn list pursuant to weapons of mass destruction wmd nonproliferation sanctions and,in,assa was added to the sdn list based on the treasury department determination that assa was a front company for bank melli 
on january,the united states implemented the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa,a multilateral agreement pursuant to which the united states lifted sanctions previously imposed on iran and removed various entities subject to those sanctions from the sdn list,including bank melli and assa.see jcpoa annex ii see also id.attachment identifying assa,assa,and bank melli as entities removed from sdn list pursuant to jcpoa.bank melli was thereafter added to the executive order list.see ofac,list of persons identified as blocked solely pursuant to executive order,last visited july.the treasury department has explained that even after january,individuals and entities meeting the definition of the government of iran or an iranian financial institution as defined in the itrs,remain persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to and section of the itrs and,accordingly,persons continue to be broadly prohibited from engaging in transactions or dealings with these individuals and entities.dep t of treasury,guidance relating to the lifting of certain sanctions pursuant to the joint comprehensive plan of action on implementation day,at,hereinafter jcpoa guidance.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiffs began filing these turnover actions in december,shortly after the government initiated its civil forfeiture action though plaintiffs and the government both seek to seize defendants properties,they proceed on fundamentally different theories that require fundamentally different proofs.plaintiffs hold money judgments against iran.to take defendants properties under the fsia or the tria,then,plaintiffs must show at least that defendants somehow are iran or an agency or instrumentality thereof as contemplated by those statutes.the government,by contrast,must show that defendants committed a forfeitable offense under the ieepa,the itrs,or the money laundering statutes,a burden that does not necessarily require proof that defendants are the state of iran or an agency or instrumentality thereof the government need not and does not allege that defendants are iran.
defendants opposed plaintiffs proposed attachments,moving for summary judgment in this turnover action on august.they argued,inter alia,that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs fsia or tria claims because neither defendant meets the definition of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under the fsia,and,further,as to the tria claim,that defendants assets have not been seized or frozen by the united states.the district court denied defendants summary judgment motion.
shortly thereafter,plaintiffs moved for an award of summary judgment and turnover of defendants properties plaintiffs argued that the defendants are iran because they meet the definition of government of iran set forth in executive order and the implementing itrs.see exec.order.
in an opinion and order the district court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the turnover action because defendants are the foreign state of iran for fsia and tria purposes.see in re fifth avenue and related properties,civ.kbf,wl,in re fifth private action.the district court conclusion rested on three alternative grounds.first,the district court ruled that defendants met the definition of government of iran under executive order and the itrs,which definitions it concluded could be used to supplement the fsia definition of foreign state.id.at.second,the district court sua sponte held that defendants could also be considered a foreign state as the alter egos of iran.id.at.third,the district court sua sponte concluded that defendants are iran because they satisfy the fsia definition of agency or instrumentality.id.at.the district court further ruled that because defendants are iran,they are a terrorist party within the meaning of the tria,and their assets are blocked under executive order.id.at.based on these conclusions,the district court granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their fsia and tria claims and ordered the turnover of defendants specified assets.following entry of a final judgment,defendants timely appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court legal conclusions under the fsia,including whether a foreign state or its property is or is not shielded by immunity.see walters indus.commercial bank of china,cir.we accord deferential review to a district court ruling on a petition for an order of attachment or execution under the fsia,and we will reverse only for abuse of discretion.id.at.a district court abuses its discretion if it applies legal standards incorrectly,relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or proceeds on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
i.the foreign sovereign immunities act 
the fsia provides the exclusive basis for obtaining subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign state.see et argentine republic amerada hess shipping.it states that foreign states shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in sections to of this chapter.see saudi arabia nelson.
in the underlying actions giving rise to plaintiffs money judgments,district courts exercised subject matter jurisdiction over iran pursuant to the act terrorism exception,this exception abrogates immunity where money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death caused by certain acts,such as torture,extrajudicial killing,or material support thereof,if such acts are engaged in by an official,employee,or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency.id.where this exception applies,the foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.see also weinstein islamic republic of iran,cir.
in addition to conferring a presumption of jurisdictional immunity on foreign sovereigns,the fsia presumes attachment and execution immunity over a foreign sovereign property.see walters,at.thus,where a valid judgment has been entered against a foreign state,the foreign state united states property is immune from attachment and execution unless a statutory exception applies.see.
the district court found three attachment exceptions applicable to defendants two under the fsia,see a,g,and one under of the tria,codified as a note to of the fsia.each provides instances where a foreign sovereign property is attachable to satisfy judgments.here,we address the first two exceptions for attachment and execution of a foreign state property,fsia a,g below,we address the applicability of of the tria.
fsia exceptions g and a 
section g strips fsia attachment immunity from the property of a foreign state or of its agency or instrumentality if the underlying judgment was entered under terrorism exception.section a does the same with particular reference to property used for a commercial activity in the united states,where the underlying judgment was entered under either or its predecessor.id.a.whether these exceptions afford attachment jurisdiction over plaintiffs turnover claims thus turns on the threshold question of whether defendants may be deemed a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under the fsia 
foreign states under the fsia 
the fsia does not define foreign state except to state that it includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection b.a.our court has long construed foreign state as used in the fsia to mean an entity bearing the attributes of statehood,which include a defined territory and population,and foreign relations,and the capacity to wage war and to enter into international agreements.morgan guaranty tr.of republic of palau morgan guaranty,cir.citing united states curtiss wright export,and restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states concluding that trust territory of palau was not foreign state within meaning of fsia because,although it bore some attributes of statehood,it lacked ability to maintain diplomatic ties,enter into treaties,and join other states in making international law see klinghoffer achille lauro ed motonave achille lauro in amministrazione straordinaria,cir.rejecting fsia defense of palestine liberation organization because it did not meet definition of foreign state as one that has a defined territory and a permanent population,under the control of its own government,and that engages in,or has the capacity to engage in,formal relations with other such entities alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has cited these traditional sovereign characteristics in concluding that somalia former prime minister could not be sued as a foreign state under the fsia in a suit brought by somali victims of governmental abuse in the.samantar yousuf.the court traced the history of sovereign immunity from the common law through the enactment of the fsia,analyzed the text and legislative history of the statute,and concluded that the fsia codified a restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,with t he term foreign state on its face indicat ing a body politic that governs a particular territory.id.at citing restatement second of foreign relations law of the united states.following this controlling precedent here,we conclude that defendants,a new foundation and similarly registered partnership,themselves bear none of the attributes of statehood and,thus,can not be equated to the foreign state of iran.
in concluding otherwise,the district court relied on executive order,which defines the government of iran to include any person owned or controlled by,or acting for or on behalf of,the government of iran.exec.order.similarly,the itrs general definitions subchapter defines the government of iran to include a ny person to the extent that such person is,or has been,since the effective date,acting or purporting to act,directly or indirectly,for or on behalf of the government of iran.this reliance on executive branch definitions to construe foreign state under the fsia raises several concerns.
first,morgan guaranty did not bless the use of just any other sources in divining the meaning of foreign state.at.in morgan guaranty,we looked specifically to international law in identifying the attributes of statehood that define a foreign state.id.at.morgan guaranty did not invite courts to substitute other sources for the ones it employed and thereby to reach a different conclusion from the one dictated by that case in construing the identical statutory term.
second,executive order expressly states that its expansive definition of the government of iran is f or the purpose of this order.exec.order.the order and its implementing itrs were designed principally to further the united states sanctioning regime against iran.see.nowhere do those sources purport to supplement the fsia definition of a foreign state.thus,we conclude that these executive branch definitions,however helpful in identifying forfeitable offenses,can not be used to expand sovereign statehood under the fsia for a single foreign state.
this conclusion is consistent with a principal purpose of the fsia,namely,to transfer the determination of sovereign immunity from the executive branch to the judicial branch,thereby reducing the foreign policy implications of immunity determinations and assuring litigants that these often crucial decisions are made on purely legal grounds and under procedures that insure due process,at,reprinted in,see also samantar,at noting that the state department sought and supported the elimination of its role with respect to claims against foreign states and their agencies or instrumentalities.
in borrowing from executive branch definitions of iran,the district court erroneously reasoned that the key question here is not whether iran is a foreign state it certainly is,but whether the d efendants have acted in such a manner as to render them,too,equivalent to iran.in re fifth private action,wl,at.that miscast the relevant inquiry for determining if a defendant satisfies the definition of foreign state under the fsia,which asks whether that defendant itself possesses of the attributes of statehood long established in international law.
samantar illustrates this seemingly semantic but enormously substantive distinction.somalia,like iran,is certainly a foreign state,but in considering whether somalia former prime minister was a foreign state under the fsia,the supreme court did not ask,as the district court did here,whether the defendant acted in such a manner as to render him equivalent to the state.id.indeed,the supreme court expressly rejected an argument urging that line of inquiry.see samantar,at.instead,the court inquiry turned on whether the defendant bore traditional attributes of statehood or otherwise qualified as a subdivision,agency,or instrumentality not on whether the defendant acted sufficiently on behalf of the foreign state.id.
in sum,we conclude that a foreign state under the fsia is not properly defined by reference to an executive order authorizing broad sanctions on a particular country.rather,it is defined according to established constructions of the term.because there is no question here that defendants lack the traditional attributes of statehood,they are not themselves foreign states.
agencies or instrumentalities of a foreign state under the fsia 
the fsia does,however,reach beyond the international law understanding of foreign states to the extent it includes within that term,for fsia purposes,a foreign state agents or instrumentalities.see a stating that foreign state includes an agency or instrumentality thereof.the fsia defines agency or instrumentality as follows 
a an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state means any entity 
which is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise,and 
which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,and 
which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title,nor created under the laws of any third country.
b.all three statutory elements must be satisfied to render an entity an agency or instrumentality under the fsia.because jurisdiction depends upon the state of things at the time the action is brought,dole food patrickson,internal quotation marks omitted,an entity agency or instrumentality status under the fsia is determined at the time of the filing of the complaint,id.at,and not necessarily as of the time an alleged tort or other actionable wrong occurred,id.at.
defendants argue that the district court erred in its alternative ruling that,as a matter of law,they each fall within the definition of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under b,and in turn constitute a foreign state itself within the meaning of the fsia.in re fifth private action,wl,at.defendants do not dispute that they are separate legal person s,corporate or otherwise,from iran and thus that they meet the first prong for fsia agency or instrumentality status under b.they do argue,however,that they are not organ s of,or majority owned by,iran under b,and that they are citizens exempted from fsia agency or instrumentality status under b.because we agree with the latter argument,we need not address the former.
to qualify as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under the fsia,b states that the person or entity can not be a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title.b.section c defines the citizenship of corporations and representatives of decedents estates.see id.c.section e defines what is meant by states.see id.e.
in deciding that the defendants were not citizen s of a state of the united states for purposes of b,the district court stated that it was mindful that the shah incorporated the foundation in new york in,and that the partnership was created in new york.in re fifth private action,wl,at.the district court nonetheless deemed defendants citizens of iran under the equitable alter ego principles set forth in first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba bancec,which permit courts to disregard defendants corporate form when the doctrine of corporate entity would work fraud or injustice.in re fifth private action,wl,at quoting bancec,at.the court reasoned that t o allow defendants corporate status as american entities to dominate their actual function as organs of iran would violate the fraud or injustice principles set forth in bancec.id.
as an initial matter,we note that plaintiffs do not here challenge the district court conclusion that b would ordinarily preclude alavi,a new corporation,and fifth,a new partnership,from satisfying the fsia definition of agency or instrumentality.see in re fifth private action,wl,at.indeed,even when moving for summary judgment before the district court,plaintiffs did not argue that defendants satisfied b definition of agencies or instrumentalities.on appeal,plaintiffs argue only that the district court properly disregarded the fact that defendants are citizens of new york.acosta appellees br.thus,we assume without deciding that defendants can not satisfy b unless bancec can properly be applied to disregard an entity citizenship.
we conclude that bancec can not be so applied to b,which unambiguously exempts from fsia agency or instrumentality status all citizen s of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title.b.as explained infra,bancec fraud or injustice exception is appropriately considered in entertaining challenges to the presumption of corporate separateness and alter ego status,as was the case in bancec itself.it is not a basis for questioning corporate citizenship in the context of determining agency or instrumentality status as defined in the fsia.see bancec,at.
accordingly,because plaintiffs do not here challenge the district court conclusion that b would ordinarily preclude alavi and fifth,both entities,from satisfying the fsia definition of agency or instrumentality,and bancec can not be used to disregard b exemption of entities from that definition,we conclude that defendants are statutorily disqualified as agencies or instrumentalities of iran under fsia a and g.
alter ego principles 
the district court also used bancec separately to conclude that,regardless of defendants status as agencies or instrumentalities of iran,they are iran alter egos and,therefore,jurisdiction properly lies over defendants just as it would over iran.see in re fifth private action,wl,at.defendants fault the district court conclusion on two grounds bancec alter ego analysis does not permit a court to expand fsia jurisdiction to reach entities that do not otherwise satisfy that statute definition of agency or instrumentality,and in any event,the record evidence is insufficient to establish that defendants are alter egos of iran.although we disagree with the first argument,we agree with the second and,accordingly,conclude as a matter of law that defendants can not be equated to the foreign state of iran under bancec.
in arguing that bancec alter ego principles can not provide jurisdiction over an entity that does not otherwise satisfy the fsia agency or instrumentality definition,defendants maintain that the issue in bancec was whether an entity that indisputably qualified as an agency or instrumentality could be held substantively liable for the debts of a foreign state despite its separate incorporation and juridical status.in bancec,a cuban trade bank sued an american bank to collect an unpaid debt,and the american bank counterclaimed,asserting a right to offset the value of foreign assets that had been nationalized by the cuban government.see bancec,at.the cuban bank,relying on its separate juridical status,asserted that it could not be held liable for cuba debts.see id.at.the supreme court disagreed and,although recognizing the presumption that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such,id.at,held that the presumption could be rebutted,and an alter ego relationship established,if the instrumentality is so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created,or the recognition of an instrumentality separate legal status would work a fraud or injustice,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants argument that this alter ego test can not be used to establish fsia jurisdiction is foreclosed by fidelity guaranty braspetro oil services,cir.per curiam.there,we adopted the district court reasoning in affirming a finding of fsia jurisdiction over a party brasoil based on bancec alter ego analysis.see fid.guar.braspetro oil servs,civ.jgk,wl,at may,aff,fid.guar.braspetro oil,cir.brasoil itself failed to satisfy the fsia agency or instrumentality test because it was not by a foreign state or an organ of a foreign state,and was created under the laws of a third country.see fid.guar.braspetro oil,wl,at.the court nonetheless concluded that brasoil was a foreign state under the fsia because it was the alter ego of two entities petrobras and braspetro that constituted foreign states under the fsia by virtue of their status as agencies or instrumentalities of brazil.see id.at,the court explained that a lthough bancec dealt with the ability of an american corporation which was sued by an instrumentality of cuba to set off its own liabilities against the liabilities of cuba,courts have applied bancec to determine fsia jurisdiction.id.at.accordingly,the court determined that this or instrumentality could be considered a foreign state under alter ego analysis,and denied brasoil motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see id.at.defendants argument that they are legally foreclosed from qualifying as iran alter egos for jurisdictional purposes,therefore,fails 
nevertheless,we conclude that there is no record evidence that alavi and,therefore,fifth,of which alavi owns,is so extensively controlled by iran that a relationship of principal and agent is created.bancec,at.the touchstone inquiry for extensive control is whether the sovereign state exercise d significant and repeated control over the instrumentality operations.em banco central de la republica argentina,cir.the factors relevant to this inquiry include whether the sovereign nation uses the instrumentality property as its own ignores the instrumentality separate status or ordinary corporate formalities deprives the instrumentality of the independence from close political control that is generally enjoyed by government agencies requires the instrumentality to obtain approvals for ordinary business decisions from a political actor and issues policies or directives that cause the instrumentality to act directly on behalf of the sovereign state.id.
here,the record evidence cited by the district court and plaintiffs indicates,at most,iran involvement in alavi affairs the shah created alavi in,the bonyad mostazafan and bank melli assisted alavi in resolving its tax problem in the,the ayatollah directed the removal of certain board members,iran ambassador to the united nations had some supervisory role and one bonyad mostazafan employee sat on the alavi board.this evidence,however,is insufficient to demonstrate iran disregard for alavi separate corporate form,see em,at,much less iran exercise of control over alavi.indeed,plaintiffs fail to identify any record evidence suggesting such control.see id.at concluding that allegations that the president appoint ed argentina central bank officers for an unspecified period without senate approval and remov ed bcra governors who supported the central bank independence from the executive branch,and that argentina sought assistance of bank in responding to debt crisis were insufficient to show control under bancec mckesson islamic republic of iran,cir.concluding that bancec presumption of separateness was rebutted where government entities held percent of the corporation stock and controlled six of the seven seats on its board of directors,government shareholders forced the corporation to disregard its commercial missions,and iran influenced r outine business decisions,such as declaring and paying dividends to shareholders and honoring the corporation contractual commitments.thus,given the lack of evidence demonstrating iran control of alavi,we conclude,as a matter of law,that defendants can not be deemed iran alter egos under bancec 
ii.the terrorism risk insurance act 
the tria provides jurisdiction for execution and attachment proceedings to satisfy a judgment for which there was original jurisdiction under the fsia if certain statutory elements are satisfied.weinstein,at.section a of the tria sets forth these required elements 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in subsection b,in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism,or for which a terrorist party is not immune under a,the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution in order to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged liable.
tria a,pub,a,stat,codified at note.here,neither party disputes that there was original jurisdiction under the fsia for the plaintiffs underlying judgments.
thus,to attach defendants properties under the tria,plaintiffs must show that the defendants are a terrorist party or an agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party,and that the defendants properties are blocked assets.id.for the same reasons we rejected the conclusion that defendants are the foreign state of iran for purposes of the fsia,we reach that same conclusion insofar as the state of iran is a designated terrorist party under the tria.we conclude,however,that insofar as the attachment jurisdiction of both statutes also reaches an agency or instrumentality of iran,the fsia definition of that phrase in b does not apply to the tria.therefore,our conclusion that defendants can not be deemed agencies or instrumentalities of iran under the fsia does not prevent defendants from qualifying as agencies or instrumentalities of iran under the tria.we nevertheless remand the case for further proceedings because material questions of fact preclude a summary judgment determination that defendants are,indeed,agencies or instrumentalities for tria purposes,and their properties are blocked assets.
terrorist parties under the tria 
under the tria,three entities qualify as a terrorist party a terrorist,a terrorist organization as defined in section a b vi of the immigration and nationality act ina a b vi,or a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under section j of the export administration act of app.j or section of the foreign assistance act of.tria d.iran is a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under tria d,making it a terrorist party for tria purposes.see determination pursuant to section i of the export administration act of iran,fed.reg,accord weinstein,at.
the district court held that defendants also qualify as a terrorist party under the tria.its reasoning was as follows iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since,and therefore is a terrorist party within the meaning of tria and defendants are iran,and thus are a terrorist party within the meaning of tria.see in re fifth private action,wl,at.in reaching the latter conclusion,the district court appears to have relied on its fsia analysis,that defendants are the foreign state of iran because they satisfy executive order definition of government of iran,satisfy the fsia definition of agencies or instrumentalities,and are alter egos of iran under bancec.we have already explained why we reject each of those conclusions.accordingly,because defendants are not themselves a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,for their properties to be subject to tria attachment and execution,defendants must be agencies or instrumentalities of iran under tria.
agencies or instrumentalities of a terrorist party under the tria 
section a of the tria confers an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction over execution and attachment proceedings against property held in the hands of an agency or instrumentality of the terrorist party,even if the agency or instrumentality is not itself named in the judgment.weinstein,at.as this court has previously explained,this basis for subject matter jurisdiction derives from the plain language of tria a,which clearly differentiates between the party that is the subject of the underlying judgment itself,which can be any terrorist party here,iran,and parties whose blocked assets are subject to execution or attachment,which can include not only the terrorist party but also any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party.id.at.thus,the fact that plaintiffs obtained their underlying judgments against iran,not specifically against alavi or fifth,does not prevent plaintiffs from attaching defendants properties under the tria if,inter alia,defendants qualify as agencies or instrumentalities of iran under the tria.
while the fsia defines agency or instrumentality,the tria,unfortunately,does not.defendants argue that because the tria is codified as part of the fsia,the terms agency or instrumentality have the same meaning in the tria as they do in the fsia.see appellants br.the normal rule of statutory interpretation is that identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning.see ibp,alvarez.but this rule is not rigid,and the meaning of identical words well may vary to meet the purposes of the law.theodoropoulos ins,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,a statutory provision placement in a particular section can not substitute for the operative text of the statute.dep t of revenue piccadilly cafeterias.indeed,n o accepted canon of statutory interpretation permits placement to trump text,especially where the text is clear and our reading of it is fully supported by the legislative history.padilla rumsfeld,cir,rev on other grounds by rumsfeld padilla.
although both the fsia and the tria permit property in the united states held by certain agencies or instrumentalities to be attached,under the fsia the entity must be an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,b emphasis added,whereas,under the tria,the entity must be an agency or instrumentality of th e terrorist party.tria a emphasis added.thus,the text of the tria unambiguously reaches more broadly to permit the attachment of property in circumstances not covered by the fsia or fsia immunity.see weinstein,at see also rubin islamic republic of iran,cir.specifically,unlike the fsia,the tria permits attachment and execution against individual terrorist s and terrorist organization s and their agencies and instrumentalities.tria d.individual terrorists and many terrorist organizations encompassed in the tria definition of terrorist party are distinguishable from fsia foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities in an important respect they can be actors.see tria d defining terrorist party to include a terrorist,and a terrorist organization as defined in section a b vi of the ina a b vi see also a b vi section a b vi of the ina,defining terrorist organization to encompass nonstate terrorist entities ruth jpmorgan chase bank,supp,noting that while terrorist is not further defined in tria,term has been interpreted to require that individual be natural person id.at observing that section a b vi of the ina is aimed at groups like al qaeda and hezbollah,not foreign states.
precisely because tria encompasses actors and,thus,reaches more broadly than the fsia,it would contravene a plain reading of the tria to cabin its reach by applying the fsia definition of agency or instrumentality which requires a foreign state principal.see corley united states,noting that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant alterations and internal quotation marks omitted thus,we agree with the eleventh circuit that applying the fsia definition of agencies or instrumentalities to tria would leave only terrorist states as potential sponsors of agencies or instrumentalities under tria,eviscerating tria effectiveness vis terrorist organizations.stansell revolutionary armed forces of colombia,cir.that can not stand,as tria definition clearly contemplates nonstate judgment debtors being subjected to tria execution.id.
we recognize that where,as here,the alleged terrorist party is a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,as opposed to an individual terrorist or terrorist organization,applying the fsia definition of agency or instrumentality to the tria might appear less problematic.see tria d.just as with terrorist organizations,however,state sponsors of terrorism may operate with less transparency than other sovereign countries,making application of b factors unrealistic.see stansell,at noting that enterprises generally have clear ownership structures that make application of b feasible,while terrorist organizations operate in the shadows out of necessity,a corporation organized under florida law will almost certainly not list a terrorist organization as a shareholder of record but,rather,will operate through layers of affiliated individuals and front companies exec.order explaining additional steps necessary to address iran threat to this nation due to deceptive practices used by iran and its banks to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties dep t of treasury,press release,treasury designates bank melli front company in new york city,last visited july,explaining scheme to use a front company set up by bank melli a known proliferator of weapons of mass destruction to funnel money from the united states to iran in violation of sanctions internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,we conclude that b of the fsia does not apply selectively to foreign states designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under the tria.the plain language of the tria refers only to the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party,and does not differentiate among the variety of entities that might qualify as a terrorist party.see tria a,d.it is against the background of this statutory structure that we determine that congress did not intend for fsia b to apply selectively to the tria.thus,because the fsia definition of agency or instrumentality and specifically the three requirements specified in b do not pertain to those terms in the tria,our conclusion that defendants can not be agents or instrumentalities of the foreign state of iran for purposes of fsia jurisdiction does not foreclose defendants being agencies or instrumentalities of iran as a designated terrorist party under the tria.defendants argument for reversal on this ground fails.
at the same time,however,questions of fact preclude a tria award in plaintiffs favor as a matter of law.because the terms agency or instrumentality are undefined under the tria,we construe these words according to their ordinary meanings.see,taniguchi kan pac.saipan,see also stansell,at using plain and ordinary meaning of agency and instrumentality in tria.we determine the ordinary meaning of these terms in light of the statutory text of the tria as a whole.see deutsche bank trust quicken loans,cir.s tatutory interpretation must begin with the plain language,giving all undefined terms their ordinary meaning while attempting to ascertain how a reasonable reader would understand the statutory text,considered as a whole.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.

to demonstrate that defendants are agencies or instrumentalities of a terrorist party under the tria,therefore,plaintiffs must show that each defendant was a means through which a material function of the terrorist party is accomplished,provided material services to,on behalf of,or in support of the terrorist party,or was owned,controlled,or directed by the terrorist party see stansell,at explaining that party seeking to execute against assets of terrorist party agency or instrumentality under tria must establish that the purported agency or instrumentality is actually an agency or instrumentality.neither in the district court nor before this court have the parties addressed whether,to satisfy the tria definition of agency or instrumentality,plaintiffs must here show that defendants knew,or reasonably should have known,that they were functioning for,providing material services on behalf of,or being owned,controlled,or directed by the terrorist party here,iran.nor have they addressed whether an defense would be available to a terrorist agency or instrumentality.d providing for defense to civil forfeiture where claimant proves by preponderance of evidence that he i did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture or ii upon learning of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture,did all that reasonably could be expected under the circumstances to terminate such use of the property.we do not decide these questions here,leaving them for further consideration on remand.we note only that whether defendants satisfied any one of the identified aspects of agency or instrumentality is a disputed question of fact in this case.although the record demonstrates as a matter of law that bank melli owned and controlled assa even after,such that alavi was providing services to bank melli and,therefore,iran through the time of the filing of the civil forfeiture complaint,questions of fact persist as to whether alavi did so with knowledge.see in re fifth,at 
further,insofar as plaintiffs contend that alavi itself was sufficiently owned,controlled,or directed by iran to render it an agency or instrumentality of a terrorist party under the tria,questions of fact exist as to whether alavi was so owned,controlled,or directed at the time plaintiffs complaints were filed.see dole food,at.although there is record evidence that iran created alavi in,supervised its board in the and,and controlled its affairs to a certain extent around that same time,the only recent record evidence of iran control is a meeting between alavi board members,alavi farshid jahedi,and iran ambassador to the united nations,mohammad khazaee,at which plaintiffs contend khazaee instructed jahedi with respect to alavi management.a set of notes dated october,purportedly from that meeting,however,are too ambiguous to support a conclusion that iran controlled alavi at that time.see in re fifth,at explaining that authorship of notes is unknown and speaker referenced therein is unclear.moreover,in urging that iran does not control alavi,defendants highlight,among other things,the testimony of abbas mirakhor,an alavi board member from through,who maintained that alavi decisions were made by its board and president without interference by iran,see app x the declaration of hanieh safakamal,alavi financial manager since april,who stated that alavi managed its own assets and chose its own employees,see app x at and the declaration of ali aliabadi,alavi program coordinator since,who confirmed the lack of iran participation in alavi affairs,see app x.viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to defendants as we must on summary judgment review,see cortes,at,we conclude that questions of fact as to the extent of iran control over alavi at the relevant time require vacatur of the district court judgment in plaintiffs favor.this conclusion is not inconsistent with our determination that defendants are not the alter egos of iran,see supra at,because t he level of state control required to establish an alter ego relationship is more extensive than that required to establish agency,fid.guar.braspetro oil,wl,at quoting walter fuller aircraft sales,republic of the philippines,cir.
blocked assets 
to attach defendants properties under the tria,plaintiffs must also show that the defendants properties are blocked assets.see tria a.the tria defines blocked asset as any asset seized or frozen by the united states under section b of the trading with the enemy act twea app.b or under sections and of the ieepa.tria d a.both blocking regimes authorize the president to freeze the assets of foreign enemy states and their agencies and instrumentalities in order to put control of foreign assets in the hands of the president so that he may dispose of them in the manner that best furthers the united states and interests.bank markazi peterson,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants argue that their assets are not blocked as required for tria attachment because defendants have not been added to the sdn list and the united states does not have a possessory interest in their assets for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that all assets belonging to an entity that satisfies executive order definition of government of iran are automatically blocked,regardless of whether that entity is on the sdn or executive order list,but whether defendants satisfy that definition depends on the resolution of disputed questions of material fact.
first,the relevant executive order and implementing itrs undermine the argument that an entity assets qualify as blocked assets only if that entity is on the sdn list or executive order list.as discussed supra,in executive order,president obama ordered that,under the authority conferred on him by the ieepa,a ll property and interests in property of the government of iran,including the central bank of iran,that are in the united states are blocked and may not be transferred,paid,exported,withdrawn,or otherwise dealt in.exec.order emphasis added see implementing blocking order as set forth in the ofac regulation implementing executive order,t he property and interests in property of persons falling within the definition of the terms government of iran and iranian financial institution are blocked pursuant to this section regardless of whether the names of such persons are published in the federal register or incorporated into the list or the sdn list,note emphasis added id,note same see also dep t of treasury,ofac faqs iran sanctions,last visited july,stating that executive order blocks the property and interests in property of any individual or entity that comes within its definition of the term government of iran regardless of whether it is listed on the sdn list emphasis added id.explaining that executive order similarly blocks the property and interests in property of all iranian financial institutions as defined in the order regardless of whether the iranian financial institution is listed on the sdn list emphasis added.indeed,in removing various entities,including bank melli and assa,from the sdn list pursuant to the jcpoa,see supra at,the treasury department made clear that,even after implementation day,individuals and entities meeting the definition of the government of iran or an iranian financial institution,remain persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to executive order and.jcpoa guidance at.although certain entities,including bank melli,that satisfy the definition of government of iran have since been added to the executive order list,that list is not exhaustive,see,note,and persons continue to have an obligation to block the property and interests in property of all individuals and entities that meet the definition of the government of iran or an iranian financial institution,regardless of whether the individual or entity has been previously identified by ofac as meeting those definitions,jcpoa guidance at.
the supreme court recent decision in bank markazi peterson,supports the conclusion that executive order blocks the property of any entity falling within the ambit of that order,without regard to whether the property holder has been added to the sdn list or executive order list.in explaining that the central bank of iran properties are blocked assets under the tria,the court did not rely on the bank sdn status or its inclusion on the executive order list but,rather,explained that the president invoked his ieepa authority in executive order and block ed a ll property and interests in property of any iranian financial institution,including the central bank of iran,that are in the united states.at quoting exec.order see also id.at explaining that executive order blocked the assets and thereby opened the door to execution under the tria.bank markazi further explained that t o place beyond dispute the availability of some of the executive order assets for satisfaction of judgments,congress passed a separate statute.id.
given that executive order blocks all property of the government of iran,including the central bank of iran,the supreme court explanation also pertains to entities satisfying the definition of the government of iran.moreover,the court reference to executive order assets evinces its understanding of executive order as in and of itself blocking assets for purposes of the tria.see id the ninth circuit has similarly treated executive order as sufficient to block assets regardless of an entity sdn status or inclusion on the executive order list.see bennett islamic republic of iran,wl,at cir.june,stating that,in addition to bank melli assets being blocked as a result of october,sdn listing,those assets also are blocked pursuant to executive order blocking the property of iran and iranian financial institutions.accordingly,if defendants satisfy executive order definition of government of iran,their assets are automatically blocked pursuant to that order regardless of whether they are on the sdn list or executive order list.
nor are we persuaded by defendants argument that,even assuming executive order blocks all property belonging to the government of iran,that does not render that property blocked within the meaning of tria because it is not seized or frozen by the united states pursuant to the ieepa.in so arguing,defendants rely on smith federal reserve bank of new york,cir,in which we explained that,for purposes of the tria,t o seize or freeze assets transfers possessory interest in the property.id.at emphasis in original.
as an initial matter,we agree with defendants that the district court erred in concluding that defendants assets were seized or frozen within the meaning of the tria because the monitor and interim trustee,who has control over defendants properties,had obtained a possessory interest in those properties.in re fifth private action,wl,at.as relevant here,the plain text of the tria permits attachment of assets seized or frozen by the united states under sections and of the ieepa.tria d a.it does not reach those funds which the government has been given authorization to control through another means.united states holy land found.for relief,cir.any control the monitor has over defendants properties,therefore,is insufficient to render them blocked for purposes of the tria.
we nevertheless conclude that,pursuant to executive order,the united states has acquired a possessory interest in defendants properties.that order prohibits transferring or otherwise dealing in property within the united states that belongs to the government of iran as defined therein,and further authorizes the secretary of the treasury to promulgate necessary regulations to carry out those prohibitions,see exec.order,thus providing the government with sufficient control of such property to be recognized as a possessory interest,see black law dictionary ed.defining possessory interest as right to control property,including the right to exclude others,by a person who is not necessarily the owner.smith,at,supports this conclusion.in smith,we concluded that certain judgment creditors could not rely on the tria to attach previously blocked iraqi assets because they were no longer blocked assets due to president george bush march,confiscation order.see id.at.the iraqi assets at issue were froze n when president george bush issued executive order,which ordered that a ll property and interests in property of the government of iraq are hereby blocked,id.at quoting exec.order,fed.reg.the assets were then confiscated pursuant to president george bush march,confiscation order,which confiscated and vested in the department of the treasury a ll blocked funds held in the united states in accounts in the name of the government of iraq,exec.order,fed.reg.viewed in this context,smith statement that there was no dispute that the iraqi assets at issue were blocked funds within the meaning of tria a at the time the president issued the confiscation order,at,is properly understood to mean that,pursuant to executive order,the assets were blocked until a president ordered their confiscation,not that blocking was effected by the confiscation order.smith thus supports the conclusion that executive order,which uses blocking language similar to executive order,freezes all property belonging to the government of iran 
indeed,the absence of a confiscation order here helps,rather than hurts,plaintiffs attempt to attach defendants properties under the tria.in concluding in smith that tria reference to blocked assets did not include confiscated assets,we distinguished seizing or freezing assets which transfers possessory interest in the property with confiscating assets which transfers ownership of terrorist property by vesting right,title,and interest as the president deems appropriate.at emphasis in original discussing legislative history in which senator harkin stated that assets as to which the united states claims ownership are not included in the definition of blocked assets quoting cong.rec.daily ed,other internal quotation marks omitted.the ieepa permits confiscation only when the united states is engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked by a foreign country or foreign nationals,and the president determines that the foreign person,foreign organization,or foreign country whose property is being confiscated planned,authorized,aided,or engaged in such hostilities or attacks against the united states.a c.the confiscation order in smith followed the president determin ation that the united states and iraq are engaged in armed hostilities.exec.order,fed.reg.the lack of a confiscation order here signals only that the president has made no such determination with respect to iran not that the united states lacks a possessory interest in property belonging to the government of iran.
accordingly,because president obama specifically invoked his ieepa authority in issuing executive order,and that order seizes or freezes the property of any entity satisfying the definition of government of iran,regardless of whether that entity is included on the sdn list or executive order list,if defendants satisfy executive order definition of government of iran,their assets are blocked and,therefore,subject to attachment under tria.nevertheless,for the same reasons we concluded that disputed questions of material fact preclude determining as a matter of law whether defendants are agencies or instrumentalities under the tria,see supra at,we can not determine as a matter of law that defendants satisfy the definition of government of iran,that they are a political subdivision,agency,or instrumentality thereof,including any person owned or controlled by,or acting for or on behalf of,the government of iran,exec.order we therefore remand for further proceedings to resolve these factual disputes.
conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude as follows 
as to summary judgment ordering turnover of defendants property under the fsia,
a defendants do not qualify,as a matter of law,as the foreign state of iran such that defendants properties may be turned over to help satisfy plaintiffs judgments under the fsia,see a 
b defendants do not qualify,as a matter of law,as the agencies or instrumentalities of the foreign state of iran such that defendants properties may be turned over to help satisfy plaintiffs judgments under the fsia,see b 
c defendants do not quality as the alter egos of iran under bancec,at,such that defendants properties may be turned over to help satisfy plaintiffs judgments under the fsia.
as to summary judgment ordering turnover of defendants property under the tria,
a defendants do not qualify,as a matter of law,as iran in its capacity as a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under the tria,see tria a,d,but 
b i defendants status as agencies or instrumentalities of iran under the tria,see tria a supra and ii defendants properties status as blocked assets under that statute,see tria d a,is not foreclosed as a matter of law.however,we identify questions of fact that prevent either of these tria questions from being decided on summary judgment.
accordingly,the only issues returning to the district court for further proceedings are defendants status as agencies or instrumentalities under the tria,and whether their asserts are blocked under that statute.for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.
the district court also granted summary judgment and turnover as to defendants assa corporation and assa company limited assa limited,but those entities are not parties to this appeal.see app x.thus,in this opinion,the term defendants refers only to alavi foundation and fifth avenue company.because the assa defendants are not parties to this appeal,our decision today does not limit plaintiffs ability to attach assa assets,including assa corporation ownership of fifth avenue company.
for ease of reference only,we refer to all three iterations of the foundation as alavi throughout the remainder of this opinion.
prior to president obama issuance of executive order,president bush issued e
