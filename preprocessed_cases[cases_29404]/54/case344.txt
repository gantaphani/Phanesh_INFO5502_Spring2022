edwin iliff appeals an order vacating a renewed default judgment in favor of iliff as against paul dustrud paul,paul brother peter dustrud peter and other defendants not parties to this appeal and entering a new renewed default judgment against paul only.the superior court order was based in part on the ground the judgment as against defendants other than paul was not renewed within years of its entry in march,even though it had been amended and reentered in may,less than years from the date of iliff renewal application.on appeal,iliff contends the court erred by vacating the renewed default judgment upon peter untimely motion concluding the period for renewal code civ,subd.a had expired where the amended judgment superseded the original judgment and vacating the renewed judgment as against the other defendant judgment debtors who were not before the court and had not sought such relief.
appearing pro se,paul appeals the order and contends he was indigent and unable to defend himself in the original case the amount of interest and attorney fees specified in the renewed judgment is incorrect and the judgment is based on false testimony.
as to iliff,we conclude the relevant renewal statutes unambiguously state that the effective date of any judgment for purposes of enforceability and accrual of the renewal period is the date of entry and thus iliff renewal application was timely filed within years from the date of entry of the amended judgment.as to paul,we reject his substantive contentions for his failure to furnish an adequate record to this court.we therefore reverse the order and direct the trial court to deny the motion to vacate and to reinstate renewal of the may,amended judgment nunc pro tunc as of april.
factual and procedural background 
in december,iliff filed a complaint against paul,peter and other defendants for damages relating to their work on a construction project on iliff property in oceanside,california.in early march,the court held a default hearing,receiving into evidence certain declarations and considering iliff oral testimony in support of his request for a default judgment.on march,the court entered judgment in iliff favor against paul in the amount of on iliff first through sixth causes of action,with interest from june,through march.the court awarded iliff in punitive damages against paul on iliff fourth and sixth causes of action.the court also entered judgment against defendant d d drywall painting d d for plus prejudgment interest,as well as in punitive damages on iliff seventh cause of action.with respect to iliff eighth cause of action,the judgment provided that all defendants named in the judgment peter,paul,d d,gregory leon wilson,dan sejd and steven mccracken would be jointly and severally liable for the amount of plus prejudgment interest.the judgment concluded it is hereby further ordered,adjudged and decreed that plaintiff shall be entitled to an aggregate award against all defendants named in this judgment in the amount of,with interest thereon at the legal rate from june,through march,plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs,postjudgment interest and punitive damages as awarded.
on may,for reasons not apparent from the record,the court entered an amended judgment in iliff favor.that judgment was identical to the first,except it omitted the last paragraph and inserted the following three paragraphs 
it is hereby further ordered,adjudged and decreed that all defendants named in the judgment shall be jointly and severally liable to plaintiff in the aggregate amount of,with interest thereon at the legal rate from june,through march,in the sum of plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs in the sum of,for a total judgment award of,plus postjudgment interest.

on april,iliff applied for renewal of the amended judgment.shortly thereafter the superior court issued notices of renewal of the judgment against peter,paul,and the other defendants identified in the amended judgment.on may,iliff served the notices of renewal on paul,peter and the remaining defendants.
on july,peter moved under sections and,subdivision d to set aside the renewal of the judgment on the ground the default judgment was void for improper service by publication iliff opposed the motion.at some point,the court requested the parties brief whether iliff timely filed his application for renewal on april,which was more than years after entry of the original march judgment but within years of entry of the may amended judgment.after continuing the hearing and considering arguments on that question,the court ruled as to paul,who had filed for bankruptcy in january,iliff renewal application was timely because the period had been extended for days following termination of the automatic stay under federal bankruptcy law and as to peter and the other defendants identified in the judgment,the renewed judgment was unenforceable and would be vacated because iliff application was filed more than years after entry of the march,judgment.it rejected peter arguments as to improper service by publication,finding the service was proper and peter had notice of the proceedings before entry of any judgment.citing section,subdivision c,the court ordered entry of a different renewed judgment as against paul only.that judgment was filed on october,and entered nunc pro tunc as of april.both paul and iliff appeal.
discussion 
iliff appeala.timeliness of peter motion to set aside the renewal of judgment 
iliff first contends peter motion to set aside the default judgment was untimely under section because it was filed more than days after he served his notice of renewal.however,while iliff challenged the timeliness of peter motion under section,subdivision d,he never raised the time limit of section,subdivision b in the trial court.he has consequently waived the argument here on appeal.in re marriage of king th,d it is well established that issues or theories not properly raised or presented in the trial court may not be asserted on appeal,and will not be considered by an appellate tribunal.a party who fails to raise an issue in the trial court has therefore waived the right to do so on appeal.
calculation of renewal period 
iliff primary contention is that the period within which a judgment creditor must renew a judgment,subd.a,commenced upon entry of the amended judgment entered in may,not from entry of the original judgment entered in march,and that the court erred by concluding otherwise.based on the plain language of the renewal statutes,we agree the trial court erred in its order vacating renewal of the amended judgment.
the issue presented is one that we review de novo,since its resolution turns on interpreting the pertinent statutes and applying them to undisputed facts.burden snowden cal th,d,ranch north county of san diego th,d.when interpreting a statute,we look first to the language of the statute itself,and its plain meaning controls unless the words are ambiguous.white ultramar,cal th,d.o ur supreme court has noted if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute fidelity creditor service,browne th,d fidelity creditor.
