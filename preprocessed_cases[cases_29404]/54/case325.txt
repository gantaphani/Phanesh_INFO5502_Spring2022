the cadle company ii,cadle,appeals from the trial court order granting wayne fiscus motion to quash service of summons in its action to revive a money judgment against fiscus.the trial court concluded the independent action to enforce the judgment required fiscus have current contacts with the state of california and the original judgment did not suffice for minimum contacts.we disagree and reverse the order.
in,fiscus defaulted on a promissory note,executed in california in,held by union bank.union bank assigned the debt to the best service company best,and best filed suit.fiscus,who was then a resident of arizona,answered the complaint.on february,after best apparently successfully moved for summary judgment,a judgment was entered in san mateo county against fiscus in best favor for,representing the promissory note unpaid balance of,plus accrued interest,attorney fees,and costs hereafter the judgment.on june,best assigned the unsatisfied judgment to cadle.
on february,cadle filed an application with the clerk of the san mateo county superior court pursuant to code of civil procedure section for renewal of the judgment,and the clerk entered the renewal in a total amount of original judgment plus accrued interest.fiscus was served with notice of the renewed judgment and did not challenge the renewal.
on may,cadle filed the instant action,an independent complaint to enforce the judgment.fiscus filed a motion to quash service of summons on the grounds the court lacked personal jurisdiction.fiscus declared he has been a resident of arizona since,and does not own property,conduct business,or maintain a residence in california.
in its opposition,cadle did not dispute any of the facts asserted by fiscus concerning his lack of current contact with the state of california.rather,it asserted personal jurisdiction existed over fiscus by virtue of the judgment.cadle explained the state of arizona has a statute of limitations for enforcement of a sister state judgment.accordingly,even though the judgment was still enforceable in california,it could not be domesticated and enforced in arizona.cadle only recourse was to file an independent action based on the still enforceable judgment in california and obtain a new judgment that could then be domesticated and executed upon in arizona 
the trial court granted the motion to quash.it concluded that although the california court might have continuing jurisdiction to renew a judgment by the statutory procedure,via section,when an independent action to enforce a judgment is filed,there must be new and current basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
discussion 
cadle contends the trial court erred by granting fiscus motion to quash service of summons.it argues the california court may exercise personal jurisdiction over fiscus as concerns the enforcement of the judgment in a revival action.we agree.
general jurisdiction principals 
once a defendant moves to quash service of process for lack of jurisdiction,the plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.citation.when the evidence conflicts,we review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.citation.when the parties do not dispute the facts,we review the issue of jurisdiction de novo.citation.as you sow crawford laboratories,th,d as you sow.because there are no significant factual disputes,we review de novo the issue of whether personal jurisdiction exists.
under section,a california court may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the federal or state constitutions.a state may constitutionally exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant when the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts in the forum state.citation.additionally,the defendant contacts with the forum must make it reasonable for the person to anticipate being haled into court there citation so it does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citations.
a state has general jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant for all causes of action if the defendant activities within the state are extensive or or substantial continuous and systematic.citation.the issue of jurisdiction depends on the particular facts of each case and can not be decided by applying a mechanical test or a precise formula.citation.
less extensive activity may not support general jurisdiction,but may justify limited jurisdiction for the purposes of a particular cause of action depending upon the nature and quality of the acts,the degree of relation to the asserted cause of action,and the balance between the convenience of the parties and the interest of the state in asserting jurisdiction.citations.citation.in cases where jurisdiction is based on the defendant occasional activities the united states supreme court has said that it is essential that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.citations.as you sow,supra,th at,d see also boaz boyle th,d boaz.
cadle does not suggest the california court has general jurisdiction over fiscus.it is undisputed fiscus has been a resident of arizona since,and does not own property,conduct business,or maintain a residence in the state of california.rather,cadle contends the california court has limited,specific jurisdiction over this particular cause of action brought to enforce the judgment.we agree.it is undisputed the california court had personal jurisdiction over fiscus when the original judgment was made a general appearance and answered the complaint.
california authorities 
in the trial court and on appeal,fiscus contends that although the california court has continuing personal jurisdiction to renew the judgment pursuant to the statutory,and purely ministerial,renewal procedure set forth in section a position recently affirmed in goldman simpson th,d see,subd.b court jurisdiction continues throughout subsequent proceedings in the action,that jurisdiction does not extend to an independent action on the original judgment,which would result in an entirely new judgment against him.there must,fiscus contends and the trial court agreed,be minimum contacts at the time the new action was filed.we conclude the original litigation and the original judgment support minimum contacts and support exercising personal jurisdiction over fiscus.
in,the legislature enacted the enforcement of judgments law ejl.et prior to enactment of the ejl,the means for renewal of a judgment in california was by filing an independent action on the judgment within the statute of limitations.pratali gates th,d pratali.
in the ejl,the legislature adopted an alternative summary procedure for renewal of judgments.pratali,supra,th at,d see recommendation proposing the enforcement of judgments law cal.law revision com.under this procedure,a money judgment is enforceable for years from the date it is entered.to obtain a renewal of the judgment,the judgment creditor must file an application for renewal with the clerk of the court that entered the judgment before the expiration of the period of enforceability,subd.a see setting forth information to be included in application.upon the filing of the application,the court clerk shall enter the renewal of the judgment in the court records,subd.a.goldman,supra,th at,d.
but nothing in the ejl limits a judgment creditor right to pursue an independent action on the judgment.an independent action based on a judgment is an action based on contract.the original judgment becomes a debt which the judgment debtor is obligated to pay and the law implies a contract on his part to pay it.citation.citation.thus,when successful,an action on a judgment results in the entry of a new judgment.goldman,supra,th at,fn,d.
goldman,supra,th,d,held the court has continuing personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtor to renew the judgment via the statutory procedure.t he renewal procedure is properly treated as a subsequent proceeding under section.id.at,d.but neither goldman,nor any other published california decision w
