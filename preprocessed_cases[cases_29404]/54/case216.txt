this consolidated appeal involves the lloyd of london request for the court recognition and enforcement of money judgments issued by the high court of justice,queen bench division,london,england,in its favor against each of the defendants.lloyd obtained money judgments in england against each of the six new mexicans the new mexico names and the nine utahns the utah names collectively,the names in connection with underwriting obligations.lloyd then brought actions in the united states district court for the districts of new mexico and utah seeking recognition of these judgments as final and enforceable,entitled to full faith and credit in new mexico and utah,respectively.each federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of lloyd.of the utah names,one defendant reached a settlement with lloyd,leaving eight in this litigation.five of the six new mexico names reached settlements with lloyd.we have consolidated these cases for disposition on appeal.
on appeal,the new mexico name raises several arguments.first,he argues that the english judgment deprived him of due process under new mexico uniform foreign recognition act.second,the new mexico name maintains that the english judgment stemmed from an action that is repugnant to new mexico public policy as the judgment a violates new mexico securities laws b is based on unconscionable contracts c stems from adhesion contracts d comprises unlawful cognovit notes,e is based on illusory contacts and f violates the new mexico unfair practices act.
the utah names offer similar arguments.they contend that the district court can not enforce the english judgments under utah law,because the english system of jurisprudence is incompatible with american standards of due process,and that they did not receive an opportunity for a full and fair trial.the defendants also maintain that the english judgments conflict with utah public policy.one utah name questions whether diversity jurisdiction exists,and also challenges the enforcement of the english judgments as violative of utah securities laws.two utah names also contend that the district court approval of the english interest of eight percent per annum was incorrect.
we hold that the utah and new mexico names received due process under the english system of jurisprudence and that,in the days of hearing before english trial and appellate courts,they received an opportunity for a full and fair trial.as to the new mexico name,specifically,the english legal proceedings provided ample due process pursuant to new mexico uniform foreign recognition act.we also hold that the lloyd judgments are not repugnant to new mexico public policy.
as to the utah names,we hold that the english proceedings satisfied utah due process requirements and the english judgments do not conflict with utah public policy.we also affirm the district court denial of a motion for discovery and a motion to certify questions of law to the utah supreme court.we hold that the parties in this case are diverse,and that enforcement of the english judgments does not violate utah securities laws.finally,we reverse the district court determination that lloyd english judgments should accrue interest at the english interest rate.
background 
numerous courts have summarized the basic facts applicable to the underlying litigation,and these facts are not in dispute.see soc y of lloyd ashenden,cir haynsworth v.the,cir allen lloyd of london,cir soc y of lloyd webb,d.we shall summarize the pertinent facts here,borrowing heavily from the detailed and webb decision.
lloyd is not an insurer,but rather is the regulator of an insurance market located in london.through parliamentary acts,specifically the lloyd acts of,parliament created lloyd and authorized it to regulate the english insurance market.individual and corporate members of lloyd known as names underwrite insurance.the new mexico defendants and utah defendants became names in the lloyd market between the late and late.
the names underwrite insurance by forming groups known as syndicates.names are passive investors in the sophisticated scheme,but along with potential profits they may incur substantial personal and direct liability with respect to a portion of a syndicate risk in the lloyd market.the liability of each name is several rather than joint.as a condition of becoming members of lloyd,names enter into agreements governing their membership in lloyd and their underwriting in the lloyd market.at issue here is the general undertaking agreement,which obligated the new mexico and utah names,and all other names,to comply with the parliamentary acts under which lloyd was created and to submit any dispute arising out of their memberships or underwriting at lloyd to the english courts for resolution pursuant to english law.each name irrevocably agree d that the courts of england had exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of the underwriting of insurance business,and agreed that such p roceedings brought in the english courts were conclusive and binding upon any party and may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction.case,aplts app.vol.i,at general undertaking agreement.
by the early,which is about the time that lloyd solicited the utah and new mexico names,
lloyds knew that it had problems with rising asbestos and toxic tort claims.the syndicates reserves were inadequate to handle these rising claims and a committee known as the asbestos working party was formed to gather information about the breadth of the problem.the problem was described as the largest phenomenon that has ever hit the casualty insurance industry and the most significant legal and loss cost issue in the history of the industry.information about these claims was not published in the marketplace,was omitted from the audit instructions,and was not published in lloyds financial statements for the year.although a letter was prepared that provided the necessary disclosures to the names,it was merely placed in a file and never distributed to the intended names.simultaneously,lloyds was campaigning in parliament for passage of the lloyds act of which granted lloyds and its governing body extraordinary powers and immunity.in exchange,lloyds committed to providing better quality information to prospective names.this promise was not fulfilled and lloyds admitted to parliament that it had not kept its promise.the council of lloyds very much regrets that the undertaking to implement the recommendations within years of the royal assent has not been kept.
webb,d at emphasis supplied internal citations omitted.
according to former name and lead plaintiff in the fraud action against lloyd,sir peter jaffray,t he only way they could keep going was to suppress the asbestos information,cook the books to ensure they were still showing profits and go after new investors.case,aplts app.vol.i,at combined mem.in opp.to summ.judgment and in support of motion in alt.for discovery under rule c,ex.at lloyd of london,time.further,
d uring the five years that lloyds failed to improve information disseminated to prospective names,approximately new names had joined lloyds,most of whom were investors.
webb,d at.the new mexico and utah names contend that the lloyd representative emphasized lloyd long history of profitability,its exclusive and selective members,its program of annual audits,and that the risk of unlimited liability had been of little consequence in lloyd history.see case,aplts app.vol.i,at mem.in opp.to summ.judgment,exs.affids.from utah names.
for the years of account through,lloyds suffered losses in excess of billion these were reported in.once the names inquiries into the cause for the losses began,they concluded that lloyds had been guilty of serious negligence fraud 
the names eventually filed suits in numerous cities across the united states claiming fraud against lloyds in connection with their recruitment as investors,their placement on syndicates and their continuing to underwrite at lloyds.in each of the cases lloyds moved to dismiss based on a forum selection the forum being in england and choice of law the law being english clauses contained in the general undertaking,a contract that the names had signed.in each of the cases filed,the courts of appeals enforced the forum selection and choice of law clauses.
webb,d at internal citations omitted.
apparently,the new mexico name and several utah names were parties to one of these suits,richards lloyd of london,cir.the richards complaint indicates that all but utah names stephen and kelly harmsen and were plaintiffs.see case,aple.vol.i,doc.at.
the richards litigation addressed and rejected the names contention that their disputes with lloyd should be litigated in the united states despite contract clauses binding the parties to proceed in england under english law.richards,at.the ninth circuit held that to invalidate the choice of law provisions in the lloyd general undertaking agreement would result in an unbounded reach of the united states securities laws,and would hamper international commerce.id.at.moreover,the court stated that t he names have recourse against lloyd for fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,or negligent misrepresentation.id.at 
we reached a similar conclusion in riley kingsley underwriting agencies,cir.we rejected the plaintiff name contentions and held that 
english law does not preclude the name from pursuing an action for fraud and we agree with the defendants that the lloyd act does not grant statutory immunity for such claims.we have been shown nothing to suggest that an english court would not be fair,and in fact,our courts have long recognized that the courts of england are fair and neutral forums.
id.internal citations omitted.as such,trial proceeded in england.following trial,
the english courts found lloyds guilty of negligence with respect to their names and awarded the names damages totaling billion.pursuant to the lloyds act of,however,the lloyds council enacted a that caused the funds awarded to the names to be frozen.the lloyds council placed lloyds as trustee of the trust funds.the appellate court of england upheld lloyds right to freeze the funds and appoint lloyds as trustee under the lloyds act of.
because the losses were widely spread throughout the various syndicates,lloyds developed a reorganization program in called reconstruction and renewal r r.this was a mandatory plan of reinsurance of all years of account prior to into one reinsurance company called equitas reinsurance.the available syndicate assets were billion yet the premium needed for the reinsurance by december,was billion 
webb,d at internal citations omitted.
in implementing the reorganization plan,lloyd required each name to become a party to the equitas reinsurance contract through an appointed,substituted agent,who signed the contract on behalf of the name.the equitas contract contained a pay now,sue later clause that precluded names from asserting claims they might have against lloyd or others as a or counterclaim to their equitas premium.the equitas contract also contained a conclusive evidence clause,which provided that,in the absence of manifest error,lloyd determination of a name equitas premium was conclusive 
the equitas premium was mandatory and each name was required to pay equitas the amount shown on his statement.if,however,the name signed the settlement agreement included in the r r package,the name would be awarded a credit,which would result in a reduction in the amount he paid in.
the new mexico and utah names were names who neither signed the settlement agreement nor paid the assessment.when they did not pay,lloyd used its powers from the lloyd act of to appoint a substitute agent.this substitute agent was instructed to sign the equitas contract on behalf of the names who refused to sign the equitas settlement.next,lloyd began suing these names.lloyd paid equitas the premium allegedly owed by the names and received an assignment for the premium in exchange.in late,lloyd then sued the new mexico and utah names and all remaining names for the amounts paid on their behalf.
lloyd served a writ of summons on each of the new mexico and utah names,notifying them of the commencement of the english action against them.each of the names filed an acknowledgment of service of writ of summons through their solicitors of record.through the filing of the acknowledgment,each name appeared in the english court and notified lloyd of his or her intent to contest the claim.although other names actively defended in the english litigation,the new mexico and utah names did not submit a notice of intention to defend,nor did they contest lloyd claims.
those names who did defend presented common objections and defenses.they alleged that lloyd lacked the regulatory authority to pursue certain aspects of the reorganization program,that they were entitled to rescind based on fraud in the inducement of their underwriting at lloyd,that they were entitled to litigate these claims of fraud,and that they were not bound by the equitas reinsurance contract pay now,sue later and conclusive evidence clauses.the english court found in favor of lloyd and entered judgment against each of the defendants.see webb,d at citing english cases.
specifically,the court found that the pay now,sue later clause was enforceable and the names could not assert a fraud claim as a to the equitas premium due.at the trial level,several hearings were held regarding the premium amounts and the trial court concluded that lloyd produced sufficient documents justifying the premiums it claimed.subsequently,each name had the opportunity to present evidence that the calculation of the premium was manifest error pursuant to the equitas contract.the court ruled against the names with respect to the manifest error claims.see webb,d at.
the english court did find,however,that lloyd could be sued for fraud damages and that the names were free to pursue separate fraud claims against lloyd.approximately names brought a fraud case in england against lloyd titled jaffray v.the society of lloyds.the honorable justice cresswell of the high court of justice of england and wales issued a decision in the jaffray litigation in november dismissing sample names claims for deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation after a trial spanning nineteen weeks.see wl,aff.civ.div.july.
in october,while the jaffray case was pending,the court issued an order requiring any names wishing to bring a fraud claim against lloyd to join the jaffray action.lloyd sent a copy of a statement regarding the terms of the order to every name who had not accepted lloyd reconstruction and renewal settlement offer,including each of the new mexico and utah names.see case,vol.v,doc.at.neither the utah names nor the new mexico name gave notice that they reserved the right to advance such allegations or otherwise become parties to the jaffray litigation.
the english judgments against the names were affirmed on appeal.all appeals from the entry of the english judgments have been exhausted.following these rulings,the english court entered individual judgments in favor of lloyd against each of the new mexico and utah names on march,lloyd filed this action to collect on the judgments.
ii.discussion 
the names raise two overarching arguments regarding the errors of the new mexico and utah district courts the courts erred when they determined that the english proceedings provided due process to the names and the courts erred when they found that the english cause of action did not violate the public policy of either new mexico or utah.they also challenge the district courts denial of other motions,and two utah names challenge the calculation of interest.
at the outset,we note that the names two principal arguments have been raised unsuccessfully in various federal and state courts,by defendants from several states although we affirm the grant of summary judgment to lloyd for largely the same reasons as our sister circuits,our analyses of the defenses brought by the new mexico and utah names are slightly different because of the defenses the names assert.furthermore,utah,unlike the states whose law was applied by each court that has addressed the issue,has not adopted the uniform foreign recognition act.although the decisions of the other courts are highly persuasive,we must detour slightly as we apply utah comity analysis to the assertions of the utah names.although we empathize with the losses that the new mexico name and utah names have incurred,and we appreciate the sincerity of their arguments,and we find many of lloyd acts to be distinctly distasteful,the agreements the names signed and the applicable law require that we must affirm the thorough and orders of the district courts,with one slight exception.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the standard applied by the district court pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.qwest city of santa fe,new mexico,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the party.id.quoting.c.
new mexico law 
the new mexico name contends that the district court erred when it failed to consider the procedures the english courts actually employed,and instead relied on the general proposition that the english courts are fair and neutral.the new mexico name also asserts that the enforcement of the english judgments violates new mexico public policy.applying new mexico law,we hold that the district court appropriately assessed the english judicial system and no violation of due process or new mexico public policy occurred.
due process concerns were met.
the new mexico name claims the district court failed to appreciate how its enforcement of the english judgment deprived him of his due process rights.while the full faith and credit clause applies to the recognition and enforcement of judgments among sister states,it does not apply to judgments rendered in foreign countries.allstate ins.hague,d stevens,concurring in the judgment the full faith and credit clause,of course,was inapplicable because the law of a foreign nation,rather than of a sister state,was at issue.the parties cite no federal statute applicable to the enforcement of foreign court money judgments in courts,nor any applicable treaty.instead,the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are governed by state law.see seetransport wiking trader schiffarhtsgesellschaft mbh,kommanditgesellschaft navimpex centrala navala,cir we note that the recognition of foreign judgments is governed by state law.see restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states cmt.a.
new mexico has adopted the uniform foreign recognition act.see stat.ann.to.pursuant to the act,a foreign judgment is not conclusive if 
the judgment was rendered under a system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law 
and it need not be recognized if 
the defendant in the proceedings in the foreign court did not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend 
the judgment was obtained by fraud 
the cause of action on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of this state 
stat.ann.emphasis supplied.
the new mexico name contends that the new mexico district court conflated the widely recognized general fairness of the english system,with this particular judgment,which,in his view,conflicts with his constitutional due process rights.specifically,the new mexico name objects to the english courts enforcement of the,clause,which prohibited him from raising certain defenses and counterclaims during the english action the conclusive evidence clause,because it renders the amount of the assessment determined by lloyd conclusive absent manifest error,and thereby fails to meet due process requirements and the fact that the cumulative effect of both these clauses is that the new mexico name could not receive a hearing,could not obtain discovery as to the amount of lloyd claim,and could not challenge lloyd calculation of the amount due.
as to whether the contested clauses,taken separately or together,amounted to a forfeit of the name due process rights,t he question is not whether lloyd accorded due process to the names,but whether the english courts did stated differently,the courts held that the names had waived their procedural rights in advance ashenden,at emphasis supplied.waiver of procedural rights in advance is clearly permitted,see,overmyer frick,d the due process rights to notice and hearing prior to a civil judgment are subject to waiver.moreover,given the new mexico name utter failure to participate in any stage of any of the english proceedings,we not only look with skepticism,but we flatly reject the due process complaint of a party who was given,and waived,the opportunity of making the adequate presentation in the english court.turner,at quoting british midland airways int l travel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
although the new mexico name would prefer to have us focus on this particular judgment,rather than the english system,at this stage of these matters,we are not permitted to do so.see stat.ann.indicating that to determine conclusive ness of a foreign judgment,a court examines the foreign country system and whether it maintains procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law.the procedures the english courts afford need not be identical to ours,they must only be compatible in that they do not offend the notion of basic fairness.see turner,at the courts of england are fair and neutral forums footnoted citation omitted hilton guyot.w e are not prepared to hold that the fact that the foreign procedure differed from that of our own courts is,of itself,a sufficient ground for impeaching the foreign judgment.uniform judgments recognition act cmt.a mere difference in the procedural system is not a sufficient basis for.a case of serious injustice must be involved.restatement third of foreign relations cmt.b a court asked to recognize or enforce the judgment of a foreign court must satisfy itself of the essential fairness of the judicial system under which the judgment was rendered.
and when we look to the basic fairness of the system,the answer is clear o ur courts have long recognized that the courts of england are fair and neutral forums.riley,at collecting cases see also haynsworth,at this is particularly so in the case of england,a forum that american courts repeatedly have recognized to be fair and impartial.the seventh circuit similarly lauded the english system regard for due process in its highly persuasive opinion involving nearly identical claims 
any suggestion that the english system of courts does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law borders on the risible.t he courts of england are fair and neutral forums.the origins of our concept of due process of law are english and the english courts are highly regarded for impartiality,professionalism,and scrupulous regard for procedural rights.
ashenden,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
we agree with the seventh circuit reasoning and hold that given the structure of the english system,which is substantially similar to our own,the new mexico name suggestion that the english court system does not provide tribunals compatible with due process is untenable.see also webb,at.
new mexico public policies were not violated.
the new mexico name also challenges the enforcement of the english judgments as a violation of new mexico public policy.first,he argues that lloyd violated the new mexico securities act through its solicitation of unregistered securities and by making fraudulent representations.second,he asserts that the equitas contract is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.third,the new mexico name contends that the equitas contract amounts to a contract of adhesion.fourth,he asserts the equitas contract is a cognovit note,which both violates new mexico public policy and new mexico law.fifth,he maintains that the equitas contract is illusory.finally,he contends the new mexico unfair practices act bars recognition of the equitas contract.
even if we assume the shaky premises of these assertions to be true that lloyd made material misrepresentations and those misrepresentations would allow rescission under new mexico law,we reject each of these claims for one overriding reason english law as applied here does not violate new mexico public policy.as we iterate throughout the opinion,t he view that every foreign forum remedies must duplicate those available under american law would render all forum selection clauses worthless haynsworth,at see also riley,at.
furthermore,we reiterate that we must focus on the cause of action and the claim for relief underlying the english judgment,not the differences in the bodies of law,because slight differences between england and new mexico laws do not trigger the public policy exception.stat.ann b see turner,at.neither a breach of contract action nor a claim for money damages is repugnant to new mexico public policy.
a.the state agreement trumps the new mexico securities act.
the new mexico name emphasizes that the new mexico securities act embodies a public policy to protect new mexico,and new mexicans,and that the contract on which lloyd sued violated the state securities act.he relies heavily upon the declaration of michael vargon,deputy director of the securities division in the new mexico department of regulation and licensing.in an affidavit,vargon states that after receiving various complaints from new mexicans regarding lloyd solicitations to become names,the division concluded that the interest in the names program was an investment contract and therefore a security,subject to the new mexico securities act.lloyd failed to register these securities,and furthermore,the information available to the division strongly suggest ed fraud and misrepresentation in the inducement and continuing misrepresentation made to names case,aplts app.vol.i,at.
in response,lloyd points to the july state agreement between lloyd and participating state securities regulators,including the acting director of the new mexico securities division.the state agreement recognizes that certain state securities regulators have asserted the activities of lloyd fall within the scope of their regulatory jurisdiction and that the activities of lloyd may have violated laws subject to their enforcement authority.id.vol.ii,at.the state agreement also indicates that lloyd denies it has violated any laws and denies it is subject to the jurisdiction of the states securities regulators with regard to the issues raised.id.
the state agreement appears to have been a necessary precursor to the enactment of the reconstruction and renewal plan.under the state agreement,lloyd promised to allocate credits to qualified state names,in exchange for which the state securities regulators agreed to take steps necessary to terminate all proceedings and investigations pending against lloyd.in addition,the state securities regulators agreed not to assist any private person or entity who seeks to pursue any action against lloyd id.vol.ii,at.because the acting director of the new mexico securities division is a signatory to the state agreement,and vargon declaration conflicts with the state agreement,we reject the new mexico name assertions based upon it.furthermore,the new mexico name offers no explanation for this anomaly.
moreover,as explained above,the new mexico name agreed in the general undertaking agreement that english law,not new mexico law,would govern any disputes between lloyd and him.the choice of law and choice of forum clause are not at issue in this litigation,and to enforce the new mexico securities laws in this context would be inappropriate.see riley,at approving forum selection clause of general undertaking agreement richards,at holding the same as to the majority of the defendant names in this case.
b.the english judgments were not based on an unconscionable contract.
next,the new mexico name invites us to examine the underlying contractual dispute through his contention that the equitas contract is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable under new mexico law.procedural unconscionability is determined by examining the circumstances surrounding the contract formation,including the particular party ability to understand the terms of the contact and the relative bargaining power of the parties.guthmann lavida llena.factors to be considered include the use of sharp practices or high pressure tactics and the relative education,sophistication or wealth of the parties,as well as the relative scarcity of the subject matter of the contract.id.
the new mexico name is a highly sophisticated investor who had to pass a means test and was required to post large sums of money as security for the unlimited liability that he knowingly undertook.unquestionably lloyd presented no high pressure tactics each name was afforded the opportunity to read the general undertaking agreement in its entirety,and to fully understand the implications of its terms.see id.at.the equitas contract was not a new investment decision it was the implementation of specific provisions to address the unlimited liability undertaken by all names,pursuant to the general undertaking agreement broad powers.there is no basis for concluding that there was any procedural unconscionability in the contracts on which the judgments were based.
the new mexico name arguments regarding substantive unconscionability are equally unavailing.substantive unconscionability is concerned with contract terms that are illegal,contrary to public policy,or grossly unfair.id.at.when terms are unreasonably favorable to one party a contract may be held to be substantively unconscionable.id.at.the terms are to be considered in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,despite the apparently massive losses lloyd was absorbing,the terms of the general undertaking agreement were not so grossly unfair to the names when the agreement was formed.approximately percent of the names accepted the subsequent equitas contract,and states signed the state agreement to facilitate the reconstruction and renewal plan.under these circumstances,we can not say these were terms that no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand,and no honest and fair man would accept on the other.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
c.the english judgments were not based on an adhesion contract.
the new mexico supreme court guthmann holding also undergirds our rejection of the new mexico name contention that the equitas contract is an adhesion contract that violates new mexico public policy.
three elements must be satisfied before an adhesion contract may be found.first,the agreement must occur in the form of a standardized contract prepared or adopted by one party for the acceptance of the other.second,the party proffering the standardized contract must enjoy a superior bargaining position because the weaker party virtually can not avoid doing business under the particular contract terms.finally,the contract must be offered to the weaker party on a basis,without opportunity for bargaining.
id.at internal citations omitted.here,the second and third elements are not met the new mexico name was not in a weaker bargaining position nor did lloyd compel his investment.
d.the english judgments were not based on a cognovit note.
next,the new mexico name contends that the general undertaking agreement and equitas contract amount to a cognovit note,which is an ancient legal device signed by a defendant in an action actually commenced confessing the plaintiff demand to be just,and empowering the plaintiff to sign judgment against him in default of his paying the plaintiff the sum due to him within the time mentioned in the cognovit.black law dictionary ed see overmyer,at.thus the debtor agrees in advance to the entry of a judgment against him without notice or hearing.new mexico public policy and new mexico law prohibit cognovits and condemn judgments obtained through cognovits,enforcing them only where a defendant voluntarily,knowingly and intelligently waives his or her rights.as established above,the new mexico name did voluntarily,knowingly and intelligently waive his rights,in addition to receiving notice and being provided an opportunity to defend prior to the entry of the judgments.we have rejected the perceived lack of due process argument above,and consequently,this argument is foreclosed.
e.the english judgments were not based on illusory contracts.
next,the new mexico name maintains that lloyd judgments are repugnant to new mexico public policy because they are based on illusory contracts.specifically,he contends that the general undertaking agreement and the equitas contract lack consideration.the general undertaking agreement was part of the overall investment agreement between the names and lloyd.the agreement certainly placed obligations upon lloyd when underwriting or investment profits were made,lloyd had to distribute to each name his or her proper share.likewise,the equitas contract was supported by consideration this reinsurance contract helped lloyd survive and protected the names from unlimited personal liability.the complaints about how lloyd may have met,or failed to meet,its obligations are another matter,which have also been considered by the english courts and in the jaffray litigation.
f.the new mexico unfair practices act does not apply.
finally,the new mexico name contends that the enforcement of the english judgment violates new mexico public policy because the contracts violated the new mexico unfair practice act,stat.ann.et.the unfair practice act defines an unconscionable trade practice as any act or practice in connection with the sale for offering for sale of any goods or services that takes advantage of the lack of knowledge,ability,experience,or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree or results in a gross disparity between the value received by a person and the price paid.see id.e.neither party addresses whether the new mexico unfair practice act encompasses an action involving the interests of the new mexico name in underwriting insurance.see,russell dean witter reynolds,connecticut unfair trade practice act does not apply to deceptive practices in the purchase and sale of securities because connecticut has long separated regulation of the purchase and sale of securities from the regulation of unfair trade practices in other industries.simpson grimes,so d,although the plaintiffs allege unfair trade practices pursuant to the louisiana unfair trade practices act,this type of action under the unfair trade practices act has been found inapplicable to cases involving securities.
to the extent the new mexico name asserts that lloyd took unreasonable advantage of him through its misrepresentation regarding asbestos claims,the english courts have considered and rejected such claims.as above,we can not allow the new mexico name to relitigate the underlying cause of action under new mexico law,despite his attempt to frame the action as violating new mexico public policy.
turning to the defenses of the utah names,we hold that these defenses fail for similar reasons.the utah names first assert that the district court improperly analyzed utah principles of comity when it determined that the process underlying the english judgments comported with constitutional norms of due process and of utah public policy.specifically,the utah names contend they did not have a full and fair trial in england,because they were bound by unlawful contracts,prohibited from asserting affirmative defenses,and prohibited from discovering or presenting evidence to refute the existence of the amount of liability.utah names stephen and kelly harmsen raise the related argument that lloyd made material misrepresentations when it induced them to become names in the lloyd market by failing to disclose information about potential asbestos and toxic tort liability.as a result,neither the forum selection clause nor the,clause should be held enforceable as matters of public policy.
the utah names also argue that they were entitled to discovery,and that the district court should have certified certain questions of law to the utah supreme court.utah name wallace bennett contends that the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction,and that the enforcement of the judgment violates utah securities laws.finally,utah names stephen and kelly harmsen also challenge the district court imposition of eight percent per annum interest.with the exception of the interest argument,we reject each of the utah names contentions.
principles of comity apply in this case.
unlike new mexico,utah has not adopted the uniform judgment recognition act.the utah supreme court has indicated that a foreign country judgment can be enforced in utah courts under principles of comity.mori mori,utah citing hilton.under the supreme court holding in hilton,the principles of comity require recognition of a foreign judgment if 
there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction,
conducting the trial upon regular proceedings,after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant,
under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those of other countries,
there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court,or in the system of laws under which it was sitting,or fraud in procuring the judgment,or 
no other special reason exists indicating why the comity of this nation should not allow it full effect.
hilton,at.emphasis added.
according to the utah names,and in seeming contrast to hilton,utah comity requires an analysis of the fairness of the english judgment,not merely of the english judicial system.the judgment here was based upon the utah names signing the general undertaking,which is a standardized contract between lloyd and the individual names.according to the utah names,their assent to the general undertaking resulted in their unknowing waiver of future due process rights in the equitas contract.
utah law provides that questions regarding the validity of a foreign judgment should be tested by the law of the jurisdiction where the judgment was rendered.rocky mtn.claim staking frandsen,utah.we have no choice under hilton and rocky mountain but to examine the entirety of the foreign judicial system,and not the particularity of individual judgments.see also restatement third of foreign relations cmt.b a court asked to recognize or enforce the judgment of a foreign court must satisfy itself of the essential fairness of the judicial system under which the judgment was rendered.like all the other circuits that have examined the question,we have already determined that the english judicial system is procedurally above reproach.see,ashenden,at even if the defendants approach is we want to emphasize our belief that it is can not possibly avail the defendants here unless they are right that the approach requires subjecting the foreign proceeding to the specifics of the american doctrine of due process.see also hilton,at.w e are not prepared to hold that the fact that the foreign procedure differed from that of our own courts is,of itself,a sufficient ground for impeaching the foreign judgment.
here,for the sake of completeness,the district court looked to the underlying decisions rendered by the english courts that have considered and rejected each of the utah names challenges to the,and conclusive evidence clauses.case,aple.at utah dist.order filed.the,provision left the names free to pursue claims of fraud against lloyd in a separate proceeding,which many names pursued unsuccessfully in the jaffray litigation.see id.citing soc y of lloyd wilkinson others,at,aff,soc y of lloyd lyon,leighs wilkinson july case,aple.vol.iii,doc,ex.j,at.
the district court observed that the english courts held that the conclusive evidence clause was not an unusual type of clause and was in principle appropriate to the contract.case,aple.at quoting soc y of lloyd fraser others,at july case,aple.vol.iii,doc,ex.j,at.furthermore,the english courts considered and rejected the argument that the names should not be bound by the equitas contract.case,aple.at citing soc y of lloyd fitzgerald,leigh and others,aff,soc y of lloyd lyon,leighs wilkinson july case,aple supp,app.vol.iii,doc,ex.j,at.
we must reject the utah names contentions that they were bound by unlawful contracts,that they were prohibited from asserting affirmative defenses,and that they were prohibited from discovering or presenting evidence to refute the existence of amount or liability.we therefore agree with the district court that the utah names were given a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims before the english courts.
similarly,we must reject the defenses mounted by the harmsens.the english court considered and rejected the allegations involving material misrepresentations made by lloyd in connection with the solicitation of investment by potential names.
the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied discovery.
the utah names sought discovery regarding information about the basis for the amount of the alleged liability set forth in the english judgments information relating to lloyd appointment of the substitute agent and other details regarding the formation of the equitas contract and information concerning lloyd contractual intent in entering into the general undertaking agreement.
discovery rulings are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court,and we review only for abuse of discretion.gwn petroleum oil gas,cir.the discovery sought by the utah names was unnecessary to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of lloyd.to have granted the discovery would have resulted in a relitigation of the underlying general undertaking agreement and equitas contract,both of which have been considered and litigated before the english courts.after reviewing the record,we find no abuse of discretion regarding the rulings on these motions.
certification of questions of state law 
the utah names suggest that the district court erred when it refused to certify certain questions to the utah supreme court and we should sua sponte certify the questions of whether the english court met the open courts provision of the utah constitution.we reject each contention and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion.
district court denial of the motion was not an abuse of discretion.
we review the district court decision not to certify questions of state law for abuse of discretion.armijo ex cam,cir.utah open courts provision requires 
all courts shall be open,and every person,for an injury done to him in his person,property or reputation,shall have remedy by due course of law,which shall be administered without denial or unnecessary delay and no person shall be barred from prosecuting or defending before any tribunal in this state,by himself or counsel,any civil cause to which he is a party.
utah const.art.i.
in general,open courts provisions in utah serve two principal purposes first,they were intended to help establish an independent foundation for the judiciary as an institution second,open courts or remedies clauses were intended to grant individuals rights to a judicial remedy laney fairview city,utah.the names attempt to invoke the open courts provisions in connection with their alleged waiver of their at the due process rights.
while certification is appropriate where the legal question at issue is novel and the applicable state law is unsettled,allstate ins.brown,cir,it is never compelled.see lehman schein,d.u nder the diversity statutes the federal courts have the duty to decide questions of state law even if difficult or uncertain.copier smith wesson,cir citing meredith winter haven.there is little caselaw suggesting that english law or any foreign law somehow abrogates the utah constitution.we have established there is no due process violation and that the names waived their procedural rights in advance.see overmyer,at.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected the utah names motion to certify.
sua sponte certification is unnecessary here.
we next consider whether we should certify this question to the utah supreme court directly.utah rule of appellate procedure a states 
the utah supreme court may answer a question of utah law certified to it by a court of the united states when requested to do so by such certifying court acting in accordance with the provisions of this rule if the state of the law of utah applicable to a proceeding before the certifying court is uncertain.
thus,there is a procedural mechanism for certification to the state court that we may consider using.however,we note that a necessary but not controlling component is the difficulty in determining the local law.lehman,at.t he mere difficulty in ascertaining local law is no excuse for remitting the parties to a state tribunal for the start of another lawsuit.lehman brothers further noted that w e do not suggest that where there is doubt as to local law and where the certification procedure is available,resort to it is obligatory.id.at.
while no utah court has rendered a decision on the precise issue in question,our analysis above establishes that there is no unusual difficulty in deciding the state law question or a likelihood that lloyd theory of liability would be adopted by the utah courts.thus,given the above conclusions,certification is unnecessary.
outstanding issues presented by utah name bennett 
bennett maintains there is not complete diversity between the parties,and he challenges the district court enforcement of the english judgments as a violation of utah securities law.he also raises defenses we have previously rejected.we address each defense briefly.
diversity jurisdiction is present.
bennett contends that lloyd is not a corporation,but is rather more like an association,which adopts the citizenship of each of its syndicate investment members.lloyd and equitas are merely agents for the syndicates,collecting cash calls from syndicate investor names to pay off the liabilities arising from syndicate insurance policies.bennett br.at.under this interpretation,lloyd attempt to claim federal diversity jurisdiction is a sham and there is no federal subject matter jurisdiction.id.
we must reject bennett assertions.early on,lloyd may have been a form of an unincorporated association,but under the lloyd act of,the company was incorporated.although we agree that lloyd is not a corporation within the traditional sense of the word,see ashenden lloyd of london,there is no challenge to or question regarding lloyd place of incorporation it is duly incorporated under the laws of england.similarly it maintains its principal place of business in london,england.these facts are unchallenged,and comprise the weightiest part of our inquiry.see id.noting that the most important consideration is supreme court precedent indicating that the citizenship of business entities must be determined by the simple fact of legal incorporation or the lack thereof,rather than the nature or attributes of the entity in question.we thus hold that the jurisdiction is proper pursuant to a.equitas reinsurance,limited the assignor of lloyd underlying claims against the names is also a duly incorporated english company formed under the laws of england,and bennett similar allegations against equitas must also fail.
b.the utah securities act offers bennett no relief.
bennett points to the utah securities acts provision as a bar to the enforcement of the english judgments.the provision declares that a condition,stipulation or provision binding a person acquiring a security to waive compliance with the chapter or rule hereunder is void.utah code ann.
we note that the provisions of the securities acts of and are substantially the same as those found in the utah statute.see any condition,stipulation,or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of this subchapter or of the rules and regulations of the commission shall be void.a any condition,stipulation,or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder,or of any rule of an exchange required thereby shall be void.
the district court determined that our holding in riley
