at issue in this case is whether plaintiff country eggs,can collect a judgment owed by the california egg commission the commission from defendants state of california and the california department of food and agriculture referred to collectively as defendants or the state.we hold that,since the state did not receive the funds that were the basis for plaintiff judgment against the commission and,as to the state,plaintiff claim is for money damages and not for specific monetary relief,that claim is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.
food and agricultural code section,subdivision a provides the state shall not be liable for the acts of the c ommission or its contracts.payments of all claims arising by reason of the acts of the c ommission are limited to the funds collected by the c ommission.unspecified statutory references that follow are to the food and agricultural code.
the trial court upheld the constitutionality of this statute,ruled that defendants had no liability for the judgment against the commission,and granted defendants motion for summary judgment.plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment.we affirm the judgment.
facts and proceedings 
the following is an abbreviated version of the long and convoluted history of this case.
plaintiff is an egg handler who paid mandated assessments to the commission for the commission educational and promotional work.in february,plaintiff filed a complaint in federal district court against the commission,asserting this assessment scheme violated its constitutional rights of free speech and free association.
in july,the parties stipulated to the terms of a preliminary injunction that required the commission to deposit the bulk of plaintiff assessments into an escrow account.three months later,in october,the district court granted the commission motion for judgment on two of plaintiff causes of action,but gave plaintiff leave to amend its complaint.the court also vacated the preliminary injunction.
a few weeks later,in november,plaintiff filed its amended complaint reiterating its claims that the assessments violated its constitutional rights.this complaint also included a request for a preliminary injunction to preclude assessments or escrow their payment,but the record does not indicate that plaintiff pursued this request.
the commission responded by filing a counterclaim,contending plaintiff was delinquent in paying its assessments.in november,the district court granted the commission request for a preliminary injunction and ordered plaintiff to pay the assessments.
given the state of the law on the constitutionality of these types of assessments,plaintiff did not believe it would prevail at trial,and it decided not to incur additional legal fees to pursue the matter.the parties entered into a stipulated order for judgment and dismissal whereby plaintiff agreed to continue paying its assessments under the negotiated terms of the injunction.the court entered this judgment on june,and the litigation in federal court effectively came to an end.
less than one year later,in march,plaintiff filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief in state court,naming the commission and the secretary of the department of food and agriculture the department as defendants.plaintiff contended the assessment scheme violated its state constitutional rights to free speech and free association.it also asserted the assessments exceeded the state police powers and thereby violated due process guarantees as well.plaintiff complaint again included a request for a preliminary injunction to escrow its assessments.however,the record does not reflect or suggest that plaintiff pursued this request while the matter was pending in the trial court,even after the department suggested that the court might take such a measure.
the court granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment.in its judgment entered on may,the court concluded the assessment system violated plaintiff constitutional rights,and it enjoined the commission from collecting these assessments.it also ruled that plaintiff was entitled to a refund of any and all assessments,penalties,and interest that plaintiff paid to the commission from and including june,through the time this judgment is entered the judgment further provided that if the parties could not agree on the amount of refund owing,the matter could be set for hearing upon the motion of either party.
both the commission and the department filed notices of appeal.
on october,while the matter was pending on appeal,plaintiff filed a motion in the trial court to require the commission to pay the judgment or escrow the amount owing.on december,the trial court denied this motion and amended its earlier judgment to specify that the amount of assessments,penalties,and interest to be refunded was.the court also made what it termed a clerical correction to specify that this refund was awarded only against the commission,and not the department or the state.
on january,plaintiff filed a motion in this court seeking to require the commission to post a bond or escrow the judgment pending appeal.we denied that request on february.on february,the commission dismissed its appeal.the department did the same one week later.
other relevant events were occurring around the same time.on december,the commission voted to recommend to the department that the commission activities be suspended,and it submitted a request to the department for a referendum of eligible egg handlers on this question.see.the handlers voted overwhelmingly in favor of suspending the commission operations.on february,the department certified the results and issued an order declaring the commission suspended.although the effective date of this suspension was not until january,the commission apparently began winding down its affairs immediately.
on march,plaintiff obtained a writ of execution for against the commission.it levied against the commission bank account on april,but because the commission was no longer collecting assessments,only slightly more than was available to satisfy the judgment.
plaintiff filed a claim with the state board of control for the remaining owed on its judgment.when that claim was rejected,the litigation at the heart of this appeal began.
in a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,plaintiff asserted that the state was liable for the debts of the commission in part because it had allowed the commission to go out of business without requiring it to set aside sufficient funds to pay the judgment.it sought a declaration that section,the immunity provision set forth earlier in this opinion,violated due process protections of both the federal and state constitutions,and it sought a refund of assessments,restitution damages in the amount of plus interest 
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,ruling that section did not violate due process and that defendants were not vicariously liable for the commission debt.plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment.
discussion 
at its essence,plaintiff action is an attempt to collect an apparently uncollectible judgment.plaintiff frames this effort as a matter of due process,asserting that its constitutional rights are violated if defendants are not held accountable for the outstanding judgment because it was defendants who permitted the commission to go out of business without ensuring that the commission had safeguarded the funds owed to plaintiff.like the trial court,we conclude that there is no constitutional infirmity in the present case.
plaintiff relies heavily on mckesson division of alc.bev,d mckesson,a case that is readily distinguishable from the situation before us.mckesson involved a florida liquor excise tax scheme that required a taxpayer to pay any assessed tax before challenging the assessment.id.at.at,d at.in mckesson,the plaintiff complied with this procedure it paid its taxes and then challenged the constitutionality of the excise tax.the state courts invalidated the tax scheme but refused to order a refund or any other relief for the taxes plaintiff had paid.id.at.at,d at.
