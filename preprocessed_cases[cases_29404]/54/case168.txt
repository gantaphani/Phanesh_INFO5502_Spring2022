in an effort to consolidate the production process,heller incorporated bolivar in march to cut and sew fabric into exclusively for screen creations.heller was bolivar sole owner,officer and director.at bolivar inception,heller borrowed from screen creations in return for a promissory note dated march.he used the money to purchase cutting and sewing equipment from one of screen creations subcontractors.heller then had bolivar purchase this equipment from him with its promissory note for.both promissory notes provided for ten percent interest,payments starting on december,and payment of the remaining principal balance by.throughout its existence,bolivar purchased additional equipment,using of its own funds.
bolivar consistently suffered financial difficulties.the amount bolivar charged screen creations for the it manufactured did not cover its basic operating costs.as a result,bolivar made no payments to heller on the promissory note,and heller similarly made no payments to screen creations.with interest accruing on the promissory note,bolivar books indicated that it owed heller by.screen creations,which was generally profitable,also regularly advanced operating funds to bolivar.by,bolivar books also reflected that it owed to screen creations.
even beyond the advances,screen creations and bolivar were closely connected financially.in,screen creations revised its plan to include bolivar employees.from to,the two corporations were insured under an insurance policy issued to screen creations.the policy covered bolivar equipment in the amount of.finally,screen creations,and not bolivar,provided heller with a salary and insurance benefits.

according to heller,the north american free trade agreement nafta made textile manufacturing unprofitable in the united states but economically advantageous in mexico.in,heller began moving bolivar equipment to mexico.in february,heller incorporated screen creations de mexico,a mexican corporation,and was a fifty percent owner,the president and a member of its board of directors.by october,heller had moved all of bolivar equipment to screen creations de mexico.screen creations de mexico never paid bolivar for the equipment or for its use of the equipment.
heller claims that he transferred the legal title of bolivar equipment to screen creations and that screen creations paid for the equipment by reducing the debt bolivar owed it on january.heller did not have bolivar equipment appraised at the time of the transfer and did not provide any documentation regarding the change in legal title.although bolivar purchased the equipment for and it was insured for,bolivar tax return recorded the transfer as a sale of the equipment in the amount of,a figure that heller claims he and his accountant arrived upon after we went through various scenarios and talked about market conditions,book value and other issues.screen creations never actually paid bolivar.instead,heller asserts that the transfer was a paper transaction,where bolivar debt to screen creations was reduced by.however,according to bolivar tax return,bolivar debt to screen creations was reduced by,not the full.with respect to the difference,heller asserts that screen creations must have advanced an additional during the tax year.heller,however,did not provide any documentary evidence supporting this claim.
bolivar equipment was its only asset.with no assets left,bolivar ceased operations in july.in october,the state of missouri officially dissolved bolivar for failure to file a annual registration report.in november,screen creations de mexico also ceased operations.heller then sent the bolivar equipment to a mexican corporation named confecciones guanajuanto confecciones.heller had no ownership interest in confecciones,and confecciones paid no compensation for the use of the equipment.however,heller hoped to receive future compensation from confecciones through commissions on product sales.
screen creations operations also moved to mexico.in november,heller incorporated screen creations de celaya to conduct the custom screen printing.heller was a percent owner,the president and a member of its board of directors.heller transferred eighty to ninety percent of screen creations equipment to screen creations de celaya,although the title to the equipment remained with screen creations.screen creations de celaya did not pay any compensation for the use of the equipment.heller claims that screen creations de celaya forwarded a portion of its profits to screen creations,although no agreement existed for such payments and no evidence was presented that screen creations de celaya actually made such payments.
by april,screen creations ceased all production work and became a service business that engaged in sales and technical assistance to screen creations de mexico and screen creations de celaya,although it has not been compensated for these services.in october,the state of missouri administratively dissolved screen creations for failure to file a annual registration report.nonetheless,screen creations continues to operate,and heller is the corporation only remaining employee.heller claims that he has loaned more than to screen creations between and.
before heller transferred bolivar assets,bolivar did not attempt to satisfy the unfair labor practice award against it.in an attempt to collect on the backpay due,the board issued a compliance specification against bolivar,screen creations,screen creations de mexico,screen creations de celaya and heller.see,at.the compliance specification alleged that the corporations and heller should be held jointly and severally liable for the backpay award against bolivar because the corporations constituted a single employer and because the corporate veil should be pierced to allow collection from heller personally.an alj conducted a hearing regarding the allegations of the compliance specification and recommended that all five respondents be held jointly and severally liable for the award against bolivar.on april,the board issued the order adopting the alj recommendation.
pursuant to e,the board filed a petition in this court for the enforcement of its order.heller challenged the board decision to pierce the corporate veil,but the corporate respondents did not contest the board decision that the four corporations constitute a single employer.the board is entitled to summary enforcement of the uncontested portions of its order.flying food group,nlrb,accord nlrb mdi commercial,cir.we therefore summarily enforce the order with respect to the single employer holding.because the board uncontested findings allow us to treat screen creations,bolivar,screen creations de mexico,and screen creations de celaya as a single employer,we consider the evidence involving all of the corporations in deciding whether the board order piercing the corporate veil to allow collection from heller was appropriate.see mdi commercial,at radisson plaza minneapolis nlrb,cir.

with respect to the first prong,substantial evidence supports the board finding that heller and the corporations failed to maintain their separate identities.first,heller controlled and owned all four corporations,and he directed the of each corporation.second,heller did not operate bolivar and screen creations as separate entities.screen creations insurance plan covered bolivar assets and its plan included bolivar employees.more importantly,heller kept screen creations profitable in part by rendering bolivar unprofitable.screen creations was bolivar sole customer,but bolivar neither charged enough to cover its basic operating costs nor attempted to expand its customer base.heller also received his salary from screen creations and not bolivar.as a result,heller salary was tied to screen creations profitability and not bolivar profitability.
third,heller and the corporations readily commingled funds,failed to maintain adequate corporate records,disregarded corporate legal formalities,and failed to maintain an arm length relationship.the funds used to purchase bolivar initial equipment came from screen creations through heller.although screen creations,bolivar and heller exchanged promissory notes,neither bolivar nor heller ever made any payments on the notes,and neither heller nor screen creations ever attempted to enforce them in any way.heller effectively prevented bolivar from making payments on the promissory note because he did not allow bolivar to charge screen creations enough to cover its operating costs.moreover,screen creations advanced operating funds to bolivar without any real accounting or any formal agreement for return payments.in fact,outside the yearly tax returns,the corporations failed to document and account for the transactions between them adequately.as a result,the two corporations tax returns reflected different amounts for bolivar debt to screen creations according to screen creations tax return,bolivar owed screen creations at the beginning of the tax year and at the end of the tax year.according to bolivar tax return,bolivar owed screen creations at the beginning of the tax year and at the end of the tax year.thus,heller readily commingled funds between the two corporations and failed to fol
