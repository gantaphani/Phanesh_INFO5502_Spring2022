a plaintiff obtained a judgment against a homeowners association.when the association failed to pay the judgment and refused to levy a special emergency assessment against its members,the plaintiff obtained an order appointing a receiver and compelling the association to levy the emergency assessment.the association appeals,claiming it can not be ordered to impose an assessment and,inferentially,that the judgment never has to be paid.we reject the association arguments and affirm the order 
after the common areas of the los angeles kingsbury court,a condominium complex in granada hills,were damaged in the northridge earthquake,the los angeles kingsbury court owners association hired an insurance adjuster,james company,to deal with the association insurer.the association agreed to pay percent of the proceeds paid by its insurer but later refused to pay,notwithstanding that the association received about million in insurance proceeds.sued the association for breach of contract and won,and in march a judgment was entered directing the association to pay damages to plus interest,with interest accruing at the rate of about per day.the association did not pay the judgment.
in early,obtained a writ of execution,recorded an abstract of judgment and,by motion,sought an order directing the association to assign to it both the regular and special assessments collected by the association from its members the homeowners.the association,in turn,filed a claim of exemption,asserting that all assessment income was needed for essential services and,therefore,exempt from execution,subd.c.
in may,the trial court agreed with the association that its claimed expenses were essential,and that all regular assessments collected by the association were exempt from execution.at the same time,the court held that judgment was an extraordinary expense within the meaning of subdivision b of section,that the association had the power to levy an emergency assessment to satisfy the judgment,that the association general duty to maintain its property included a more specific duty to meet its legal obligations,that it was obligated to pay a valid civil money judgment entered against it,and that it was thus required to levy a special or emergency assessment to raise the money needed to pay the judgment.to that end,the court ordered the association to convene a meeting of the individual condominium owners to consider and provide for a meaningful emergency assessment so as to satisfy judgment.
the association held a meeting in may but the members refused to impose an emergency assessment to pay judgment.then filed a motion for an order directing the association to levy a special emergency assessment or,in the alternative,for an order appointing a receiver to levy and administer a special emergency assessment.over the association opposition,the trial court granted motion for the appointment of a receiver to levy and administer a special emergency assessment,then stayed its order to permit the association to pursue this appeal

unless otherwise provided in a homeowners association declaration of common interest development,the association is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the common areas,subd.a.in this case,in typical form,the los angeles kingsbury court owners association declaration charges the association with the duty to maintain,repair,restore,replace and make necessary improvements to the common area so that the same are at all times in a condition and good state of repair,and to pay,out of the general funds of the association,the costs of any such maintenance and repair after the northridge earthquake,the association took the first step but not the second,and the question now before us is whether the association can be compelled to impose an assessment to obtain the money needed to pay for the work that was performed for the benefit of the association and its members.for the reasons that follow,we answer the question affirmatively.
the relationship between individual homeowners and the managing association of a common interest development is complex lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners cal th,d,and their respective rights depend upon the nature of the particular dispute.some years ago,in duffey superior court th,d,the court observed that associations were sometimes treated as landlords frances village green owners cal d,association could be held liable for rape and robbery of individual owner who was not allowed to install additional lighting at time of crime wave,sometimes as minigovernments laguna publishing golden rain foundation d.gated community could not discriminate among newspapers,sometimes as businesses village green owners cal d,condominium project with age restrictions was business within the meaning of unruh civil rights act,and sometimes as corporations beehan lido isle community d.board of directors good faith refusal to take action against construction of house in arguable contravention of setback restrictions was protected by corporate business judgment rule.
more recently,the supreme court has differentiated between the situation where,for the sake of maximizing the value of the homeowner investment,each individual owner has an economic interest in the proper management of the development as a whole,and the relationship between the owner and the association is analogous to that of a shareholder to a corporation,and the situation where an individual owner who resides in the development has a personal,not strictly economic,interest in the appropriate management of the development in a manner that will keep the property secure from risks of physical injury,in which sense the relationship is analogous to that between a tenant and landlord.lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners,supra,cal th at,d.
this the homeowners interests are strictly plainly one in which the relationship of the association to the homeowners is akin to that of a corporation to its shareholders.
we begin by rejecting the association contention that it is not required to levy a special emergency assessment to satisfy a civil judgment,and that the trial court had no power to order it to do so.as relevant,section provides 
a except as provided in this section,the association shall levy regular and special assessments sufficient to perform its obligations under the governing documents and this title.however,annual increases in regular assessments for any fiscal year shall not be imposed unless the board has complied with specified requirements.
b notwithstanding more restrictive limitations placed on the board by the governing documents,the board of directors may not impose a regular assessment that is more than percent greater than the regular assessment for the association preceding fiscal year or impose special assessments which in the aggregate exceed percent of the budgeted gross expenses of the association for that fiscal year without the approval of owners,constituting a quorum,casting a majority of the votes at a meeting or election of the association this section does not limit assessment increases necessary for emergency situations.for purposes of this section,an emergency situation is any one of the following 
an extraordinary expense required by an order of a court.
an extraordinary expense necessary to repair or maintain the common interest development or any part of it for which the association is responsible where a threat to personal safety on the property is discovered.
an extraordinary expense necessary to repair or maintain the common interest development or any part of it for which the association is responsible that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the board in preparing and distributing the pro forma operating budget under section 
c regular assessments imposed or collected to perform the obligations of an association under the governing documents or this title shall be exempt from execution by a judgment creditor of the association only to the extent necessary for the association to perform essential services,such as paying for utilities and insurance.in determining the appropriateness of an exemption,a court shall
