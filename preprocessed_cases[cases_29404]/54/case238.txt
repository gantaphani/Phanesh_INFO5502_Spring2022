this case is ancillary to a securities and exchange commission sec enforcement proceeding against paul bilzerian for violation of federal securities laws.the united states district court for the district of columbia created a receivership estate and appointed a receiver to satisfy the sec judgment against bilzerian assets.in the instant action,the receiver filed a complaint against defendant ernest haire,iii to collect on the principal,interest,and fees due and owing to the receivership estate on a million loan.haire moved to dismiss the complaint,alleging that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him,that venue in the district of columbia was improper,that the forum was not convenient,and that the receiver had failed to join a necessary party.the district court rejected those challenges,and entered summary judgment in the receiver favor.we affirm.
in,the united states district court for the district of columbia ordered bilzerian to disgorge over million in profits and million in prejudgment interest obtained from his unlawful transactions in several common stocks.sec bilzerian,aff.on december,after finding bilzerian in contempt for failing to pay the disgorgement judgment,the district court appointed the appellee,deborah meshulam,as receiver for the purpose of identifying,marshaling,receiving and liquidating bilzerian assets.sec bilzerian,d,aff.hereinafter receivership order.the receivership order authorized the receiver to take and maintain complete and exclusive control,possession and custody of bilzerian assets wherever situated and to liquidate any interest in any asset held by anyone on behalf of bilzerian,including but not limited to the initiation and prosecution of litigation against others to recover such asset interests in asset on behalf of the receivership estate.id.at.the receiver filed copies of the receivership order in various federal district courts,including the united states district court for the middle district of florida where haire resides.
the assets of the receivership estate included,inter alia,the assets of overseas holdings limited partnership ohlp,a partnership owned by the bilzerian family to which bilzerian transferred substantial assets during the course of the sec litigation.on july,during the pendency of the contempt proceeding against bilzerian,ohlp loaned haire million.the loan was reflected in a promissory note the note,which accrued interest at an annual rate of and made the principal payable on demand.the note was secured by haire pledge of his stock shares in cimetrix.ohlp demanded payment on august,and haire failure to pay within days of that demand triggered the note terms governing default and penalties.haire and ohlp subsequently executed a forbearance and extension agreement on march,under which haire agreed to pay accrued interest immediately,and ohlp agreed to extend the due date for payment of principal until march.
in december,ohlp agreed to transfer to the receiver all right,title and interest in that certain note and stock pledge agreement and related documents by ernest haire iii in the principal amount of million,as extended.consent and undertakings agreement at see also assignment without recourse.haire,in his capacity as trustee of another entity,signed the agreement.on january,the court entered the agreement as a consent judgment.on april,the receiver sent a letter to haire demanding that he immediately pay all accrued and unpaid interest due on the note,and warning that failure to pay within fifteen days would result in a default under the note express terms.haire failed to pay,and the receiver notified him that the entire million principal and accumulated interest and penalty fees was immediately due.
on june,the receiver filed the present complaint against haire,demanding judgment for the full amount of principal and accrued interest under the note.haire filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction,improper venue,forum non conveniens,and failure to name an indispensable party.at the same time,the receiver moved for summary judgment.the district court denied haire motion to dismiss,mem.order,hereinafter mem.op,and granted the receiver motion for summary judgment,mem.order july,hereinafter july mem.op.
haire now appeals we review both of the district court orders de novo.see gorman ameritrade holding,gilvin fire.in part ii,we consider haire challenge to the court conclusion that it had personal jurisdiction.in part iii,we consider haire remaining objections to the court order denying dismissal,as well as his objections to the court grant of summary judgment to the receiver.
we begin with the threshold question of whether the united states district court for the district of columbia has personal jurisdiction over the defendant,a tampa,florida resident who claims not to have any contacts with the district of columbia.in sec vision communications,a case also involving a receiver in a proceeding ancillary to an sec enforcement action,we explained how such personal jurisdiction could be obtained.step one involves federal rule of civil procedure k d,which provides that s ervice of a summons or filing a waiver of service is effective to establish jurisdiction over the person of a defendant when authorized by a statute of the united states.k d.step two requires a statute that provides the needed authorization to have the defendant served in a district outside the territorial boundaries of the district court for the district of columbia.at.section of title,we said,could provide such authorization.id.that section states 
in proceedings in a district court where a receiver is appointed for property,real,personal,or mixed,situated in different districts,process may issue and be executed in any such district as if the property lay wholly within one district but orders affecting the property shall be entered of record in each of such districts.
finally,to invoke,a receiver first must comply with.at.under that section,a receiver appointed in one district may obtain jurisdiction over property located in another district by filing in the district court of that district,within ten days after the entry of his order of appointment,a copy of the complaint and his order of appointment.id thus,we said,is a stepping stone on the court way to exercising in personam jurisdiction over one who holds receivership assets in a remote district.id.at 
as precedent,vision communications relied on the sixth circuit decision in haile henderson national bank,cir,which is on all fours with the case presently before us.in haile,a receiver was appointed in the middle district of tennessee for a bankrupt church and its assets.id.at.the receiver then brought suit against an individual in the northern district of alabama who had defaulted on a note held by the church.id.at.the alabama defendant resisted on the ground that the district court in tennessee lacked personal jurisdiction over him,and that court agreed,concluding that while they may provide the court with control of the property of the debtor,neither nor grants this court personal jurisdiction of the defendants.id.at.
the sixth circuit reversed.it held that,pursuant to,the territorial jurisdiction of the appointing court is extended to any district of the united states where property believed to be that of the receivership estate is found,provided that the proper documents have been filed in each such district as required by.id.at.it noted that rule of the federal rules of civil procedure contemplates the use of statutes of the united states which provide for service of process upon a party not found within the state in which the district court is held.id.at.and it concluded that the statute of the united states which provides for service of process beyond the territorial limits of the state in which the district court sits in the case at bar is.id.the process authorized by,the court said,is not but rather nationwide.id.at.under that section,t he appointment court process extends to any judicial district where receivership property is found.id.
in american freedom train foundation spurney,the first circuit pronounced itself in agreement with the sixth circuit holding that pursuant to sections and,t he appointment court process extends to any judicial district where receivership property is found,cir quoting haile,at.and both circuits discussions paralleled,and haile expressly relied upon,the views of professor moore,who concluded i n cases under these two sections,the minimum contacts analysis of international shoe as a limitation on extraterritorial power,does not apply,since service of process under is nationwide.pt.james moore,moore federal practice ed.
in the present case,the district court followed the analysis outlined in vision communications and haile.the court found that the receiver had complied with by filing the appropriate documents in the middle district of florida,and that this compliance meant that authorized service of process.the court further found that haire had been properly served.citing rule k d,the court concluded that it therefore had personal jurisdiction over the defendant.mem.op.at.
haire does not dispute that the receiver filed the appropriate documents in florida,or that he received service of process there.what he disputes is the district court authority to issue process to obtain in personam jurisdiction over an defendant.section,haire contends,authorizes extraterritorial service of process only to obtain in rem jurisdiction jurisdiction over property in another district,and not in personam jurisdiction over a defendant in such a district.when a court exercises only in rem jurisdiction,the resulting judgment can affect only the property and can not personally bind absentees simply on the basis of their interests in the property.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,sfederal practice and procedure,at ed hereinafter wright miller.
haire contention is,of course,inconsistent with the explanation of the role of that we enunciated in vision communications.haire contends that explanation was dicta because,in vision communications,the receiver had failed to make the necessary filings within the ten days required by,which precluded the district court from using as a stepping stone on its way to exercising in personam jurisdiction.at.thus,he says,the court discussion of was unnecessary.haire may be technically correct,but it is apparent that the vision communications court did not think so.the court made clear that,but for the failure to comply with,the interplay between rule k d and could have provided th e authorization for service of process sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.id.at.and it ended its opinion with a direction to the parties that it would not have issued had it not thought authorized the service necessary to bind the defendant 
on remand,the court may reappoint the receiver and start the clock of ticking once again.presumably,the receiver will take advantage of his second chance once he does so,the receiver will have jurisdiction over the pennsylvania property and may seek to have vista vision served in pennsylvania under.
the defendant asks us to cast aside our statements in vision communications,as well as the sixth circuit decision in haile,and accept instead the analysis found in an unpublished opinion from the northern district of illinois.that court held that merely authorizes extraterritorial service of process in aid of in rem actions and does not do so in cases like this one in which the receiver seeks an in personam judgment.stenger world harvest church,wl,at.the basis for the stenger court conclusion was that does not mention service of process rather it speaks only of issuance and execution of process.stenger,wl,at.in the stenger court view,service of process and issuance of process are not the same thing only service achieves in personam jurisdiction issuance is merely the clerk ministerial act of issuing a summons to a plaintiff so that he or she can serve it on the defendant.id.moreover,stenger continued,service and execution are also different while service achieves in personam jurisdiction,execution of process involves the act,in an in rem action,of attaching property.id.
section states that in a district court where a receiver is appointed for property which is the case of the district court here process may issue and be executed.as stenger concedes,process generally refers to a summons or writ,especially to appear or respond in court.stenger,at quoting black law dictionary ed.the remaining question,therefore,is the meaning of may issue and be executed.and neither congress nor the courts have restricted those terms to the meanings insisted upon by stenger.
even if stenger were correct that issuance is merely the clerk ministerial act of issuing a summons,federal rules,statutes,and court opinions have used execution as more than merely a synonym for attaching property.indeed,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure uses execution of process as roughly synonymous with service of process.see.requiring that the civil docket contain entries showing the substance of each order or judgment of the court and of the returns showing execution of process.in that sense,providing that a summons may issue and be executed means that the summons may issue and be served.see also black law dictionary,at,meaning defining execution as the act of carrying out or putting into effect as a court order.
execution is also often used to mean the method by which a judgment,including a judgment in personam,is enforced this is as distinct from attachment,which is often used to denote the method by which or jurisdiction is obtained in this sense,then,may issue and be executed describes the entire process from initial issuance,through service,through judgment,to final enforcement of judgment.
there is also no support for stenger insistence that issuance is limited to a clerk ministerial act.congress has used issue as shorthand to comprehend the phase of the process that extends from issuance of an order through and including its service similarly,courts frequently use issuance and service interchangeably 
in sum,common legal usage of the words employed in support the views expressed by this court in vision communications,by the first and sixth circuits in american freedom train and haile,and by scholarly commentary.accordingly,we decline to part company with those views,and we conclude that the interplay between rule k and and properly provided the district court with jurisdiction over the person of haire 
the defendant remaining challenges to the district court denial of his motion to dismiss,and to its grant of the receiver motion for summary judgment,require only brief discussion 
haire sought dismissal of the complaint on three grounds in addition to personal jurisdiction.first,he contended that venue was improper in the district of columbia to enforce a contract signed in florida between two florida residents.but the district court correctly concluded that,because the receiver complaint was brought to accomplish the objectives of the receivership order and was thus ancillary to the court exclusive jurisdiction over the receivership estate,venue was properly established.mem.op.at see haile,at w here jurisdiction is ancillary,the consideration of venue is ancillary as well.wright miller,at noting with approval that,where ancillary jurisdiction sufficed to allow a claim or a party without jurisdictional grounds,it was also unnecessary to satisfy the venue statutes with regard to that claim or party see also scholes lehmann,cir the laying of venue is authorized by,which allows a receiver to sue in the district in which he was appointed to enforce claims anywhere in the country.
second,haire sought dismissal on the ground that the note provides that all related actions must be brought in local florida courts.although haire styled this as a forum non conveniens argument,his challenge centered not on the inconvenience or burden of litigating in the district of columbia,but rather on the note forum selection clause.that clause states 
venue for any legal proceeding arising under this note or the stock pledge agreement shall be in the courts located in hillsborough county,flori
