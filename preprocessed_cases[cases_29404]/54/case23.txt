fonten and belmann appeal from a jury verdict and the district court denial of its motion for a new trial in their suit against ocean spray cranberries,ocean spray,for a claimed violation of a settlement agreement.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the participation and conduct of ocean spray trial attorney prejudiced the jury,and that the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.we affirm.
background 
fonten and belmann were engaged in the business of marketing fruit juice in taiwan.fonten,a california corporation,purchased the juice in the united states and shipped it to taiwan where belmann,a taiwanese corporation,distributed it both corporations were controlled by hong chen chen,a taiwanese citizen.in,ocean spray,a cooperative of cranberry and grapefruit growers headquartered in lakeville,massachusetts,began to market its fruit juices in taiwan,advertising their products using a chinese phrase that translates roughly as natural fruit juices.chen took exception to this phrase,interpreting it to mean that ocean spray was advertising its products as juice,when some of the products were in fact of the cocktail mixture of juice and sugar water.ocean spray disputed that interpretation,saying that it was advertising its products only as natural,and it refused to change its advertisements.three years after the advertisements ran,plaintiffs brought an action in federal court in the district of massachusetts for false advertising and related claims.
the parties eventually entered into a settlement agreement,in which ocean spray agreed to pay chen and to publish a series of corrective advertisements in taiwanese newspapers,but did not admit to having falsely advertised its products.ocean spray was represented in the settlement negotiations by attorney cynthia vreeland.following the agreement,certain corrective advertisements ran in selected newspapers in april of.because of a quirk in taiwanese newspaper advertising,some of the advertisements ran in only half of a given newspaper circulation.some of taiwan newspapers follow a practice of allowing an advertiser to purchase space in only half of a day circulation.these two single editions are then shuffled together so that each edition is distributed roughly equally around the area.
chen closed his fruit juice businesses in and sued ocean spray in massachusetts state court in late for breach of the settlement agreement.because the parties had consented to federal jurisdiction,the state court dismissed the action.on february,plaintiffs brought the same breach of contract suit in district court under diversity jurisdiction.at trial,ocean spray was again represented by attorney cynthia vreeland,and it is her participation that is at issue here.shortly before trial,plaintiffs moved to have vreeland disqualified under massachusetts rule of professional conduct a rule because she ought to be called as a witness since she was a part of the negotiations at issue.the motion was denied and trial proceeded without vreeland being called to testify.at the close of the trial,the jury returned a verdict for ocean spray.plaintiffs moved for a new trial,which the district court denied.plaintiffs now appeal both the verdict and the denial of their motion for a new trial.they argue on appeal that the district court erred in not ordering a new trial because of the conduct of attorney vreeland and because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.
ii.discussion 
attorney conduct 
plaintiffs argue that the district court should have granted the new trial motion because vreeland had engaged in prejudicial misconduct during the course of the trial,and because vreeland mere presence lent undue weight to the testimony of ocean spray witnesses,making it impossible for plaintiffs to have a fair trial the unsworn witness problem 
as to attorney vreeland trial conduct,plaintiffs point only to the following exchange in which vreeland plaintiffs expert on his use of an estimate to calculate damages,rather than one based just on taiwanese juice businesses 
q.in your conversations with ehrhard and cheng counsel for plaintiffs,did they tell you that daisy hong from ocean spray had collected audited public financial statements from nine companies that actually sell fruit juice products in taiwan 
i did not make use of that report.
q.did you know that,did you know that your lawyers had that report 
i not aware of that.
q.did you or did you not know that chen lawyers had public audited financial statements from nine companies selling fruit juice products in taiwan 
i did not know that.
q.they did tell you that 
plaintiffs did not contemporaneously object to the questioning,but did raise the issue at the close of trial and again in their motion for a new trial following the jury verdict.their objection was based on the fact that the financial reports vreeland referenced were not in evidence.the district court ruled that the line of questioning was proper.
absent an abuse of discretion,this court defers to a district court denial of a motion for a new trial based upon improper argument or conduct of counsel.happ,cir.defendants argue that plaintiffs failure to timely object waives the issue.failure to timely object to an attorney misconduct will frequently result in the denial of a motion for new trial,but such denials typically occur in cases where a party did not raise the objection at all until after the jury had returned a verdict.see,computer.eng g,qantel,cir.the concern in those cases is that a party might hold back its objections until after it sees the verdict.see wildman lerner stores,cir counsel can not play a waiting game and after an adverse verdict is rendered raise an objection to argument for the first time.here,such gaming is not a concern,since plaintiffs first brought their concerns to the attention of the district judge prior to the jury verdict.see happ,at applying an abuse of discretion standard where attorney failed to immediately object to closing arguments,but did object before the jury began deliberations.furthermore,even if the objection were not preserved,we would still review for plain error in order to correct substantial injustice.see united states olano,d smith kmart,cir failure to object to improper closing argument forfeits,but does not waive,the issue,and plain error review still applies see also computer.eng g,at.
admittedly,the reasons for allowing a delayed objection to an attorney conduct during closing argument are different from those for allowing a delayed objection to an attorney conduct during witness questioning.see wilson town of mendon,cir we are loath to impose a rule that would require counsel to abandon professionalism and decorum by routinely interrupting the other side closing argument to avoid the risk of waiving an objection entirely.however,because it does not affect the outcome of this case,we need not decide the issue here.instead,we will follow the practice we have adopted in the cases of assuming,arguendo,that the objection was preserved.see united states potter,cir united states,cir.nonetheless,because we award a high degree of deference to a district judge management of attorney conduct,a showing of prejudice is still required before we will reverse for an abuse of discretion.see happ,at reversal of an order denying a new trial on the basis of attorney misconduct requires a showing of prejudice aqueduct sewer auth.constructora lluch,cir we reverse only upon a showing of prejudice.
the district judge ruled that vreeland questioning had not been improper,and that she was permitted to use her knowledge of the case in asking leading questions.plaintiffs are not specific as to why such questioning would be improper,much less why it would rise to the level of misconduct such as would leave the district judge no option but to order a new trial.they say only that vreeland was testifying through these questions.however,all that we can see that she was testifying to was the existence of certain documents,and that they were in the possession of plaintiffs counsel she made no reference to any facts contained in the documents,or whether the documents contradicted the expe
