to satisfy the judgment,the bennetts obtained writs of attachment against iran former embassy,ambassador residence,and another diplomatic residence,as well as two parking lots.the united states has been the custodian of these properties since april,when it cut diplomatic ties with iran in response to the of the american embassy in tehran.see dep t of state office of the legal adviser,digest of united states practice in international law,at,see also exec.order,freezing iranian assets in the united states.the united states has held iran diplomatic and consular properties for the past thirty years pursuant to article of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations,which requires signatory states to respect and protect the premises and property of a mission if diplomatic relations are severed or a mission is recalled,and the foreign missions act,c,which authorizes the secretary of state to protect and preserve the property of a foreign mission that has ceased conducting diplomatic activities in the united states.
the united states intervened in the proceeding and moved to quash the writs on the ground that the properties were not subject to attachment.the district court granted the government motion.bennett islamic republic of iran.the bennetts appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.whether the properties are subject to attachment is a question of law that we review de novo.see price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,d.
diplomatic properties are generally immune from attachment.see.the terrorism risk insurance act tria carves out an exception to this general rule,authorizing the attachment of blocked assets of state sponsors of terrorism to satisfy judgments for compensatory damages for acts of terrorism,a,stat,codified at note.tria defines blocked assets as those seized or frozen by the united states for certain foreign policy purposes.see id.d a.blocked assets do not include,however,property subject to the vienna convention on diplomatic relations that is being used exclusively for diplomatic or consular purposes.id.d b ii.such property may not be attached.
the government and the bennetts agree that the properties subject to the writs are seized assets belonging to a state sponsor of terrorism and that their attachment would satisfy a judgment for compensatory damages for an act of terrorism.the parties contest,however,whether the properties are subject to the vienna convention on diplomatic relations and are being used exclusively for diplomatic or consular purposes.tria d b ii.the bennetts concede that all the properties except the diplomatic residence are subject to the vienna convention.they have forfeited the argument that the residence is not because they raised it for the first time on appeal.see potter district of columbia.that leaves us with only the question of whether the properties are being used exclusively for diplomatic or consular purposes.tria d b ii.
the united states claims that it has held the attached properties in custody since to fulfill its obligations under article of the vienna convention to respect and protect the premises of a former mission after diplomatic relations between two states have been severed,as well as the foreign missions act.see decl.of claude nebel,deputy assistant sec y for diplomatic sec.deputy dir.of the office of foreign missions,july.on march,the united states announced that it would rent out iran diplomatic properties periodically to generate income to pay for the upkeep required by the vienna convention.id.since then,the united states has at times rented iran properties to other foreign missions and to private parties and used the proceeds to maintain and repair the properties consistent with its treaty obligations.any excess income from the rentals has been placed in an iranian bank account that,like all iranian assets in america,has been frozen by the united states.id.
there is no dispute that the united states has used these properties for a diplomatic purpose.the bennetts have conceded this point.appellants br.at.according to the government,that concession resolves the dispute because the sole inquiry under the statute is the purpose for which the united states uses the properties.the bennetts insist that the statute requires us to look at the nature of the use as well.
statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.engine mfrs.ass south coast air quality management.the bennetts contend that renting the properties to third parties is a nondiplomatic use,which makes the properties subject to attachment.their argument assumes that tria protection from attachment requires a diplomatic use of the property.that requirement finds no support in the text of the statute,which provides only that the property is being used exclusively for diplomatic and consular purposes.tria d b ii emphasis added.the adjectives diplomatic and consular modify the noun purpose,not the verb used.we read the verb phrase is being used for to carry its ordinary meaning of ma de instrumental to an end or process.webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove.the statute provides that the property retains its immunity from attachment only so long as it is being used exclusively for diplomatic and consular purposes.tria d b ii.the bennetts cite several cases from our sister circuits interpreting what they consider to be analogous portions of the foreign sovereign immunities act.see.bank of commerce republic of congo,cir interpreting a provision permitting attachment of property used for a commercial activity joseph office of the consulate general of nigeria,cir construing the commercial activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity,which focus es on the nature of the transaction at issue rather than its purpose.but unlike the provisions at issue in those cases,tria,by its plain language,is concerned only with the purpose for which the property is used,and not the way the property is used in service of that end.
the bennetts argue that our reading of section d b ii is mistaken because it fails to take into account section b a of tria,which creates another means to protect from attachment properties subject to the vienna conventions.section b a authorizes the president to immunize such properties from attachment so long as they have not been used by the united states for any nondiplomatic purpose including use as rental property.tria b a.the parenthetical phrase,the bennetts argue,establishes that any use of a seized asset as a rental property invariably has a nondiplomatic purpose.not only is that not true as a descriptive matter,but that view of the provision can not be squared with its plain meaning,which calls for an inquiry into the purpose of the use and not the type of same inquiry required by section d b ii.far from announcing a categorical rule that any use as a rental is in pursuit of a nondiplomatic purpose,the parenthetical simply acknowledges that the government may have a nondiplomatic purpose for renting the property.
we are equally unpersuaded by the bennetts argument that our interpretation of section d b ii renders this provision superfluous because it duplicates protection alread
