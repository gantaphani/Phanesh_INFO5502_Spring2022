in,construction company sued the miccosukee tribe of indians of florida the tribe for breach of contract in the miccosukee tribal court.the tribe denied liability and counterclaimed,alleging that was the breaching party.following a trial on the merits,the tribal court denied claims and,finding for the tribe on its counterclaim,awarded the tribe a judgment of million.petitioned the tribe business council for leave to appeal the judgment to the tribe general council,which acts as the tribal court of appeals the council denied petition.
refused to satisfy the tribal court judgment,so the tribe brought suit against in the united states district court for the southern district of florida to enforce it.as an affirmative defense,alleged that,in denying its petition for leave to appeal the tribal court judgment,the business council denied it due process of law,thereby rendering the judgment void.on for summary judgment,the district court,relying on principles of comity,held the judgment unenforceable and granted summary judgment.the tribe now appeals.we reverse and remand the case to the district court with the instruction that it dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the tribe,a federally recognized indian tribe,has approximately members and maintains its reservation in county,florida.is a large construction company that specializes in building casino properties for indian tribes 
and the tribe negotiated and signed three contracts from to for the construction of several buildings on the tribe reservation,including a resort hotel and halfway house the parties agreed to base the three contracts on the american institute of architects standard form of agreement between owner and the aia form some of the aia form provisions were amended by interlineation one provision,article arbitration,was eliminated altogether although preferred that claims be resolved pursuant to the arbitration procedures of that article,the tribe asserted that it would waive its sovereign immunity only if agreed to use the tribal court as the forum for resolving contract disputes.relented and,in lieu of article,the parties inserted the following section in article 
waiver of sovereign immunity.the tribe hereby waives any defense of sovereign immunity from suit in miccosukee tribal court in connection with any action or proceeding,including any claim,or counterclaim,brought by or against it in connection with this contract or any of the transactions contemplated in this contract for and only with respect to actions brought in miccosukee tribal court.the tribe does not waive immunity in any form for actions in any court including miccosukee tribal court not in connection with this contract or any of the transactions contemplated in this contract.
the aia form choice of law provision,article miscellaneous provisions,
states,in section,that t his part shall be governed by the law of the place where the work is located.the parties amended section so that it provided that part would be governed by substantive contract laws of the state of florida and other substantive laws of the miccosukee tribe.
in,the parties began to disagree as to the amounts due under the contracts.the tribe refused to honor certain invoices submitted by,contending that the company had overcharged for the work it had performed and had failed to remedy several construction defects.settlement negotiations ensued,but the parties were unable to resolve their differences,and the invoices remained unpaid.
on may,filed a complaint against the tribe in the tribal court alleging that was due under the contracts.the tribe responded with a counterclaim and,neither of which specified a monetary amount,based on allegedly improper overcharges and construction defects.on june,following discovery and a bench trial,the tribal court issued its trial decision,a document that summarized the evidence and set forth the court findings and conclusions.in it,the tribal court denied claims and awarded the tribe judgment in the sum of on its counterclaim.
filed a notice of appeal to the miccosukee business council on july,asserting the following claims of error the tribal court exceeded its powers rendered a decision based on mathematical errors excluded material evidence and prejudiced ability to present its case and was generally prejudiced against.the business council considered these asserted errors and reached a consensus that the tribal court committed no procedural error in reaching its decision.on july,the business council notified that it had disallowed its appeal because the company raise d no issues meriting review by the tribal court of appeals.
did not pay any portion of the judgment entered against it.on november,the tribe commenced this action to enforce the tribal court judgment.the tribe complaint alleged that the district court had federal question jurisdiction under,diversity jurisdiction under,and federal common law of comity jurisdiction under.after reciting the contractual events that led to the tribal court judgment,the complaint requested the court to find that the trial decision final judgment is entitled to recognition,registration,and enforcement in accordance with the applicable federal law and to enter an order recognizing,registering and enforcing the tribal court trial decision final judgment.
in its answer,asserted,as an affirmative defense,that the tribal court judgment was unenforceable because the business council refusal to allow the appeal denied due process of law.addressing the complaint assertion of subject matter jurisdiction,disagreed that the district court had jurisdiction under and but admitted that the court had jurisdiction under because its answer contained a defense based on the due process clause.
the parties having joined issue,moved the court for summary judgment based on its affirmative defense.the court granted its motion in an order entered on may.after stating that the complaint failed to disclose a basis for jurisdiction under or,the court concluded that subject matter jurisdiction over this action,which seeks the enforcement of a tribal court judgment against a party,is based on federal common law,and therefore presented a federal question embraced by.the court then turned to the question of whether full faith and credit or comity was the appropriate framework for analyzing the enforceability of the tribal court judgment.the court opted for the latter approach and held that the judgment should not be afforded comity because the business council was an interested party in the litigation and its disallowance of appeal constituted a denial of due process.after the court entered a final judgment for in accordance with its may order,the tribe took this appeal.
we begin,as in all appeals,by asking whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.see great fire proof hotel jones.on every writ of error or appeal,the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction,first,of this court,and then of the court from which the record comes.in the complaint,the tribe asserted three bases for jurisdiction,and.the district court concluded that jurisdiction lay under.we therefore consider that jurisdictional basis first,then address and.
although the parties agree with the district court that jurisdiction lies under we nonetheless have the obligation to inquire sua sponte into whether the district court was correct.see bender williamsport area sch,d e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.quoting mitchell maurer.fitzgerald seaboard,cir.
pursuant to,district courts have original jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.f ederal question jurisdiction does not exist merely because an indian tribe is a party or the case involves a contract with an indian tribe,stock west,confederated tribes of the colville reservation,cir a plaintiff complaint still must claim a right to recover under the constitution and laws of the united states,bell hood.although this is not a stringent standard,a mere incantation that the cause of action involves a federal question is not always sufficient.murphy inexco oil,cir see generally charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.bearing in mind this standard,we examine whether the tribe has sufficiently identified a constitutional provision or federal law under which it can recover.
despite the complaint lack of reference to any discernible federal law,the district court invoked its jurisdiction on the theory that a case that seeks the enforcement of a tribal court judgment against a party is based on federal common law.on appeal,in supplemental briefing that we requested following oral argument,the tribe and similarly rely upon federal common law to support federal question jurisdiction.the tribe argues that the district court had jurisdiction based on the quintessentially federal character of native american law and that its claim for enforcement of a tribal judgment on land relied exclusively on the federal government longstanding policy of encouraging tribal.agrees that the existence of abundant federal common law pertaining to indian tribes is sufficient to invoke federal question jurisdiction.we therefore begin by examining the possibility that federal common law created jurisdiction pursuant to.we conclude that it did not.
c laims founded upon federal common law as well as those of a statutory origin may give rise to federal question jurisdiction.farmers union ins.crow tribe of indians,d quoting illinois city of milwaukee,d.the supreme court has made clear,however,that vague assertions by plaintiffs regarding federal common law to support federal question jurisdiction will not suffice.in inyo county indians,d,the court explained that merely relying on the federal common law of indian affairs does not clarify what federal law,if any,the tribe case arises under.id.at.at see also weeks,oglala sioux hous,cir t he fact that the housing authority is created by and operates on behalf of an indian tribe is not alone sufficient to find the existence of a federal question.likewise,here,the tribe has failed to explain the specific prescription of federal common law that enables it to maintain an action to enforce a judgment handed down by a tribal court in a proceeding to which the defendant consented by contract 
although the tribe has failed to identify any federal law or constitutional provision that its suit arises under,we proceed to consider another way that federal question jurisdiction may be conferred.whether a tribal court has adjudicative authority over nonmembers presents a federal question based on federal common law.plains commerce bank long family land cattle,d iowa mut.ins.laplante,d farmers,at.at.in this section,we explain why this case is not a challenge regarding the reach of indian power and that subject matter jurisdiction does not exist on that basis.
in national farmers,the supreme court commented that it has frequently been required to decide questions concerning the extent to which indian tribes have retained the power to regulate the affairs of.at.at.there,a tribal court entered a default judgment against a state school district,and the school district sought and received an injunction from a federal district court preventing further proceedings in the tribal court.id.at.at.the supreme court held that in order to invoke federal question jurisdiction,the school district had to contend that the tribe had been divested of its sovereign authority to enter a essence,that a dispute existed over the extent of tribal powers.id.at.at.because the school district contended that federal law divested the tribe of this aspect of sovereignty,it satisfied this federal question requirement.id.at.at.in particular,t he question whether an indian tribe retains the power to compel a property owner to submit to the civil jurisdiction of a tribal court had to be answered by reference to federal law and is a federal question under.id.at.at.a federal court may determine under whether a tribal court has exceeded the lawful limits of its jurisdiction.id.at.at.
in sum,national farmers dictates that a dispute over tribal court jurisdiction is considered a dispute over tribal sovereignty,and a dispute over tribal a matter of federal law to which applies.this case,however,does not involve a dispute over the tribal court jurisdiction.that is,the tribe has not asked for a declaratory decree to resolve a dispute over whether the tribal court had jurisdiction to entertain claim for payment and the tribe set off and counterclaim.both sides agree that the tribal court possessed such jurisdiction what the tribe asks is that the federal district court domesticate its judgment against so that it can obtain execution of the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.a suit to domesticate a tribal judgment does not state a claim under federal law,whether statutory or common law.thus,the district court lacked jurisdiction under national farmers to entertain the tribe complaint.
finally,we note that although rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires a complaint to include a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court jurisdiction,courts have saved some complaints even though they lacked a jurisdictional statement because they made references to federal law sufficient to permit the court to find jurisdiction.gardner first am.title ins,cir rule a is satisfied if the complaint say s enough about jurisdiction to create some reasonable likelihood that the court is not about to hear a case that it is not supposed to have the power to hear.alteration in original internal quotation omitted.here,the complaint is devoid of a single citation to a constitutional provision,a federal statute,or a recognized theory of common law as the basis for the allegation that the tribe cause of action arises under federal law.the barren complaint provided by the tribe gives us no indication of how the tribe expected the district court to recognize,register,and enforce the tribal judgment.see pan am.petroleum superior court,d finding it immaterial that the plaintiff could have elected to proceed on a federal ground if the plaintiff decides not to invoke a federal right,his claim belongs in a state court.internal citation omitted.therefore,we find no other ascertainable basis for jurisdiction under.
having concluded that does not provide a basis for federal jurisdiction in this case,we now turn to the other bases for federal jurisdiction asserted in the complaint,and.we can quickly reject both possibilities.
first,as the district court found regarding the possibility of diversity jurisdiction,t he majority by every court of appeals that has addressed the that unincorporated indian tribes can not sue or be sued in diversity under a because they are not citizens of any state citing cases.turning to,the tribe asserted in its complaint that this full faith and credit an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction we are accordingly faced with the question of whether,under the circumstances presented here,a cause of action seeking the enforcement of a tribal court judgment creates an independent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.the clear answer is no.
under circuit precedent,it is long established that does not,standing alone,confer jurisdiction on a federal district court to domesticate a judgment rendered by a court of another jurisdiction.hazen research,omega minerals,cir.similarly,an appeal to comity does not,standing alone,create federal question jurisdiction under.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.supp.as the sixth circuit has noted,an argument that comity brings about federal question jurisdiction puts the proverbial cart before the horse w hen an action already rests on federal question jurisdiction,the theory of comity can serve as a discretionary basis for a court to determine whether a foreign country court judgment should be given preclusive effect.taveras taveraz,cir.furthermore,the tribe no longer asserts as a basis for federal jurisdiction in its supplementa
