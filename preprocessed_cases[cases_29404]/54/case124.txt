the estate of christopher moreland the estate,filed a motion for a writ of execution to enforce a judgment against joseph county,indiana and its board of commissioners the county,pursuant to indiana code and rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied the estate motion.because we conclude that the state law that the estate seeks to invoke was not intended to apply retroactively,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
the estate has appeared before this court twice,both stemming from the beating of christopher moreland.in,moreland was detained in joseph county jail on a drunk driving charge.erich dieter and michael sawdon,officers at the jail,took part in a beating of moreland that would result in the imposition of massive civil liability against them.its more immediate effect was moreland death.
the details of the assault are reported in estate of moreland dieter,cir.for present purposes,we note only that moreland beating and subsequent denial of medical care spanned multiple floors of the jail,lasted several hours,and was ruthless.moreland was physically restrained for much of the incident.ultimately,he was placed unconscious into the jail drunk tank and left for dead.
pursuant to,the estate filed suit against dieter,sawdon,and a third officer,paul moffa,alleging violations of moreland constitutional rights.the county paid for the officers defenses.in may,a jury returned a verdict against dieter and sawdon and determined that they were liable for million in damages million of which were compensatory.the jury deadlocked,however,on the claims against moffa a new trial was held,and a jury returned a verdict in his favor in september.this court subsequently upheld the verdict against dieter and sawdon.estate of moreland,at.
on july,to the moffa retrial,but more than a year after the jury returned the verdict against dieter and sawdon,and nearly ten months after the county stopped paying their legal amendment to the indiana code took effect.see.acts,the amendment or the amendment.as discussed below,the amendment made changes to indiana statutory scheme governing indemnification by governmental entities for the conduct of their employees.critically,the amendment converted a discretionary indemnification provision into one that is only for damages and only when the governmental entity defends or has the opportunity to defend the employee.
in,the estate sought to invoke the amendment,filing with the district court a motion for a writ of execution to collect against joseph county its board of commissioners on the judgment.the estate argued that the amendment required joseph county to pay the million in compensatory damages for which dieter and sawdon were found liable.the district court denied the motion,and this appeal followed.
ii.indiana code 
section of the indiana code relates to indemnification for civil rights claims against public employees.it provides,with the key language in italics 
if a present or former public employee,including a member of a board,a committee,a commission,an authority,or another instrumentality of a governmental entity,is or could be subject to personal civil liability for a loss occurring because of a noncriminal act or omission within the scope of the public employee employment which violates the civil rights laws of the united states,the governmental entity when the governmental entity defends or has the opportunity to defend the public employee shall,subject to ic,ic,ic,and ic,pay 
any judgment other than for punitive damages of the claim or suit or 
any judgment for punitive damages,compromise,or settlement of the claim or suit if 
the statutorily specified officer or governing body determines that paying the judgment for punitive damages,compromise,or settlement is in the best interest of the governmental entity.the governmental entity shall also pay all costs and fees incurred by or on behalf of a public employee in defense of the claim or suit.
emphasis added.
after a relatively stable existence section was expanded by the amendment.as amended,the provision has two noteworthy features.first,in certain cases and subject to a cap the code requires a governmental entity to indemnify its public employees for compensatory damages growing out of their noncriminal acts,where the governmental entity defends or has the opportunity to defend the public employee.under the prior version of the act,the governmental matter how active it was in its employee decide whether or not to indemnify its employee.see supp.city of muncie peters,citing kapitan city of gary,cir.
the second noteworthy feature of amended section is that it keeps punitive damages and settlements on the same footing as all damages had been under prior law.that is,while indemnification for compensatory damages is in some cases mandatory,indemnification for punitive damages and settlements remains a matter of grace the governmental entity must foot the bill only if the pertinent officer or governing body determines that paying is in the best interest of the governmental entity.
as we discuss in greater depth in part iii,infra,the mandatory payment of judgments combined with discretionary payment of settlements creates a regime which allows governmental entities to decide whether they would rather pay a settlement or risk a judgment 
iii.analysis 
the district court ruled that the amendment to section did not apply to dieter and sawdon,concluding that the amendment was not intended to apply retroactively.indiana code has not been extensively interpreted by the indiana courts,and we review the district court interpretation of the indiana code de novo.salve regina coll.russell,d united states rosenbohm,cir.
in indiana,the lodestar of statutory interpretation is legislative intent,and the plain language of the statute is the best evidence of that intent.cubel cubel.generally,the words in a statute should be given their ordinary meaning.while courts should try to give effect to each word in a statute,they ought not to do so myopically.instead,t he statute should be examined as a whole,avoiding both excessive reliance on strict literal meaning and selective reading of individual words.tormoehlen state,noting that legislative intent as ascertained from the whole prevails over the strict,literal meaning of any word or term used in a statute.
indiana courts presume that the general assembly laws apply prospectively only,unless the statute contains explicit language mandating retroactive application.state pelley,statutes are to be given prospective effect only,unless the legislature unequivocally and unambiguously intended retrospective effect as well.see also landgraf usi film,d scalia,concurring.the presumption against retroactivity is deeply rooted.see,citizens state bank of noblesville julian,united states heth,cranch.laws should be applied prospectively unless the words are too imperious to admit of a different construction.
an and occasionally invoked exception to the general rule is that remedial intended to cure a defect or mischief that existed in a prior statute bourbon,gast fuel,retroactive application to certain state environmental laws will be applied retroactively to carry out the statute purpose unless to do so violates a vested right or constitutional guaranty.martin state,retroactive application where a legislative amendment was an apparent corrective to a judicial decision.in the end,however,legislative intent remains the overriding goal of the retroactivity analysis,just as it is for statutory interpretation more generally.bourbon,at cubel,at.
the estate argues that the amendment applies to the judgment because the interpretation that it seeks is not retroactive at all,the language of the amendment requires retroactive application,and the amendment was a remedial statute whose purpose requires retroactive application.we examine each argument in turn.
a.the estate seeks a retroactive interpretation 
the estate most ambitious argument is that application of the amendment to this case would not be retroactive at all because there was no final judgment at the time that the amendment took effect the final judgment rule that the estate proposes,however,is not one that indiana courts have adopted as a bright line rule in their retroactivity analysis.rather the retroactivity inquiry centers on whether application of a new rule will attach new legal consequences to events completed before the law enactment.landgraf,at.stewart marson constr.plainly,that is what the estate seeks to do in this case.prior to the enactment of the amendment,a governmental entity was required to pay all costs and fees incurred by or on behalf of a public employee in defense of a claim or suit supp,but the governmental entity did not have to pay a judgment unless it decided that payment was in its best interest.id.thus,under the law as it existed at the time that the county elected to defend dieter and sawdon,the county had the option not to pay the ensuing judgment.
the amendment changed the calculus for the governmental entity.under the amendment,once the governmental entity defends or has the opportunity to do so,it is at least partially on the hook for any subsequent judgment.had the amendment been in effect prior to the trials of dieter and sawdon,the county at least could have urged the two to settle.it is no answer to say that the county had the opportunity to defend dieter and sawdon on appeal.the point is that the amendment attache d new legal consequences to an was completed before the amendment enactment.landgraf,at.after all,there are only limited bases for reversing a jury verdict at the appellate stage,in large part because the facts are construed in favor of the prevailing party.tate executive mgmt,cir w e will overturn a jury only if we conclude that no rational jury could have found for the prevailing party.quotation marks omitted mcroberts software,media,cir see also latino kaizer,cir even greater deference for a case with simple issues but highly disputed facts.
even the cases cited by the estate to prop up its proposed final judgment rule do not support its argument.for instance,in int l fidelity ins.state,the indiana court of appeals held merely that a statute that was amended after a final judgment could not be applied retroactively to the judgment.similarly in speidel state,the court held that a amendment to a statute governing interest owed on judgments was applicable to a judgment obtained in,even though the underlying cause of action accrued before the amendment took effect.neither case supports the argument that final judgments qua final judgments play a special role in the retroactivity analysis.in int l fidelity,the fact that the judgment was final seems merely to have made the retroactivity analysis easier.in speidel,the statute in question dealt only with interest on final judgments.and while in that case the critical moment for purposes of determining retroactivity was the final judgment,the court reasoning revealed that it was not adopting a approach to retroactivity at.indeed,the cases cited by the estate do a better job of demonstrating the disutility of bright line rules in the retroactivity analysis than they do of advancing the estate case.see also peacock drew mun.separate sch,application of attorney fees provision would be impermissibly retroactive where the district court already acted in the first instance on the substantive claims in the case.
b.the language of the amendment does not support the estate argument 
the estate also advances two distinct arguments that the language of the statute explicitly spells out its intended retroactive effect.we are unconvinced.
the estate first argues that by indemnifying both present and former employees for conduct within the scope of the public employee employment,the legislature elucidate d the temporal application of the statute and indicated its intent that the amendment apply retroactively.appellant br.at.temporal yes,retroactive no.indeed,the code provision by its terms does apply to former public employees who commit civil rights violations within the scope of employment.the natural reading of this provision is that includes within its purview employees who engage in actionable conduct and then get fired or quit before a plaintiff files suit.the plain language is fatal to the estate argument because a plausible alternative construction exists,the estate proposed interpretation fails.lindh murphy,d retroactive application of a statute based on its language is appropriate only where the language is so clear that it can sustain only one interpretation see also sholes sholes,stating that courts must respect a statute plain language and finding no evidence that the legislature used an unusual or stylized meaning of a commonly understood word.bell.util.regulatory comm n,relying on the plain and obvious meaning of the words in a public utility statute 
moreover,the language that the estate emphasizes has been part of the statute for more than a quarter of a century.see.the amendment added only the defends or has the opportunity to defend language and mandated indemnification for compensatory damages.the rest of the language had been unchanged for decades that the estate leans so heavily on language that predated the amendment in making its retroactivity argument counsels against our accepting it,for it is difficult to swallow the argument that the legislature intended to give retroactive effect to the amendment by resorting to language that already resided in the indiana code.
the estate second textual argument also relies on reenacted language,and it too falls short of that which is required to gain retroactive effect.according to the estate,because section requires indemnification of a public employee who is or could be subject to personal civil liability,it applies to cases that were decided,and in which personal civil liability attached,prior to.the logic of the argument appears to be that if liability is predicated on a certain state of this case,a public employee being subject to that state of affairs existed when the amendment was enacted,then the legislature intended the law to apply in those cases.appellant br.at noting that the general assembly could have used shall to indicate prospective application.
there are many flaws with the estate argument.first,it simply ignores the presumption against retroactivity.the legislature use of a present tense verb,or predicating liability on the existence of a certain state of affairs,does not somehow reverse the presumption against retroactivity.see,bourbon,at,conceding that the language of the statute in question,which was worded in the present tense,did not demonstrate that the legislature meant for recovery to be retroactive.of envtl.mgmt.med.disposal,no retroactive effect to a definition state ex rel.state bd.of dental examiners judd,denying retroactive effect under circumstances logically equivalent to the estate argument in re hershman,same.the estate can not overcome the presumption against retroactivity simply by disregarding it.
nor is the argument rescued by the estate invocation of the rule against surplusage,which directs courts to give effect to each word used by the legislature.lincoln bank trust of fort wayne nathan,hatcher state.but see chickasaw nation united states,d noting that the canon is sometimes offset by the canon that permits a court to reject words as surplusage if inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to the rest of the statute quotation marks omitted.as noted above,section applies to an employee who is or could be subject to personal civil liability.the estate argues that,from the moment that the amendment was enacted,every public employee cum constitutional tortfeasor could be subject to personal civil liability.therefore,in order to avoid violating the rule against surplusage,the phrase is subject to personal civil liability must be read to refer to employees who were already liable at the time that the amendment was enacted.
the problem with the estate syllogism is that it ignores both the plain language and the structure of the statutory scheme.see sales state.ins.guar.ass davis,cautioning that interpretation should not overemphasize a strict literal or selective reading of individual words.statutory interpr
