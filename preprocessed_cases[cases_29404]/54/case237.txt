how does one enforce a civil judgment against a person protected by the witness security program congress,it turns out,answered this question in.that provision requires the attorney general to determine whether the protected person is making reasonable efforts to satisfy the judgment and establishes procedures for collecting the judgment if the person is failing to do so.in this case,the attorney general found that a protected person would make reasonable efforts to pay a judgment owed to appellant.dissatisfied,appellant sought to invoke one of section enforcement of a guardian to help collect the judgment.under these circumstances,the district court held,section does not authorize appointment of a guardian.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we agree.
on september,former chilean ambassador and foreign minister orlando letelier and his assistant ronni moffitt were assassinated as they drove to their office in washington,michael vernon townley,an american citizen and agent of chilean president augusto pinochet intelligence service,direcci√≥n de intelligencia nacional,admitted his complicity in the killings,testified in the criminal proceedings,and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to murder a foreign official.united states.sampol.after serving five years in prison,townley entered the witness security program wsp,commonly known as the witness protection program.through the wsp,the attorney general may relocate and protect witnesses whose safety is at risk.a.such protection may include the creation of a new identity.id.b a.
in the years following the two assassinations,townley involvement in various other crimes came to light.in particular,he was linked to the july torture and murder of carmelo soria espinoza soria,a united nations diplomat then living and working in chile.in november,soria widow,laura,along with the personal representative of soria estate,sued townley seeking damages for soria torture and killing.when townley defaulted,the district court entered a million judgment against him.kissinger,order for default judgment.
then asked the attorney general to help collect the judgment pursuant to.subsection a of that provision states that if a civil judgment is entered against a person enrolled in the wsp,the attorney general shall determine whether the protected person has made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment and shall urge the person to comply with the judgment.in language central to this case,subsection a states 
if the attorney general determines that the person has not made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment,the attorney general may,after considering the danger to the person and upon the request of the person holding the judgment disclose the identity and location of the person to the plaintiff entitled to recovery pursuant to the judgment.
in response to request,the united states marshals service informed townley that unless he took satisfactory steps to comply with the judgment,his identity and location could be disclosed pursuant to subsection a.townley responded with an affidavit describing his present assets,debts,income,and financial history.based on that affidavit,the wsp director,to whom the attorney general has delegated his authority on such issues,determined that it is not unreasonable for townley to pay per week toward the judgment.letter from stephen,director,department of justice witness security program,to jeffery johnson,dickstein shapiro llp june.townley agreed,but according to the director,rejected the arrangement and so has received no payments.although has a different view of what transpired,this disagreement is irrelevant to the statutory question we face here.
then sued townley and the attorney general in the united states district court for the district of columbia pursuant to section b,which provides that any person who holds a judgment against a wsp participant may,upon a decision by the attorney general to deny disclosure of the current identity and location of such protected person,bring an action against the protected person in the united states district court.if the petitioner in fact holds a judgment and if the court finds that the attorney general has declined to disclose to the petitioner the current identity and location of the protected person,then subsection b requires the court to appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the petitioner.b.the attorney general must then disclose to the guardian the protected person identity and location.id.
the attorney general moved to dismiss,arguing that subsection b makes a guardianship proceeding available only where the attorney general determines that the protected person is failing to make reasonable efforts to comply but,after considering the danger to the protected person,a,nonetheless declines to disclose the person identity and location.subsection b does not,the attorney general insisted,allow the to sue for the appointment of a guardian,where,as here,the attorney general finds that the protected person will make reasonable efforts to pay.
agreeing with the attorney general,the district court emphasized that the statute authorizes plaintiffs to bring this action only upon a decision by the attorney general to deny disclosure a decision,the district court held,the attorney general had no authority to make because a does not authorize disclosure unless the attorney general determines that townley has not made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment.townley,d,quoting b.having found that townley would make reasonable efforts,the attorney general had no choice,no discretion,no decision.id.at.because lack ed statutory authorization to bring this suit,the district court dismissed the case.id.
appeals,arguing that the district court misinterpreted the statute.we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss,see,piersall winter,as well as its resolution of this pure question of statutory interpretation,united states,see also murphy exploration and prod.dep t of interior,agency construction of a statute receives no deference where statute grants judicial power to the courts rather than administrative power to the agency.
as noted above,section b permits a to sue for the appointment of a guardian upon a decision by the attorney general to deny disclosure.because this case turns on the meaning of that phrase and its relationship to the process described in subsection a,we think it helpful to begin by quoting the relevant provisions of the statute in full 
a if a judgment is entered against a protected person the attorney general shall determine whether the person has made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment if the attorney general determines that the person has not made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment,the attorney general may,after considering the danger to the person and upon the request of the person holding the judgment disclose the identity and location of the person to the plaintiff entitled to recovery pursuant to the judgment 
b any person who holds a judgment entered by a federal or state court in his or her favor against a person provided protection under this chapter may,upon a decision by the attorney general to deny disclosure of the current identity and location of such protected person,bring an action against the protected person in the united states district court in the district where the person holding the judgment resides 
upon a determination a that the petitioner holds a judgment entered by a federal or state court and b that the attorney general has declined to disclose to the petitioner the current identity and location of the protected person against whom the judgment was entered,the court shall appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the petitioner to enforce the judgment the attorney general shall disclose to the guardian the current identity and location of the protected person and any other information necessary to enable the guardian to carry out his or her duties under this subsection 
the parties agree that the attorney general makes a decision to deny disclosure within the meaning of subsection b when he finds that the protected person is failin
