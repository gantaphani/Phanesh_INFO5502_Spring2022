on december,david menken menken filed a complaint in arizona state court alleging negligence,interference with contractual relations,civil extortion,and a violation of arizona revised statutes.tomerlin removed the case based on diversity of citizenship to the united states district court for the district of arizona on march,the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.
because we conclude that tomerlin had sufficient contacts with the state of arizona to warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
in his complaint,menken alleges that tomerlin obtained a judgment against menken in a case arising out of the united states district court for the district of nevada.in,tomerlin along with other judgment creditors obtained a judgment against menken for attorneys fees and costs totaling.menken never satisfied the judgment.between and,tomerlin incurred expenses and legal fees attempting to locate menken and his assets.on may,the judgment creditors recorded the nevada judgment against menken in maricopa county,arizona and established a lien on menken home there.
menken alleges that tomerlin then attempted to use the lien as leverage to extract more money from menken than was due under the nevada judgment.on august,tomerlin nevada attorney wrote to menken agent in arizona with a payoff demand for the judgment and interest,as well as costs and legal fees accrued attempting to locate menken,for a total demand of.menken attorney responded to the payoff demand by letter dated september,claiming the amount was too high and that menken did not have to pay the costs and legal fees.tomerlin then rejected menken proposal to pay the judgment and interest,but not the costs and legal fees,in a september,letter.menken counsel wrote to tomerlin attorney on october,advising that menken had a pending offer from a buyer to purchase his home in maricopa county,but could not complete the sale while tomerlin lien was in place.menken counsel wrote again on november,requesting that tomerlin release the judgment lien.the lien was not released and,according to menken,the sale of his home fell through.
menken filed a complaint on december,in arizona state court,later removed to the united states district court for the district of arizona,alleging negligence,interference with contractual relations,civil extortion,and a violation of on january,the district court granted tomerlin motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.
following the issuance of the january,order,no separate entry of judgment was filed.instead,on february,menken filed a motion to retain in rem jurisdiction over count four relating to.at the june,hearing on the motion,menken orally moved to amend the complaint.on june,the district court entered an order denying menken motion to retain in rem jurisdiction and denying his motion to amend the complaint.a separate document entering final judgment was filed on june.menken filed his notice of appeal on july.
on appeal,menken argues that the district court erred in finding that it did not have personal jurisdiction over tomerlin denying his motion to retain in rem jurisdiction and denying his motion to amend the complaint.tomerlin challenges the timeliness of menken notice of appeal.
we first address tomerlin argument that menken appeal is untimely.a notice of appeal must be filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.a judgment or order is entered as follows 
i if federal rule of civil procedure a does not require a separate document,when the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under federal rule of civil procedure a or 
ii if federal rule of civil procedure a requires a separate document,when the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket under federal rule of civil procedure a and when the earlier of these events occurs 
the judgment or order is set forth on a separate document,or 
days have run from entry of the judgment or order in the civil docket under federal rule of civil procedure a.
fed.a.federal rule of civil procedure a requires the january,order to be set forth in a separate document.see.a every judgment and amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document,except for orders disposing of motions which are not applicable here.therefore,the appeals window to file a notice of appeal began to run when the judgment or order was entered in the civil docket under federal rule of civil procedure a and when the earlier of these two events occurred the judgment or order was set forth on a separate document,or days had run from entry of the judgment or order in the civil docket.
no separate document was entered following the january,order.the parties agree that at the time the judgment was entered,more than days had run from entry of the january,order that is,days ran from the date of the january,order and the june,entry of judgment.
the parties dispute the window of time for filing a notice of appeal with respect to a judgment entered by operation of federal rule of appellate procedure a,when more than days have run from entry of the judgment or order in the civil docket.tomerlin argues that if more than days have passed from the entry of the order,the time to appeal that order has expired.menken correctly asserts that under federal rule of appellate procedure a plain language,judgment was entered after days,which then started the federal rule of appellate procedure a a appeals period.in other words,menken had days days plus days from entry of the order on january,in which to appeal.
menken filed his notice of appeal on july,which is days from the entry of the january,order.menken notice of appeal is therefore timely.
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo.see pebble beach caddy,cir.when a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant.see harris rutsky.ins,bell clements,cir.however,this showing requires that the plaintiff make only a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts to withstand the motion to dismiss.doe unocal,cir internal citations omitted.although the plaintiff can not simply rest on the bare allegations of its complaint,schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir quoting amba mktg,jobar int l,cir,uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken as true.id.citing at t compagnie bruxelles lambert,cir.the court resolves all disputed facts in favor of the plaintiff.pebble beach,at.
legal framework for personal jurisdiction analysis 
we first outline the legal framework for our personal jurisdiction analysis.
when no federal statute specifically defines the extent of personal jurisdiction,we look to the law of the state where the district court this case,arizona.arizona rule permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the extent allowed by the due process clause of the united states constitution.
ce,llc new sensor,cir internal citations and quotation signals omitted.
a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant consistent with due process only if he or she has certain minimum contacts with the relevant forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.unless a defendant contacts with a forum are so substantial,continuous,and systematic that the defendant can be deemed to be present in that forum for all purposes,a forum may exercise only specific is,jurisdiction based on the relationship between the defendant forum contacts and plaintiff claims.the parties agree that general jurisdiction does not exist here only specific jurisdiction is at issue.
we analyze specific jurisdiction according to a test 
the defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws 
the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant activities and 
the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice,it must be reasonable.
schwarzenegger,at quoting lake lake,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of satisfying the first two prongs of the test.if the plaintiff fails to satisfy either of these prongs,personal jurisdiction is not established in the forum state.id.internal citation omitted.on the other hand,if the plaintiff succeeds in satisfying both of the first two prongs,the burden then shifts to the defendant to present a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.id.quoting burger king rudzewicz,d.
we next elaborate on the three prongs of our personal jurisdiction analysis purposeful availment and direction conduct and reasonableness.
purposeful availment and direction 
the proper application of the first prong is contested in this case.this prong includes both purposeful availment and purposeful direction.it may be satisfied by purposeful availment of the privilege of doing business in the forum by purposeful direction of activities at the forum or by some combination thereof.la ligue contre le racisme et,cir en banc.outlined the contours of purposeful availment and direction in tort and contract cases 
we have typically treated purposeful availment somewhat differently in tort and contract cases.in tort cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully directs his activities at the forum state,applying an effects test that focuses on the forum in which the defendant actions were felt,whether or not the actions themselves occurred within the forum.see schwarzenegger,at citing calder jones,d.by contrast,in contract cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities or consummates a transaction in the forum,focusing on activities such as delivering goods or executing a contract.see schwarzenegger,at.
id.brackets omitted.
menken argues that the district court erred by failing to employ the effects test for tort claims as set forth in calder jones,d.in calder,a entertainer sued for an allegedly defamatory article published by defendants.the article had been written and edited in florida,and the defendants had few contacts with california.the court upheld the exercise of personal jurisdiction in california because the defendants knew that the article would have an effect there.calder held that the defendants had not engaged in mere untargeted negligence rather,their intentional,and allegedly tortious,actions were expressly aimed at california.calder,at.brackets omitted.
we construe calder effects test to impose three requirements the defendant allegedly must have committed an intentional act,expressly aimed at the forum state,causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state,at.
in a specific jurisdiction inquiry,we consider the extent of the defendant contacts with the forum and the degree to which the plaintiff suit is related to those contacts.a strong showing on one axis will permit a lesser showing on the other.a single forum state contact can support jurisdiction if the cause of action arises out of that particular purposeful contact of the defendant with the forum state.id.at internal citation,quotation signals,ellipses,and brackets omitted.
under the second prong of our personal jurisdiction analysis,the plaintiff claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant activities.in determining whether menken claims arise out of tomerlin conduct,the ninth circuit follows the but for test.myers bennett law offices,cir.hence,menken must show that he would not have suffered an injury but for tomerlin conduct.
reasonableness 
the third prong examines whether the exercise of the jurisdiction would be reasonable.
we consider the following seven factors when making this determination the extent of the defendants purposeful interjection into the forum state affairs the burden on the defendant of defending in the forum the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendants state the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy the importance of the forum to the plaintiff interest in convenient and effective relief and the existence of an alternative forum.
ce,at internal citation omitted.
with this framework in mind,we turn to menken claims against tomerlin 
purposeful availment and direction the effects test 
the district court recited our test for personal jurisdiction,but did not clearly indicate that it was employing the effects test as to the first prong.because menken complaint alleges negligence,wrongful interference with contractual relations,civil extortion,and a violation of,his cause of action arises primarily in tort therefore,calder effect test is the proper framework for the first prong purposeful availment and direction analysis.under this analysis,menken has alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the three requirements of the effects test.the court addresses each of the test three elements in turn.
intentional act 
menken alleges that tomerlin committed an intentional act by intentionally interfering with his contractual relation with a third party for the pending sale of his property that tomerlin demanded a sum of money in excess of the lawful amount due under the judgment and that tomerlin intentionally violated by recording an invalid lien.
expressly aimed at arizona 
second,menken alleges that tomerlin intentional conduct was expressly aimed at the forum state because the act of trying to extract the judgment payoff was aimed at tying up menken real property located in arizona.the requirement is satisfied when the defendant is alleged to have engaged in wrongful conduct targeted at a plaintiff whom the defendant knows to be a resident of the forum state.dole food,watts,cir internal citation and quotation signals omitted.menken sufficiently alleges that tomerlin engaged in wrongful conduct targeted at menken,whom tomerlin knew to be a resident of arizona.
causing harm tomerlin knew would be suffered in arizona 
finally,menken alleged that the action caused harm that tomerlin knew was likely to be suffered in arizona.the complaint alleges that menken told tomerlin that title to his arizona property was clouded by the allegedly invalid judgment lien and that he could not sell the property with the lien in place.when tomerlin improperly recorded the lien in arizona and then refused to accept the legally owed amount as full satisfaction of the lien,tomerlin caused harm knowing that it would be suffered in arizona.
menken has sufficiently alleged the three requirements of the effects test and has met his burden as to the first prong.
the second prong of the analysis is easily met.menken alleges that he would not have suffered an injury but for tomerlin conduct.assuming menken allegations as true,menken was unable to close on the sale of his arizona property because tomerlin recorded the lien on the property,demanded a sum in excess of that lawfully due under the nevada judgment,and refused to remove the lien.menken tort claims arise out of tomerlin demand for an amount greater than awarded by the nevada judgment in arizona.
although tomerlin alleged contacts with arizona are not extensive,a single forum state contact can support jurisdiction if the cause of action arises out of that particular purposeful contact of the defendant with the forum state,at internal citation,quotation signals,and ellipses omitted.menken has satisfied the first two prongs the burden thus shifts to tomerlin to show that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.
reasonableness 
we next balance the seven reasonableness factors 
the extent of the defendant purposeful interjection into the forum state affairs the burden on the defendant of defending in the forum the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendants state the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy the importance of
