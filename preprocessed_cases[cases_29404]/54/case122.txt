the laborers pension funds won a default judgment against king construction,and king larsen construction,as well as against mike king,a director and officer of both companies.those defendants were judgment proof,so the funds added new defendants in an amended complaint.the district court found some of the new defendants,lord essex,and the lay not john popp,an on a theory,and granted summary judgment to the funds and to popp.we affirm the decision to pierce king veil to reach and lord essex,and we affirm the dismissal of popp from suit.the lay trust,however,played no role in the transactions that rendered and lord essex liable,nor did it wield control over king.we therefore reverse with respect to the lay trust and dismiss it from the case.
the question before us arises from the close relationship among several construction companies located just outside chicago.those companies included king larsen,a unionized subcontractor that did excavation work and poured foundations and driveways for residential properties.mike king was king larsen sole shareholder and a director and officer.lord essex is a residential housing contractor that regularly hired king larsen to work on its job sites.is a developer of commercial and residential real estate.
lord essex and are owned by the popp family.more precisely,lord essex is owned by john popp and was previously owned by the lay trust.is still owned by the lay trust,which otherwise exists for the benefit of the popps.john popp and his wife were the trust primary beneficiaries popp and his sister are secondary beneficiaries and,since popp death in the midst of this litigation.popp was the president and a director of both and lord essex.popp remains a director and officer in both companies.
in,king larsen entered a collective bargaining agreement that required it to make monthly benefits contributions and payments of union dues to the funds.late in,king larsen began missing payments the company was suffering financially,and lord essex and began loaning it money and paying some of its bills meanwhile,popp and king began plans for a new company called king construction that would take over king larsen business.popp companies were to provide new financing for king in exchange for a position on king larsen assets.
king was incorporated on march,with the popps and king as directors.the directors elected king as president and treasurer,and king wife gail as vice president and secretary.the directors also resolved to issue shares of stock to the gak irrevocable living trust in exchange for a promissory note from the trust for.both sides agree,however,that the shares were never issued and the capital contribution was never made.this turns out to be critical.no other capital contributions were made to king.to be sure,king did receive other types of financing,but all of it was debt.on april,king received a loan from,secured by king assets and mike king personal guaranty also on april,king board with mike king abstaining entered into an employment agreement with king,setting his salary and prohibiting him from spending more than on behalf of king other than for taxes and payroll without consent.king was authorized to enter into banking relationships,but prohibited from borrowing on the corporation behalf without written consent.
at the center of the plans of popp and king for the creation of king is a series of transactions visually represented by chart that circuitously transferred most of king larsen assets to king.as described in detail below,those assets traveled first through lord essex and.the defendants have cast these transactions as a service to mike king,but popp arranged the transfer of assets through his companies so that and lord essex could obtain priority on them before they were transferred on to king.mike king agreed to the transactions because popp promised to release a junior mortgage on the house of king mother,doralee.the defendants thus clearly believed they stood to benefit from the deal.
turning to the series of transactions at the heart of the case,the first occurred on april,when king larsen and lord essex executed an assignment of collateral and satisfaction of debt.in this agreement,king larsen assigned all of its assets to lord essex,including million in receivables,in work in progress,worth of shop materials,and perhaps worth of vehicles and heavy equipment.in exchange,lord essex released king larsen from debts of about and assumed million in accounts payable and in other notes owed by king larsen.as even the defendants concede,n otably,lord essex declined to assume king larsen tax liabilities and king larsen obligations to the funds.those liabilities remained in king larsen otherwise empty shell.king larsen dissolved on july.
the second set of transactions also took place on april.lord essex borrowed from to pay off the outstanding debts it had acquired from king larsen,observing corporate formalities when it did so the companies executed security agreements and promissory notes for the amounts borrowed.lord essex and then executed their own assignment agreement,whereby lord essex satisfied its nascent obligations to by transferring king larsen assets on to.again the companies observed corporate formalities.both sides agree that lord essex was merely a conduit between king larsen and,which had funded lord essex acquisition from king larsen in the first place.
on may,the final transaction occurred.and king entered a master lease and assignment agreement,in which leased to king the vehicles and equipment formerly owned by king larsen these are the assets the defendants valued at,supra and assigned to king all of king larsen other assets and liabilities.the assignment included the million in king larsen receivables,the in work in progress and the in shop materials,as well as the million in accounts payable and the in other notes.in exchange,king agreed to make monthly payments of to starting june and continuing through may.king also agreed to pay an operations fee of of its profits every other month starting july,with interest payable on unpaid balances.the master lease and assignment agreement also contained a distribution restriction also incorporated in mike king employment contract,prohibiting king from making any payments except taxes and payroll to third parties greater than without consent.
king never made any of the payments required under the master lease and assignment agreement,nor did it make payments on the april loan from.nonetheless continued to loan king money.between april and october,made another in payments to king and its creditors,all subject to mike king guaranty and the security agreement applicable to the april loan.the lay trust also issued five checks to king between april and august,totaling.there is no corresponding note or other documentation covering these lay trust payments to king in the record.the lay trust also issued a check to king larsen in october for.as further evidence of the various companies interrelatedness,lord essex made two payments in august for prior king larsen to king under the master lease and assignment to king but instead to the lay trust.also made at least one payment to king for work performed for lord essex.
throughout the summer of,king operated in king larsen stead,picking up its contracts and operating out of the same yard and office,using the same fax and telephone number,the same employees,the same equipment.that summer mike king also began making payments to the funds for king larsen obligations.recall that he had personally guaranteed an installment note for unpaid contributions in february.see supra.but king made those payments,totaling about,from king accounts,not from his personal account or from any account of the defunct king larsen.moreover,king paid only a fraction of the amount king larsen owed the funds at the time.in august,the funds sued king larsen,king and mike king for the outstanding balance.
in september,mike king entered a new collective bargaining agreement on king behalf,incurring new obligations to the funds.the popps viewed mike king payments to the funds and the new union contract as violations of the distribution restriction in the master lease and assignment agreement.as a result,the popps resigned from king board,and filed its own suit against mike king and king,which led to a default judgment that apparently remains unsatisfied.king continued working for lord essex until december.king was dissolved in early.the funds lawsuit resulted in two more default judgments,against king larsen,king and mike king,and the funds amended their complaint to add the current defendants.the funds also added gail and doralee king as defendants,but they were voluntarily dismissed after the district court ruled on the parties summary judgment motions.on for summary judgment,the district court found,lord essex and the lay trust liable on a theory for,the amount that the district court found that king and king larsen collectively owed the funds.the district court found that popp was not individually liable and dismissed him from the suit.this appeal followed.
the only issue here is whether it was appropriate to pierce king veil to reach each of the defendants is an equitable remedy governed by state law,here the law of illinois because that is where all of the corporations at issue were incorporated.we have jurisdiction by virtue of the funds original claim for relief under erisa,e and.see.because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,our review is de novo,v.the pepper source,cir.and though the decision whether to disregard the corporate form to impose liability is,see freeland enodis,cir,here the material facts are not in dispute,making resolution on summary judgment appropriate.
a corporation exists separately from its shareholders,officers,directors and related corporations,and those individuals and entities ordinarily are not subject to corporate liabilities.see fontana tld builders,d.indeed,one of the primary purposes of incorporation is to limit liability and thereby encourage investment.an exception exists when an individual or entity uses a corporation merely as an instrumentality to conduct that person or entity business.id.at.then a court may pierce the corporate veil,and the individual or entity may be charged for the underlying cause of action.see id.at,at van dorn future chem.and oil,cir.the point is to prevent those who disregard the corporate form from then relying on it to avoid liability for their wrongdoing.
the standard test for piercing the corporate veil is.the plaintiff must demonstrate both that there is such unity of interest and ownership between the individual or entity and the corporation that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual or entity no longer exist,and that adherence to the fiction of separate corporate existence would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.hystro,mnp,cir quoting van dorn,at.
courts consider a laundry list of factors to determine whether there is a unity of interest between two corporations or between a corporation and a controlling shareholder or other dominant personality,fontana,at,but the focus is on whether the corporations have respected corporate their separateness from each whether one was a sham acting at the whim of the other.see judson atkinson candies,dhimantec,cir.
likewise,the rule for determining when respecting the corporate form would sanction fraud or promote injustice is not clearcut,see hystro,at discussing,and van dorn,but i f a corporation is organized and carries on business without substantial capital in such a way that the corporation is likely to have no sufficient assets available to meet its debts,that is sufficient,because it is inequitable that shareholders set up such a flimsy organization to escape personal liability.hystro,at quoting stap chicago aces tennis team,d,further quoting ballantine on corporations ed.
taking the defendants here one at a time,we find that controlled king purse strings,if not its operations,and that it did so at least in part to avoid king and king larsen pension benefit and union dues obligations,and therefore that it was appropriate to pierce king veil in order to hold liable for those obligations.the master lease and assignment agreement explicitly restricted king from entering any material transactions with third parties without consent.likewise,mike king employment agreement prohibited him from entering into such transactions on behalf of the company without written consent from.the kind of control exerted by over king is what is meant when the cases talk about a dominating personality,fontana,at,that directs another entity at its whim.
to be sure,king is not the clearest case of a sham corporation that one might conceive.sham corporations can be mere figments,little more than corporate names held up like picket signs by an individual who is individually responsible for the putative corporation actions.in fontana,for instance,tld builders,was just a cloak for nicola dicosola,the husband of the nominal sole shareholder.dicosola testified that tld had never had an employee and that he had never kept records of his dealings with subcontractors,at.at the time of suit,dicosola had poured all of tld profits into another company.id.any capital that had been contributed to tld in the first place which,at most,was had come from the dicosolas personal bank accounts.id.by contrast,when the funds here filed suit in august,king was a functioning corporation,performing jobs for lord essex.it had assets and employees and contracts.
but king never operated separately and independently from.the popps were on king board the master lease and assignment agreement prevented king from entering material transactions without consent and no stock in king was ever issued.likewise these companies did not engage in arm length relations.king never made its required payments on the april loan or under the master lease and assignment agreement,but continued to extend it credit anyway.in a very real sense,then,king was completely subject to control and to no other.we agree with the district court that was king de facto principal.
aside from these indicia of corporate form and control,undercapitalization is the single most important factor in the analysis.see william hackney tracey benson,shareholder liability for inadequate capital,pitt.assessing whether a corporation is adequately capitalized is delicate business.the legal the corporation has so little money that it can not operate its business on its own,see judson atkinson candies,at indus.of,ter maat,cir provides little in the way of specifics.what does it mean for a corporation to operate on its own very generally,it means that the corporation has adequate equity usually in addition to debt,though how much equity depends on the facts of the case this makes software designer has different equity needs than a car in the right case a fight about undercapitalization could easily preclude summary judgment.what is clear,though,is that there must be some equity.shareholders are generally expected to invest some money,that is,if they want the benefit of limited liability.see fontana,at s hareholders should in good faith put at the risk of the business unencumbered capital reasonably adequate for the corporation prospective liabilities.citing fiumetto garrett,d,emphasis added.
the defendants argue that it is impossible to tell from this record whether king had enough capital to meet its prospective liabilities,because nothing shows its cash needs or obligations.yet this argument confuses king working capital that portion of a firm assets that are in relatively liquid form,such as cash,accounts receivable and inventory with its equity capital the excess of total assets over total is called unencumbered capital in fontana.undercapitalization is primarily concerned with unencumbered or equity capital,see lifschultz fast freight appeal of salson express,cir,also called capital,describing the investment made by the shareholders at the establishment of a corporation,fentress triple mining,d.again,this is because is an exception to limited liability,and,under the doctrine of limited liability,shareholders only risk the equity capital that they invest.see frank easterbrook daniel fischel,limited
