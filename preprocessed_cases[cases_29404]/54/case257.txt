in the years since lisec,the internal revenue service irs and the vast majority of federal appellate courts have broadly interpreted the applicable internal revenue code irc provisions as requiring an employer to withhold payroll taxes for all wages arising from the relationship,even after that relationship has terminated.persuaded by these authorities,we adopt this prevailing view and conclude costco properly withheld the payroll taxes.the judgment having been satisfied,we reverse the trial court order and remand with instructions.
factual and procedural background 
while employed by costco,cifuentes observed a manager hugging a female employee outside the store.he reported the incident to a supervisor.six months later,the manager reported seeing cifuentes surreptitiously sip three ounces of a beverage sold by costco.costco terminated cifuentes employment for violating its policy against grazing,consuming food merchandise without payment.

when costco paid the judgment,it withheld in payroll taxes from the attributed to lost wages.the taxes included federal income contribution act fica contributions,federal and state income taxes and state disability insurance.maintaining it was required by law to withhold the taxes,costco informed cifuentes it had fully satisfied the judgment.
initially,cifuentes claimed that interest of was still owed.costco disputed this,but paid the and demanded that cifuentes acknowledge full satisfaction of the judgment.cifuentes again declined,pointing to the sixth appellate district decision in lisec,supra,th at page,that an award of lost wages to a former employee is not subject to withholding.he asserted costco should have paid him the full judgment amount,issued a tax form for the lost wages and allowed him to pay any taxes due directly to the taxing authorities.cifuentes filed an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction in the amount of.
in a series of letters,the parties disputed whether lisec was controlling.costco cited a number of contrary irs and federal case authorities and highlighted the admonishment in a respected california practice guide that e mployers should not rely on lisec,supra.the opinion does not cite or mention contrary federal cases on what is basically an issue of federal tax law.chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation the rutter group,cal.rutter employment guide accord,rosen et,cal.practice guide federal employment litigation the rutter group,fed.rutter employment guide.costco further noted that cifuentes own financial expert,pamela allman,testified that any compensation for lost past or future wages would be subject to payroll taxes,including social security,medicare,and s tate disability insurance.

citing a number of federal appellate decisions,irs authorities and treatises,costco argued lisec was wrongly decided and that prevailing law supported the withholding.the trial court acknowledged that m uch of what costco argues is compelling,and stated that i f the court were to rule on this issue in the first instance,it might be inclined to rule in costco favor.suggesting the issue may need to be decided by a higher court,the court determined it had no choice but to follow lisec as the only california appellate decision on point and consequently denied the motion.it found costco still owes cifuentes the withheld for fica and state disability insurance,plus interest on that sum and possibly on the income tax withholdings that eventually were refunded.the court questioned whether interest is due on the amounts withheld for income taxes actually owed,but concluded i n any event,the judgment has not been fully satisfied.it denied cifuentes request for in attorney fees based on his failure to submit a declaration providing evidence of those fees.costco appeals.
discussion 
the principal issue on appeal is whether an employer is required to withhold payroll taxes when paying a judgment to a former employee for lost past wages back pay and lost future wages front pay.back pay is the amount of wages the employee would have earned from the date of termination up to the time of the court award or settlement but for the employer misconduct.noel new york state office of mental health central new york psychiatric center cir,noel.front pay is money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.pollard du pont de nemours.
costco contends the award of back and front pay to cifuentes constituted wages under the applicable federal and state tax laws and,as such,was subject to mandatory withholding.it claims that if it had paid the judgment without deducting the taxes,it could have been held personally liable for them.cifuentes responds that under lisec,supra,th at page,the judgment must be satisfied in the amount as written.he concedes the award was taxable to him as income,but maintains the withholding was unlawful because the award was not remuneration for services performed by him on costco behalf.
the trial court determined it was bound by lisec under principles of stare decisis.see auto equity sales,superior court cal d.although we review the decision of a sister court with respect,if we disagree with its conclusion,we are not so bound.greyhound lines,county of santa clara d,see in re jaime cal th,r eexamination of precedent may become necessary when subsequent developments indicate an earlier decision was unsound,or has become ripe for reconsideration.our review of current irs and federal decisional authorities persuades us that an employer who fails to withhold payroll taxes from an award of back or front pay to a former employee exposes itself to penalties and personal liability for those taxes.we therefore decline to follow lisec and adopt instead the prevailing federal view.

we review de novo the trial court interpretation of the meaning and scope of federal statutory law.kanter warner lambert th.if the united states supreme court has not provided guidance on an issue of federal law and there is a division of opinion or conflict among the federal courts,state courts may make an independent determination of federal law.alicia county of los angeles d.the decisions of the federal appellate and district courts are accorded great weight,though they are not binding.ibid.
pre interpretation of applicable tax laws 
the irc requires employers to collect income and fica taxes by withholding them from wages paid to employees.a,a maxfield united states postal service cir.california law similarly requires employers to withhold state income and disability insurance taxes.unemp.uic,subd.a.an employer who fails to withhold such taxes may be held liable for those taxes plus penalties and interest.b,uic.the failure to withhold taxes also is punishable as a crime.felony uic,misdemeanor.in addition,even if the tax is later paid,an employer who fails to withhold is subject to liability for penalties and other statutory additions.d see cheetham csx transportation wl,cheetham.
the irc and uic define wages for income tax withholding purposes as all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his or her employer.a uic.the irc describes wages for fica social security and medicare withholding as all remuneration for employment,and defines employment as any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him.a,b.given the similarity in the statutory definitions of wages,they are interpreted in the same manner.rowan united states,tax statutes favor consistent definition of wages for both fica and income tax withholding purposes see mcknight ranch,franchise tax bd.th,fn.when federal and state tax statutes are identical,as they are here,federal decisions are particularly compelling in interpreting state tax law.douglas state of california d,estate of darby d.
social sec.bd.nierotko nierotko,considered whether an award of back pay to a wrongfully terminated employee constitutes wages for social security purposes.the employee was reinstated and awarded pay for the period he was not employed.id.at.the united states supreme court held the award constituted wages under the social security act definitions which define wages as remuneration for employment and employment as any service performed by an employee for his employer.id.at see a,b.the court rejected the argument the award did not qualify as wages because no services had been performed.it explained that wages and employment should be interpreted broadly the very words any service performed for his employer,with the purpose of the social security act in mind import breadth of coverage.they admonish us against holding that service can be only productive activity.we think that service as used by congress in this definitive phrase means not only work actually done but the entire relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.nierotko,at,italics added,fn.omitted.
emphasizing nierotko broad construction of wages,the federal court of claims similarly approved the deduction of fica taxes from an award of back pay to an employee who was wrongfully terminated and then reinstated to his position.ainsworth united states,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in markey united states fed.cl.because the employee had been reinstated,the court found it unnecessary to address the problems which may arise if an employee is not reinstated at any time.id.at.
in,the irs ruled that a payment of three weeks pay to a discharged employee in settlement of a discrimination claim constituted wages for purposes of fica and income tax withholding.rul.it noted that under the applicable employment tax regulations,remuneration for employment constitutes wages even though the individual is no longer an employee at the time paid,and for purposes of income tax withholding,that all payments made by an employee on account of dismissal,that is,involuntary separation from the service of the employer,constitute wages regardless of whether the employer is legally bound by contract,statute,or otherwise to make the payments,citing a b,i,b i,and a a.
when lisec came before the court in,there was little additional decisional guidance on the scope of wages as defined in the tax statutes.the plaintiffs,who had prevailed on their wrongful termination claim,obtained an award of contract damages that included back and front pay.lisec,supra,th at.their former employer withheld payroll taxes,claiming the award constituted wages under federal and state law.id.at.when the plaintiffs maintained the judgment was not satisfied,the employer moved for an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment,as permitted by section the trial court denied the motion,finding the employer lacked statutory authority to unilaterally reduce the judgment by withholding taxes.lisec,at.
in affirming the decision,the court of appeal distinguished nierotko and ainsworth on the basis that the employees in those cases were reinstated.lisec,supra,th at.it observed the damages awarded to the plaintiffs did not redress deprivation of compensation earned or due for services already performed within the context of an ongoing employment relationship.ibid.in the absence of such a relationship,the court held the award did not constitute remuneration for services performed,and thus was not wages for purposes of withholding.ibid.
post lisec interpretation of applicable tax laws 
in the years since lisec,numerous federal courts have considered whether an award of back or front pay to a employee is subject to taxation and withholding.with the exception of the fifth circuit see dotson united states cir,federal appellate courts have adopted nierotko broad interpretation of wages for taxation and withholding purposes.in gerbec united states cir,gerbec,the sixth circuit concluded that a portion of a settlement award of back and front pay in a class action brought by former employees of continental can company continental was subject to both income and fica taxes.it explained the phrase remuneration for employment as it appears in irc should be interpreted broadly.citations.we hold that the phrase remuneration for employment includes certain compensation in the relationship for which no actual services were performed the holding in nierotko clearly supports the conclusion that awards representing a loss in wages,both back wages and future wages,that otherwise would have been paid,reflect compensation paid to the employee because of the relationship,regardless of whether the employee actually worked during the time period in question.
the fourth and eighth circuits reached the same conclusion in two other continental settlement cases.hemelt united states cir,hemelt mayberry united states cir,mayberry.they,along with gerbec,rejected dotson united states,supra,at page,an earlier continental settlement case which held that front pay was not subject to wage taxation because it was not for services already performed.gerbec,supra,at,fn.hemelt,at,mayberry,at see noel,supra,at,fn.
in rivera baker west,cir,rivera,the ninth circuit concluded that payroll taxes had to be withheld from an award of lost wages arising from settlement of a wrongful termination claim.citing gerbec,hemelt and mayberry,the court determined that even though the plaintiff was no longer employed,his claim arose from the relationship,and that it would be improper to exempt him from tax withholding merely because the payment was not in return for actual services performed.rivera,at see gerbec,supra,at a i.it emphasized that the employer could have been held liable to the taxing authorities for failing to withhold the requisite taxes and that the plaintiff could seek a refund for any excess withholding.rivera,at.
cifuentes contends these cases are distinguishable because they involved a settlement of claims,rather than an adjudicated award of lost wages.it is well established,however,that whether a claim is resolved through litigation or settlement,the nature of the underlying action determines the tax consequences of the resolution of the claim.tribune pub.united states cir,sager glove,the taxability of the proceeds of a lawsuit,or of a sum received in settlement thereof,depends upon the nature of the claim and the actual basis of recovery,affd.cir.cifuentes cites no case law suggesting an award of back or front pay for breach of an employment contract should be treated differently for tax purposes because it arose from a judgment rather than a settlement.
noel illustrates this point.a jury awarded the plaintiff back and front pay as damages for wrongful termination.noel,supra,at.the former employer withheld federal and state payroll taxes on both sums.as in this case,the trial court determined the judgment was not satisfied.id.at.the irs maintained in amicus briefing that the decision unfairly pe
