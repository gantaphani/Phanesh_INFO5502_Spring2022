this appeal compels us to wend our way through a tangled record,and leads us to an unexpected destination.because the history of the case informs our decision,we start there.
the litigation that underlies this appeal had its genesis in an unspeakably tragic incident that occurred in fajardo,puerto rico,on december.the grisly details are chronicled in an earlier opinion,see whitfield mel√©ndez rivera whitfield i,cir,and no useful purpose would be served by rehearsing them now.for present purposes,it suffices to say that a young man,justin lee whitfield,was shot and seriously wounded,without sufficient justification,by two fajardo police officers acting in the course of their employment and under color of law.
in due course,whitfield sued in the federal district court,under,for compensatory and punitive damages.his father and mother joined the suit as plaintiffs they asserted derivative claims under local law.see laws ann.tit.the suit named as defendants the two police officers,the police commissioner,the municipality of fajardo the municipality,and the mayor of fajardo.the plaintiffs premised the liability of the parties upon alleged failures i to adopt appropriate regulations anent police officers use of force and ii to train officers properly in the use of force.
following a trial,a jury found all the defendants liable and awarded whitfield in compensatory damages against the defendants,jointly and severally.the jury simultaneously awarded each of his parents in compensatory damages.finally,the jury awarded punitive damages in favor of whitfield as follows against each of the police officers against the police commissioner and against the mayor.each punitive award ran against the specified defendant in his individual capacity.
on appeal,a panel of this court upheld the liability finding against the two police officers,whitfield i,at,but deemed the compensatory damage awards excessive,id.at.to remedy this defect,the panel vacated the awards and remanded with instructions to convene a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages unless whitfield agreed to remit all compensatory damages in excess of and his parents agreed to remit all compensatory damages in excess of apiece.id.at.
the other defendants fared better.the panel determined that liability had not been established against any of them.id.at.consequently,the panel vacated the verdicts against the police commissioner,the municipality,and the mayor in their entirety mandate issued on january.
on remand,the plaintiffs agreed to the remittiturs proposed in whitfield i.the district court entered amended judgments in those amounts against the two police officers.see whitfield municipality of fajardo,civ,slip op.at,unpublished.
at this juncture,an idiosyncratic puerto rico indemnity law,laws ann.tit,came front and center.this statute,familiarly known as law,provides generally albeit subject to various limitations that a public official or employee current or former,of either the commonwealth of puerto rico or a municipality,may request the commonwealth to assume the payment of any judgment that may be entered against his person.id.upon the receipt of such a request,the commonwealth secretary of justice the secretary shall determine whether it is in order to pay the full judgment imposed on the public official.id.see,cir.if the secretary decides that payment is in order,the public official employer must pay the indemnity from its available funds.laws ann.tit.if those funds are insufficient,the balance is paid by the commonwealth.id.
local police officers are public employees within the ambit of law.see id,identifying members and former members of the municipal police corps as covered persons.with that in mind,the defendant police officers requested indemnity.
on february,the secretary issued a resolution the resolution directing that payment of the amended judgments be effected out of the municipality available funds.see id.the balance,if any,would be payable by the commonwealth.id.
this arrangement suited the plaintiffs,who wished to collect the amended judgments and saw the public coffers as a salubrious source of satisfaction.since the municipality had been a party to the action from its inception,the plaintiffs asked the district court to implement the resolution and enforce the amended judgments against the municipality qua indemnitor.the municipality strenuously objected.
in entertaining the plaintiffs motion,the court apparently invoked its ancillary enforcement jurisdiction.that jurisdiction is implemented through rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides in pertinent part that the procedure on execution must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located.under this rule,state law governs not only the parties substantive rights but also the procedure to be followed see gabovitch lundy,cir.the relevant state law is that of the state in which the federal district court sits.see wright,miller marcus,federal practice procedure ed.
the district court initially indicated a willingness to oblige the plaintiffs.it ordered the municipality,pursuant to the resolution,to hold the officers harmless by paying the plaintiffs from available funds to the extent practicable.see whitfield municipality of fajardo,civ,slip op.at may,unpublished.the court theorized that this procedure would be consistent with law and that the commonwealth would pay the balance.see id.at citing laws ann.tit.yet that order was patently.for example,the court stopped short of either quantifying a fixed amount to be paid by the municipality or establishing a deadline for payment.in an effort to thwart the plaintiffs collection efforts,the municipality instituted an action in the puerto rico court of first instance.its complaint,filed a few days before the may order issued,sought to nullify the resolution.the secretary resisted this initiative.
in the days that followed the may order,the municipality pressed ahead in the district court and,among other things,asked the court to abstain from definitively resolving the indemnification question.the whitfields were not parties to the municipality suit in the court of first instance.nevertheless,they beseeched the district court to ignore that suit on the ground that the municipality lacked standing to challenge the resolution 
on june,the court of first instance granted a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the resolution.that very day,the municipality asked the district court to stay its rule a proceedings pending a full adjudication of the validity of the resolution in the puerto rico courts.the district court refused to grant a stay.see whitfield municipality of fajardo,civ,slip op.at june,unpublished.again,however,the court stopped short of enforcing the amended judgments.
the denouement occurred on november.on that date the district court,despite its original inclination,spurned an enforcement order.instead,it ordered the municipality to deposit the monies needed to satisfy the amended total of plus the registry of the district court by a date certain.see whitfield municipality of fajardo,civ,slip op.at,unpublished.the court decreed a rolling fine of per day for noncompliance with the deposit deadline.the municipality staved off any such fines by posting a supersedeas bond in a form and amount approved by the district court.
during the currency of this appeal,the court of first instance declared the resolution void.municipality of fajardo sec y of justice,civ.no,slip op.at,unpublished certified translation.on the date of oral argument in this court march,the appeal period pertaining to that judgment was still open.
with this background in place,we turn to the task at hand.the parties have served up a salmagundi of issues relating to,among other things,the scope of the district court ancillary enforcement jurisdiction,the impact of the mandate in whitfield i on the municipality status as a party,the effect of principles of abstention and comity,and the appropriateness of the manner in which the district court has thus far exercised its discretion.we can not partake of that fare because we have come to conclude that we lack
