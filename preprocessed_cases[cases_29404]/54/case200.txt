a majority of the en banc court judge fletcher,joined by chief judge schroeder and judges hawkins,fisher,gould,paez,clifton,and bea concludes that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants.of that majority,three judges chief judge schroeder,and judges fletcher and gould conclude that the action should be dismissed for lack of ripeness.five judges judge fisher,joined by judges hawkins,paez,clifton,and bea conclude that the case is ripe for adjudication.the three remaining judges judges ferguson,and tashima conclude that the action should be dismissed because the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants.
a majority of the en banc court having voted therefor,the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the action without prejudice.
an american internet service provider,brought suit in federal district court in diversity against la ligue contre le racisme et licra and des etudiants juifs de france uejf seeking a declaratory judgment that two interim orders by a french court are unrecognizable and unenforceable.the district court held that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf was proper,that the dispute was ripe,that abstention was unnecessary,and that the french orders are not enforceable in the united states because such enforcement would violate the first amendment.the district court did not reach the question whether the orders are recognizable.licra and uejf appeal only the personal jurisdiction,ripeness,and abstention holdings.a majority of the en banc panel holds,as explained in part ii of this opinion,that the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf.a plurality of the panel concludes,as explained in part iii of this opinion,that the case is not ripe under the criteria of abbott laboratories gardner,d.we do not reach the abstention question.
background 
is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in california.through its united website,makes available a variety of internet services,including a search engine,web page hosting,instant messaging,auctions,and chat rooms.while some of these services rely on content created by,others are forums and platforms for content.
users can,for example,design their own web pages,share opinions on social and political message boards,play fantasy baseball games,and post items to be auctioned for sale.does not monitor such content before it is posted on the web through sites.
united states website is written in english.it targets users in the united states and relies on servers located in california.foreign subsidiaries,such as france,and india,have comparable websites for their respective countries.the internet addresses of these websites contain their country designations,such as,and.foreign subsidiaries sites provide content in the local language,target local citizens,and adopt policies that comply with local law and customs.in actual practice,however,national boundaries are highly permeable.for example,any user in the united states can type into his or her web browser and thereby reach france website.conversely,any user in france can type into his or her browser,or click the link to on the france home page,and thereby reach.
sometime in early april,licra chairman sent by mail and fax a cease and desist letter,dated april,to headquarters in santa clara,california.the letter,written in english,stated in part 
w e are particularly choked sic to see that your company keeps on presenting every day hundreds of nazi symbols or objects for sale on the web.
this practice is illegal according to french legislation and it is incumbent upon you to stop it,at least on the french territory.
unless you cease presenting nazi objects for sale within days,we shall size sic the competent jurisdiction to force your company to abide by the law.
on april,five rather than eight days after the date on the letter,licra filed suit against and france in the tribunal de grande instance de paris.on april,uejf joined licra suit in the french court.licra and uejf used united states marshals to serve process on in california.
after a hearing on may,the french court issued an interim order on may requiring to take all necessary measures to dissuade and render impossible any access from french territory via to the nazi artifact auction service and to any other site or service that may be construed as constituting an apology for nazism or a contesting of nazi crimes emphasis added among other things,the french court required to take particular specified actions b y way of interim precautionary measures.was required to cease all hosting and availability in the territory of france from the site of messages,images and text relating to nazi objects,relics,insignia,emblems and flags,or which evoke nazism,and of web pages displaying text,extracts,or quotes from mein kampf and the protocols of the elders of zion at two specified internet addresses.was further required to remove from all browser directories accessible in the territory of the french republic the index heading entitled negationists and any link bringing together,equating,or presenting directly or indirectly as equivalent sites about the holocaust and sites by holocaust deniers.
the may interim order required france as distinct from to remove the negationists index heading and the link to negationist sites,described above,from.the order further required france to post a warning on stating to any user of that website that,in the event the user accessed prohibited material through a search on,he or she must desist from viewing the site concerned,subject to imposition of the penalties provided in french legislation or the bringing of legal action against him.
the order stated that both and france were subject to a penalty of euros per day of delay or per confirmed violation,and stated that the possibility of liquidation of the penalties thus pronounced was reserve d.the order also awarded franc in provisional damages,payable by and france to uejf,and awarded an additional franc against and france for expenses under article of the new code of civil procedure.the french court also awarded francs against for expenses under article,payable to licra,and francs each against and france under article a total of francs,payable to uejf.
objected to the may order.it contended,among other things,that there was no technical solution which would enable it to comply fully with the terms of the court order.emphasis added.in response,the french court obtained a written report from three experts.the report concluded that under current conditions approximately of users operating from computer sites in france could be identified.the report specifically noted that already used such identification of french users to display advertising banners in french.the number applied irrespective of whether a user sought access to an auction site,or to a site denying the existence of the holocaust or constituting an apology for nazism.
with respect to auction sites,the report concluded that it would be possible to identify additional users.two out of the three experts concluded that approximately an additional of users seeking access to auction sites offering items for sale could be identified through an honor system in which the user would be asked to state his or her nationality.in all,the two experts estimated that almost of such auction site users in france could be identified the combination of the two procedures,namely geographical identification of the ip address and declaration of nationality,would be likely to achieve a filtering success rate approaching.the third expert expressed doubts about the number of additional users of the auction site who would respond truthfully under the honor system.he did not,however,specify an alternative number of,or who would respond truthfully.
with respect to sites denying the existence of the holocaust or constituting an apology for nazism,the report was not able to propose suitable and effective technical solutions because no grievance against those sites had been made with sufficient precision.in consequence,as to these sites,the report did not estimate how many users above the base number could be identified by an honor system.
in a second interim order,issued on november,the french court reaffirmed its may order and directed to comply within three months,subject to a penalty of francs per day of delay effective from the first day following expiry of the month period.the may order had specified a penalty of euros rather than francs.the court reserve d the possible liquidation of the penalty against.the french court november order required france as distinct from to display a warning to surfers even before they have made use of the link to,to be brought into effect within months following notification of the present order.however,the french court found that yahoo france has complied in large measure with the spirit and letter of the order of may.emphasis added.
the november order required to pay francs for a report,to be prepared in the future by one of the experts previously appointed by the court,to determine whether was in compliance with the court orders.it also awarded a total of francs against for expenses under article,payable to licra and uejf,and an unspecified amount of costs against,payable to licra and uejf.the court specifically stated that it was not awarding any expenses or costs against france which it had found to have complied in large measure with its order.licra and uejf used united states marshals to serve both orders on in santa clara,california.
did not pursue appeals of either interim order.
the french court has not imposed any penalty on for violations of the may or november orders.nor has either licra or uejf returned to the french court to seek the imposition of a penalty.both organizations affirmatively represent to us that they have no intention of doing so if maintains its current level of compliance.yet neither organization is willing to ask the french court to vacate its orders.as licra and uejf counsel made clear at oral argument,my clients will not give up the right to go to france and enforce the french judgment against in france if they revert to their old ways and violate french law.
the record reveals that the french public prosecutor participated in the proceedings against and france in the french court,but it does not reveal whether he has the authority to seek a penalty against under the interim orders,either on his own or pursuant to a request by licra uejf.the public prosecutor was not made a party to the suit in the district court,and has made no appearance in the district court or on appeal to this court.if licra,uejf,or the public prosecutor were to seek the imposition of a penalty by the french court pursuant to the interim orders,that court would have to determine the extent of violation,if any,of the orders,as well as the amount of any penalty,before an award of a penalty could be entered.
on december,filed suit against licra and uejf in federal district court,seeking a declaratory judgment that the interim orders of the french court are not recognizable or enforceable in the united states.subject matter jurisdiction is based solely on diversity of citizenship.a.in a thoughtful opinion,the district court concluded that it had personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf.la ligue contre le racisme et,d.several months later,in another thoughtful opinion,the district court concluded that the suit was ripe,that abstention was not warranted,and that the first amendment precludes enforcement within the united states,la ligue contre le racisme et,d.
in early,after both interim orders had been entered by the french court,and after had filed suit in federal district court,adopted a new policy prohibiting use of auctions or classified advertisements on to offer or trade in items that are associated with or could be used to promote or glorify groups that are known principally for hateful and violent positions directed at others based on race or similar factors.has represented,in this court and elsewhere,that its new policy has not been adopted in response to the french court orders,but rather for independent reasons.yahoo new policy eliminates much of the conduct prohibited by the french orders.however,after conducting its own internet research on,the district court found that even after this policy change,appear s not to have fully complied with the orders with respect to its auction site.d at.for example,the district court found that continued to allow the sale of items such as a copy of mein kampf and stamps and coins from the nazi period on which the swastika is depicted.id.the district court also found that access was available through to various sites in response to searches such as did not happen.id.
licra and uejf timely appealed the district court rulings on personal jurisdiction,ripeness,and abstention.
ii.personal jurisdiction 
the only bases for personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf in the district court are the actions they have taken in connection with their french suit against.those actions are sending a cease and desist letter to at its headquarters in santa clara,california serving process on in santa clara to commence the french suit obtaining two interim orders from the french court and serving the two orders on in santa clara.
where,as here,there is no applicable federal statute governing personal jurisdiction,the district court applies the law of the state in which the district court sits.see.k a panavision int l,toeppen,cir.because california jurisdictional statute is coextensive with federal due process requirements,the jurisdictional analyses under state law and federal due process are the same.id.at citing.
in international shoe washington,the supreme court held that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant consistent with due process only if he or she has certain minimum contacts with the relevant forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.at.quoting milliken meyer.unless a defendant contacts with a forum are so substantial,continuous,and systematic that the defendant can be deemed to be present in that forum for all purposes,a forum may exercise only specific is,jurisdiction based on the relationship between the defendant forum contacts and the plaintiff claim.the parties agree that only specific jurisdiction is at issue in this case.
in this circuit,we analyze specific jurisdiction according to a test 
the defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws 
the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant activities and 
the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice,it must be reasonable.
schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir quoting lake lake,cir.the first prong is determinative in this case.we have sometimes referred to it,in shorthand fashion,as the purposeful availment prong.schwarzenegger,at.despite its label,this prong includes both purposeful availment and purposeful direction.it may be satisfied by purposeful availment of the privilege of doing business in the forum by purposeful direction of activities at the forum or by some combination thereof.
we have typically treated purposeful availment somewhat differently in tort and contract cases.in tort cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully direct s his activities at the forum state,applying an effects test that focuses on the forum in which the defendant actions were felt,whether or not the actions themselves occurred within the forum.see schwarzenegger,at citing calder jones,d.by contrast,in contract cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities or consummate s a transaction in the forum,focusing on activities such as delivering goods or executing a contract.see schwarzenegger,at.however,this case is neither a tort nor a contract case.rather,it is a case in which argues,based on the first amendment,that the french court interim orders are unenforceable by an american court.
licra and uejf contend that we must base our analysis on the effects test of calder jones,d,which is normally employed in purposeful direction cases.see,ce,llc new sensor,cir schwarzenegger,at dole food watts,cir.in calder,a entertainer sued the national enquirer and various individual defendants for an allegedly defamatory article published in the enquirer.the article had been written and edited in florida,and the defendants had few contacts with california.the court nonetheless upheld the exercise of personal jurisdiction in california because the defendants knew that the article would have an effect in that state.in the words of the court,the defendants had not engaged in mere untargeted negligence rather,their intentional,and allegedly tortious,actions were expressly aimed at california.at.
in this circuit,we construe calder to impose three requirements the defendant allegedly must have committed an intentional act,expressly aimed at the forum state,causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.schwarzenegger,at quoting dole food,at.in some of our cases,we have employed a slightly different formulation of the third requirement,specifying that the act must have caused harm,the brunt of which is suffered and which the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.bancroft masters,augusta,cir emphasis added.the brunt of the harm formulation originated in the principal opinion in nobel indus.ab,cir.that opinion required that the brunt of the harm be suffered in the forum state based on that requirement,it concluded that there was no purposeful availment by the defendant.id.at.a dissenting judge would have found purposeful availment.relying on the supreme court opinion in keeton hustler magazine,d,he specifically disavowed the brunt of the harm formulation,at wallace,dissenting t he supreme court has already rejected the proposition that the brunt of the harm must be suffered in the forum.without discussing the disputed brunt of the harm formulation,a concurring judge agreed with the dissenter that purposeful availment could be found.id.at fernandez,concurring i agree with chief judge wallace that purposeful availment can be found in this case.later opinions picked up the brunt of the harm formulation of the principal opinion in without noting that at least one,and possibly two,of the judges on the panel disagreed with it.see,bancroft masters,at panavision,at caruth int l psychoanalytical ass n,cir.
we take this opportunity to clarify our law and to state that the brunt of the harm need not be suffered in the forum state.if a jurisdictionally sufficient amount of harm is suffered in the forum state,it does not matter that even more harm might have been suffered in another state.in so stating we are following keeton,decided the same day as calder,in which the court sustained the exercise of personal jurisdiction in new hampshire even though i t is undoubtedly true that the bulk of the harm done to petitioner occurred outside new hampshire.at.
licra and uejf contend that the calder effects test is not satisfied because,in their view,calder requires that the actions expressly aimed at and causing harm in california be tortious or otherwise wrongful.licra and uejf contend that they have done no more than vindicate their rights under french law,and that their behavior has therefore not been wrongful.they conclude that their behavior therefore does not confer personal jurisdiction in california.we agree with licra and uejf that the calder effects test is appropriately applied to the interim orders of the french court.but we disagree with them about the meaning and application of calder.
in any personal jurisdiction case we must evaluate all of a defendant contacts with the forum state,whether or not those contacts involve wrongful activity by the defendant.see,quill north dakota,d upholding jurisdiction to enforce state tax on corporation that sent catalogs and goods to forum burger king rudzewicz,d upholding personal jurisdiction based on a course of dealing related to a franchise agreement.many cases in which the calder effects test is used will indeed involve wrongful conduct by the defendant.see,calder,at,allegedly defamatory publication purposefully directed at california bancroft masters,at wrongful interference with california corporation use of domain name sinatra enquirer,cir unauthorized use of celebrity name and likeness to promote swiss clinic lake,at provision of legal services to secure allegedly improper custody order.but we do not read calder necessarily to require in purposeful direction cases that all or even any jurisdictionally relevant effects have been caused by wrongful acts.we do not see how we could do so,for if an allegedly wrongful act were the basis for jurisdiction,a holding on the merits that the act was not wrongful would deprive the court of jurisdiction.
we therefore analyze all of licra and uejf contacts with california relating to its dispute with,irrespective of whether they involve wrongful actions by licra and uejf.there are three such contacts.the first two contacts,taken by themselves,do not provide a sufficient basis for jurisdiction.however,the third contact,considered in conjunction with the first two,does provide such a basis.
the first contact is the cease and desist letter that licra sent to,demanding that alter its behavior in california to conform to what licra contended were the commands of french law.a cease and desist letter is not in and of itself sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the sender of the letter.red wing shoe,a patentee should not subject itself to personal jurisdiction in a forum solely by informing a party who happens to be located there of suspected infringement.there are strong policy reasons to encourage cease and desist letters.they are normally used to warn an alleged rights infringer that its conduct,if continued,will be challenged in a legal proceeding,and to facilitate resolution of a dispute without resort to litigation.if the price of sending a cease and desist letter is that the sender thereby subjects itself to jurisdiction in the forum of the alleged rights infringer,the rights holder will be strongly encouraged to file suit in its home forum without attempting first to resolve the dispute informally by means of a letter.see red wing shoe,at cascade ab,cir douglas furniture of,wood dimensions,if any attempt by an intellectual property holder to put an alleged wrongdoer on notice forced the property holder to submit to the jurisdiction of the alleged wrongdoer forum,an intellectual property owner would be forced to file an action in his own jurisdiction in order to avoid the threat of being haled before a court in another,possibly distant state.
this is not to say that a cease and desist letter can never be the basis for personal jurisdiction.for example,in bancroft masters,we upheld jurisdiction based on two letters sent by augusta national ani,based in georgia,contending that bancroft masters,b m was improperly using its domain name.one letter was sent to network solutions,nsi in virginia.nsi was then the sole registrar of domain names.the other,a cease and desist letter,was sent to b m at its corporate offices in california.b m sued ani in federal district court in california seeking a declaratory judgment that it had the right to the disputed domain name.on the assumption that b m factual allegation was true,we held that the letters were intended to trigger nsi dispute resolution procedures,to interfere wrongfully with b m use of its domain name,and to misappropriate that name for ani own use.at.we therefore upheld jurisdiction under calder based on the letters.
licra letter was not used to facilitate settlement.although it stated that licra would file suit in eight days if had not complied with licra demands,licra filed suit five days after the date of the letter.nonetheless,licra letter to was more like a normal cease and desist letter than the letters at issue in bancroft masters,for it was not abusive,tortious or otherwise wrongful.rather,it simply alerted to its view of french law and stated its intent to file suit in france to enforce that law against.
under these circumstances,we do not believe that licra letter is a contact that would,if considered alone,justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.
licra and uejf second contact or,more precisely,set of contacts with california was service of process on in california.licra first effected service of process to commence the french suit.licra and uejf later effected service of the french court two interim orders.we do not regard the service of documents in connection with a suit brought in a foreign court as contacts that by themselves justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign litigant in a united states court.if we were to hold that such service were a sufficient basis for jurisdiction,we would be providing a tool by which any united states resident sued in a foreign country and served in the united states could bring suit in the united states,regardless of any other basis for jurisdiction.we are unaware of any case so holding,and has cited none.
third,and most important,licra and uejf have obtained two interim orders from the french court directing to take actions in california,on threat of a substantial penalty.we agree with licra and uejf that the french court orders are appropriately analyzed under the calder effects test.
the first two requirements are that licra and uejf have committed an intentional act,which was expressly aimed at the forum state.schwarzenegger,at quoting dole food,at.it is obvious that both requirements are satisfied.licra intentionally filed suit in the french court.indeed,it had previously signaled its intent to file suit in its april letter to.uejf intentionally joined licra suit ten days later.further,licra and uejf suit was expressly aimed at california.the suit sought,and the french court granted,orders directing to perform significant acts in california.it is of course true that the effect desired by the french court would be felt in france,but that does not change the fact that significant acts were to be performed in california.the servers that support are located in california,and compliance with the french court orders necessarily would require to make some changes to those servers.further,to the extent that any financial penalty might be imposed pursuant to the french court orders,the impact of that penalty would be felt by at its corporate headquarters in california.see dole food,at.
the third requirement is that licra and uejf acts caus e harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.id.this requirement is somewhat problematic,for has not shown or even alleged any specific way in which it has altered its behavior in response to the french court interim orders.changed its policy with respect to after the french court orders were entered,but has consistently maintained that the change was unrelated to the orders.therefore,even if we were persuaded that change of policy harmed it in some way,itself has represented that such harm was not caused by any action of licra or uejf.nor is it clear that,absent the interim orders,would change its policy in the future.indeed,represented to us during oral argument that there is nothing that it would like to do,but is now refraining from doing,because of the interim orders.
however,points to the possibility that a substantial penalty will be assessed under the french court november interim order.it points in particular to the provision in that order specifying that the potential amount of the penalty increases by francs for every day that is in violation of the court orders.represents to us that even now,after its change of policy,it is acting in plain violation of the orders.it contends that a declaratory judgment determining the enforceability by an american court of the french court orders will allow it to determine an appropriate course of conduct with respect to the activities in which it continues to engage.the district court found that,notwithstanding its new policy,
the auction site still offers certain items for sale such as stamps,coins,and a copy of mein kampf which appear to violate the french order.while has removed the protocol of the elders of zion from its auction site,it has not prevented access to numerous other sites which reasonably may be construed as constituting an apology for nazism or a contesting of nazi crimes.
d at emphasis added.
in both this court and the district court,licra and uejf have represented that,in their view,is in what they call substantial compliance with the french court orders.they have further represented that they will not seek enforcement of the penalty provision if continues its present level of compliance with the orders.however,licra and uejf have stopped short of making a binding contractual commitment that they will not enforce the orders,and they have taken no action to have the orders withdrawn.as their counsel made clear at oral argument,licra and uejf want to be able to return to the french court for enforcement if returns to its old ways.for its part,while does not independently wish to take steps to comply more fully with the french court orders,it states that it fears that it may be subject to a substantial and increasing fine if it does not.maintains that in these circumstances it has a legally cognizable interest in knowing whether the french court orders are enforceable in this country.
in a specific jurisdiction inquiry,we consider the extent of the defendant contacts with the forum and the degree to which the plaintiff suit is related to those contacts.a strong showing on one axis will permit a lesser showing on the other.
a single forum state contact can support jurisdiction if the cause of action arise s out of that particular purposeful contact of the defendant with the forum state.see lake,at.the case before us is the classic polar case for specific jurisdiction described in international shoe,in which there are very few contacts but in which those few contacts are directly related to the suit.see at.s ome single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state because of their nature and quality and the circumstances of their commission,may be deemed sufficient to render the corporation liable to suit.all of the contacts with the forum state in this case are either the interim orders themselves or contacts directly related to those orders.
licra and uejf have not sought enforcement of the french court orders in this country,and they have stated that they will not seek enforcement or penalties so long as continues its current course of conduct.however,licra and uejf have not sought to vacate the french court orders,and it is at least possible that they might later seek enforcement based on a continuation of current conduct.or more likely,they might seek enforcement if changes it conduct in the future.but even if licra and uejf seek enforcement at some time in the future,and even if the french court finds a violation that warrants the imposition of a penalty,enforcement of that penalty is extremely unlikely in the united states.enforcement is unlikely not because of the first amendment,but rather because of the general principle of comity under which american courts do not enforce monetary fines or penalties awarded by foreign courts.
finally,contends that it has a legally protected interest,based on the first amendment,in continuing its current policy with respect to nazi memorabilia and materials.until that contention is endorsed by the judgment of an american court,it is only a contention.but even if the french court orders are not enforced against,the very existence of those orders may be thought to cast a shadow on the legality of current policy.
it is a close question whether licra and uejf are subject to personal jurisdiction in california in this suit.but considering the direct relationship between licra and uejf contacts with the forum and the substance of the suit brought by,as well as the impact and potential impact of the french court orders on,we hold that there is personal jurisdiction.
iii.ripeness 
because we conclude that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf is proper,we turn to the question of ripeness.ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass doi,d quoting reno catholic social,d.even where jurisdiction is present in the article iii sense,courts are obliged to dismiss a case when considerations of prudential ripeness are not satisfied.socialist labor party gilligan,d problems of prematurity and abstractness may well present insuperable obstacles to the exercise of the court jurisdiction,even though that jurisdiction is technically present.citing rescue army municipal court.
the existence of article iii subject matter jurisdiction is,like personal jurisdiction,a close question,but we agree with the district court that the effect of the french court orders on is sufficient to create a case or controversy within the meaning of article iii.see d at.however,we disagree with the district court conclusion that there is prudential ripeness.in its current form,this case presents the sort of p roblems of prematurity and abstractness that counsel against reaching the first amendment question that insists is presented by this case.see socialist labor party,at.
in determining whether a case satisfies prudential requirements for ripeness,we consider two factors the fitness of the issues for judicial decision,and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.gardner,d pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d quoting abbott labs.we address these two factors in turn.
fitness of the issue for judicial decision 
the substantive legal question at issue 
whether a dispute is sufficiently ripe to be fit for judicial decision depends not only on the state of the factual record.it depends also on the substantive legal question to be decided.if the legal question is straightforward,relatively little factual development may be necessary.as we wrote in san diego county gun rights comm.reno,cir,p ure legal questions that require little factual development are more likely to be ripe.by contrast,if the legal question depends on numerous factors for its resolution,extensive factual development may be necessary.
a noted example is adler bd.of,in which justice frankfurter disagreed with the other justices about the precise legal question presented,and,as a consequence,disagreed about ripeness.because the legal question,as justice frankfurter understood it,required and subtle judgments based on extensive factual development,he concluded that the suit was not ripe.id.at.frankfurter,dissenting.in the view of the other justices,however,the legal question was different.in their view,this different legal question was relatively simple,requiring little factual development.for them and for this different legal question,the suit was ripe.id.at.at.douglas,dissenting.see fritz scharpf,judicial review and the political question a functional analysis,yale.see also united public workers mitchell.dismissing suit as unripe id.at.black,dissenting id.at.douglas,dissenting.
it is thus important to a ripeness analysis that we specify the precise legal question to be answered.depending on the legal question,the case may be ripe or unripe.if we ask the wrong legal question,we risk getting the wrong answer to the ripeness question.the legal question presented by this case is whether the two interim orders of the french court are enforceable in this country.these orders,by their explicit terms,require only that restrict access by internet users located in france.the orders say nothing whatsoever about restricting access by internet users in the united states.we are asked to decide whether enforcement of these interim orders would be repugnant to california public policy.
there is currently no federal statute governing recognition of foreign judgments in the federal courts.see american law institute,recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments analysis and proposed federal statute april,proposed final draft.the federal full faith and credit statute,governs only judgments rendered by courts of states within the united states.in diversity cases,enforceability of judgments of courts of other countries is generally governed by the law of the state in which enforcement is sought.bank of montreal kough,cir see also southwest livestock trucking ramon,cir choi kim,cir andes versant,cir ingersoll milling mach.granger,cir branca security benefit life ins,cir.this is a diversity suit,brought by in federal district court in california.
in a typical enforcement case,the party in whose favor the foreign judgment was granted comes to an american court affirmatively seeking enforcement.the standard rule in such a case is that the federal court sitting in diversity applies the law of the state in which it sits.however,this is not the typical case,for the successful plaintiffs in the french court do not seek enforcement.rather,the unsuccessful defendant in france,seeks a declaratory judgment that the french court interim orders are unenforceable anywhere in this country.
insofar as the issue is whether the french court orders are enforceable in california,it is clear that california law governs.however,it is less clear whose law governs when enforceability in other states is at issue.this is a potentially difficult question,but we do not need to answer it in order to decide ripeness.first,the central issue is enforceability in california.therefore,if the suit is unripe under california law,we should not decide the case,irrespective of whether it might be ripe under the law of some other state.to do otherwise would be to allow the tail to wag the dog.second,in any event,the law of virtually all other states appears to be similar,or even identical,to california law.we may thus safely proceed with our ripeness analysis based on the california law of enforceability.
california,along with many other states,has adopted the uniform foreign recognition act uniform act or act.the relevant standard for enforceability under the act is whether the cause of action or defense on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of this state.id.b emphasis added.however,the act is not directly applicable to this case,for it does not authorize enforcement of injunctions.see id.foreign judgment means any judgment of a foreign state granting or denying recovery of a sum of money,other than a fine or other penalty.but neither does the uniform act prevent enforcement of injunctions,for its savings clause specifies that the act does not foreclose enforcement of foreign judgments in situations not covered by the act.id.
because the uniform act does not cover injunctions,we look to general principles of comity followed by the california courts.we may appropriately consult the restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states third restatement or restatement,given that california courts frequently cite the restatement,as well as earlier restatements,as sources of law.see,renoir redstar,th,d third restatement american home assurance sociét é commerciale toutélectric,th,d same smith hopland band of pomo indians,th,d same pecaflor construction,landes,d.second restatement.the general principle of enforceability under the third restatement is the same as under california uniform act.that is,an american court will not enforce a judgment if the cause of action on which the judgment was based,or the judgment itself,is repugnant to the public policy of the united states or of the state where recognition is sought.restatement d emphasis added see also restatement second of the conflict of laws cmt.c e nforcement will usually be accorded a judgment of a foreign court except in situations where the original claim is repugnant to fundamental notions of what is decent and just in the state where enforcement is sought.emphasis added.
there is very little case law in california dealing with enforceability of foreign country injunctions under general principles of comity,but that law is consistent with the repugnancy standard of the restatement.we have found only one case in which a california court has ruled on the enforceability of an injunction granted in another country.in in re stephanie,cal th,d,a mexican court had entered a guardianship decree purporting to authorize the named guardian to take immediate custody of a child and to return her to mexico.the california supreme court recognized that an injunction could be enforced by the california courts as a matter of comity,but it declined to order enforcement in this particular case because the mexican decree conflicted with california public policy.id.at,d.
california courts have also relied on public policy in the analogous context of injunctions entered by other american courts.in smith superior court,th,d,plaintiff smith had been badly injured,and her husband and two children killed,when their general motors gm vehicle burst into flames after a collision.smith brought a product liability suit in california against gm.elwell had been an engineer for gm for many years and had extensive knowledge about the design of gm vehicles.an earlier wrongful termination suit between elwell and gm in michigan had been dismissed after the parties stipulated to a permanent injunction forbidding elwell from testifying in any suit about gm vehicles.smith sought to call elwell as an expert witness in her california suit.the california court of appeal declined to enforce the michigan injunction on the ground that it blatantly and irreconcilably conflicts with our fundamental public policy against the suppression of evidence.id.at,d see also baker general motors,d missouri state court not required by to enforce the same michigan injunction against elwell when such enforcement would violate missouri public policy.
the repugnancy standard is also generally followed in states other than california.see,hilkmann hilkmann,observing that the restatement repugnancy standard has been incorporated into pennsylvania common law alberta sec.comm ryckman,stating that foreign judgments are not enforceable under arizona common law if they are repugnant to public policy panama processes,cities serv,declaring that a judgment must not be enforced if repugnant to public policy greschler greschler,t he public policy exception to the doctrine of comity is usually invoked when the original claim is repugnant to fundamental notions of what is decent and just in the state where enforcement is sought.internal quotation omitted.further,federal courts sometimes cite general principles of comity without reference to particular state laws.see,jaffe accredited sur.cas,cir declaring that a judgment will not be enforced if repugnant to public policy in re schimmelpenninck,cir to be enforceable,foreign laws need not be identical to the laws of the united states they merely must not be repugnant to our laws and policies turner entertainment degeto film gmbh,cir general comity concerns include whether the foreign judgment is prejudicial,in the sense of violating american public policy because it is repugnant to fundamental principles of what is decent and just.see also hilton guyot.discussing principles of comity governing enforcement of foreign judgments.
under the repugnancy standard,american courts sometimes enforce judgments that conflict with american public policy or are based on foreign law that differs substantially from american state or federal law.see,in re hashim,cir reversing bankruptcy court refusal to enforce english court award of million in costs against debtors whose assets had been frozen by saddam hussein milhoux linder,affirming recognition of belgian judgment as a matter of comity,even though it was based on a belgian statute of limitations.inconsistency with american law is not necessarily enough to prevent recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment in the united states.the foreign judgment must be,in addition,repugnant to public policy.
fitness of the question for judicial decision 
with the suit in its current state,it is difficult to know whether enforcement of the french court interim orders would be repugnant to california public policy.the first difficulty is evident.as indicated by the label interim,the french court contemplated that it might enter later orders.we can not know whether it might modify these interim orders before any attempt is made to enforce them in the united states.
a second,more important,difficulty is that we do not know whether the french court would hold that is now violating its two interim orders.after the french court entered the orders,voluntarily changed its policy to comply with them,at least to some extent.there is some reason to believe that the french court will not insist on full and literal compliance with its interim orders,and that changed policy may amount to sufficient compliance.
in its interim second order,entered on november,the french court found that france had complied in large measure with the spirit and letter of its may order.emphasis added.based on that level of compliance,the french court was satisfied.it declined to enter any further orders against france.it also declined to award any expenses or costs against france,even though in that same order it awarded expenses and costs against.we thus know from this second order that compliance in large measure by is very likely to be satisfactory to the french court,just as compliance in large measure by france was satisfactory.
licra and uejf insist that has now,in their words,substantially complied with the french court orders.we take this to be a statement that,in their view,has complied in large measure with the orders.for its part,however,insists that it continues to be in serious violation of the orders.the district court did not hold that is in violation,substantial or otherwise,of the french court orders.it wrote only that does not appear to be in full compliance with the french court order with respect to its auction site,and that various sites continue to be accessible through.d at.there is only one court that can authoritatively tell us whether has now complied in large measure with the french court interim orders.that is,of course,the french court.
to the extent that we are uncertain about whether has complied in large measure with the french court orders,the responsibility for that uncertainty can be laid at door.in its november interim order,the french court ordered the appointment of one of the experts who had previously reported on the technical feasibility of restricting access by french users to.under the november order,was required to pay the expert,who would be charged to undertake an assignment to prepare a consultancy report on the conditions of fulfillment of the terms of the aforementioned order.has placed nothing in the record to tell us whether has paid the expert whether the expert has prepared a report for the french court and,if a report has been prepared,what it says.there is also nothing in the record to indicate what other steps,if any,has taken to obtain an indication from the french court whether it believes that is in compliance,in large measure or otherwise,with the terms of its interim orders.all we know for certain is that abandoned its appeal of the may interim order and declined to appeal the november interim order,and that on december,a month and a day after entry of the second interim order,it came home to file suit in the northern district of california.
a third difficulty is related to the second.because we do not know whether has complied in large measure with the french court orders,we can not know what effect,if any,compliance with the french court orders would have on protected activities.we emphasize that the french court orders require,by their terms,only a limitation on access to materials by users located in france.the orders do not by their terms limit access by users outside france in any way.contended in the french court that it was technically too difficult to distinguish between users inside and outside france.as described above,the french court commissioned a report by three experts to determine if contention were true.the experts disagreed with,concluding that is readily able to distinguish between most users inside and outside france.
with respect to users seeking access to forbidden auction sites,two out of the three experts concluded that could identify almost of its users located in france.the third expert did not dispute that of such auction site users could be identified,but expressed doubt about how many additional such users could be identified.with respect to users seeking access to sites of holocaust deniers and nazi apologists,the experts declined to propose any solution by which a greater number than of users located in france could be identified.
in its briefing to this court,contends that restricting access by french internet users in a manner sufficient to satisfy the french court would in some unspecified fashion require simultaneously to restrict access by internet users in the united states.this may or may not be true.it is almost certainly not true if is now complying in large measure with the french court orders,for in that event the french court will almost certainly hold that no further compliance is necessary.even if the measures has already taken restrict access by american internet users to antisemitic materials,this has no bearing on first amendment argument.by its own admission,has taken these measures entirely of its own volition,for reasons entirely independent of the french court orders.
however,it is possible,as contends,that it has not complied in large measure with the french court orders,and that the french court would require further compliance.it is also possible,as contends,that further compliance might have the necessary consequence of requiring to restrict access by american internet users.but has been vague in telling us in what ways,and for what reasons,it believes further compliance might have that consequence.one possible reason for vagueness might be that its contention is,and that a detailed explanation would reveal that fact.we are not now in a position to judge this.another,more important,merely a possible its vagueness is that has no way of knowing what further compliance might be required by the french court.until it knows what further compliance if any the french court will require,simply can not know what effect if any further compliance might have on access by american users.
the at this point highly of further compliance with the french court orders on access by american users would be highly relevant to the question whether enforcement of the orders would be repugnant to california public policy.but we can not get to that question without knowing whether the french court would find that has already complied in large measure,for only on a finding of current noncompliance would the issue of further compliance,and possible impact on american users,arise.
without a finding that further compliance with the french court orders would necessarily result in restrictions on access by users in the united states,the only question in this case is whether california public policy and the first amendment require unrestricted access by internet users in france.in other words,the only question would involve a determination whether the first amendment has extraterritorial application.the extent of first amendment protection of speech accessible solely by those outside the united states is a difficult and,to some degree,unresolved issue.compare,desai hersh,f or purposes of suits brought in the united states courts,first amendment protections do not apply to all extraterritorial publications by persons under the protections of the constitution,and laker airways pan american airways,it is less clear,however,whether even american citizens are protected specifically by the first amendment with respect to their activities abroad,with bullfrog films,wick,t here can be no question that,in the absence of some overriding governmental interest such as national security,the first amendment protects communications with foreign audiences to the same extent as communications within our borders,aff,cir.
we are thus uncertain about whether,or in what form,a first amendment question might be presented to us.if the french court were to hold that voluntary change of policy has already brought it into compliance with its interim orders in large measure,no first amendment question would be presented at all.further,if the french court were to require additional compliance with respect to users in france,but that additional compliance would not require any restriction on access by users in the united states,would only be asserting a right to extraterritorial application of the first amendment.finally,if the french court were to require additional compliance with respect to users in france,and that additional compliance would have the necessary consequence of restricting access by users in the united states,would have both a domestic and an extraterritorial first amendment argument.the legal analysis of these different questions is different,and the answers are likely to be different as well.
hardship to the parties 
we next consider the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott,at.as discussed above,we believe that has suffered sufficient harm to justify though not by a wide margin the exercise of personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf.the threshold requirement for hardship for purposes of personal jurisdiction,however,is not necessarily the same as the threshold for purposes of prudential ripeness.particularly where,as here,there are substantial uncertainties bearing on the legal analysis to be performed,there is a high threshold requirement for hardship.
contends that it will suffer real hardship if we do not decide its suit at this time.makes essentially two arguments.first,it argues that the potential monetary penalty under the french court orders is mounting every day,and that the enforcement of a penalty against it here could be extremely onerous.second,it argues that the french court orders substantially limit speech that is protected by the first amendment.we take these arguments in turn.
enforceability of the monetary penalty 
contends that the threat of a monetary penalty hangs like the sword of damocles.however,it is exceedingly unlikely that the sword will ever fall.we may say with some confidence that,for reasons entirely independent of the first amendment,the french court orders are not likely to result in the enforcement of a monetary penalty in the united states.the french court orders threaten monetary sanctions against,which that court explicitly labels penalties.in order to obtain an award of a penalty from the french court,licra and uejf would have to return to the french court,to explain to the french court why they believe has violated its interim orders,and to persuade the french court that violation merits the imposition of a penalty.in the nearly five years since the entry of the french court second interim order and change of policy,licra and uejf have taken none of these steps.further,licra and uejf have represented that they have no intention of seeking a monetary penalty by the french court so long as does not revert to its old ways.
more important,even if the french court were to impose a monetary penalty against,it is exceedingly unlikely that any court in indeed elsewhere in the united enforce it.california uniform act does not authorize enforcement of fines or other penalties.the act includes a savings clause,see,but the fine is equally unenforceable under california common law doctrine.
california courts follow the rule that,u nless required to do so by treaty,no state,country enforces the penal judgments of other states,countries.in re manuel,d.wiener,dissenting quoting restatement cmt.see also in re marriage of gray,d.this is consistent with the restatement declaration that c ourts in the united states are not required to enforce judgments from foreign countries for the collection of fines or other penalties.restatement see also d execution and enforcement of judgments courts in the united states will not recognize or enforce a penal judgment rendered in another nation.a number of states have adopted an identical version of california uniform act,see enforcing foreign judgments in the united states and united states judgments abroad ronald brand,and the common law rule against the enforcement of penal judgments is venerable and.see huntington attrill.see also james moore et,moore federal practice.
penal judgments are those intended to punish an offense against the public justice of the foreign state.chavarria superior court,d.quoting huntington,at.the test to determine a judgment nature 
is not by what name the statute on which the judgment is based is called by the legislature or the courts of the state in which it was passed,but whether it appears to the tribunal which is called upon to enforce it to be,in its essential character and effect,a punishment of an offense against the public,or a grant of a civil right to a private person.
huntington,at.
there are a number of indications that the french judgments are penal in nature.first,the word used by the french court astreinte is consistently translated as penalty in the record in this case.for example,the may order provides that and france are subject to a penalty of euros per day of delay and per confirmed violation.the november order provides that is subject to a penalty of francs per day of delay.
second,the french court held that was violating section of the french penal code,which declares it a crime to exhibit or display nazi emblems,and which prescribes a set of criminal penalties,including fines.fr.pén,translation available at.the monetary penalties against do not lose their character as penalties simply because they were obtained in a civil action.see wisconsin pelican ins.nor do they lose their character because private litigants initiated the action.a civil remedy is penal,as the term is understood in private international law,if it awards a penalty to a member of the public,suing in the interest of the whole community to redress a public wrong.weiss glemp,see also loucks standard oil,cardozo.in short,the label civil does not strip a remedy of its penal nature.thus,for example,an american court is not required to enforce an order of contempt or an award of punitive damages in a civil action.frank reese,other jurisdictions are reluctant to give full faith and credit to an order for contempt due to its punitive nature.republic of philippines westinghouse,refusing to enforce philippine law providing for punitive damages see also third restatement cmt.b some states consider judgments penal for purposes of if multiple,punitive,or exemplary damages are awarded,even when no governmental agency is a party.
third,the penalties the french court imposed on are primarily designed to deter from creating,in the words of the november order,a threat to internal public order.the penalties are payable to the government and not designed to compensate the french student groups for losses suffered.see farmers merchants trust madeira,d.suggesting that a judgment is penal if it is designed to punish a defendant for an offense committed against the public justice of the jurisdiction.judgments designed to deter conduct that constitutes a threat to the public order are typically penal in nature.kennedy,d.
the french court awarded nominal damages of one franc to licra and uejf in its first but not its second order.balanced against the far more substantial penalties payable to the government up to francs per day under the second order,this award of one franc can not render the orders primarily remedial rather than punitive in nature.see ducharme hunnewell,determining that whether a judgment requires enforcement depends on whether its purpose is remedial in nature,affording a private remedy to an injured person,or penal in nature,punishing an offense against the public justice.even the restitution the court printing of its judgment in publications of uejf and licra the general public and does not specifically compensate the two student groups for a particular injury.
first amendment 
argues that any restriction on speech and activities resulting from the french court orders is a substantial harm under the first amendment.we are acutely aware that this case implicates the first amendment,and we are particularly sensitive to the harm that may result from chilling effects on protected speech or expressive conduct.in this case,however,the harm to first amendment such harm exists at be nowhere near as great as would have us believe.has taken pains to tell us that its adoption of a new hate speech policy after the entry of the french court interim orders was motivated by considerations independent of those orders.further,refuses to point to anything that it is now not doing but would do if permitted by the orders.in other words,itself has told us that there is no first amendment violation with respect either to its previous but now abandoned activities,or to its future but not currently engaged in activities.any restraint on such activities is entirely voluntary and.
the only potential first amendment violation comes from the restriction imposed by the interim indeed they impose any the activities in which is now engaged,and which might be restricted if further compliance with the french court orders is required.for example,continues to allow auctions of copies of mein kampf,and it maintains that the french court orders prohibit it from doing so.the french court might find that has not yet complied in large measure with its orders,and that is prohibited by its orders from allowing auctions of copies of mein kampf.
even if the french court took this step,claim to first amendment protection would be limited.we emphasize that the french court interim orders do not by their terms require to restrict access by internet users in the united states.they only require it to restrict access by users located in france.that is,with respect to the mein kampf example,the french court if further compliance is by their terms only prohibit from allowing auctions of copies of mein kampf to users in france.
the core of hardship argument may thus be that it has a first amendment interest in allowing access by users in france.yet under french criminal law,internet service providers are forbidden to permit french users to have access to the materials specified in the french court orders.french users,for their part,are criminally forbidden to obtain such access.in other words,as to the french users,is necessarily arguing that it has a first amendment right to violate french criminal law and to facilitate the violation of french criminal law by others.as we indicated above,the the very such an extraterritorial right under the first amendment is uncertain.
in sum,it is extremely unlikely that any penalty,if assessed,could ever be enforced against in the united states.further,first amendment harm may not exist at all,given the possibility that has now in large measure complied with the french court orders through its voluntary actions,unrelated to the orders.alternatively,if has not in large measure complied with the orders,its violation lies in the fact that it has insufficiently restricted access to materials by internet users located in france.there is some possibility that in further restricting access to these french users,might have to restrict access by american users.but this possibility is,at this point,highly speculative.this level of harm is not sufficient to overcome the factual uncertainty bearing on the legal question presented and thereby to render this suit ripe.
c.the dissent addressed to ripeness 
the dissent addressed to the question of ripeness makes two principal contentions.first,it contends that the french court interim orders are unconstitutional on their face,and that further factual development is therefore not needed.second,it contends that if any further factual development is necessary,we should remand to the district court for that purpose.we take these contentions in turn.
unconstitutionality of the french court orders 
the dissent repeatedly states that the french court interim orders are facially unconstitutional.it writes,the french orders on their face violate the first amendment and are plainly contrary to one of america,and by extension california,most cherished public policies.dissent at.it later refers to the french court orders as foreign court orders that so obviously violate the first amendment.id.at.it writes further,t he absence of a discernible line between the permitted and the unpermitted makes the orders facially unconstitutional.id.at 
the dissent is able to conclude that the french court interim orders are facially unconstitutional only by ignoring what they say.the dissent appears to assume that the orders,on their face,require to block access by united states users.it writes,t he question we face in this federal lawsuit is whether our own country fundamental constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech protects and,derivatively,at least its users in the united states against some or all of the restraints the french defendants have deliberately imposed upon it within the united states.id.at emphasis in original.further,confront s the dilemma of whether or not to stand by its united states constitutional rights or constrain its speech and that of its user.id.at.legions of cases permit first amendment challenges to governmental actions or decrees that on their face are vague,overbroad and threaten to chill protected speech.indeed,the sweeping injunction here presents just such a paradigmatic case.id.at.still further,under the principles articulated today,a foreign party can use a foreign court decree to censor free speech here in the united states.id.at.
if it were true that the french court orders by their terms require to block access by users in the united states,this would be a different and much easier case.in that event,we would be inclined to agree with the dissent.see,sarl louis feraud int l viewfinder,civ,wl,dist.lexis,holding unenforceable as contrary to the first amendment a french damage judgment based on photographs posted on the internet freely accessible to american viewers.but this is not the case.the french court orders,by their terms,require only that restrict access by users in france.the boundary line between what is permitted and not permitted is somewhat uncertain for users in france.but there is no uncertainty about whether the orders apply to access by users in the united states.they do not.they say nothing whatsoever about restricting access by users in the united states.
the dissent conclusion that the french court orders are unconstitutional may be based in part on an assumption that a necessary consequence of compliance with the french court orders will be restricted access by users in the united states.but if this is the basis for the dissent conclusion,it could hardly say that the orders are unconstitutional on their face.whether restricted access by users in the united states is a necessary consequence of the french court orders is a factual question that we can not answer on the current record.
if the only consequence of compliance with the french court orders is to restrict access by internet users in france,only argument is that the first amendment has extraterritorial effect.the dissent fails to acknowledge that this is inescapably a central part of argument,let alone acknowledge that it may be only argument.
remand to the district court 
as a fallback position,the dissent contends that we should remand to the district court for a determination whether a necessary consequence of compliance with the french court orders would be restriction on access by users in the united states.this fallback contention is,of course,in tension with the dissent conclusion that the french court orders are unconstitutional on their face.
if a necessary consequence of compliance with the french court orders were a restriction on access by american users,this would be a different and much easier case.the dissent argues that we should remand to the district court to determine whether this is a necessary consequence.but we can not obtain this determination merely by remanding to the district court.before the district court can engage in useful factfinding,it must know whether or to what extent has already sufficiently complied with the french court interim orders.there are two alternative scenarios.
first,if the french court were to conclude,as licra and uejf contend,that has already complied in large measure with the french court orders,simply has no first amendment argument.has explicitly stated that its change of policy after the entry of the second interim order was undertaken for reasons entirely independent of the french court orders.under this scenario,the question of compliance would disappear,and the district court would have no factfinding role.
second,if the french court were to determine,contrary to licra and uejf contention,that has not complied in large measure,the question of the necessary consequences for american users would then arise.if and when the french court determines what further compliance is necessary,there might be some appropriate factfinding role for the district court on that question.but even under this scenario,we first need to get a determination from the french court as to what further compliance is necessary,for the district court factfinding role is dependent on there having been such a prior determination by the french court.
under either scenario,the essential initial step is to find out from the french court whether has complied in large measure with its orders,and,if not,what further compliance is required.until we know that,the district court can not perform any useful factfinding on the question of whether a necessary consequence of compliance with the french court orders will be to restrict access by internet users in the united states.
conclusion 
first amendment issues arising out of international internet use are new,important and difficult.we should not rush to decide such issues based on an inadequate,incomplete or unclear record.we should proceed carefully,with awareness of the limitations of our judicial competence,in this undeveloped area of the law.precisely because of the novelty,importance and difficulty of the first amendment issues seeks to litigate,we should scrupulously observe the prudential limitations on the exercise of our power.
wants a decision providing broad first amendment protection for speech and activities on the internet that might violate the laws or offend the sensibilities of other countries.as currently framed,however,suit comes perilously close to a request for a forbidden advisory opinion.there was a live dispute when first filed suit in federal district court,but soon thereafter voluntarily changed its policy to comply,at least in part,with the commands of the french court interim orders.this change in policy may or may not have mooted federal suit,but it has at least come close.unless and until changes its policy again,and thereby more clearly violates the french court orders,it is unclear how much is now actually in dispute.
it is possible that because of voluntary change of policy it has now complied in large measure with the french court orders.it is also possible that has not yet complied in large measure.if further compliance is required,will have to impose further restrictions on access by french users.the necessary consequence of such further restrictions on french users may or may not be that will have to impose restrictions on access by american users.until we know whether further restrictions on access by french,and possibly american,users are required,we can not decide whether or to what degree the first amendment might be violated by enforcement of the french court orders,and whether such enforcement would be repugnant to california public policy.we do not know whether further restrictions are required,and what they might be,because has chosen not to ask the french court.instead,it has chosen to come home to ask for a declaratory judgment that the french court they may or may not require,and whatever first amendment questions they may or may not unenforceable in the united states.
an majority of the en banc panel holds,as explained in part ii of this opinion,that the district court properly exercised specific personal jurisdiction over defendants licra and uejf under the criteria of calder.a plurality of the panel concludes,as explained in part iii of this opinion,that the suit is unripe for decision under the criteria of abbott laboratories.when the votes of the three judges who conclude that the suit is unripe are combined with the votes of the three dissenting judges who conclude that there is no personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf,there are six votes to dismiss suit.
we therefore reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
i concur that the district court judgment in favor of should be reversed and the case dismissed,but i do so based on reasons other than those set forth by the majority.i do not believe that lack of ripeness is the proper ground to dismiss suit.instead,i believe that the district court did not properly exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants and also should have abstained from deciding claims.suit should be dismissed,therefore,either under rule b or rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the district court did not properly exercise personal jurisdiction over la ligue contre le racisme et licra and des etudiants juifs de france uejf.licra and uejf suit was not expressly aimed at california under the effects test of calder jones,d,which,i agree with judge fletcher,governs this case and may be appropriately applied to the french court orders.
an intentional act aimed exclusively at a location other than the forum state,which results in harm to a plaintiff in the forum state,does not satisfy the express aiming requirement under calder.in schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir,an ohio car dealer ran an advertisement in the akron beacon journal that featured arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator without first seeking schwarzenegger permission.we held that the advertisement,though it wrongfully depicted schwarzenegger,a california resident,was expressly aimed at ohio rather than california.id.at.because the dealer express aim was local,the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear schwarzenegger complaint.id.dole food,watts,cir finding that european defendants expressly aimed at california,the forum state,since they communicated directly with dole california managers to fraudulently induce them to enter into significant and detrimental contractual arrangements bancroft masters,augusta,cir deciding that defendant letter was expressly aimed at california,the forum state,because it individually targeted bancroft masters,a california corporation doing business almost exclusively in california.
the majority provides a explanation for why licra and uejf suit was expressly aimed at california the suit sought,and the french court granted,orders directing to perform significant acts in california.op.at.
that is not true.licra and uejf suit sought french court orders directing to perform significant acts locally in france,not in california.the may,interim order declares b y permitting objects to be viewed in france and allowing surfers located in france to participate in such a display of items for sale,the company is therefore committing a wrong in the territory of france,a wrong whose unintentional character is averred but which has caused damage to be suffered by licra and uejf,both of whom are dedicated to combating all forms of promotion of nazism in france.emphases added.
to comply with french law,would need to prevent surfers calling from france from viewing these services on their computer screen to identify the geographical origin of a visiting site from the caller ip address,which should enable it to prevent surfers calling from france from accessing services and sites which,when displayed on a screen installed in france,is liable to be deemed an offence in france to constitute a manifestly unlawful trouble under french law and to take all measures to dissuade and make impossible any access by a surfer calling from france to disputed sites and services of which the title content constitutes a threat to internal public order.emphases added.
there is no evidence whatsoever that licra and uejf had any intention to expressly aim their suit at california.the majority believes that because the effect of the french court orders was for to perform significant acts in california,express aiming on the part of licra and uejf was obvious.op.at.but the majority fails to recognize what schwarzenegger makes clear express aiming requires intentional conduct by a party directed at the forum state.licra and uejf are two french civil liberties organizations.is a global internet service.at the time licra and uejf brought their suit,they could not precisely have known of server locations,security capabilities,or technical procedures or,more important,how they relate to operations.licra and uejf had one aim and one aim only to prevent french citizens from using and to access illegal hate merchandise in france.they were plainly concerned with actions within france,regardless of where those actions emanated from.
it may be true that licra and uejf intentional suit eventually caused harm to in california,and licra and uejf may have known that was based in california.but this does not confer jurisdiction,for licra and uejf express aim was local.schwarzenegger,at.
the district court should have also abstained from deciding claims.

in philippine bank,a dispute arose between a class of plaintiffs and the republic of philippines over the right to the assets of philippine president ferdinand marcos estate.id.at.the class obtained a large judgment in a federal district court in hawaii against the marcos estate for human rights violations by the marcos regime.at the same time,the republic of philippines brought suit in the philippines seeking forfeiture of the marcos estate assets on the ground that they were stolen by marcos from the philippine government and its people.id.at.the philippine supreme court agreed with the republic of philippines and ordered the assets to be forfeited to the philippine government.id.a federal district court in hawaii,however,ruled that the philippine supreme court judgment violated the due process rights of the class of plaintiffs and was entitled to no judicial deference.id.at.
we disagreed and held that the philippine supreme court judgment was an act of state because it effectuated the statutory mandate of the philippine government to recover property allegedly stolen from the treasury.id.at quoting in re estate of ferdinand marcos human rights,cir.significantly,we held that the collection efforts of the republic of philippines,even though they extended beyond philippine borders into singapore,were governmental,and the philippine supreme court decision upholding those efforts was therefore an act of state.philippine bank,at t he republic interest in the enforcement of its law does not end at its borders quoting callejo bancomer,cir.
like the philippine forfeiture judgment,both french court orders at issue in this case constitute acts of state.three factors lead to this conclusion.first,while licra and uejf were private french litigants,they were acting as,associations and institutional partners with the french government in fighting their injunctive actions against clearly followed the french government mandate to enforce le nouveau code penal art.nazi symbols act,a criminal provision.the record makes clear,for example,that licra and uejf litigated with the assistance of pierre dillange,first deputy prosecutor representing the office of the public prosecutor to the county court of paris.dillange,in fact,demand ed to the french court that the reality of the damages suffered by licra and uejf be recognised.prior to the issuance of the french court orders,dillange publicly condemned the sale of nazi memorabilia on and calling for constraints and an injunction against licra and uejf litigated their claims in accordance with the demands of the french public prosecutor.
second,french justice gomez expressly recognized in his court orders the compelling interest of france to rid its country of merchandise and speech within its borders.in his may,interim order,for example,he called the largest vehicle in existence for the promotion of nazism and described the commercial sale of nazi objects as an affront to the collective memory of a country profoundly traumatized by the atrocities committed by and in the name of the criminal nazi regime against its citizens.access to nazi memorabilia on auction sites constitute d a threat to internal public order and a wrong in the territory of france.like the philippine supreme court,the french court here gave clear effect to the collective efforts of french civil liberties organizations,the french government,and french law enforcement to enforce french criminal provisions against.justice gomez opinion sets forth the moral judgment of france itself.
third,the french court orders reflected judicial enforcement of a robust french state policy against racism,xenophobia,and.france has acceded to the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination icefrd and the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr,both of which include provisions against racist speech.see iccpr,icefrd,a.since world war ii,france has introduced sweeping legislation to combat.in july it passed loi pléven,which criminalized a range of racist behavior from racial defamation and provocation to racial hatred and violence,and in july it passed loi,which criminalized speech that denied the existence of the holocaust or that celebrated nazism.the nazi symbols act,which was found guilty of violating,encompassed france earlier dramatic efforts to criminalize racist speech within its borders.
it is apparent then that the french court orders were not merely private judgments but,in fact,reflected the sentiments of two french civil liberties organizations,the french public prosecutor,and,indeed,france itself.they were acts of state 
the district judge sitting in san jose,california did not have the authority to second guess these orders and should have abstained from invalidating them.he should have deferred to the executive and congress to assess the foreign consequences of france broad policy against hate speech.see siderman de blake republic of argentina,cir the act of state doctrine reflects the prudential concern that the courts,if they question the validity of foreign acts taken by sovereign states,may be interfering with the conduct of american foreign policy by the executive and congress.footnote and citations omitted.our current government,in fact,is already fully committed to monitoring and combating throughout the world.
the criminal statutes of most nations do not comport with the constitution.that does not give judges in this country the unfettered authority to pass critical judgment on their validity,especially where,as here,the criminal statute embodies the determined will of a foreign sovereign to protect its borders from what it deems as morally reprehensible speech of the worst order.
our requirement that a defendant have purposefully availed himself of the protections and benefits of the forum state,or have purposefully directed his activities into the forum state,must be read in light of the supreme court admonition in milliken meyer,that the exercise of personal jurisdiction must comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.at.because i can not agree that california exercise of personal jurisdiction over la ligue contre le racisme et licra and des etudiants juifs de france uejf comports with those basic principles,i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion while concurring in its conclusion that suit must be dismissed.for similar reasons,i concur in judge tashima concurrence and in part i of judge ferguson concurrence.
a state jurisdiction is defined not by force or influence but by physical territory and its judicial power traditionally extended over only those persons and property within its borders.see pennoyer neff.the idea of minimum contacts developed as a surrogate for actual presence in a state but did not alter the essentially territorial nature of jurisdiction.the question in every personal jurisdiction case,then,is whether an individual contacts with the forum state are so substantial that they render the extension of sovereign power just,notwithstanding his lack of physical presence there.
the personal jurisdiction requirement is not merely a rule of civil procedure it is a constitutional constraint on the powers of a state,as exercised by its courts,in favor of the due process rights of the individual.see omni capital int l rudolf wolff,d the requirement that a court have personal jurisdiction flows not from article iii,but from the due process clause.it represents a restriction on judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty,but as a matter of individual liberty.grounded in the fourteenth amendment protection of the processes necessary to ensure basic fairness in the application of the law,the requirement that an individual have certain minimum contacts with the relevant forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,international shoe washington.quoting milliken,at,protects him from the unpredictable and burdensome exercise of authority by foreign courts.it follows from this that the rights and interests of and the interests of the state of california,if not irrelevant to the inquiry,are clearly subordinate to the rights of licra and uejf,the parties against whom jurisdiction is asserted and whose rights are protected by the due process clause.
the supreme court has advised that 
the constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts in the forum state.although it has been argued that foreseeability of causing injury in another state should be sufficient to establish such contacts there when policy considerations so require,the court has consistently held that this kind of foreseeability is not a sufficient benchmark for exercising personal jurisdiction.instead,the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is that the defendant conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.
burger king rudzewicz,d emphases added.by requiring that individuals have fair warning that a particular activity may subject them to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,shaffer heitner,d stevens,concurring in judgment,the due process clause gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.volkswagen woodson,d.
the supreme court has never approved such a radical extension of personal jurisdiction as would sanction the majority holding that,by litigating a bona fide claim in a foreign court and receiving a favorable judgment,a foreign party automatically assents to being haled into court in the other litigant home forum.such a result can not be reconciled with the constitutional touchstone of foreseeability that the defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in the forum.burger king,at.
in calder jones,d,the defendants should reasonably have expected that,by circulating a libelous story in california about a california celebrity,they would be haled into court in california to answer for their tortious behavior.and in burger king,because the defendants business ties with the state of florida were shielded by the benefits and protections of florida laws,it was presumptively not unreasonable to require them to submit to the burdens of litigation there as well.at.these cases stake out the limits of personal jurisdiction as approved by the supreme court.
licra and uejf actions lie beyond that limit.neither party has ever carried on business or any other activity through which they have availed themselves of the benefits and protections of california laws nor should either party have reasonably anticipated that it would be haled into court in california to answer for the legitimate exercise of its rights in france.
this case was reheard en banc primarily for the purpose of answering the question of whether the underlying action in a case must be tortious or otherwise wrongful to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction,or whether the express aiming of any action,regardless of culpability,will suffice although the resolution of that question does not affect my conclusion that california can not exercise personal jurisdiction over licra or uejf,i respectfully disagree with the majority interpretation of calder on this point.
under the majority reading of calder,acts giving rise to personal jurisdiction in a case need not be wrongful.op.at w e do not read calder necessarily to require in purposeful direction cases that all or even any jurisdictionally relevant effects have been caused by wrongful acts.that conclusion is undermined by the language of calder itself and requires the majority to divorce that case holding from its a dubious exercise.in calder,the supreme court affirmed a decision that had concluded that a valid basis for jurisdiction existed on the theory that petitioners intended to,and did,cause tortious injury to respondent in california.calder.at emphasis added.the court itself held that i n this case,petitioners are primary participants in an alleged wrongdoing intentionally directed at a california resident,and jurisdiction is proper on that basis.id.at emphasis added.the wrongfulness of the defendants acts was,therefore,a key element in the jurisdictional calculus,possibly because a person who has committed a wrongful act should expect to be haled into court by his victim in the victim home state.although the court might have reached the same result if the act in question had not been the majority apparently presumes it is reckless of us to proceed on the basis of such speculation beyond what is currently the farthest reach of personal jurisdiction approved by the court.
the majority jurisdictional legerdemain is nimble but,like any trick,does not stand up to close scrutiny.it begins innocuously enough by noting that the traditional analysis of minimum contacts depends on whether the disputed act sounds in tort or in contract.in tort cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully direct s his activities at the forum state,op.at.and in commercial and contract cases,we typically inquire whether a defendant purposefully avails itself sic of the privilege of conducting activities or consummate s a transaction in the forum.id.and do not require that the defendants actions be wrongful.however,that traditional distinction is abruptly jettisoned when the majority next asserts that in any personal jurisdiction case we must evaluate all of a defendant contacts with the forum state,whether or not those contacts involve wrongful activity by the defendant.id.at emphases added.
the majority statement is,quite literally,unprecedented.with a stroke of its pen,the majority extends the analysis previously applied only to commercial and contract cases to all assertions of personal jurisdiction.tellingly,the only cases that the majority musters in support of its novel assertion are commercial or purposeful availment cases.in quill north dakota,d,the supreme court held that when an mail order company purposefully avails itself of the benefits of an economic market in the forum state,it may subject itself to the state in personam jurisdiction even if it has no physical presence in the state.at.and,in burger king,the court held that jurisdiction was proper on the grounds that defendants business ties with the state of florida were shielded by the benefits and protections of florida laws.at.in sharp contrast,every purposeful direction case that the majority cites in its opinion involved tortious or otherwise wrongful acts by the defendants.
given our long line of precedent applying the purposeful availment test only in contract and commercial cases,and the majority concession that this case should be analyzed under calder purposeful direction test,see op.at,the majority conflation of the elements of these two tests is an unseemly act of judicial slight of hand.licra and uejf are,indisputably,actors who have never purposefully availed themselves of the benefits or protections of california laws.therefore,neither calder nor any other supreme court precedent justifies california assertion of personal jurisdiction over them.
licra and uejf actions and contacts with the state of california were,at most,incidental to the legitimate exercise of their rights under french law.they should not have reasonably anticipated being haled into court in california to answer for their prosecution of a lawsuit in france.because california exercise of personal jurisdiction over them on that basis would violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and,therefore,the procedural guarantees of the due process clause,i would remand the case with instructions to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction and not reach the issue of ripeness.
thus,while i must dissent from its rationale,i concur in the majority conclusion that the district court opinion must be reversed.
i concur in the judgment reversing and remanding with instructions to dismiss this action,but i dissent from the majority conclusion that personal jurisdiction exists over la ligue contre le racisme et licra and des etudiants juifs de france uejf.i therefore concur in part i of judge ferguson concurring a district court located in california can not exercise personal jurisdiction over licra and uejf.
because i believe that the district court lacked in personam jurisdiction,i would not reach the issues discussed in part iii of the majority opinion part ii of judge ferguson concurring,even if it had jurisdiction over the defendants,the district court should have abstained from deciding this case.i do believe,however,that judge ferguson eloquent discussion in part ii of the reasons why he would hold that abstention is proper further supports why personal jurisdiction is lacking in this case.
licra and uejf defendants had only three contacts with california.these contacts were a cease and desist letter,the service of process to commence the french action,and the subsequent service of two interim orders on.service was made in accordance with the requirements of the hague convention on the service abroad of judicial documents.as the majority rightly acknowledges,these contacts are an insufficient basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants.op.at.
the majority goes on,however,to find a sufficient basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants in two interim orders issued by the french court because those orders direct ed to take actions in california,on threat of a substantial penalty.id.at.the majority conclusion is not based on any contact with california,but on acts which it contends were expressly aimed at the forum state.id.quoting schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir.but neither schwarzenegger nor any other case relied on by the majority based a finding of specific jurisdiction on conduct expressly aimed at the forum state which conduct was not also a contact with the forum state.here,for the first time,the majority completely divorces the conduct from the requirement that that conduct also be a contact with the forum state.thus,i submit that the finding of personal jurisdiction on the basis of calder effects test in the circumstances of this case is a radical extension of that doctrine.
it is that the orders are the orders of the french court,not acts of defendants.thus,more precisely,the majority finding of personal jurisdiction is,in fact,based on licra and uejf petitioning the french court for relief under french law.but should the petitioning by a citizen of the courts of his or her own country to uphold the laws of that country form the sole basis of personal jurisdiction over that citizen by the courts of a foreign country the majority answer is yes.that answer,seems to me,to be perverse.first,the bringing and prosecuting of an action in a french court are all acts done wholly in france.none of these acts constitutes a contact with california.second,no citizen of any country can safely sue a foreign defendant under the majority theory of specific jurisdiction because the sought judgment,including an ordinary money judgment for injury or damages,will have an adverse effect on the defendant purse or treasury in that defendant home country.in this sense,every lawsuit naming a foreign defendant can be said to be expressly aimed at that defendant home state or nation.thus,unless it is anchored to a contact with the forum,express aiming becomes a meaningless test in terms of due process.
moreover,courts,even when acting at the behest of a private petitioner,have an independent interest and obligation to uphold their nations domestic laws,particularly when,as here,those laws are designed to carry out an important and national policy.thus,as judge ferguson reminds us,it is the manner in which the french courts have determined to vindicate french national state action that has the adverse effect in california that is complaining about,not the acts of defendants in petitioning for french laws to be upheld.it was not defendants who determined the terms and scope of injunctive relief,nor was it defendants who determined that continuing should be subject to a penalty,or the amount of such a penalty.needless to say,defendants will not be the ones who decide whether such penalties ultimately will have to be paid or waived 
whatever other conduct calder effects test was intended to encompass,it surely was not intended to include attribution of the effects of an intervening court order when a citizen does no more that petition a court in his own country for relief under domestic law,particularly in a case,such as this,in which defendants have had no contact that would provide a sufficient basis for jurisdiction.op.at.for these additional reasons,i concur in part i of judge ferguson concurring opinion.
stated simply,the issue before us is whether a united states internet service provider,whose published content has been restricted by a foreign court injunction,may look to the united states federal courts to determine the enforceability of those restrictions under the united states constitution first amendment.the french injunctive by substantial,retroactive monetary penalties for to block access from french territory to material on its website some prohibited content is readily identifiable,such as nazi artifacts or copies of mein kampf.much,however,is not.the orders impose the following sweeping mandate 
we order the company to take all necessary measures to dissuade and render impossible any access via to the nazi artifact auction service and to any other site or service that may be construed as constituting an apology for nazism or a contesting of nazi crimes.
emphasis added.in traditional first amendment terms,this injunctive mandate is a prior restraint on what may post or control access to on its under principles of french law and in such facially vague and overbroad terms that even the majority does not know whether further restrictions on access by french,and possibly american,users are required to comply with the french orders.op.at.can either hope to comply with what the french court and the defendants here deems to be inappropriate content by attempting to block access to material thinks the orders cover or by simply removing any questionable content altogether.or can ignore the french court mandate in whole or in part and accept the risk of substantial accruing fines.the majority,however,is unmoved.for it,proper recourse is to take its case back to france.we can not agree.
as the district court readily concluded in its thoughtful opinion,a united states court constitutionally could not make such an order,la ligue contre le racisme et,d,hereinafter yahoo ii.it specifically found that the orders are far too general and imprecise to survive the strict scrutiny required by the first amendment,and that p hrases such as all necessary measures and render impossible instruct to undertake efforts that will impermissibly chill and perhaps even censor protected speech.yahoo ii,d at citing bd.of airport comm rs jews for jesus,d and gooding wilson,d.the district court emphasized that t he loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.id.at quoting elrod burns,d citing new york times united states,d.
the issue is not whether the french defendants who obtained the injunctive orders,or the french court that issued them,are justified in trying to suppress hateful speech.we of course recognize the horrors of the holocaust and the scourge of,and france understandable interest in protecting its citizens from those who would defend or glorify either.nor is the issue one of application of the first amendment if anything,it is the application of french law to the united states.we do not question the validity of the french orders on french soil,and has complied with the orders as they relate to its website.rather the question we face in this federal lawsuit is whether our own country fundamental constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech protects and,derivatively,at least its users in the united states against some or all of the restraints the french defendants have deliberately imposed upon it within the united states.p rior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights.tory cochran,d quoting.press ass stuart,d.
the majority,after properly opening the door to the federal courthouse by upholding personal jurisdiction,nonetheless turns a blind eye to the constitutional free speech interests of,throwing it out of court because those interests are not ripe for adjudication.the majority thesis rests on the contention that the french orders do not by their terms limit access by users outside france in any way.op.at.but as the majority recognizes elsewhere in its opinion op.at,the crux of this case is not in the words of the order alone,but in their application.and to assess the effects of the orders,one can not simply disregard the what of the orders and focus only on their who.
as we shall explain later,we disagree with the majority conclusion that uncertainties about whether can technologically isolate the effects of the orders only to users compel us to withdraw the case from the district court.even assuming such uncertainties exist and are material,the district court is fully capable of exercising its factfinding role to resolve them.but there is no uncertainty that the mandate imposed on is also content based,and the orders identify that content in terms that on their face are overbroad and vague.they require to guess what has to be censored on its internet services here in the united states,under threat of monetary sanction if it guesses wrong.in that respect,the orders are facially unconstitutional.
by their terms,the orders reach any other site or service in addition to the auction service that may be construed as constituting an apology for nazism or a contesting of nazi crimes.emphasis added.as the district court rightly understood,this is the crux of facial overbreadth and vagueness concern 
seeks protection for its actions in the united states,specifically the ways in which it configures and operates its auction and sites.moreover,the french order requires not only to render it impossible for french citizens to access the proscribed content but also to interpret an impermissibly overbroad and vague definition of the content that is proscribed in light of the court conclusion that enforcement of the french order by a united states court would be inconsistent with the first amendment,the factual question of whether possesses the technology to comply with the order is immaterial.even assuming for purposes of the present motion that does possess such technology,compliance still would involve an impermissible restriction on speech 
yahoo ii,d at emphasis added.
surely the majority is not suggesting that has no first amendment protection from being sanctioned when it could not guess or it guessed wrong as to what it was supposed to censor on its domestic if limited to users.and if not so limited,so much the worse.yet the majority faults do not know whether its current activities are permitted by the orders.op.at.this is to apply first amendment precedents exactly backwards.as the majority admits,t he boundary line between what is permitted and not permitted is somewhat uncertain for users in france.op.at.under such circumstances,we blame the law,not the speaker.
instead,the majority effectively imposes an exhaustion requirement on to litigate this issue in france,confirm that it is still is not in compliance with the orders just as it was not on may and november,and obtain a final adverse judgment before the majority will consider this case ripe.in doing so,the majority imposes a heightened standard on a plaintiff seeking to vindicate its first amendment rights when that plaintiff is challenging a foreign prior restraint.principles of ripeness or comity do not require this result.the extraordinary hurdles the majority creates are inconsistent with our established jurisprudence protecting this country tradition of free expression.see,city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d holding that a plaintiff need not have applied and been denied a newspaper rack license before challenging a city ordinance as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.to say so is not to deny france interests in protecting its own citizens from harmful speech,but only to recognize that federal courts have the duty to adjudicate and uphold the legitimate constitutional rights of litigants who have properly invoked our federal jurisdiction.
in correctly sustaining personal jurisdiction over the defendants and in finding an article iii case or controversy,the majority concedes the central dilemma faces as a result of the french injunction.w hile does not independently wish to take steps to comply more fully with the french court orders,it states that it fears that it may be subject to a substantial and increasing fine if it does not.op.at.acknowledging the obvious chilling effect of the injunction,the majority recognizes that e ven if the french court orders are not enforced against,the very existence of those orders may be thought to cast a shadow on the legality of current policy.op.at.
but unfortunately the majority then stops short,concluding that the level of harm suffered by is not sufficient to overcome the factual uncertainty bearing on the legal question presented and thereby to render this suit ripe.op.at.with respect,the majority creates its own factual bad first amendment its attempt to find daylight between its holdings on personal jurisdiction and ripeness.we agree that the calder effects test,see schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir citing calder jones,d,need not be satisfied by the same degree of harm as ripeness op.at,but the majority rationale for finding the harm sufficient in one instance and deficient in the other is seriously flawed.
by peremptorily terminating access to federal court,the majority establishes a new and burdensome standard for vindicating first amendment rights in the internet context,threatening the internet vitality as a medium for robust,open debate.it also bypasses the factfinding role of the district to credit much of what the district court found on the record as litigated below,and removing the district court from the process of resolving the factual issues the majority now finds so vital to first amendment claims.accordingly,although we concur in that part of the majority opinion upholding personal and article iii jurisdiction,we respectfully dissent from its ultimate holding that this case is not ripe for adjudication.
ii.prudential ripeness 
the majority invokes prudential ripeness because it finds circumstances suffer from prematurity and abstractness that preclude our reaching claim that the french injunction on its face violates the first amendment.op.at.as did the district court,we conclude otherwise.
fitness of the issues for judicial resolution 
a purely legal question 
the majority holds this case unfit for judicial resolution by suggesting that it does not involve a purely legal question,abbott laboratories gardner,d,but instead requires us to sort through factual uncertainties,which ultimately make adjudication inappropriate.op.at.yet even if the majority were correct that case suffers from a lack of factual development,it does not follow that the suit is therefore rendered unripe.when a dispositive fact is missing from the district court record,we usually remand for further factfinding.we do not peremptorily throw litigants out of court and expect them to petition a foreign court for relief.
to begin with,this case fundamentally involves a legal question whether the french injunction as ordered against runs afoul of the first amendment.the answer calls for a legal application of free speech doctrine to final orders that on their face are vague and overbroad.true,the defendants must take steps in the french court to initiate actual enforcement,but is subject to the orders and to a retrospective financial penalty for noncompliance.the majority argument that we should give weight to the label interim because it indicates that the french court contemplated that it might enter later orders is a.op.at.a court may contemplate issuing subsequent orders whether or not a prior order on the subject is called interim or final.we need not be distracted by the label interim,because,as the district court found,there is no dispute that the french order is valid under french law and that the french court may fix a penalty retroactive to the date of the order.yahoo ii,d at.
cases involving far less definitive or targeted yet enforced against the complaining been treated as final actions ripe for adjudication.in abbott laboratories,one of the majority lynchpin cases,drug manufacturers challenged the food and drug commissioner regulation requiring that their products labels show both a drug generic and its brand name.the supreme court,addressing the purely legal issue presented,held that the regulation was a final agency action,even though it was a statement of general applicability and violations of the new rule could be enforced only by the attorney general authorizing criminal and seizure actions.at.the court held the case ripe for review because the commissioner labeling order placed petitioners in a dilemma that it was the very purpose of the declaratory judgment act to ameliorate.id.at.the court cited the district court finding that petitioners either must comply with the label changeovers or they must follow their present course and risk prosecution and concluded that the latter course would risk serious criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful distribution of misbranded drugs.id.at.see also frozen food express united states.holding justiciable a challenge to an interstate commerce commission rule because violations could be punished by criminal sanctions and the rule itself would cause companies to conform their behavior to the regulation united states storer broadcasting.finding standing to challenge a federal communications commission rule limiting radio licenses even though the broadcaster had not yet received an unfavorable decision 
the final,targeted injunction before us presents the same kind of purely legal confronting the dilemma of whether or not to stand by its united states constitutional rights or constrain its speech and that of its users to avoid a penalty.legions of cases permit first amendment challenges to governmental actions or decrees that on their face are vague,overbroad and threaten to chill protected speech.indeed,the sweeping injunction here presents just such a paradigmatic case.see,freedom to travel campaign newcomb,cir rejecting a ripeness defense to a facial attack on blanket travel restrictions to cuba under the first and fifth amendments,even though the plaintiff group had never applied for a license,because the case presented purely legal questions see also forsyth county,nationalist movement,d addressing a facial first amendment challenge to a licensing scheme even though the plaintiff had never applied for a permit,citing numerous first amendment cases involving facial claims steffel thompson,d concluding that petitioner had established an actual controversy based on his threatened criminal trespass arrest by state police for distributing political handbills and holding that he did not need to first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.seeks nothing more than for a united states court to resolve its legal claim that the french court injunction by its very whole or in protected speech.see naacp,region city of richmond,cir upholding standing to bring facial challenge to substantially overbroad city parade ordinance.
comity and the repugnance of unconstitutional injunctions 
we do not agree with the majority professed uncertainties as to whether a california court,under principles of comity,would be inclined to enforce a foreign court order that infringes upon a corporation first amendment rights.the repugnancy standard the majority invokes is easily satisfied here.california case law and its federal underpinnings tell us to honor foreign court judgments unless they prejudice the rights of united states citizens or violate domestic public policy.in re stephanie,cal th,d,citing hilton guyot.and victrix salen dry cargo,cir.the french orders on their by putting at risk of substantial the first amendment and are plainly contrary to one of america,and by extension california,most cherished public policies in short,they constitute a foreign judgment that is repugnant to public policy.op.at.
the district court considered the role of comity but ultimately found that it was outweighed by constitutional freedoms.although france has the sovereign right to regulate what speech is permissible in france,this court may not enforce a foreign order that violates the protections of the united states constitution by chilling protected speech that occurs simultaneously within our borders.yahoo ii,d at.this finding does not mean that every foreign court judgment implicating speech in the united states would be deemed repugnant to american public policy and therefore unenforceable,but this particular judgment is so vague and overbroad that it fails the repugnancy analysis.significantly,the defendants do not argue to us that the french injunction comports with the first amendment.indeed,they did not even appeal the district court ultimate finding that the orders are unconstitutional.
the majority goes to great lengths to avoid labeling a prior restraint on and vague by its repugnant to public policy and is content to leave in place foreign court orders that so obviously violate the first amendment.op.at.in reaching this result,the majority has succumbed to an error of logic.it has conflated foreign orders that are somewhat inconsistent with law with those that violate law.it is one thing for courts to pass on foreign attorney fees larger than what domestic laws would award,see in re hashim,cir,or to recognize a judgment pursuant to a foreign statute of limitations longer than that of its domestic analogue,see milhoux linder.it is quite another to imply,as the majority does,that a violation of the constitution is no different from any other i nconsistency with american law,which the majority claims is not necessarily enough to prevent recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment in the united states.op.at.
neither in re hashim nor milhoux implicated federal or state constitutional rights.indeed,both cases held that the foreign judgments being challenged were not repugnant to the public policy of either arizona or colorado,respectively.where a foreign judgment was held to be repugnant to california public policy,the repugnancy was based on the violation of california uniform child custody jurisdiction act that would have resulted had the foreign order been enforced.see in re stephanie,d,at.the majority provides no explanation why the california courts would refuse to enforce a foreign judgment that violated a state statute,yet be willing to enforce a foreign judgment that violates the federal and perhaps the state constitution.
the majority dictum implying that foreign judgments that would be unconstitutional if entered by a court may nonetheless be enforceable is troubling.under the principles articulated today,a foreign party can use a foreign court decree to censor free speech here in the united states on any range of subjects it finds,democracy,gender the name of enforcing its own country laws.the good intentions of even sympathetic foreign parties such as licra and uejf in this case are not the standard.how could a california court honor the french defendants good intentions in proscribing speech when the city of paul good intentions did not cure its speech code of viewpoint discrimination and constitutional infirmity even when directed at see city of paul,d paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle,while requiring the other to follow marquis of queensberry rules.see also collin smith,cir,cert.denied,d striking down on first amendment grounds several skokie,illinois ordinances prohibiting the national socialist party of america from marching through the town first amendment rights are truly precious and fundamental to our national life it is,after all,in part the fact that our constitutional system protects minorities unpopular at a particular time or place from governmental harassment and intimidation,that distinguishes life in this country from life under the third reich.

the alleged lack of factual development 
even accepting the majority assumption that this case does not turn on purely legal issues,the concerns the majority invokes as reasons to withhold judicial resolution are either unconvincing or at most reasons for remand.for instance,the majority seems to call into question whether the french court injunction is sufficiently final because the orders are labeled interim,notwithstanding their unconditional and mandatory language.op.at.in considering whether the injunction survives laws,we must take the orders issued by the french court as final actions,reflecting that court view of conduct and current obligations under french law.there is no reason for us to assume that the french court intends something different from the words of its own mandatory as we would not assume that a federal or state court would not stand by an injunctive order it has issued.
moreover,by insisting on withholding judicial resolution,the majority disregards the district court factual determinations,and its role in resolving factual disputes.first,with respect to the content at issue,the majority minimizes the district court findings that hosts content violating the specific terms of the orders.as the district court found,continues to offer at least some third reich memorabilia as well as mein kampf on its auction site and permits access to numerous web pages with and content.yahoo ii,d at.the district court took judicial notice from its own search of the site in october that using the keyword nazi called up items posted for sale,such as stamps,coins and a copy of mein kampf.id.at.the district court also conducted keyword searches on general website,finding thousands of sites referring to jewish conspiracy,promoting nazism or suggesting the holocaust did not happen.id.at 
clouding the majority view of the facts are the defendants assertions before us and in the district court that they have no present intention of taking legal action against in the united states because they consider to be in substantial compliance with the french order.yahoo ii,d at.but the french court has never made such a determination of alleged compliance.instead,the majority speculates that because france has complied in france in large measure with the spirit and letter of the may french order,compliance in large measure by is very likely to be satisfactory to the french court.op.at.but is not france,and the french court did not explain the factual basis for its finding of compliance.
nor have the defendants ever taken any steps to stipulate in a legal forum that is in compliance with the injunction.thus the district court properly gave no weight to the defendants professions of substantial compliance.the court pointedly observed that the defendants have not taken steps available to them under french law to seek withdrawal of the orders or to petition the french court to absolve from any penalty,yahoo ii,d at,and they gave no indication they would pursue such measures when pressed on the subject.id.at.
during oral argument before us,defense counsel conceded that the defendants did not want to foreclose their options by agreeing to such a stipulation.as the majority recognizes op.at,should alter its content in a way that the defendants disapprove of,they want the judicial authority to seek relief and mandate compliance.oral arg.the majority in large part hinges its analysis on the defendants litigation position of saying that they have no problem now with conduct but declining to take any steps to eliminate the speech injunction or accruing financial penalties.see abbott laboratories,at.concluding that the subsequent representation of the department of justice that it was likely to impose only civil sanctions for violations,thus mitigating the harm to the plaintiff,should not suffice to defeat the claim see also culinary workers union,local del papa,cir disregarding attorney general claim that she lacked authority to carry out specific threat of prosecution in holding that a real controversy existed for purposes of article iii.
the majority claims that we do not know whether the french court would hold that is now violating its two interim orders.op at.ironically,the majority thereby highlights the very threat faces.uncertainty about whether the sword of damocles might fall is precisely the reason seeks a determination of its first amendment rights in federal court.see metro.airports auth.citizens for abatement of aircraft noise,d chang united states,cir recognizing that this court does not require damocles sword to fall before it will adjudicate a case.
in sum,the uncertainties faces are not reasons to delay adjudication.rather,they provide a compelling basis for a federal court to hear first amendment challenge at this time,as the district court did.
the fact that does not know whether its efforts to date have met the french court mandate is the precise harm against which the declaratory judgment act is designed to protect.the declaratory judgment act was designed to relieve potential defendants from the damoclean threat of impending litigation which a harassing adversary might brandish,while initiating suit at his leisure or never.
yahoo ii,d at emphasis added instead,the majority turns uncertainties against it to the french courts for clarification and absolution.
substantial hardship of withholding judicial consideration 
even more perplexing is the majority conclusion that does not face substantial hardship because of our unwillingness to adjudicate its first amendment claim.the majority attempts to avoid the obvious chilling effect of an overbroad and vague injunction in two creative and troubling ways.first,the majority opines with some confidence that need not fear the enforcement of a fine because it is exceedingly unlikely that the sword of damocles will ever fall op.at another speculative assessment,we submit.it also faults for failing to proffer examples of anything that it is now not doing but would do if permitted by the orders op.at and thereby imposes a new,higher burden on a first amendment plaintiff to establish a chilling effect.
the french orders chill speech 
first,the majority overlooks claim that it faces actual abridgment of its current just a chilling effect on its web content.as the majority does acknowledge,hosts content on its auction site,including the sale of mein kampf,that is specifically prohibited by the terms of the injunction.the district court findings of impermissible material still present on the auction site demonstrate that is currently engaged in speech that the french their it to foreclose to some users or forgo entirely.opts not to accede to the injunction,thereby incurring daily accumulating fines should its current or future behavior displease licra or uejf.certainly should not have to abstain from conduct it believes is constitutionally protected solely for us to find its claim ripe.city of auburn,at cir noting that finding case unripe would require party to comply with costly and cumbersome franchise requirements,only for the party to then raise exactly the same argument that it makes here.
more importantly,the majority largely ignores the broad and diffuse scope of the french extends well beyond auction site and clearly raises the question whether it is substantively possible for to comply.apart from entirely obvious cases,how can one determine with any certainty whether something may be construed as constituting an apology for nazism or a contesting of nazi crimes the majority makes the rather startling assertion that b efore the district court can engage in useful factfinding,it must know whether or to what extent has already sufficiently complied with the french court interim orders.op.at.of course,this is precisely the crux of highlights the vagueness and overbreadth of the orders.we know the actions has taken and not taken with respect to nazi paraphernalia appearing on its site.the only reason we can not determine whether or to what extent has already sufficiently complied with the french orders is because we can not assess the scope of the orders themselves it is this very kind of uncertainty that epitomizes a purely legal question of facial infringement of first amendment rights and the harms routinely associated with such an infringement.
in plain terms,if no one but the french court can decipher the meaning of its injunction aimed at speech,how can comply has to know what content it has to screen from users.the french orders contain no meaningful instructions for to winnow permitted speech from unpermitted speech.it is the absence of a discernible line between the permitted and the unpermitted that makes the orders facially unconstitutional.as the district court concluded,and as discussed previously,compliance would still involve an impermissible restriction on speech because it would require to interpret the vague and overbroad injunction as to what content is prohibited and which users should be denied access,on pain of substantial penalty should it guess wrong.see yahoo ii,d at.
ultimately,the majority parsimonious treatment of the free speech issues here culminates with its reducing argument to an interest in merely allowing access by users in france to nazi materials.op.at.is allegedly seeking a first amendment right to violate french criminal law and to facilitate the violation of french criminal law by others.op.at.notably,even the defendants have not construed first amendment argument in such crabbed terms.
but suppose really were concerned only with not having to act in the united states as an enforcer of france restrictions on internet access by users.that would not make the constitutional implications of the effects on united states operations go away.can not merely act in france to restrict access by users located in france the french orders require to make changes to its servers and protocols in the united states.that seeks first amendment protection from having to compromise its domestic operations to comply with a foreign injunction does not translate into its seeking the right simply to violate french law.this case is not about the application of the first amendment it is about the application of france denial speech codes and the extent to which compliance may infringe rights of free speech here in the united states.
the majority,however,views the french orders as concerning speech accessible solely by those outside the united states.op.at.additionally,it accepts that can screen out access to any prohibited materials by most estimated to be of users.op.at.this reasoning is flawed in several respects.
first,does not target specific users by initiating content directed solely at them.rather,anyone who logs on to,including users in france,gains access to material on message boards,search engines,auction sites and other services.it is the accessing of vaguely and overbroadly described anyone in french the orders prohibit and hold responsible for preventing.thus,even if one could readily and reliably limit the universe of internet users whose access must be assumption the record before us does not would still be at a loss to define the universe of content it must censor.
second,the factual question of whether it is technologically feasible for to monitor the postings and filter the millions of users accessing the such technology actually bears on first amendment an unresolved issue that should be returned to the district court.the parties have not addressed the specifics of technical feasibility issue on this appeal,nor the validity of the experts report.thus the and figures the majority adopts from that report depend solely on the majority reading of a translated technical and ambiguous document,the scientific merits of which have not been addressed even in the district court.licra and uejf did raise the issue of feasibility below,but the district court denied them discovery regarding technological feasibility of screening users because it deemed the issue immaterial to the court first amendment ruling.see yahoo ii,d at.the defendants have not appealed either the district court first amendment decision or its discovery ruling.to the extent that the technological feasibility issue has been argued at all on appeal,has said that it could not monitor the content of these millions of postings and listings to its internet services and that it essentially faces a binary choice between and paying the french fines.
on the record before expert testimony and,much less district court findings of do not believe we as appellate judges can or should accept as a given that can readily and reliably identify of the users it must censor,irrespective of whether a user sought access to an auction site,or to a site denying the existence of the holocaust or constituting an apology for nazism.op.at.
this is particularly true given that the experts report is replete with hearsay,technological assumptions and disclaimers.most importantly,the experts explicitly limited their analysis to how an internet surfer in france could be prevented from accessing prohibited content only on auction site,not all such content that might find its way onto generally.as the experts own concern about the imprecision of the orders 
the decisions of the french court and the demands made are precisely directed against the auctions site.no grievance against any other sites or services is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the consultants to propose suitable and effective technical solutions.in these circumstances,the consultants will therefore confine their answers to the matter of the auctions site 
emphasis added.the experts also emphasized,t he measures to be taken depend upon the particular case in point.they can not be generalised to all sites and services on the internet.in this case,the site in question is.emphasis added.
of course,the french orders do not solely prohibit content on auction site but,by their terms,encompass content on all of services.services extend far beyond its auction site and include its search engine,classified listings,personal web pages,shopping,message boards,chat rooms and news stories.
the the french court to credit two of the three experts who estimated as many as of users of yahoo auction site could be identified and screened.the methodology underlying this estimate,however,further illustrates the uncertainty of predicting internet identification and screening,compounded by the vague and overbroad mandate of the court orders.assuming that of the ip addresses assigned to french surfers can be matched with certainty to a service provider located in france,and can be filtered,all three experts agreed that no filtering method is capable of identifying all french surfers or surfers connecting from french territory.to reach,two experts relied on a voluntary sworn declaration of nationality by a french surfer that could be made when a first connection is made to a disputed site,in this case the yahoo auctions site emphasis added.they suggested asking for the declaration of nationality at the home page of the auctions site or in the context of a search for nazi objects if the word nazi is included in the user request in short,the experts figure depends on the ability to link users to a specific site and to specific content on that site.
the third expert,vinton cerf,a recipient of the united states national medal of technology for the architecture of the internet disavowed relying on users at all,concluding that it does not appear to be very feasible to rely on discovering the geographic locations of users for purposes of imposing filtering of the kind described in the french court order.
given the orders broad language,none of the experts could devise a system for screening out users that went beyond the auction site.therefore,even if were true that can identify up to of all of its users,irrespective of the site or service they are accessing,the evidence is clear that geographical identification alone would not enable to prohibit such users from accessing of the content proscribed by the french,could not even come close on that side of the compliance equation.
there are other serious questions about the experts report that should be part of an evidentiary hearing in the district court.for example,the screening figure was derived in part from information provided by a french internet association regarding how many of its access providers can identify whether their users are located in france.such anecdotal data do not demonstrate conclusively that itself has the capability to identify the location of its users.
indeed,the method the experts proposed for to identify users is imprecise.the experts noted that for a number of reasons the real world location of a user may not be readily identifiable.for instance,a french citizen who uses aol for internet service may be shown as having an ip address from virginia,where aol network is located.in other instances,users may choose to mask the geographical origin of their internet address.
thus we can not assume,as does the majority,that this case is about restricting access only by french users,of whom are readily identifiable regardless of what content they may seek out on.the validity of these percentage assumptions not only drives the majority definition of whose access is restricted,but also its apparent willingness to assume that even if can identify only of the prohibited universe of users,that would be good enough.if technical feasibility is to be the lynchpin on which day in federal court depends,then let the parties return to the district court for proper factfinding.instead,the majority preempts the district court factfinding function,interpreting the french experts report as conclusive evidence in order to deny access to the court altogether.
lastly,there is the issue of cost of compliance.there can be no dispute that the very nature of the french orders puts to the choice of incurring the costs to develop and implement mechanisms to filter out individual users based on location or removing content from its service altogether.this type of immediate financial burden clearly suffices to make a case ripe for adjudication,even if we accept the majority proposition that the threat of enforcement is remote.see pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d holding ripe for review a preemption challenge to a regulation imposing a moratorium on new nuclear plants because petitioners would face substantial financial hardship if they built plants while hoping the law would be struck down city of auburn qwest,cir noting that finding case unripe would require party to comply with costly and cumbersome franchise requirements 
the enforceability of foreign penal judgments 
recognizing that the risk of a large monetary penalty must inevitably weigh heavily in assessment of its options,the majority tries to neutralize the a protective shield by invoking the doctrine that united states courts will not enforce the penal judgments of other countries.it thus assures that even if the french court were to impose a monetary penalty against,it is exceedingly unlikely that any court in indeed elsewhere in the united enforce it because it is a penal judgment.op.at.
it is true as justice marshall observed that t he courts of no country execute the penal laws of another,the antelope,wheat.but that begs the question whether the french injunction itself or the accruing fines are truly penal.although we respect the majority scholarship,this issue has not been the focus of the parties briefs or arguments,and thus we can not share the majority level of confidence that its dictum is sufficiently we should remove the risk of a substantial,retroactive monetary penalty from the first amendment or ripeness analysis.as with the french defendants assurances that they consider currently in substantial compliance,absent a binding court order actually freeing from the enforcement of the french orders,remains at serious risk if it fails to conform its web content to the dictates of those orders.
the test whether a law is penal,in the strict and primary sense,is whether the wrong sought to be redressed is a wrong to the public,or a wrong to the individual huntington attrill.the court warned against the danger of being misled by the different shades of meaning allowed to the word penal in our language.id.at.determining whether a sanction is penal or civil in nature is not always a simple task.hanshaw,emerald river,cir establishing procedural protections due a party based on whether sanctions were criminal or civil in nature.
although licra and uejf substantive claims against in french court depended in part upon violations of french criminal law the record suggests that the french lawsuits were civil rather than criminal and,more importantly,that the french orders primarily sought to redress a wrong to licra and uejf rather than a wrong to the french public.of course,we agree with the majority that the label civil does not strip a remedy of its penal nature.op.at.however,that still begs the question whether or not the french accruing fines were penal.on this point,the majority asserts that there is some language in the november order that supports the characterization of the fines as penal and that in any event the fines are potentially much larger than the nominal damages awarded to uejf and therefore the award of one franc to uejf can not render the orders primarily remedial rather than punitive in nature.op.at.the majority cites no authority for the novel arithmetic balancing test it proposes to distinguish penal from orders,and although we admit there is some language in the orders that supports holding the french orders punitive,there is also significant language that supports the conclusion that the orders sought to redress a wrong done to licra and uejf.the proper test for determining whether the french orders are penal is a purposive one,see huntington,at,and based on the record before us,we do not share the majority certainty that the orders are undoubtedly penal in nature.
french law gives standing to public interest,organizations dedicated to defending the interests of members of certain victimized groups,including victims of the holocaust déportés,to initiate enumerated types of civil actions but not criminal prosecutions on behalf of such victims.see,pr.pén.law of july,law on freedom of the press.challenge to uejf standing under article of the french law on freedom of the press and the french court subsequent finding that licra and uejf are dedicated to combating all forms of promotion of nazism in france suggest that the french trial was a civil proceeding under one of the specialized french standing statutes.this conclusion is further supported by the french court reliance on article of the new code of civil procedure for its authority to issue orders.
furthermore,the award of damages to uejf and other relief by way of restitution strongly suggests that the french court orders were predominantly civil and remedial rather than penal the court based its award of damages and other restitution in its may decision on a finding that the exhibition for sale of nazi objects has caused damage to be suffered by licra and uejf.the french court reiterated this finding of direct harm in its november decision this display of nazi objects clearly causes damage in france to the plaintiff associations who are justified in demanding the cessation and reparation thereof.in this context,the additional relief afforded to the french injunction ordering to cease its harmful activity in to be merely an additional remedy in a civil suit.
as with the french injunction,the accruing fines are similarly more likely civil than penal in nature.the most natural reading of the french court rationale for imposing the accruing fines is that such fines were meant to coerce into compliance with the substance of the french injunction.rather than assessing the fines retroactively as a court would do when redressing the public wrong had allegedly already committed,the french court made the fines entirely conditional on future behavior beginning three months after the date of the second french order.
the analogue for such a regime of per diem fines is civil contempt.see sarl louis feraud int l viewfinder,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,characterizing a french court judgments and a fine astreinte of francs per day for each day that viewfinder failed to comply with each judgment as an injunction backed by coercive penalties analogous to a civil contempt fine under american law.in contrast to criminal contempt,civil contempt sanctions,or those penalties designed to compel future compliance with a court order,are considered to be coercive and avoidable through obedience.int l union,united mine workers bagwell,d.see also contempt c ontempt proceedings brought to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court may be characterized as criminal in nature,whereas those brought to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties are remedial and civil in character.courts have the power to order either imprisonment or the payment of fines when holding a party in civil contempt a close analogy to coercive imprisonment is a per diem fine imposed for each day a contemnor fails to comply with an affirmative court order.like civil imprisonment,such fines exert a constant coercive pressure.bagwell,at.see also people gonzalez,cal th,d,
was afforded a safe harbor to allow it to implement the french court orders,and only then would any fines be assessed.as with a civil contempt order,the fines were entirely avoidable through obedience.because the french coercive fines aim is enforcement of an underlying injunction that is civil preventing the continuation of harm the french court found licra and uejf had already suffered rather than penal benefiting french public justice or vindicating the french court dignity and authority,the california rule of comity announced in in re stephanie might well apply,were it not for the orders substantive unconstitutionality see d,at.
for these reasons,unlike the majority we can not take the monetary penalty out of the ripeness analysis and assume that is not harmed by the very threat of the french orders possible enforcement.once again,at the least this is another issue that could and should be remanded to the district court for appropriate briefing and factfinding.
a new,higher burden for proving chilling effect 
finally,the majority dismisses the chilling effect of the orders by placing the burden on to identify other speech it wants to engage in but which is foreclosed by the french orders.what more should have to specify about the exact manner in which the objectionable content would appear on its site millions of postings and other material flow through networks each day can not possibly predict when and how specific content prohibited by the french orders will make its way onto its service.for example,a user could decide at any time to post a message or a link to a website containing impermissible content.because it acts as a platform for other speakers,can not,as the majority demands,identify the specific speech it wishes to engage in that is prohibited by the injunction.
nor should it have to.to place such a requirement on an internet forcing it to speculate as to the particular speech activity its millions of users might engage in as senders or to afford it no first amendment protection at all.as the supreme court has recognized,t he internet offer s a forum for a true diversity of political discourse,unique opportunities for cultural development,and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.ashcroft american civil liberties union,d quoting a,supp.v see batzel smith,cir emphasizing that congress,in insulating internet service providers from liability for certain content published on their sites,recognized the importance of protecting the unfettered and unregulated development of free speech on the internet 
the majority would impose on far greater burdens and litigation risks than those alleging first amendment violations by domestic parties would have to bear.is expected to try to persuade the french court to narrow or eliminate the very injunction has unsuccessfully fought against in france from the beginning.unconstrained by our first amendment,the french court might well take the opportunity to sanction for do nothing to alleviate the sweeping restraint on the content of the website.if the defendants want to narrow the injunction such that it might warrant comity,that burden should fall on them,not.
but even if went to the french court and obtained a ruling that its current auction site policy and internet services content comply with the orders,that would not resolve first amendment problem unless the sweeping injunction itself were permanently withdrawn or narrowed.all would obtain would be clearance for its current operations it would remain exposed to the risk of violating the orders and incurring penalties should it deviate from those current practices or should the defendants decide that content has become objectionable.the very nature of business is inherently is the essence of the internet,because of the sheer number and constantly changing identity of its users and of the content those users may seek or themselves post on.only a united states court can provide with a legal resolution of its claim that the injunctive order,as written,can not be enforced in the united states without infringing the company first amendment rights,thereby relieving it of the coercive threat hanging over its website and the operation of its business.by denying adjudication,the majority abdicates our proper role in protecting constitutional rights.
in so doing,it leaves in place a foreign country vague and overbroad judgment mandating a company to bar access to prohibited content by internet users from that country.this astonishing result is itself the strongest argument for finding claims ripe for adjudication.are we to assume that internet service providers are now the policing agencies for whatever content another country wants to keep from those within its territorial as,for example,controversial views on democracy,religion or the status of women if the majority application of the first amendment in the global internet context in this case is to become the as a matter of constitutional law or it should be adopted or not after full consideration of the constitutional merits,not as a justification for avoiding the issue altogether as not ripe for adjudication.
iii.conclusion 
without doubt,the hateful speech the defendants in this case seek to suppress is to be condemned.but censoring speech we find repugnant does not comport with our cherished first amendment.it is that a hate speech code which prohibits otherwise permitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses is facially unconstitutional,at.under the majority reasoning,a party targeted for enforcement of a foreign judgment restricting its speech in the united states will have no recourse but to appeal to the foreign court,which does not recognize the first amendment,to try to escape the strictures of the to demonstrate compliance,either through voluntary action or by submitting to its terms.only after enduring the decree chilling effects while this process plays out,and then faced with whatever sanction the foreign court may impose for noncompliance,may the doors of the united states district court be opened.
we should not allow a foreign court order to be used as leverage to quash constitutionally protected speech by denying the united target an adjudication of its constitutional rights in federal court.by invoking the doctrine of prudential having found both personal jurisdiction over the two foreign defendants and a constitutional case or majority does just that,denying the only forum in which it can free itself of a facially unconstitutional injunction.moreover,in doing so the majority creates a new and troubling precedent for internet service providers who may be confronted with foreign court orders that require them to police the content accessible to internet users from another country.we therefore respectfully dissent from the majority ripeness decision.
the french court orders are written in french.we quote from the english translation provided in the record.counsel for licra and uejf contended at oral argument that the words all necessary measures underlined and italicized above are a mistranslation of the french text.the original french for the entire phrase italicized above is prendre toutes les mesures de nature à dissuader et à rendre impossible.counsel contended that the words toutes les mesures de nature à are more accurately translated as all reasonable or available measures.

it is also worth noting that the french court orders were final criminal judgments that elected not to appeal through the french court system.instead,brought the present declaratory relief action for a district court to invalidate the french court orders based on a violation of first amendment right.in so doing,here is essentially no different than a party losing in state court who seeks to vindicate his or her federal rights by challenging the adverse state court judgment in federal district court.the supreme court has barred such opportunistic attempts at relitigation under the doctrine.see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.

the majority citation of adler bd.of,as a noted example of a debate over ripeness in the context of speech is inapposite.op.at.adler,a case affirming limits on the speech of teachers in new york public schools during the war ii red scare,not only concerns the constitutionally distinct situation of a state government regulating the speech of its employees as opposed to a court being asked to enforce a injunction against a corporation,but also predates important modern free speech precedents establishing the doctrine of facial invalidation.see,lakewood,at.furthermore,justice frankfurter was the sole dissenter and the sole justice to question the suit ripeness justices black and douglas were convinced the suit was ripe and that new york laws infringed upon public school teachers first amendment rights.see adler,at.because adler itself would certainly be reasoned,and likely decided,differently today given cases such as connick myers,d,and pickering bd.of,d,which recognized a government employee interest in commenting on matters of public concern,adler approach to ripeness is hardly illuminating even within the narrow confines of government employee speech.
as the majority correctly notes,it is california public policy rather than public policy that is relevant to a comity analysis in a federal diversity case.op.at.however,although focused its energies on alleging violations of the federal first amendment rather than violations of the analogous provision of the california constitution,see art.i,a,it is certainly not california public policy to countenance violations of the united states constitution.indeed,the california supreme court has held california free speech clause to be more expansive than the first amendment.see golden gateway ctr.golden gateway tenants ass n,cal th,d,unlike the united states constitution,which couches the right to free speech as a limit on congressional power,the california constitution gives e very person an affirmative right to free speech.accordingly,we have held that our free speech clause is more definitive and inclusive than the first amendment.internal citations omitted.see also sarl louis feraud int l viewfinder,wl,dist.lexis,at american courts have recognized that foreign judgments that run afoul of first amendment values are inconsistent with our notions of what is fair and just,and conflict with the strong public policy of our state new york.emphasis in original.
the french defendants initially objected to a far broader array of content than the limited category of items now excludes under its revised auction site policy.uejf plea for relief asked the french court to mandate that remove from all browser directories the index heading entitled negationists and any link bringing together,equating or presenting directly or indirectly as equivalent sites categorized under the heading holocaust and those indexed as negationist.
circumstances are readily distinguishable from those found not ripe in socialist labor party gilligan,d.there,the principal first amendment claims the party leveled against ohio election code were mooted by legislative amendments,leaving only a subsidiary challenge to a loyalty oath.the court found this claim singularly sparse in its factual allegations,with no suggestion that the party had ever refused or would refuse in the future to sign the oath,or that it had suffered or would suffer any injury from the existence of the oath requirement.id.at.similarly,in committee thornburgh,cir,members of the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp contended that provisions of the act unconstitutionally put them at risk of deportation for engaging in protected first amendment activities without the opportunity for a fair and impartial hearing before the ins.we held that the plaintiffs were sufficiently at risk of government prosecution to give them standing but we found their claims not ripe because there was a sketchy record with many unknown facts,such as whether the plaintiffs were actually members of the pflp or what acts the government alleged they had committed,and we emphasized that the ins had not yet interpreted or applied the challenged provisions.id.at.in marked contrast to these cases,here the french injunction remains extant and as broadly worded as ever the defendants have refused to stipulate to compliance and the district court has found actual noncompliance with specific terms as well as an overall risk of noncompliance with fatally undefined subjecting to the risk of substantial monetary fines and the chilling effect of the vague and overbroad injunction.additionally,there is no court or than this federal can address united states constitutional claim.
it is telling that even the internet experts relied upon by the french court were unable to recommend a suitable and effective technical solution for to screen out users from any of its sites or services,other than the auction site,that may be construed as constituting an apology for nazism or a contesting of nazi crimes because n o grievance against any sites or services other than the auction site is formulated with sufficient precision.
according to the majority,the french court interim orders do not by their terms require to restrict access by internet users in the united states.op.at.this is not position.the company has asserted that complying with the french orders would compel it to remove prohibited material from its united internet services and reengineer its servers,also located in the united states,to identify both users and prohibited material that may be posted in the future therefore,it may not be possible to comply with the french orders without rendering certain content in
