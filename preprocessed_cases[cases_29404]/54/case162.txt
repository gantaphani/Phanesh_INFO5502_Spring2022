these are diversity suits brought in the federal district court in chicago by lloyd,a foreign corporation see haynsworth v.the corporation,cir,against american members names of insurance syndicates that lloyd manages.a.lloyd wanted to use the illinois uniform foreign recognition act,ilcs to,to collect money judgments,each for several hundred thousand dollars,that it had obtained against the defendants in an english court after the names repeated efforts in earlier litigation to knock out the clause in their contracts with lloyd had failed.bonny society of lloyd,cir lipcon underwriters at lloyd,cir richards lloyd of london,cir haynsworth v.the corporation,supra allen lloyd of london,cir roby corporation of lloyd,cir.pursuant to this strategy,lloyd filed the judgments in the district court and then issued citations pursuant to the illinois procedure for executing a judgment.the filing of the judgments inaugurated this proceeding to collect them and state law,in this case the illinois citations statute,ilcs,supplies the procedure for executing a judgment.fed.civ.pro.a resolution trust ruggiero,cir charles wright,arthur miller richard marcus,federal practice and procedure.the statute allows the holder of a judgment to depose the judgment debtor respecting the existence,amount,and whereabouts of assets that can be seized to satisfy the judgment to impose a lien on those assets and to command the debtor to turn over to the judgment creditor as many of the seizable assets as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment.see bank of aspen fox cartage.
the defendants ignored the citations and instead asked the district court not to recognize the english judgments as being enforceable in illinois.they argued that those judgments had denied them due process of law and therefore were not enforceable under the foreign recognition act,which makes a judgment rendered by a court outside the united states unenforceable in illinois if the judgment was rendered under a system which does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law.ilcs emphasis added see also.the district court rejected the argument and granted summary judgment for lloyd,declaring the judgments enforceable and so the issuance of citations proper.
we have italicized the word that defeats the defendants argument.the judgments about which they complain were rendered by the queen bench division of england high court,which corresponds to our federal district courts they were affirmed by the court of appeal,which corresponds to the federal courts of appeals and the appellate committee of the house of lords,which corresponds to the supreme court,denied the defendants petition for review.any suggestion that this system of courts does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law borders on the risible.t he courts of england are fair and neutral forums.riley kingsley underwriting agencies,cir to same effect see haynsworth v.the corporation,supra,at roby corporation of lloyd,supra,at.the origins of our concept of due process of law are english,dent west virginia.hurtado california.coniston village of hoffman estates,cir keith jurow,untimely thoughts a reconsideration of the origins of due process of law,am.legal hist,and the english courts,especially the supreme court of judicature composed of the high court and the court of appeal and the appellate committee of the house of lords,the tribunals involved in the judgments challenged here,are highly regarded for impartiality,professionalism,and scrupulous regard for procedural rights.the english judicial system is the very fount from which our system developed a system which has procedures and goals which closely parallel our own.in re hashim,cir,quoting somportex philadelphia chewing gum,aff,cir.united states courts which have inherited major portions of their judicial traditions and procedure from the united kingdom are hardly in a position to call the queen bench a kangaroo court.british midland airways international travel,cir.
not that the english concept of fair procedure is identical to ours but we can not believe that the illinois statute is intended to bar the enforcement of all judgments of any foreign legal system that does not conform its procedural doctrines to the latest twist and turn of our courts regarding,for example,the circumstances under which due process requires an opportunity for a hearing in advance of the deprivation of a substantive right rather than afterwards.see hilton guyot.ingersoll milling machine granger,cir.it is a fair guess that no foreign nation has decided to incorporate our due process doctrines into its own procedural law and so we interpret due process in the illinois statute which,remember,is a uniform act,not one intended to reflect the idiosyncratic jurisprudence of a particular state to refer to a concept of fair procedure simple and basic enough to describe the judicial processes of civilized nations,our peers.the statute requires only that the foreign procedure be compatible with the requirements of due process of law,and we have interpreted this to mean that the foreign procedures are fundamentally fair and do not offend against basic fairness.id.at see also hilton guyot,supra,at.wilson marchington,cir guinness plc ward,cir banco minero ross.
we call this the international concept of due process to distinguish it from the complex concept that has emerged from american case law.we note that it is even less demanding than the test the courts use to determine whether to enforce a foreign arbitral award under the new york convention,et,whose due process defense that a party lacked proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case,article v b,has been interpreted to mean the enforcing jurisdiction concept of due process,albeit a rather minimal such concept.iran aircraft industries avco,cir see also generica pharmaceutical basics,cir.
it is true that no evidence was presented in the district court on whether england has a civilized legal system,but that is because the question is not open to doubt.we need not consider what kind of evidence would suffice to show that a foreign legal system does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law if the challenged judgment had been rendered by cuba,north korea,iran,iraq,congo,or some other nation whose adherence to the rule of law and commitment to the norm of due process are open to serious question,see,bank melli iran pahlavi,cir choi kim,cir banco minero ross,supra,at bridgeway citibank,d,as england are not.it is anyway not a question of fact.it is not,strictly speaking,a question of law either,but it is a question about the law of a foreign nation,and in answering such questions a federal court is not limited to the consideration of evidence that would be admissible under the federal rules of evidence any relevant material or source may be consulted.pittway united states,cir charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure.
rather than trying to impugn the english legal system en gross,the defendants argue that the illinois statute requires us to determine whether the particular judgments that they are challenging were issued in proceedings that conform to the requirements of due process of law as it has come to be understood in the case law of illinois and other american jurisdictions.the statute,with its reference to system,does not support such a retail approach,which would moreover be inconsistent with providing a streamlined,expeditious method for collecting money judgments rendered by courts in other would in effect give the judgment creditor a further appeal on the merits.the process of collecting a judgment is not meant to require a second lawsuit,see bank of aspen fox cartage,supra,at resolution trust ruggiero,supra,at,thus converting every successful multinational suit for damages into two suits actually three,as we see at the end of this opinion.but that is the implication of the defendants argument.they c
