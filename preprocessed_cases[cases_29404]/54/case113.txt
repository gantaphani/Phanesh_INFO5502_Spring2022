plaintiff john mickowski obtained a dollar patent infringement judgment against corporation vtc,which subsequently declared bankruptcy and sought reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.after the bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan for vtc,thereby discharging vtc liability for the unpaid patent judgment,defendant worldwide,llc purchased substantially all of vtc remaining assets.subsequent to the sale,the operating trustee for vtc successfully moved the bankruptcy court to revoke the reorganization plan.assuming that the bankruptcy court revocation of the reorganization plan also revoked the confirmation order,mickowski filed suit in the northern district of ohio,seeking to hold worldwide liable for the unpaid patent judgment against vtc.mickowski now appeals the june,order of the district court,denying his motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment for worldwide on the grounds that worldwide purchased vtc assets free and clear of any claim for the unpaid patent judgment and,in any event,can not be held liable as vtc successor under ohio law.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
vtc is an ohio corporation that was formed on december.in,john mickowski,a resident of new york,filed an action in the southern district of new york against vtc for direct,contributory and induced patent infringement on patents he owned.in,mickowski filed suit in the northern district of ohio against three of vtc officers,john vann,john branden,and ying shen.on march,the court in the southern district of new york entered judgment in favor of mickowski against vtc in the amount of for trebled damages and prejudgment interest on mickowski claim that vtc willfully induced infringement of the patents in the suit.on june,before mickowski could execute the patent judgment against vtc,vtc voluntarily petitioned for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court for the northern district of ohio.on march,vtc filed a proposed plan of reorganization,which proposed the sale of vtc stock for.
mickowski,a creditor of vtc by virtue of the patent judgment,and acquisition group vtac,filed a competing plan of reorganization on june,pursuant to which vtac proposed purchasing vtc stock for.in response,vtc filed an amended plan of reorganization,offering to pay million for the stock of a reorganized vtc.on september,vtac and mickowski submitted an amended plan,increasing its bid to.they submitted a revised amended plan of reorganization on october.
the bankruptcy court issued an order permitting vtac to conduct due diligence at vtc headquarters on november.upon the arrival of vtac personnel at vtc site,vtc management group consisting of jack vann,tom vann,ying shen,and jack branden resigned.on november,mary ann rabin was appointed chapter operating trustee for vtc.believing that vtc management group had damaged the ongoing business by resigning,the operating trustee of vtc and mickowski filed suit against the management group for breach of fiduciary duty.that matter settled in march.
after months of difficult negotiations and discussions,vtc confessed that it was unwilling or unable to litigate to determine which of the two plans would survive the confirmation process.at the behest of trade creditors,the parties met to determine whether it was more appropriate to sell vtc assets pursuant to providing that the bankruptcy trustee may use,sell,or lease property of the estate.at that meeting,vtac offered million for the assets,and expressed its desire to present that deal through a plan of reorganization.discussions regarding the asset sale ceased,and the creditors elected to support the vtac plan.
mickowski and vtac presented a second amended plan of reorganization on january.the plan stated that its effective date would be february,provided that the bankruptcy court would have confirmed the plan at least days prior to that date no stay of the confirmation order would be in effect the confirmation order would not have been vacated and all conditions to the effective date,as set forth in section.of the plan,would have been satisfied or waived.article ix sets forth numerous conditions to the effective date of the plan,including the bankruptcy court entering the confirmation order,approving the plan there having been no material adverse change after september,in the financial condition of vtc which would make it improbable that vtc could continue operations at historical sales,gross margin and operating income levels or meet its financial obligations on a going forward basis and vtac having had the opportunity to audit vtc financial records.the plan further provided that if each condition to the effective date were not timely satisfied or waived,then the proponents of the plan vtac or mickowski could move the bankruptcy court to vacate the confirmation order,whereupon the plan would be deemed null and void in all respects,including with respect to the release,disallowance,or extinguishment of any claims by or against vtc.
on january,after holding a confirmation hearing,the bankruptcy court held that the conditions to the effective date contained in article ix of the plan were appropriate in light of the uncertainties of vtc financial condition.the court ordered that,e xcept as expressly otherwise provided in its order or the plan,on the effective date all property and assets of the debtor vtc estate shall vest,free and clear of all claims,interests and encumbrances,in the reorganized debtor,subject only to the provisions of the plan.the court further ordered that,except as provided in the plan,entry of the court order discharged vtc from any debt that arose before the date of the confirmation order.the bankruptcy court entered the confirmation order on february.
on april,vtc operating trustee filed an emergency motion pursuant to,seeking the bankruptcy court approval for the private sale of certain assets of vtc free and clear of liens.the trustee motion sought approval to sell certain of vtc assets through a private sale to vtc holdings,llc,a company organized by kathy vann in september for the purpose of filing a plan of reorganization for vtc vtc holdings subsequently changed its name to worldwide.the trustee argued that vtac was refusing to purchase vtc assets on the ground that there had been a material adverse change in vtc business since the plan was confirmed.the trustee stated that she ceased vtc operations on march,because it had become too costly to operate and was undertaking to sell vtc assets as quickly as possible.
mickowski filed two objections to the trustee emergency motion.mickowski argued that the purported emergency that prompted the trustee desire for a sale was the product of collusion amongst certain employees of vtc to discourage customers from placing sales orders.mickowski also argued that the trustee had failed to submit an appraisal to establish the fair and reasonable value of the assets being sold.
the court rejected the proposed private sale of vtc assets and ordered the trustee to hold a public auction,where the assets were to be sold as is and where is.an auction was held on may,and vtc holdings worldwide was the winning bidder of vtc accounts receivable,inventory,and equipment.the bankruptcy court confirmed the sale of assets to vtc holdings on may.on september,vtc bankruptcy proceedings were converted to liquidation proceedings pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.
when worldwide commenced business,each of its officers and key employees were former employees of vtc,and each was hired to perform the same tasks that they previously had performed at vtc.worldwide website also indicated that it was the same company as vtc,just at a new location.
on june,vtc operating trustee moved to vacate the bankruptcy court order confirming the second amended plan of reorganization.the trustee argued that the conditions for confirmation of the plan had not been fulfilled and that the plan could not be consummated.based on the trustee representation that all necessary parties had been served with the motion,the bankruptcy court ordered on august,that t he second amended chapter plan of john mickowski and vt acquisition is hereby vacated.worldwide was never served with the motion to vacate nor with notice of the court order granting the motion.
on february,mickowski filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.mickowski complaint sought a declaratory judgment that worldwide is liable for mickowski patent judgment against vtc on the ground that worldwide is the successor to and a mere continuation of vtc.mickowski also alleged that the formation of worldwide,the abandonment of vtc by its officers and directors,and worldwide subsequent purchase of vtc assets amounted to a fraud upon mickowski.
on june,the court denied mickowski motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment for worldwide.the court concluded that at the time worldwide purchased vtc assets in bankruptcy,it was not subject to a claim of successor liability because the bankruptcy court had discharged vtc liability on the patent infringement judgment by its order confirming the second amended plan of reorganization.although the bankruptcy court subsequently vacated its order confirming that plan of reorganization,the court held,as a matter of public policy,that successor liability should not attach retroactively.the court found in the alternative that state law applies to mickowski successor liability claim and that mickowski claim fails as a matter of ohio law.mickowski timely appealed.
worldwide ability to rely on vtc discharge in bankruptcya.standard of review 
a district court allowance of an affirmative defense that purportedly was not raised in a timely manner is reviewed for abuse of discretion.williams lampe,cir.
the federal rules of civil procedure require a party to plead the affirmative defense of discharge in bankruptcy.fed.civ.c.the purpose of rule c is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and a chance to argue,if he or she can,why the defense lacks merit,of illinois,d.mickowski argues that worldwide failed to comply with rule c in pleading an affirmative defense to mickowski claim for declaratory relief,successor liability,and fraud.specifically,he argues that worldwide failed to plead the affirmative defense that mickowski claims relating to the patent judgment against vtc were discharged in bankruptcy.
we disagree.worldwide answer clearly put mickowski on notice that it would be relying on the bankruptcy rulings to foreclose mickowski claims.worldwide answer states 
mickowski claims are preempted by mickowski is precluded from pursuing his claim by,the bankruptcy code and the law regarding bankruptcy generally and bankruptcy sales specifically,including,without limitation by reason of specification,the proceedings in in re corporation,bankruptcy court,northern district of ohio case,including without limitation a the proceedings in the bankruptcy court pertaining to the emergency motion by operating trustee mary ann rabin pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code to sell certain assets free and clear of liens and approving certain buyer protections including a fee,filed april,b the effect of the purchase by vtw,then known as vtc holdings,llc,of virtually all of vtc assets at public auction conducted pursuant to and c the effect of the bankruptcy court orders i ordering and ii approving and confirming such sale,dated april,and may,respectively.
although the affirmative defense does not specifically invoke the phrase discharge in bankruptcy contained in rule c,it clearly notified mickowski that worldwide would be defending against any attempt by mickowski to enforce the patent judgment by relying on the prior bankruptcy proceedings and related orders,including the confirmation order discharging any claim for the patent judgment.accordingly,mickowski argument that worldwide waived its affirmative defense and that he was somehow prejudiced lacks merit.the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting worldwide to raise this defense.
summary judgment for worldwide based on vtc discharge in bankruptcya.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment.cockrel shelby county sch,cir.summary judgment must be granted if the pleadings and evidence show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.a dispute over a material fact is only a genuine issue if a reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party on that issue.cockrel,at citing anderson liberty lobby,d.in reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment,this court must view all the facts and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
mickowski argues that the bankruptcy court february,order,which confirmed vtc plan of reorganization and discharged vtc from any debt that arose before that date,was completely vacated by the bankruptcy court on august,and therefore no longer has any legal effect.mickowski further argues that there is no evidence that worldwide relied on the february,order when it purchased most of vtc remaining assets at the may,public auction.mickowski argues that worldwide knew,at the time of the auction,that the reorganization plan upon which the february,confirmation order was based was not going to become effective if the plan was going to become effective,then the public auction of vtc assets would have been unnecessary.according to mickowski,worldwide purchased vtc assets free and clear of secured liens only and,therefore,his unsecured claim based on the unpaid patent judgment survived the asset sale.see f in re white mot.credit.
critical to mickowski argument is the assertion that the confirmation order is no longer in force or effect.the revocation of any confirmation order is governed by,which provides 
on request of a party in interest at any time before days after the date of the entry of the order of confirmation,and after notice and a hearing,the court may revoke such order if and only if such order was procured by fraud.an order under this section revoking an order of confirmation shall 
contain such provisions as are necessary to protect any entity acquiring rights in good faith reliance on the order of confirmation and 
revoke the discharge of the debtor.
argues that the bankruptcy court august,order,by its own terms,did not revoke the confirmation order and,in any event,did not comport with the procedural requirements of.we agree for the reasons stated below.
first,although the august,order is captioned order to vacate order confirming plan of reorganization,the operative language of the order vacates only the second amended plan of reorganization,not the confirmation order.see the second amended chapter plan of john mickowski and vt acquisition is hereby vacated.
second,proving the point that the order vacated only the reorganization plan and not the confirmation order,the bankruptcy court did not comply in this case with any of the formalities necessary to revoke a bankruptcy discharge or confirmation order.first,the bankruptcy court failed to comply with the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.rules and provide that a proceeding to revoke a bankruptcy discharge or to revoke a confirmation order is an adversary proceeding.an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy is commenced like any other new civil filing a complaint with the bankruptcy court and serving process on the named parties.fed.bankr.adopting fed.civ.fed.bankr.here,however,the august,order was not the product of an adversary proceeding.rather,the operating trustee for vtc merely filed a motion after the may,asset sale to worldwide.
third,rule provides that if an order is entered denying or revoking a discharge,the clerk must promptly give notice to all creditors.fed.bankr.see also fed.bankr.f.the trustee motion to vacate the confirmation order,however,was not served on all creditors,nor on worldwide.
fourth,permitted the bankruptcy court to vacate the confirmation order only upon a finding that the order was procured by fraud.the august,order does not refer to fraud at all.
finally,although the reorganization plan explicitly provides that if each condition to the effective date were not timely satisfied or waived,then the proponents of the,vtac or move the bankruptcy court to vacate the confirmation order,it was not vtac or mickowski who made the motion but rather vtc operating trustee.
because the bankruptcy court did not follow any of the bankruptcy code procedures required when a litigant seeks to vacate a confirmation order,the order remains in effect at least as to worldwide.the fact that the reorganization plan was never consummated does not undermine the continuing viability of the confirmation order as to worldwide purchase of vtc assets.the result is that,assuming that worldwide is vtc successor,worldwide may invoke the complete discharge of mickowski patent judgment claim that was in effect at the time it purchased vtc assets.summary judgment was proper for worldwide on this ground alone.
potential successor liability of worldwidea.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment.cockrel,supra.
even assuming,arguendo,that mickowski patent judgment against vtc was revived on august,when the bankruptcy court purportedly vacated the confirmation order,we hold in the alternative that worldwide can not be held liable for that judgment as a successor to vtc.mickowski argues that,under federal common law,he needs to show only that worldwide had notice of mickowski claim against its predecessor vtc and that there was substantial continuity in the operation of the business before and after the sale.see,eeoc,cir citations omitted age discrimination case finding substantial continuity where successor retained most of predecessor personnel,including most of its management personnel and all its salesmen,and did not institute major changes until a year after the acquisition upholsterers int l union pension fund artistic furniture of pontiac,cir suit for delinquent pension funds holding that continuity of operations was established where successor employed substantially all of the predecessor workforce,including supervisory personnel used the predecessor plant,machinery,and equipment and manufactured the same products the successor completed the predecessor uncompleted work orders and agreed to honor warranty claims for goods sold by the predecessor and several of the predecessor officers stayed on in the same positions under the successor management.
worldwide counters that the substantial continuity test is not part of the federal common law and that,in any event,the mere continuation test for successor liability under ohio common law governs.see welco,applied,ohio,a corporation that purchases the assets of another is not liable for the contractual liabilities of its predecessor corporation unless the buyer expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such liability the transaction amounts to a de facto consolidation or merger the buyer corporation is merely a continuation of the seller corporation or the transaction is entered into fraudulently for the purpose of escaping liability.emphasis added citation omitted.under ohio common law,a corporation is not a mere continuation of the corporation whose assets it has purchased,just because it continues to provide the same services.erdy columbus paraprofessional,ohio app d.under a mere continuation theory of successor liability,it is not enough to show that the purported successor has the same physical plant,officers,employees and product line as the purported predecessor.welco,at holding that these facts are relevant only to the more expansive theory of successor liability of substantial continuity,which does not apply where one corporation has contracted to purchase the assets of another.rather,the basis of this mere continuation theory is the continuation of the corporate entity,not the business operation,after the transaction,such as when one corporation sells its assets to another corporation with the same people owning both corporations.welco,at citation omitted see also id.at rejecting a relaxation of the mere continuation theory of successor liability in which courts have imposed liability after a transaction on the basis of significant shared features between the predecessor and successor corporations.t he key element in establishing continuation is a common identity of stockholders,directors,and stock.erdy,at citations omitted.
because ohio law of successor liability arguably is more favorable to worldwide than the relaxed standard under federal common law,the application of federal or state common law could determine whether the district court appropriately granted summary judgment for worldwide.for the reasons discussed below,we hold that the district court properly held that ohio law applies the relevant standard of successor liability and that the court correctly held that worldwide is not vtc successor as a matter of ohio law.
article i,section of the constitution prescribes that congress shall act to promote the program of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times for authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.const.art.i.the objective of the clause was clearly to facilitate the granting of rights national in scope.goldstein california,d.from this general statement in goldstein,mickowski argues that federal common law must guide this court determination of worldwide potential successor liability for his patent judgment.yet,mickowski neglects to mention that the court in goldstein also held that the subject matter to which article i,is addressed may be of purely local importance and not worthy of national attention or protection,id.at,that its subject matter may at times be of purely local concern,and that n o conflict will necessarily arise from a lack of uniform state regulation,id.at.thus,goldstein suggests that there need not be complete,national uniformity in the protection of patent rights.
mickowski also cites cases in which courts have applied federal common law to the issue of successor liability.see of locomotive eng rs springfield terminal,cir railway labor act case chicago truck drivers union tasemkin,cir erisa case,at adea case leib,cir adopting federal common law approach for determining successorship liability for a claim under the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act that is similar to the approach used under the national labor relations act.because these cases arose in the context of labor law and pension litigation,they do not necessarily extend to the patent judgment enforcement context.
to determine whether the standards for successor liability for a patent judgment derive from federal or state common law,this court must apply the supreme court decision in atherton fed.deposit ins,d.in atherton,the resolution trust corporation later replaced by the fdic sued several officers and directors of a savings association for violating the standard of care they owed the and savings associations.the initial question for the court was whether that standard of care was defined by federal common law.the court explained that federal common law refers to a rule of decision that amounts,not simply to an interpretation of a federal statute or a properly promulgated administrative rule,but,rather,to the judicial creation of a special federal rule of decision.id.at.citations omitted.critically,the court noted that cases in which judicial creation of a special federal rule would be justified are few and restricted.id.quoting myers fdic,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.further,the existence of related federal statutes does not automatically show that congress intended courts to create federal rules,for congress acts against the background of the total corpus juris of the states id.quoting wallis pan am.petroleum,d other quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,normally,when courts decide to fashion rules of federal common law,the guiding principle is that a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law must first be specifically shown.id.quoting wallis,at.indeed,such a conflict is normally a precondition.id.quoting,at.
with respect to the facts before it,the court noted that congress had passed numerous pieces of legislation concerning the formation,operation,and activities of banks,which are distinct from savings associations.id.at.congress also had enacted legislation concerning savings associations.id.none of this legislation,however,even purported to set forth standards for corporate governance of savings associations.id.thus,the remaining question for the court was whether the application of standards of care to such banks would conflict with,and thereby significantly threaten,a federal policy or interest.id.if so,then it would be appropriate to create federal common law on the issue assuming that no federal statute controlled the issue.
the court found that there was no such conflict between state law standards and a federal policy or interest.id.the court rejected the fdic argument about the need for uniformity,which purportedly would occur if federal common law supplanted state standards of fiduciary responsibility.id.at.to invoke the concept of uniformity is not to prove its need,remarked the court.id.at.internal punctuation and citations omitted.in fact,there was no need for uniformity because the nation banking system had thrived despite disparities in matters of corporate governance.id.the court also held that the mere fact that savings associations in the case were did not in itself justify the application of federal common law.id.at.the court observed that numerous state laws,contract law,employment discrimination laws apply to banks.id.at.in the end,the court found no significant conflict with,or threat to,a federal interest.id.at.the court therefore held that the case before it did not represent one of the few and restricted instances in which a federal court can create federal common law.id 
attempting to distinguish atherton,mickowski argues that federal common law applies to a determination of successor liability because there is a conflict between state and federal law standards and that the federal law standard is more encompassing than its ohio common law counterpart.but the mere fact that the substantial continuity test of federal common law is more encompassing than the mere continuation test of state common law does not demonstrate a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law.atherton,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.mickowski has failed to show that there is a federal policy or interest in extending the substantial continuity test to the patent judgment enforcement context to date,that test has largely been limited to the few and restricted areas of labor and employment law and pension benefits,where the need for a uniform,broader rule of successor liability is more apparent.see of locomotive eng rs,at national uniformity is essential in the interpretation of labor law if courts were to rely on state law to determine when veil piercing was appropriate,rla collective bargaining agreements might include some companies in one state and other companies in a neighboring state.moriarty svec,cir the federalization of multiemployer plan contribution obligations evinces a strong congressional desire to minimize contribution losses and the resulting burden such losses impose on other plan participants.we emphasize that the state law of successor liability,which cuts off the obligation to pay a predecessor promised contributions,significantly conflicts with this federal interest and justifies a departure.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,at observing that federal common law doctrine of successor liability has been applied in the labor and employment context because u sually the primary relief sought in such cases is nonmonetary and can be effective only if directed against the workers current employer 
an asserted need for absolute uniformity in the collection of patent judgments,without more,is insufficient in itself to justify resort to federal common law.mickowski has failed to demonstrate that the failure to adopt a uniform federal standard for successor liability will somehow inhibit patent rights generally nor has mickowski presented evidence that patent rights have failed to thrive despite the existence of more restrictive varying state law standards for successor liability.there certainly is no reason to think that the state of ohio will become a haven for companies seeking to avoid their obligations to pay patent judgments or,for that matter,any other type of unpaid judgment.atchison,topeka and santa fe ry.brown bryant,cir opining,without deciding,that federal common law standard for successor liability does not apply under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla there is no evidence that the application of state corporation law will frustrate this objective.no state provides a haven for liable companies.nor is there reason to think that states will alter their existing successor liability rules in a race to the bottom to attract corporate business it is unrealistic to think that a state would alter general corporate law principles to become a peculiarly hospitable haven for polluters.citing anspec johnson controls,cir kennedy,concurring.particularly in light of goldstein pronouncement that there need not be complete,national uniformity in the protection of patent rights,mickowski has failed to make his case for resort to or the creation of federal common law regarding successor liability 
the supreme court decision in united states bestfoods,d also militates against the application of the substantial continuity test from federal common law.bestfoods involved a cercla action against the parent corporations of chemical manufacturers for the costs of cleaning up industrial waste generated by a chemical plant.the court explored the question of whether a parent corporation that actively participated in,and exercised control over,the operations of a subsidiary may,without more,be held liable as an operator of a polluting facility owned or operated by the subsidiary.bestfoods,at.the court initially observed that,under general corporate law principles,a parent corporation does not have liability beyond the assets of the subsidiary.id.at.the court further observed that,under corporate law principles,a parent company corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for the subsidiary corporation conduct when,inter alia,the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish certain wrongful purposes,most notably fraud,on the shareholder behalf.id.at.citations omitted.the court then stated 
cercla is thus like many another congressional enactment in giving no indication that the entire corpus of state corporation law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff cause of action is based upon a federal statute,burks lasker,d,and the failure of the statute to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership demands application of the rule that i n order to abrogate a principle,the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law,united states texas,d internal quotation marks omitted.
id.at.the court therefore held that evidence that a parent corporation actively participated in,and exercised control over,the operations of a subsidiary was not sufficient to hold the parent liable as an operator of a polluting facility.id.at.the court rejected the proposition that cercla establishes a relaxed rule of derivative liability which displace s or fundamentally alter s standards of limited liability.id.at.
following bestfoods,the second circuit in new york servs,cir,rejected the argument that federal common law provides the standards for successor liability in a cercla action.instead of the federal common law standard of substantial continuity,the court applied the state common law rule of mere continuation,reasoning as follows 
in considering the substantial continuity test,we take from bestfoods the principle that when determining whether liability under cercla passes from one corporation to another,we must apply common law rule
