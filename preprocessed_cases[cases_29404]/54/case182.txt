cameron winklevoss,tyler winklevoss and divya narendra the winklevosses claim that mark zuckerberg stole the idea for facebook the social networking site from them.they sued facebook and zuckerberg facebook in massachusetts.facebook countersued them and their competing social networking site,connectu,in california,alleging that the winklevosses and connectu hacked into facebook to purloin user data,and tried to steal users by spamming them.the ensuing litigation involved several other parties and gave bread to many lawyers,but the details are not particularly relevant here.
the district court in california eventually dismissed the winklevosses from that case for lack of personal jurisdiction.it then ordered the parties to mediate their dispute.the mediation session included connectu,facebook and the winklevosses so that the parties could reach a global settlement.before mediation began,the participants signed a confidentiality agreement stipulating that all statements made during mediation were privileged,and inadmissible in any arbitral,judicial,or other proceeding.
after a day of negotiations,connectu,facebook and the winklevosses signed a handwritten,page term sheet settlement agreement the settlement agreement.the winklevosses agreed to give up connectu in exchange for cash and a piece of facebook.the parties stipulated that the settlement agreement was confidential,binding and may be submitted into evidence to enforce it.the settlement agreement also purported to end all disputes between the parties.
the settlement fell apart during negotiations over the form of the final deal documents,and facebook filed a motion with the district court seeking to enforce it.connectu argued that the settlement agreement was unenforceable because it lacked material terms and had been procured by fraud.the district court found the settlement agreement enforceable and ordered the winklevosses to transfer all connectu shares to facebook.this had the effect of moving connectu from the winklevosses to facebook side of the case.
the winklevosses appeal.
because connectu switched sides,it no longer had any interest in appealing the district court order.the winklevosses sought to intervene after the district court entered judgment enforcing the settlement agreement.the court denied the motion as unnecessary,holding that they were already parties to the proceedings to enforce the settlement agreement and may appeal that judgment.in fact,the winklevosses had earlier been dismissed from the case.but,by ruling that they were already parties,the district court implicitly granted them intervention nunc pro tunc.see beckman,int l ins,cir.they therefore have standing to appeal.see marino ortiz,t hose litigants who properly become parties may appeal an adverse judgment.
b.the settlement agreement envisioned that facebook would acquire all of connectu shares in exchange for cash and a percentage of facebook common stock.the parties also agreed to grant each other mutual releases as broad as possible,and the winklevosses represented and warranted that t hey have no further right to assert against facebook and no further claims against facebook its related parties.
facebook moved to enforce the settlement agreement,and also asked the district court to order connectu and the winklevosses to sign more than pages of documents,including a stock purchase agreement,a connectu stockholders agreement and a confidential mutual release agreement.facebook deal lawyers claimed that the terms in these documents were required to finalize the settlement agreement,and its expert dutifully opined that they were typical of acquisition documents.
the winklevosses argue that if these terms really are required and typical,then they must be material,and their absence from the settlement agreement renders it unenforceable.see weddington,flick,d.but a term may be material in one of two ways it may be a necessary term,without which there can be no contract or,it may be an important term that affects the value of the bargain.obviously,omission of the former would render the contract a nullity.see citizens utils.wheeler,acquisition of a private company shares could proceed because price was omitted from the contract.but a contract that omits terms of the latter type is enforceable under california law,so long as the terms it does include are sufficiently definite for a court to determine whether a breach has occurred,order specific performance or award damages.see elite show,staffpro,d,witkin,summary of california law,contracts ed hereinafter witkin on contracts terry conlan,d.this is not a very demanding test,and the settlement agreement easily passes it the parties agreed that facebook would swallow up connectu,the winklevosses would get cash and a small piece of facebook,and both sides would stop fighting and get on with their lives.
the settlement agreement even specifies how to fill in the material terms that the winklevosses claim are missing from the deal 
facebook will determine the form documentation of the acquisition of connectu shares consistent with a stock and cash for stock acquisition.emphasis added.
california allows parties to delegate choices over terms,so long as the delegation is constrained by the rest of the contract and subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.see cal.lettuce growers,union sugar,cal see also witkin on contracts.delegation is necessary for a contract like the settlement agreement to be enforceable,as the court may fill in missing terms by reference to the rest of the contract,extrinsic evidence and industry practice.see witkin on contracts sterling taylor,cal.but the clause quoted above leaves no doubt that the winklevosses and facebook meant to bind themselves and each other,even though everyone understood that some material aspects of the deal would be papered later.
the winklevosses contractual delegation is valid because the settlement agreement obligates facebook to draw up documents consistent with a stock and cash for stock acquisition.and,if facebook should draft terms that are unfair or oppressive,or that deprive the winklevosses of the benefit of their bargain,the district court could reject them as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.see witkin on contracts.the district court got it exactly right when it found the settlement agreement enforceable but refused to add the stack of documents drafted by facebook deal lawyers.
c.after signing the settlement agreement,facebook notified the winklevosses that an internal valuation prepared to comply with section of the tax code put the value of its common stock at per share.the winklevosses argue that facebook misled them into believing its shares were worth four times as much.had they known about this valuation during the mediation,they claim,they would never have signed the settlement agreement.the winklevosses charge facebook with violating rule,and they seek rescission of the settlement agreement under section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act.
rule prohibits fraud,whether by commission or omission,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b.we assume,without deciding,that a party negotiating an exchange of shares to settle a lawsuit could violate rule by misstating or hiding information that would materially change the other side evaluation of the settlement.green.ancora citronelle,cir foster fin,cir.
section b renders voidable e very contract made in violation of any provision of the securities laws or of any rule or regulation thereunder,and every contract the performance of which involves such a violation.b see mills auto lite.if facebook violated rule,the winklevosses would be entitled to rescission of the settlement agreement.see mills,at royal air,smith,cir.
the winklevosses are sophisticated parties who were locked in a contentious struggle over ownership rights in one of the world companies.they engaged in discovery,which gave them access to a good deal of information about their opponents.they brought lawyers to the mediation.howard winklevoss father of cameron and tyler,former accounting professor at wharto
