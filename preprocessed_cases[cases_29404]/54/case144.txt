background 
republic and natc are competing distributors of cigarette papers.in january,a natc employee wrote a letter to one of republic largest retail customers,clark oil,stating that republic was violating natc patent and trademark rights and that,as a result,natc had taken legal action against one of republic other customers.in august,natc wrote a letter to all of its customers many were also republic customers,alleging that republic marketing programs violated federal and state antitrust laws.
republic sued natc for defamation and violations of the lanham act,a.it also sought a declaratory judgment that its marketing programs were lawful.natc filed counterclaims alleging that republic violated federal and state antitrust laws and that it committed a variety of other state law commercial torts.at the summary judgment stage,the district court dismissed all of natc claims and granted republic both the declaratory relief it sought and summary judgment on its defamation claim.on july,a jury awarded republic million in damages.
natc moved to stay execution of the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.it supported its motion with an affidavit from the company president and chief financial officer,david brunson,who averred that natc could not afford to secure an million appeal bond because it had no unencumbered assets to serve as collateral.it then asked the court to waive the security requirement or,alternatively,allow a security bond of million.republic opposed natc request to waive or reduce the security requirement and insisted on security in the full amount of the judgment.
the district court held four hearings to determine the proper security.on july,natc offered to post as security for the judgment a million letter of credit.based on an overnight review of natc public financial statements,however,republic complained that natc actually possessed million worth of unencumbered assets.natc responded that the assets were in fact encumbered and that it could only post million from a revolving line of credit.republic mentioned the possibility of accepting,in lieu of a bond,a second priority secured interest in natc assets,provided that it received more information about natc financial status,but natc never provided that documentation.
on july,natc advised the court that one of its investors could obtain an million loan for plus interest in response,republic offered to secure the judgment for million,which approximated the offer from natc investor.on july,the district court ordered natc to secure the full judgment,and natc promptly obtained the loan through its investor.
on november,the district court granted natc motion for a remittitur or,alternatively,a new trial and reduced the jury verdict to million.on december,republic accepted the remittitur,and the district court entered an amended judgment of million.natc immediately sought and obtained a reduction of the security to reduce the amount of interest paid on its loan.on january,the district court awarded republic in costs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d.
on september,this court affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in republic favor on natc antitrust claims and republic defamation claim.we also reduced republic damage award from million to million and ordered each party to bear its own costs.
on september,natc moved this court to award natc the costs,approximately million,that it incurred by securing the judgment to the extent it exceeded million.the court denied natc motion,stating,any request for costs associated with natc supersedeas bond should be directed to the district court.
following our instructions,natc filed a motion in the district court under federal rule of civil procedure d,seeking the costs it incurred by securing the jury million judgment during the district court proceedings.the motion also asked the court to award,under federal rule of appellate procedure e,the costs associated with securing the million judgment on appeal.
republic opposed the motion,arguing that natc was not entitled to costs incurred prior to appeal because it was not the prevailing party in the district court,it did not seek the costs within thirty days of judgment as required by local rule a,it did not prevail on appeal to justify an award of costs under rule e,and it chose an unnecessarily expensive mode of security.
the district court granted natc motion in its entirety.it pointed out that natc had to secure judgments before appeal,during appeal,and after appeal.it said that rule e allowed it to award costs during appeal and that local rule c allowed it to award costs before and after appeal it also rejected republic contention that natc costs in securing the judgment were unreasonably high.it found credible brunson assertion that natc attempted to obtain a bond from a bonding company but was unable to do so because it had no unencumbered assets to pledge as collateral.
ii.analysis 
prevailing party 
republic first argues that the district court erred by awarding natc,costs under federal rule of civil procedure d,because natc was not the prevailing party in the district court.natc responds that the district court correctly awarded those costs because it prevailed at the stage insofar as the district court reduced the jury damages award.the question,therefore,is whether a defendant can be a prevailing party under rule d if its only success in the district court is a reduction of the plaintiff damages award.the court reviews the district court interpretation of the phrase prevailing party de novo.see dattner conagra foods,cir dupuy samuels,cir reviewing de novo a district court interpretation of prevailing party for purposes of.
rule d states that costs other than attorney fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.courts and commentators have interpreted prevailing party to mean the party in whose favor judgment has been entered.moore federal practice ed see also barber williamson,cir noting that a party prevails if judgment is entered in its favor head medford,cir usually the litigant in whose favor judgment is rendered is the prevailing party for purposes of rule d.leasing ampex,cir reversing a district court award of costs to the defendant where the plaintiff won its breach of contract claim and was entitled to an award of nominal damages.additionally,one commentator has stated that a determination of who is the prevailing party for purposes of awarding costs should not depend on the position of the parties at each stage of the litigation but should be made when the controversy is finally decided.wright,miller,kane federal practice procedure ed.
we agree that a district court award of costs should not depend on who wins the various battles preceding final judgment.indeed,we have not found,and natc has not cited,any case in which an appellate court has upheld an award of costs to a party that did not obtain a judgment in its favor.in this case,republic prevailed,notwithstanding natc successful motion,because the district court entered a million judgment in its favor.consequently,the district court erred by taxing natc,costs against republic.
crawford and rule d 
even if natc had prevailed below,there is a second reason that the district court erred by awarding natc its,costs the supreme court has said that a district court may not tax costs under rule d unless a federal statute authorizes an award of those costs.see crawford fitting gibbons,d holding that expert witness fees in excess of the stat
