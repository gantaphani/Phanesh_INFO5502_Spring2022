dennis gandy is in the tree nursery business.he operated as a sole proprietor until,at which time he formed two corporations gandy nursery,to grow trees,and gandy marketing and trucking,to market and transport the trees.in,the irs began investigating gandy for criminal tax violations for the years,and.in september,gandy pled guilty to one count of making and subscribing to a false income tax return for the year,in violation of.the irs also issued gandy a statutory notice of deficiency,determining that he was liable for additional income taxes for the years through,and that he was liable for fraud penalties for those years.gandy filed a petition with the united states tax court contesting these determinations.the tax court found that gandy had fraudulently his income on his returns for the years through and that,as a result,gandy had filed income tax returns reporting negative adjusted gross income for the tax years from through.thus,the tax court determined that gandy was liable for fraud penalties for each of those years.the fifth circuit affirmed the tax court determination.see gandy commissioner,cch,wl.on may,in its amended findings of fact and conclusions of law in the present case,the district court found that the evidence at trial established that gandy had an outstanding tax liability of million.
according to the government,appellants had neither filed returns for nor paid employment taxes for several taxable periods,but the irs did not pursue the matter before because of the ongoing criminal proceedings against gandy.appellants note that in april,gandy discovered that his chief financial officer,mildred ann dozier had been embezzling funds that were to be used to pay employment taxes.dozier subsequently pled guilty to this alleged embezzlement scheme.
according to appellants,on april,after discovering the embezzlement,their accountant,tony morgan,met with tyler revenue officer jo kirkham and petitioned for a reasonable cause hearing on the penalties,pending appellants payment of the underlying taxes,and requested involuntary collection proceedings to be withheld until after the reasonable cause hearing.appellants claim that kirkham found reasonable cause existed as to some of the quarters for which appellants had failed to file employment taxes.she assured morgan that the irs would not issue a levy on appellants accounts until after the irs dallas office had determined if reasonable cause existed as to all quarters.nevertheless,appellants claim that kirkham began civil collection actions on behalf of the irs and,in august,levied on appellants bank accounts.
the government describes the same events differently.it states that in,appellants filed delinquent employment tax returns for several preceding years.upon receipt,the irs assessed employment taxes,interest,and and penalties against all appellants.appellants tendered payment of the employment taxes,directing that the funds be applied only to the taxes,and not to the related interest or penalties.they also filed administrative claims for abatement of the taxes and penalties.according to the government,kirkham testified at trial that during her meeting with morgan she agreed to refrain from collecting by levy so long as appellants abided by certain conditions,which included paying the interest due on the employment tax by july,and submitted proof that they were remaining current on their employment tax obligations.by late august,kirkham had concluded that the agreement was no longer effective because appellants had not kept their side of the deal.thus,in august,the irs served a levy on the agricultural production credit association pca,an institution at which gandy had deposits,to collect the assessments made against gandy for penalties and interest.the pca issued a check to the irs in the amount of on august.this sum satisfied all interest and penalties on the employment tax,so the irs released the liens.in december,the irs service center granted gandy claims for abatement of the penalties.thus,it began refunding to gandy some of the pca funds that had been applied to the penalties.but before refunding all of the funds,a special agent with the criminal investigation division of the irs contacted the service center with instructions that the abatements of the penalties of the employment taxes be reversed.thus,the service center ceased issuing refunds and reassessed the penalties,without notice or demand.neither party cites the precise date of the reassessment of penalties.tax liens were filed in april and again in september,according to appellants and the record.
on january,appellants filed administrative claims with the irs to obtain release of the liens.according to appellants,on august,the irs refused in writing to refund any of appellants funds that had been applied to the penalties,or to remove any of the liens filed against appellants in april and september.on december,appellants filed administrative claims for relief from wrongful collection actions,but the irs again refused to stop the collection actions or to remove the liens.according to appellants,the issuance of the tax liens prevented appellants from purchasing property for the expansion of their business.in addition,the liens prevented appellants from selling property or receiving the fair rental value for their property.
appellants then filed this action in district court on november,and a first amended complaint on january.the government filed its answer to the first amended complaint on february.although appellants filed a second amended complaint with leave of court on january,no answer was filed immediately.
in their second amended complaint,appellants sought abatement of the unpaid balance of penalty assessments for late filing of employment tax returns and late payment of employment tax refund of payments that had been credited toward the penalty assessments damages under for negligent failure to release a tax lien and damages under for unauthorized tax collection practices.in addition,appellant gandy sought a refund of fraud penalties assessed against him.
although the deadline to file dispositive motions expired on january,the government filed an answer to the second amended complaint without leave of the court on august,over three years after the second amended complaint was filed and days before trial was scheduled to begin.and,on august,over appellants objection,the government was granted leave to file a motion for partial dismissal summary judgment,which motion was denied in its entirety.
appellants had a right to a jury trial on the refund and abatement issues,see,martin,discussing the constitutional underpinnings of providing a right to a jury on such matters,aff,cir,and the presiding magistrate judge allowed the jury to sit in an advisory capacity over the damages issues pursuant to rule c.at trial,the jury found in favor of appellants on the employment tax penalt
