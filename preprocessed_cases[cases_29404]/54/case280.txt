on september,after learning that shaw was beginning an appearance on a weekly show on mtv networks mtv,ellerbee sent supplemental instructions by overnight mail to the sheriff department.ellerbee was concerned that shaw show,a live reality show,could be terminated at any time.in his instructions to the sheriff department,ellerbee attorney explained the debtor was currently being paid on a weekly basis,and requested the writ be served on mtv,as soon as possible.the sheriff department received ellerbee supplemental instructions on september and,on that day,advised ellerbee attorney it would promptly process the levy and garnishment.on september day wrote to the sheriff department to ascertain the status of the service of the writ.he stressed that time was of the essence because monies owed ellerbee may have been paid to shaw by third parties,and urged the sheriff to take prompt action to ensure that sony bmg and mtv were served.the sheriff department served mtv on october.

the trial court ordered the parties to participate in a mediation.prior to that proceeding,the mediator advised the parties that in his experience,the single most important factor contributing to the success of mediation is the presence of both parties.accordingly,pursuant to the california rules of court,the mediator required that all parties having authority to settle be present at the mediation.telephonic availability is not an acceptable substitute.
ellerbee attorney attended the mediation,as did ellerbee and nelson.no representative from the county or the sheriff department was present.nelson represented that he had client representatives on telephone standby,and the mediation proceeded.near the conclusion of the mediation,ellerbee made a settlement offer,and requested that nelson communicate it to his client.at that point nelson admitted that he did not have anyone with settlement authority on standby the mediation was terminated.

appealabilitya.motion for judgment on the pleadings 
the county purports to appeal from the trial court order denying its motion for judgment on pleadings.ellerbee argues the appeal is not because the order is nonappealable.ellerbee also asserts that even if that january,order were appealable,this appeal,initially filed june,and amended three days later to add nelson,would be untimely.ellerbee is correct on both counts.see code civ,neufeld state bd.of equalization th,fn an order granting or denying a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not an appealable order because it is not final,but only a preliminary or interlocutory order.the proper appeal is from an actual judgment,little mountain view dairies cal d,cal.rules of court,rule a latest date on which notice of appeal may be filed is days from entry of order.
