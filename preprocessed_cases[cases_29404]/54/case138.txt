in a separate suit,the plaintiffs sued to pierce the corporate veil of the defendant corporations in the same court.charles stevenson,don moore,employ america,llc,and encompass financial solutions,llc were also named as defendants in the second suit,based on their respective insider relationships with the corporate defendants and for their failure to observe corporate formalities.
in the collection suit,the plaintiffs filed four motions to set aside fraudulent transfers for a preliminary injunction to prevent the disposition of assets for the appointment of a receiver and to dissolve the corporate defendants.defendants failed to respond to these motions even after receiving two extensions of time.defendants instead filed a motion to consolidate the collection case with the piercing case or,alternatively,to transfer the collection case to the district court judge presiding over the piercing case.
on august,the district court denied the motion to consolidate it also found that defendants fraudulently transferred certain assets to charles stevenson,don moore,employ america,llc,and encompass financial solutions,llc the transferees were in possession of the defendants property and ordered the transferees to return the assets within days.the district court also enjoined further disposition of the transferred assets.
on september,the defendants filed a motion requesting the court to reconsider the finding that the transfers were fraudulent.the district court denied the motion on october,it found that the defendants,despite extensions,had not responded to the plaintiffs motion to set aside the fraudulent transfers and that the motion for consolidation was not an adequate response.
plaintiffs filed renewed motions for judicial dissolution and for the appointment of a receiver.the district court granted this motion on october,it held that the judgment in the amount of remained unsatisfied,and that the defendants were and had admitted to being insolvent.
the defendants appealed the orders of october,and october.this court questioned whether final and appealable judgments had been entered by the district court and ordered the defendants to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction or to voluntarily dismiss the appeal.defendants then voluntarily dismissed the appeals pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure b.
plaintiffs then moved for the entry of the judgment of plus interest against the transferees for their failure to return the fraudulently transferred assets as ordered by the district court on august.on january,the district court granted this motion and denied the transferees motion to reconsider on february.
on february,the various defendants and the transferees appealed the district court orders of august,october,october,and january.
discussion 
the defendants and the transferees argue that the district court erred in denying the motion to consolidate since the collection case and the piercing case involved the same judgment and almost identical parties.they also argue that the district court erred in entering judgment against the transferees.before we address the merit s,a threshold question arises over the scope of our appellate jurisdiction and which of the appealed orders are reviewable.
appellate jurisdiction 
for purposes of appellate jurisdiction,our review of whether there has been a final order is de novo.trustees of pension,welfare vacation fringe benefit funds of ibew local pyramid electric,cir.this court has jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.generally,the question of whether a decision is final for purposes of depends on whether the district court decision ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.van cauwenberghe biard,d.conversely,orders that specifically contemplate further activity in the district court are generally not final.pyramid electric,at internal citations omitted.however,if an order contemplates only ministerial actions by the court,finality may exist.id.
this rule postpones the appeal until the final judgment,but in the context of the appeal before us,we are reviewing orders after the entry of a final judgment.because the judgment against the defendants was not,their assets were neither seized nor sold to pay the district court issued a series of orders in a proceeding to complete the execution of the judgment.supplementary proceedings to enforce a judgment are treated,for the purposes of appeal,as separate,lawsuits.resolution trust ruggiero,cir citing cases.we treat orders in those proceedings as appealable,to the same extent as in a regular lawsuit.id.
leading off with the january,order,where the district court entered judgment against the transferees,no one disagrees that we have appellate jurisdiction to review that order since the notice of appeal was filed on february,see fed.a,and plaintiffs argue that the orders dated august,and october,were final and immediately appealable when entered,but because the defendants filed their notice of appeal in february,the appeals are untimely and can not be considered by this court 
as to the august,order,the plaintiffs are correct that certain aspects of this order were immediately appealable and the appeal untimely.there are several aspects to this order the grant of plaintiff preliminary injunction against the defendants the set aside of fraudulent transfers and the order to the transferees to turn over those transfers the denial of plaintiffs motions for appointment of a receiver and a judicial dissolution of the defendants and the denial of the defendants motion to consolidate the collection case with the piercing case.
the plaintiffs argue that the entire august,order was immediately reviewable because the preliminary injunction contained therein was immediately reviewable,a,and also because the order was immediately reviewable.laborers pension fund dirty work unlimited,cir.but labeling the entire order as immediately appealable ignores the discretionary,interlocutory order lying within.here,there are separate orders,derived from separate motions by the parties,contained in one document.but for jurisdictional purposes,what is really at issue is the discretionary denial of the motion to consolidate,an interlocutory order unappealable until final judgment.
the fact that some aspects of the august,order were immediately appealable does not alter the interlocutory nature of the district court decision to deny consolidation.see helene curtis,church dwight,cir although a preliminary injunction was immediately appealable,an incidental discretionary order was unreviewable as not final for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.after the final order dated january,the defendants timely appealed.
accordingly,we now have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of consolidation.
consolidation 
the defendants argue that the district court in the collection case erred when it denied the motion to consolidate the case with the piercing case or,alternatively,transfer the collection case to the judge presiding over the piercing case,since there were abundant similarities between the actions.we review a district court decision granting or denying a motion to consolidate only for an abuse of discretion.king general,cir.
a district court may consolidate actions that involve a common question of law or fact.a.local rule b also allows for related cases to be consolidated before the judge assigned
