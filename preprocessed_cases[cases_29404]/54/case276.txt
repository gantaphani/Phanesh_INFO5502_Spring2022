counsel attending a mandatory settlement conference in superior court are encouraged to settle all differences between the parties.but,if they want to settle a civil action and a related worker compensation action,they must obtain approval of the workmen compensation appeals board wcab.as we explain,the difficulty is not insurmountable and we fashion a remedy which is practical and workable,the settlement is conditional upon wcab approval.
wendy ann steller appeals from the judgment enforcing a settlement agreement between her and respondent,sears holdings management companys.code civ.she contends that the trial court erroneously interpreted the settlement agreement as encompassing both of her actions against respondent a civil action for disability discrimination and a workers compensation action.she argues that the settlement agreement encompassed only her civil action because labor code section requires wcab approval before a worker compensation can be settled.
neither the settlement agreement nor the judgment expressly require that settlement of the workers compensation claim be approved by the wcab.but,we construe the judgment as requiring the wcab subsequent approval.as so construed,we affirm the judgment.we also conclude that,because the settlement agreement was ambiguous,the trial court should have considered extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.but this error was harmless and we easily conclude that the trial court would have enforced the settlement even if it had considered the extrinsic evidence.
factual and procedural background 
in april appellant filed a civil action for disability discrimination against respondent.she claimed that respondent had failed to reinstate her with reasonable accommodation to her disability upon termination of a workers compensation leave of absence because of her disability,a bad back.concurrently with this action,appellant was pursuing a workers compensation proceeding against respondent the parties were represented by different counsel before the wcab.appellant workers compensation claim arose from the same alleged back injury as the disability discrimination claim.
in april respondent served appellant with an offer to compromise pursuant to section offer.the offer was made in the civil action and does not expressly mention the workers compensation action.the offer stated in return for the acceptance of the terms of this offer,respondent will pay appellant the total sum of.paragraph of the offer declared that payment of the includes,and shall operate as a satisfaction of all claims for,appellant alleged damages,costs and expenses,attorneys fees and interest asserted or that could have been asserted by appellant in this action,as well as all demands,actions,liabilities,obligations,damages causes of action arising from this lawsuit or relating to appellant employment with respondent.italics added.the italicized language appeared at lines of paragraph.the offer required appellant to dismiss the lawsuit,the disability discrimination action.but the offer did not expressly mention the workers compensation action or its case number.
on may,the parties attended a mandatory settlement conference in superior court.after discussing settlement both in and out of chambers,appellant counsel announced in open court that his client accepted respondent offer and the matter was settled.in june appellant filed a section motion for entry of a judgment in the disability discrimination action.appellant argued that the only legally permissible interpretation of the offer is that it did not include the settlement of the workers compensation proceeding within the dollar amount contained in the offer.respondent filed a for entry of a judgment specifying that the offer represents the settlement of appellant disability discrimination suit and appellant related workers compensation claim.both parties submitted declarations in support of their motions.the declarations contained extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.
a hearing on the motions was conducted in august.the trial court ruled that the language of paragraph,lines,unambiguously applied to all claims relating to appellant employment,including the workers compensation claim.it did not consider the extrinsic evidence contained in the parties declarations saying the offer was signed in open court by appellant counsel,and the court interpretation of paragraph of the,and i do think we have to go any farther than that.sic.so the declarations and everything else about what was discussed in negotiation we do need to even consider that.all we have to consider is the offer language,and i focused on paragraph in lines and,and the court feels that is sufficient enough for the court to grant the motion to compel the settlement brought by respondent pursuant to on september,the court signed a formal order granting respondent motion to enforce terms of settlement agreement.the order states that the language of paragraph,lines and,is sufficient to include any workers compensation claim appellant has arising from this lawsuit or relating to her employment with respondent.
section and labor code sections,
section provides if parties to pending litigation stipulate,in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,for settlement of the case,or part thereof,the court,upon motion,may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.although a judge hearing a section motion may receive evidence,determine disputed facts,and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment citations,nothing in section authorizes a judge to create the material terms of a settlement,as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon.citation.osumi sutton th.
we construe the judgment as encompassing both the disability discrimination and workers compensation claims.but,as indicated,pursuant to labor code sections and,the settlement agreement could not compromise or release appellant workers compensation claim without the approval of the wcab.
labor code section provides in relevant part no release of liability or compromise agreement is valid unless it is approved by the appeals board or referee.labor code section provides a copy of the release or compromise agreement signed by both parties shall forthwith be filed with the appeals board.upon filing with and approval by the appeals board,it may,without notice,of its own motion or on the application of either party,enter its award based upon the release or compromise agreement.
undoubtedly the legislature,in enacting this section labor code section,was primarily concerned with protecting workmen who might agree to unfortunate compromises of workers compensation liability because of economic pressure or lack of competent advice.citation.however,the effect of the section,by its clear wording,is to make every compromise invalid until it is approved by the wcab.citations.chavez industrial acc.commission cal d.
thus,there is a significant difference in legal effect between a release of tort liability and a release of workmen compensation liability a tort release is effective upon execution,but a compromise and release of workmen compensation liability is invalid until approved by the workmen compensation appeals board.citations.these safeguards against improvident releases place a workmen compensation release upon a higher plane than a private contractual release johnson workmen.bd.cal d.
the requirement that the wcab approve a compromise and release of workers compensation liability is set forth in the california administrative code,title,section the workers compensation appeals board shall inquire into the adequacy of all compromise and release agreements and stipulations with request for award,and may set the matter for hearing to take evidence when necessary to determine whether the agreement should be approved or disapproved,or issue findings and awards.
both the trial court and the parties are presumed to have known that a settlement of the workers compensation claim would require the wcab approval.the record does support the conclusion that the attorneys and t
