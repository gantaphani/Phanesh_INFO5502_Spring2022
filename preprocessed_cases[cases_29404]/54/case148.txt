most mutual funds and other investment companies come within the scope of the investment company act of because they hold themselves out as being engaged primarily,or propos ing to engage primarily,in the business of investing,reinvesting,or trading in securities.a a.but firms can be dragged within the act coverage kicking and screaming,even though they depict themselves as operating businesses rather than as managing other people money.any issuer that owns investment securities worth of its total assets is an investment company under a c unless some other provision of the act takes it outside the definition.for this purpose,however,government securities and cash items are omitted from both the numerator and the denominator.
national presto industries,a seller of both consumer goods cookware,diapers,and other household items and munitions,used to make everything it sold.during the it began to divest its manufacturing facilities and to contract production to third parties.in the department of defense closed a facility that presto had used to make artillery shells.presto was left with a pile of cash,most of which it retained with a plan to acquire other businesses,and a shrunken book value of operating assets.financial instruments were of its total assets by and in.since presto has purchased two manufacturers of military supplies and two makers of diapers and puppy pads.but in financial instruments still represented of its physical and financial assets.intellectual property,although of considerable value to presto,is not carried on corporate books at its full economic value,so this ratio overstates the significance of its portfolio of securities,but presto does not argue that it could come under the ratio by marking its patents and trademarks to current market value.
all of presto consumer products other than absorbent products are made by subcontractors,so although it has a substantial operating income it does not have operating assets to the investment company act main test is.the sec concluded that presto was well past the trigger.when the firm refused to register as an investment make the changes to its corporate structure,management,and financial reporting required of investment request an administrative exemption,the sec filed this suit to seek an injunction that would require compliance.after preliminary maneuvering vindicated the sec choice of forum,see cir,the district court granted summary judgment in the agency favor,d,and issued an injunction requiring presto to register under the act.the firm has complied pending appeal.
after suffering defeat on the merits,presto replaced enough of its existing portfolio with government securities and cash items to bring investment securities under the threshold.the sec had proposed an injunction that would have allowed presto the opportunity to do this or to seek an administrative exemption in lieu of registration the firm thought to avail itself of the opportunity even before the injunction was entered.
without inviting comment from the parties,however,the district judge deleted these options from the sec draft and entered an injunction unconditionally requiring presto to register as an investment company.the judge did not explain why.the result was a regulatory mismatch a firm that is today required by statute to be organized and to report its financial position as an operating company is required by injunction to be organized and report its financial position as an investment company.instead of doing this,the district court would have been well advised to craft an injunction commanding registration only if presto should revert to its old portfolio design obliging it to register as an investment company even when its investments do not require this is hard to fathom except as a form of punishment for presto conduct in past years,and civil injunctions are not supposed to punish litigants.
the unconditional injunction has caused considerable trouble.investment companies are subject to many governance requirements that do not apply to operating companies.see,and the corresponding regulations.presto auditor,grant thornton,resigned because the sec questioned its certification of presto financial statements as those of an operating company.now that presto is officially an investment company,grant thornton has refused to allow the statements it certified to be used for any purpose.this has disabled presto from complying fully with either the investment company act or the securities exchange act of.without the financial statements,it is unable to file quarterly and annual reports.it has hired another auditor,but recreating and financial statements for many past years is expensive and time consuming.meanwhile stock exchanges have threatened to delist its stock because presto is out of compliance with both statutory and requirements.
at oral argument we inquired whether presto financial rearrangement has made the case moot.now that it has complied with the injunction by registering as an investment company,ca it deregister and go back to its preferred status as an operating company,subject to registration under the securities exchange act,no matter what happens on appeal deregistration requires the consent of the sec,however,and although presto filed the appropriate papers with the agency in january the sec has failed to act on them.
one senses from this prolonged silence,and the tenor of the sec brief and oral argument,that the agency or its senior staff is in a snit because presto declined to do what many other firms with excess liquid assets have to the agency for an exemption.see b.microsoft,for example,holds more than of its assets in the form of investment securities but received permission to operate outside the act.the agency counsel implied at oral argument that an exemption would have been forthcoming if sought.yet a firm refusal to kowtow to an agency is not a good reason to force its investors to bear unnecessary it is the investors who must pay to recreate the financial statements,though they did not contribute to this keep a firm inappropriately registered,as presto now is.why is the sec bent on grinding down a corporation that it appears to acknowledge would not mislead or otherwise injure investors by using the governance and reporting devices appropriate to an operating company 
because presto remains registered as an investment company while the sec sits on its hands,there is a live case or controversy,because a remedy is possible we could end its registration forthwith.moreover,if we hold that presto former portfolio does not bring it within the investment company act,it will be free to rejigger its investments the old investments likely had a higher rate of return,which is why presto switched only after the district court opinion.
let us begin,then,with presto argument that even before the recent changes to its portfolio,enough of its investments were government securities and cash items to keep its investment securities under the trigger.
government securities is a defined term.the phrase means any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the united states,or by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the united states pursuant to authority granted by the congress of the united states or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing.a.according to presto,municipal bonds refunded bonds for short fit this definition.presto held these instruments in quantity.
a refunded bond is a bond backed by securities as well as the credit of the issuer.suppose that a municipality issues bonds for a project say,an airport and that the market rate of interest later falls.the issuer would like to take advantage of the lower rate,but the bonds lack a call feature.the municipality can issue new bonds at the current lower rate and use the proceeds to buy treasury bonds with the same maturity as the original issue of municipal bonds.the treasury securities are held in trust to pay interest and principal on the original issue.the municipality pays the interest on the new issue the treasury securities may cover the old issue,and if not the municipality can chip in the difference.refinancing in this way works because municipal bonds are not subject to federal taxes,so they often pay lower interest rates than treasury securities.bonds that can be bought with the proceeds of the new municipal issue may produce enough interest by themselves to cover the interest on the old issue.
the treasury bonds held in trust lead presto to call the refunded bonds themselves government securities.it should be apparent,however,that they do not fit the statutory definition.refunded municipal bonds are still municipal bonds,exactly as they were before the refunding transaction.municipal bonds are neither issued nor guaranteed by the national government or any federal instrumentality.if the municipality defaults,or a local employee reaches into the till and makes off with the treasury securities,the national government will not cover the loss.the bonds in trust make the municipal bonds safer,but a does not include in the category of government securities everything that a company deems almost as safe as treasury securities.
the argument x has the same economic attributes as y,so x must have the same legal attributes as y has a history in securities law.it was the basis of the doctrine that many courts accepted before landreth timber landreth,d.the idea was that someone who bought all of the stock in a corporation was buying the corporation assets,as an economic matter,so the transaction should not be governed by the securities laws.landreth timber held,however,that someone who wants the legal treatment of an asset acquisition must buy the assets rather than the stock people may choose between transacting in securities and transacting in assets,and the law follows the only because that is what the statute says,but also because trying to determine,one case at a time,when a transaction really has the economic attributes of a different form would lead to a great deal of uncertainty for little purpose.landreth timber represents the norm in securities law.stock or bonds in a company that invests the proceeds in land,or gold,or art,are still regulated as securities rather than as land,or gold,or art.pooled interests in orange groves are regulated as investment contracts rather than as oranges.see sec howey.and municipal bonds issued by a city that plans to repay using bonds are still municipal bonds.
securities laws regulate the form of financial transactions,rather than looking through form to substance.see reves ernst young,d demand notes are regulated as securities even though they have many economic attributes of exempt instruments.true enough,begins,as several other definitional clauses in the securities laws do,with the phrase,unless the context otherwise requires.the supreme court used this in marine bank weaver,d,to hold that a interest in a neighbor farm in exchange for a loan,the sort of investment that could not even in principle be traded among anonymous not be treated as a security.
we know from rowland california men colony,d,however,as well as from landreth timber,that this use of the context clause can not be generalized into a norm that substance trumps form.rowland holds that context clauses refer to linguistic rather than economic contexts,and even as so limited should be they when the context of a phrase elsewhere in a statute requires a departure from the definitional clause.neither the interest in the neighbor farm nor the bank account involved in marine bank was a security under the securities exchange act because neither fit the model of homogenous instruments that at least potentially could be traded among anonymous investors.the context clause prevented a need to jam a square peg into a round hole.see scott fitzgibbon,what is a security a redefinition based on eligibility to participate in the financial markets.but nothing in a c similarly requires a departure from the definition in a.the definition of the phrase government securities in the latter makes perfect sense when plugged into the former.
judge friendly once remarked,with respect to the definition of the term note in the securities laws so long as the statutes remain as they have been for over forty years,courts had better not depart from their words without strong support for the conviction that,under the authority vested in them by the context clause,they are doing what congress wanted when they refuse to do what it said.exchange national bank of chicago touche ross,cir.that high standard has not been met here.the investment company act has been with us for years without giving problems through the definition of government securities.and even if there were some wriggle room via the context clause,presto has not established that refunded bonds are the economic equivalent of treasury bonds.a report in the record from morgan stanley shows that the yield for treasury bonds maturing in was,while the taxable equivalent yield for refunded bonds was for taxpayers in the bracket.that a premium over treasuries,which must reflect extra risk.the nominal interest rate for refunded bonds is below that for treasury bonds,because of the tax subsidy for municipal securities an adjustment must be made to find real returns and implicit risks.
mutual funds may treat refunded bonds as if they were government securities for the purpose of,which says how an investment company portfolio must be structured if it calls itself diversified.see b.how can refunded bonds be government securities for one purpose but not the other,presto asks.yet treating a as if it were b for one purpose does not imply that a is b for every purpose.the regulation on which presto relies governs how investment companies describe their portfolios that a very different subject from whether something is an investment company in the first place.equating refunded bonds with treasury securities for the purpose of diversification allows mutual funds to offer tax advantages which refunded bonds supply without any change in the covariance of risk across a fund assets.denying investors that opportunity would injure them it sensible for the sec to look at the economic attributes of instruments when determining what counts as diversification another economic inquiry while insisting that the statutory definition be used to determine what entities are covered by the statute in the first place.
cash items also are excluded when calculating the ratio,and presto maintains that demand notes should be treated as cash items.a demand note is an instrument usually a bond or debenture whose rate of interest is updated weekly if not more often based on some index,such as the london interbank offering rate.whenever the interest rate changes,the note holder is entitled to redeem at par.usually this transaction is handled by a remarketing agent,who buys the note from the holder and resells it in the secondary market to another investor the note issuer is involved only if the note is trading for less than par.
in contrast to the detailed statutory definition of government securities,the investment company act does not define cash items.presto maintains that demand notes are equivalent to cash because of the weekly opportunity to sell the instruments at par for cash.if liquidity were enough,however,one would treat all shares of stock in large issuers,and many bonds,as cash items because they can be sold on liquid markets in a matter of minutes.the reason that such investments are not treated as cash or its equivalent,however,is that the market price the instrument will fetch when sold is variable.presto thinks that the redeem at par feature of the demand note insulates them from that sort of risk,but that not true.the investor is entitled to demand redemption at par,but whether the issuer will comply depends on its financial health.a business reverse or,for a municipal issuer,a shortfall of taxes will mean no redemption,or redemption at a discount.that a kind of risk an investor takes with any stock or does not take with cash.
although the statute does not define cash item,the sec gave this definition when adopting a rule 
for purposes of determining compliance with the propose
