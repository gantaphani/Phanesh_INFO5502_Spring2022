george clinton appeals the district court order appointing a receiver,assigning four master sound recording copyrights to the receiver,and authorizing the receiver to use the copyrights to the extent necessary to satisfy monetary judgments a law firm obtained against him.clinton also raises several issues for the first time on appeal,including fraud on the court and judicial estoppel.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
h l judgments against clinton 
george clinton is a musician,bandleader,and touring performance artist.hendricks lewis h l is a law firm that represented clinton in various disputes from march to august.h l billed clinton for its work,received in payment,and wrote off approximately of the remaining balance.this left due.h l initiated arbitration to secure payment of the balance,and an arbitration panel issued an award in favor of h clinton did not participate in the arbitration proceedings.h l petitioned the western district of washington for an order confirming the arbitration award,and,in may,the district court entered judgment for h l against clinton in the amount of,plus interest.the court entered a second judgment awarding h l an additional in attorneys fees and costs in july.
h l judgment collection efforts 
h l pursued a variety of judgment collection efforts,including garnishments,levies,and liens in several districts across the country.clinton attorney declared that these actions created a financial stranglehold so that clinton c a pay his taxes.ca pay his lawyers.now,it is going to affect his touring and his ability to make a living at years old.
ownership history of the masters 
in july,clinton,through his production company,thang,inc,entered into a recording contract with warner.records in which clinton agreed to make master recordings of his performances with the group funkadelic the masters.clinton had previously entered into a valid and binding agreement with thang to render his services as a recording artist solely and exclusively for thang.
the recording contract between thang and warner provided that warner 
shall own in perpetuity throughout the world all right,title and interest in and to all the results and proceeds of thang and clinton services and performances hereunder,including the sole and exclusive ownership of any and all masters,the copyrights therein throughout the universe,and the right to extend or renew such copyrights,and thang and clinton acknowledge that they shall at no time have any right,title or interest in the foregoing.
the agreement further provided that thang 
acknowledges and agrees that warner is and shall be the owner of all rights of copyright in records embodying the results and proceeds of clinton services,including the exclusive right to copyright same as sound recordings in the name of warner to renew and extend such copyrights it being agreed that for this purpose thang and clinton are deemed warner employees for hire and to exercise all rights of the thereunder.to the extent,if any that thang or clinton may be deemed an author of such sound recordings,thang and clinton further grant to warner a power of attorney,irrevocable and coupled with an interest for thang and clinton and in thang clinton name,to apply for and obtain and on obtaining same,to assign to warner,all such renewal copyrights.clinton signed a substantially similar agreement with warner in may.under these agreements,the masters at issue in this appeal hardcore jollies,one nation under a groove,uncle jam wants you,and the electric spanking of war babies were created,and warner registered the copyrights in those recordings as works made for hire in its name as author.
in august,to resolve a separate dispute involving clinton,warner,and other parties,clinton and warner entered into a settlement agreement under which warner agreed to relinquish its ownership of the clinton masters at issue in this appeal,if or when clinton entered into an agreement with a third party to distribute and sell records produced from the masters.clinton ownership of the masters was eventually confirmed through litigation in when the central district of california issued an order that clinton is the sole owner of the masters and has been the sole owner of the masters since.clinton subsequently sued third parties for copyright infringement of the masters.
ii.procedural history 
in july,approximately one year after h l secured its judgments for attorneys fees against clinton,clinton sued h l in the western district of washington alleging various theories of legal malpractice.h l asserted judgment collection counterclaims and moved for an order authorizing the sale of the masters to satisfy the judgments it had secured against clinton.in april,h l initiated a separate action in the western district of washington seeking an order for a judgment debtor examination of clinton.h l subsequently filed a motion in this separate action for the appointment of a receiver and for an order directing the assignment of the masters to the receiver.h l counterclaims in the malpractice action were severed and consolidated with the action initiated by h l,which is at issue here 
in november,the district court found that d espite numerous efforts to enforce the subject judgments in this and other district s,plaintiff has recovered less than.the district court appointed a receiver in an order specifying that the receiver 
shall have all of the rights,powers,duties,and authority vested in him under applicable washington law,including but not limited to authority and control over the funkadelic master sound recordings hardcore jollies,one nation under a groove,uncle jam wants you,and the electric spanking of war babies,in order to maximize the value of the sound recordings for the benefit of the parties and to make whole the judgment creditor,h l.receiver shall,to the greatest extent possible,maximize the income stream from the funkadelic master sound recordings without selling or otherwise permanently disposing of the copyrights.ideally,the receiver will utilize the copyright and sound recordings over a one or two year period to satisfy the judgments and pay the expenses of the receivership before returning the copyrights and master sound recordings to clinton.notwithstanding the court preference for returning the recordings and copyrights to clinton after his debts are satisfied,the receiver has the authority to sell or permanently dispose of any or all of the master sound recordings.
emphasis added.the district court also ordered that it would have to any sale of the masters 
in entering its order,the district court considered the text and legislative history of copyright act e,which protects individual authors from the involuntary transfer of their copyrights.the district court ruled that clinton was not entitled to e protection because he is either an assignee of the original author or he has previously transferred the copyrights voluntarily.the district court noted that the initial agreements between warner and clinton,and between warner and thang,specifically granted the copyrights in the sound recordings to warner.the court concluded that warner was the original author of the masters under both the copyright act and the parties contract,and that clinton was not eligible for protection under e of the copyright act.the district court reasoned that clinton,who obtained ownership of the masters in,is an assignee,not the author for purposes of the act.in the alternative,the court reasoned that even if it found clinton was the original author,he voluntarily transferred the copyrights to warner,thus making himself ineligible for protection under e.finally,the district court concluded that the masters recording copyrights,like any other species of personal property,are subject to judicial sale or assignment to satisfy a judgment.
clinton appeals.
iii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court interpretations of the copyright act.rossi motion picture ass of am,cir.the appointment of a receiver is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see cameron groveland improvement,king cnty.dep t of cmty.human servs.nw.defenders ass n.because a court invokes judicial estoppel at its discretion,we review the application of judicial estoppel to the particular facts of a case for abuse of discretion.johnson oregon,cir.
clinton copyrights in the masters are subject to execution to satisfy judgments entered against him.
federal rule of civil procedure a governs execution proceedings.it provides 
t he procedure on execution and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of a judgment or execution must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located,but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.
a.we therefore look to washington law,which generally allows money judgments to be enforced by execution all property,real and personal,of the judgment debtor that is not exempted by law is liable to execution.washington law does not specifically address whether copyrights,like other types of property,are subject to sale or assignment in order to satisfy a judgment,but federal law establishes that copyrights are alienable.d provides that t he ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law.
we know of no federal statutory law directly addressing whether copyrights are subject to execution to satisfy a judgment.both h l and the district court relied on federal common law,specifically ager murray.the ager court ruled that if a patent holder refused to assign his patent to satisfy a judgment entered against him,the trustee was authorized to execute the assignment on his behalf.id.at.though ager involved a patent rather than a copyright,the district court analogy to patent law is rooted in our case law.our court has said that where copyright case law is lacking,it is appropriate to look for guidance to patent law because of the historic kinship between patent law and copyright law.harris emus records,cir quoting sony of am.universal city studios.indeed,ager itself discusses patents and copyrights in tandem.see at t he provisions of the patent and copyright acts,securing a sole and exclusive right to the patentee,do not exonerate the right and property from liability to be subjected by suitable judicial proceedings to the payment of his debts.the authority cited by the district court is helpful,but rule requires that state law controls execution proceedings absent express statutory authority,not federal common law.see.a.
our court confronted an analogous issue in office depot.zuccarini,cir,where we considered whether internet domain names are subject to execution in california.consistent with rule,in office depot our court first looked to california law because there is no specific federal statute addressing whether domain names may be the subject of judgment execution efforts.because california law permits writs of execution against intangible assets generally,and because domain names are intangible personal property,we held that internet domain names are subject to execution in california.id.at.
here,rule required that the district court look to washington law in the absence of a federal statute addressing whether copyrights may be subject to execution procedures,and washington law provides that all property,real and personal,is subject to execution.johnson dahlquist.this rule,known as the johnson rule,was first articulated when a previous version of.was in effect,but,subject to narrow exceptions that are not applicable here,washington courts continue to follow it.see mp med.wegman.as ager recognizes,copyrights,like patents,are a form of intangible personal property.at.therefore,unless an exception or exemption applies,washington law permits h l to execute against clinton copyrights in the masters.
clinton challenges the district court reliance on washington admittedly broad and general execution statutes and the district court analogy to patent law.he argues that e of the copyright act precludes h l execution efforts.for the first time on appeal,he also argues that c of the copyright act prohibits execution against his copyrights because he enjoys the inalienable right to terminate the assignment of his copyrights to warner as discussed below,both arguments fail.
copyright act e does not protect clinton from the involuntary transfer of his copyrighted works.
clinton argues that e of the copyright act protects the subject copyrights from h l judgment collection efforts.neither the statute plain text nor its legislative history supports clinton argument.
we begin with the statutory language.section e provides 
when an individual author ownership of a copyright,or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright,has not previously been transferred voluntarily by that individual author,no action by any governmental body or other official or organization purporting to seize,expropriate,transfer,or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the copyright,or any of the exclusive rights under a copyright,shall be given effect under this title,except as provided under title.
e emphases added.a leading authority on copyright law explains 
the stated purpose of this prohibition was to protect foreign authors against laws and decrees purporting to divest them of their rights under the united states copyright statute,and would protect authors within the foreign country who choose to resist such covert pressures.more particularly it was feared that the soviet union,by its accession to the universal copyright convention on february,would be enabled to enforce censorship in the united states of the works of its dissident authors through the device of seizing the ownership of such works,and then by enforcing the american copyright therein,enjoin any public distribution within the united states.
melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright footnote omitted.the legislative history of e explains that t he purpose of this subsection is to reaffirm the basic principle that the united states copyright of an individual author shall be secured to that author,and can not be taken away by any involuntary transfer,at,reprinted in,
section e is of no help to clinton because he is not the author of the masters within the meaning of the copyright act.thang specifically agreed in its contract with warner that warner would be the sole owner of the master recordings resulting from the parties contract.thang and clinton were deemed warner employees for hire in the same contract as noted,the parties signed a substantially similar agreement in,and it is uncontested that all four masters were created under these agreements.b provides i n the case of a work made for hire,the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author for purposes of the copyright act,and,unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them,owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.warner registered the masters as works made for hire within five years of publication,listing warner.records as the author on the registration form.copyright act c states 
in any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.the evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration made thereafter shall be within the discretion of the court.
c.this language persuasively supports h l argument that,on this ground alone,the district court could reasonably conclude that warner was the initial author and owner of the masters,and the protection afforded by e is unavailable to clinton.
but clinton argues that the masters were not created as works for hire,and that clinton,not warner,was the original author of the masters.this argument fails because even if the masters were not originally works for hire,e protection does not apply where a copyright was previously transferred voluntarily by that individual author.there is no question that clinton transferred any interest that he had in the masters to warner,and,as part of a settlement arising from unrelated litigation,warner subsequently agreed to transfer ownership back to clinton.these
