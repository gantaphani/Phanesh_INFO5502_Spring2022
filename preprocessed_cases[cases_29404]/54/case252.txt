appellant sutter health sutter obtained a sizable judgment against respondent eden township healthcare district district.more than a year after the judgment was entered,the district filed a motion under government code section which permits a local public entity to pay a judgment in up to annual installments upon a showing that prompt payment would impose an unreasonable hardship.in addition,the district sought to change the rate of postjudgment interest established by the judgment to the interest rate specified by section,subdivision e,which applies to judgments paid by periodic payment.in support of its claim of hardship,the district motion demonstrated that it lacked sufficient funds to pay the judgment,was unable to borrow additional money against its already encumbered assets,and might be forced into bankruptcy if required to sell assets to raise the funds necessary for a lump sum payment.
the trial court granted the motion.in addition to permitting the district to pay the judgment in annual installments,the court order effectively amended the judgment nunc pro tunc to impose the postjudgment interest rate specified in section from the date the judgment was entered.
we affirm the trial court grant of installment payment relief under section,concluding that the district financial straits readily support a finding of unreasonable hardship.while we conclude that the postjudgment interest rate established by section is appropriate prospectively,we find no statutory basis for reducing the interest accrued prior to the trial court grant of relief under section.we therefore reverse the retroactive portion of the trial court order and remand for entry of an amended judgment consistent with our decision.
background 
the district is a public agency established pursuant to the local health care district law health saf.code,et to furnish hospital and other health care services.eden township healthcare dist.sutter health th,eden i.in this litigation,the merits of which are not pertinent to the issues on appeal,the district suffered a money judgment in favor of sutter of million,plus an additional million in prejudgment interest,attorney fees,and costs 
more than a year after entry of the nearly million judgment,the district moved for an order permitting the district to pay the judgment in annual installments under section and declaring that the postjudgment interest rate to be paid on the judgment will be the same as the interest rate on united states treasury bills in each year,subd.e.the motion was supported by a declaration from dev mahadevan,the chief executive officer of the district.mahadevan described various activities of the district,which include maintaining an endowment to assist local organizations in providing health care to the disadvantaged,subsidizing the expenses of hospitals with financial problems,and operating three community medical offices offices in san leandro,castro valley,and dublin.the offices,owned by the district,are valued at approximately million,encumbered by million in debt.rent and other income from the offices is the district primary source of revenue.of the three locations,by far the bulk of the district income,percent,is derived from the dublin office complex.the district is required by its loan agreements to maintain a balance of at least million in unencumbered liquid assets.at the time of the declaration,it possessed million in liquid assets above the required minimum.
to satisfy the judgment in one lump sum,mahadevan believed,the district would be required to sell property.as a practical matter,this would require sale of the dublin offices,since the castro valley and san leandro offices have little value in excess of their encumbrances.yet sale of the dublin offices would deprive the district of the majority of its revenue stream crucial to fulfilling its mission and would grossly undermine its ability to provide valuable healthcare services to the community.mahadevan stated he had explored options to satisfy the judgment,including borrowing against other assets,but he had concluded that the district simply does not have the equity to obtain the additional financing needed.if the district is unable to satisfy the judgment through a periodic payment plan,mahadevan threatened,it will likely commence the process to file a chapter bankruptcy petition.the district board of directors had adopted a resolution finding insufficient funds to satisfy the judgment and an unreasonable hardship if installment payments were denied.
mahadevan views were confirmed in a declaration submitted by an accountant who had performed an independent analysis of the district finances.the accountant stated that the district was required by a loan agreement to retain a minimum of million in liquid assets.in addition to that amount,the district possessed approximately million.he believed that an entity such as the district must retain liquid assets sufficient to cover its expenses for a reasonable period of time,from six months to a year,or a minimum for the district of approximately million.the district therefore lacked the funds to make a lump sum payment to satisfy the judgment.further,the district income consisted primarily of rental income from offices in the buildings it owned.without the revenue stream from the offices,there would be considerable doubt that the district could continue as a going concern.based on his analysis of the district projected income and expenses,the accountant concluded that it would require years to pay the judgment without significantly impacting the district ability to continue to service its residents.
sutter opposed the motion.in support of its opposition,sutter submitted the declaration of stephen goff,one of sutter attorneys in this litigation,who stated that,beginning in,he had periodically reviewed the district published financial information.goff characterized the offices operated by the district as investment properties.he explained that the dublin property consisted of three parcels,two of which held offices and the third as yet undeveloped.one of the lessees of the offices had been granted an option to purchase one parcel and a right of first refusal as to the entire property.goff reviewed the district grants to community medical service providers,finding that the grants had fallen considerably from between to million annually in the period,to less than annually in the years since.he noted that virtually all of the district income is now used to pay its own administrative expenses and the operating expenses of the offices.
in an order entered on june,the trial court summarily granted the district motion,authorizing it to pay the judgment in equal annual installments over years,beginning june,and setting the interest rate consistent with section,subd.e,beginning from the date of entry of the judgment.
discussion 
sutter appeals the trial court order,arguing the court erred in finding unreasonable hardship justifying installment payments under section and,alternatively,in permitting payment over years,rather than over a shorter period.in addition,sutter contends the trial court erred in imposing the rate of interest established by section,subdivision e,both retroactively,from the date of entry of judgment,and prospectively,from the date of entry of the order granting the district motion.
a local agency,such as the district,is required to pay a judgment entered against it in the fiscal year in which the judgment becomes final,if it has sufficient funds available.if not,the agency is required to raise the necessary funds and pay the judgment in the following fiscal year,subd.c joseph san francisco housing authority th.an exception created by section permits a court to authorize payment in as many as annual installments,if the agency governing body adopts an ordinance or resolution finding that immediate payment would cause an unreasonable hardship and the court makes a similar finding,subd.a.
the parties dispute the standard to be applied on appellate review of a hardship determination under section,with sutter arguing for de novo review and the district seeking substantial evidence review.we side with the district.this is a typical situation in which the trial court has,either by express statute or by rule of policy,a discretionary power to decide the issue.witkin,cal.procedure ed,williams city of los angeles cal d.we therefore review for abuse of abuse of discretion.james harris painting decorating,west bay builders,th.in so doing,we affirm the trial court decision unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence,it rests on improper criteria,or it rests on erroneous legal assumptions.ayala antelope valley newspapers,cal th.we will therefore affirm if the trial court finding of unreasonable hardship and its decision to permit repayment over the full years are supported by substantial evidence.
as support for de novo review,sutter cites community redevelopment agency force electronics th force electronics,in which the court was required to reconcile section with code of civil procedure section,which permits a successful plaintiff in an eminent domain action to seek reconveyance of its property if the condemnation judgment is not promptly paid.in approaching this issue,the court wrote the trial court order permitting the agency to pay the balance of the judgment over years is appealable as an order after judgment under section,subdivision a.review by this court is de novo.appellate courts may independently determine the proper interpretation of a statute they are not bound by evidence presented in the trial court or by the trial court interpretation.citation.likewise,application of the interpreted statute to undisputed facts is subject to independent appellate determination.force electronics,at.while we acknowledge that the court language can be read to require de novo review of a hardship determination,the context of the statement suggests otherwise.the only issue actually addressed in force electronics was the conflict between the two statutory provisions.it was this issue,reconciling the statutes,to which the court intended to apply the de novo standard of review,not to the trial court ruling on the issue of unreasonable hardship.in any event,because the court found section unavailable to the local agency,it never reached the validity of the trial court hardship determination.any pronouncement on the standard of review applicable to that determination would therefore have been dictum.
section does not define unreasonable hardship,and the meaning of the term has not been the subject of considered judicial interpretation because of the district particular circumstances,we find it unnecessary to go beyond its plain meaning.this is not a hard case.mahadevan declaration demonstrates that the district does not have the funds to pay the judgment in a lump sum,the district is unable to borrow the funds necessary to pay the judgment,and a sale of assets to finance payment of the judgment would deprive the district of the funds required for it to operate,threatening bankruptcy.the same conclusions were reached by an accountant after an independent analysis of the district finances and the district board of directors in a formal resolution.by anyone definition,an unreasonable hardship is imposed when the only means for payment of a judgment in a lump sum could result in the bankruptcy of a local public agency.
sutter argues that mahadevan declaration does not demonstrate that the district explored all available avenues of payment prior to filing its motion.section,however,contains no requirement that an agency provide affirmative evidence of such an exhaustive search.in any event,mahadevan states that the district explored options to satisfy the judgment,including borrowing against other assets,but was unable to come up with a solution.
sutter claims that the district can raise revenue by taxing or issuing bonds,but it makes no attempt to demonstrate that these represent a realistic means for the district to make a lump sum payment of the judgment.contrary to sutter claim,the district lacks the taxing power and must rely on the county board of supervisors to impose a levy.further,such taxation is limited in amount and purpose see health saf.code,and sutter makes no attempt to demonstrate that this power could be used to raise the necessary amount of cash required in time to pay the judgment in a lump sum,even assuming cooperation by the board.nor is it clear that a bond issue could be used to pay the judgment,even assuming it could be issued in time.a health care district bond issue is limited in amount to a maximum of percent of the average of the district gross revenues for the preceding three years and may be issued only to provide funds for the acquisition,construction,improvement,financing or refinancing of an enterprise,or the refunding of any bonds,notes,loans,or other indebtedness of the district.health saf.code.again,sutter makes no attempt to demonstrate that a bond issue is a realistic alternative for the district here.
in other words,the sole realistic avenue available to the district to make a lump sum payment of the judgment that is supported by the evidence,sale of the offices,carries a substantial risk of undermining the district operations,perhaps resulting in bankruptcy.sutter hardly argues differently.rather,it attempts to minimize the significance of a sale of the offices by characterizing them as passive investments.the characterization ignores the importance of the offices to the district operations.first,income from the properties helps to fund the district,making its operations possible.second,and more important,ownership of the properties is,in effect,the function of the district.the purpose of a local health care district is to fulfill the function of protecting the public health and welfare by furnishing hospital services in areas where hospital facilities are for some reason inadequate.talley northern san diego hosp.dist.cal d,overruled on other grounds,muskopf corning hospital dist.cal d.selling the offices would put the district out of business.
sutter does not shy from this conclusion.its argument is that we would all be better off if the district were put out of business,arguing,the only true function the district accomplishes is to fund and perpetuate its own bureaucracy.according to sutter,the district is a shell operation that owns passive investment properties outside the district boundaries the district does not own,govern,or operate a hospital,or participate in the ownership,governance,or operation of a hospital,and it does not perform any health service or function.selling the offices,it is claimed,would permit the district to pay the judgment and leave it with approximately million in cash to use to support its statutory mission for its constituency.this sum would allow the district to do far more for its constituents than it has done for many years,or will do until after the year.even assuming public policy would be better served if the district sold the offices to a private owner,that is a decision for the county officials and residents to make the purpose of section is precisely to prevent a large judgment from bringing an involuntary end to the operations of a local public entity.
sutter also contends the district should be required to pay the judgment because the installment payment mechanism makes it an unwilling creditor.assuming this is true of sutter,it is also true of every judgment creditor when a motion is granted under section.in enacting the statute,the legislature expressed a willingness to create such creditors when to do otherwise would impose an unreasonable hardship on a local public entity.the decision relied on by sutter in contending it can not be made an unwilling creditor,force electronics,was decided under the eminent domain statute.as discussed above,that statute permits a judgment creditor to repossess its property if prompt payment is not made,demonstrating the legislature intent not to require persons whose property is subject to eminent domain to wait for payment.there is no similar statutory remedy available here.
sutter also argues the district did not demonstrate that it would need the full years to pay the judgment.on the contrary,the district submitted the tes
