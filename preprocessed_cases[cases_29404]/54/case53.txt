appellant goldberg connolly g c appeals from an order for distribution of interpleader funds order entered on august,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york wexler.the order distributed funds,inter alia,to appellee new york community bancorp,roslyn savings bank roslyn in payment of its claimed perfected security interest in an interpleader fund fund set up by the united states postal service usps.the fund was created to satisfy a judgment the usps owed usps judgment to abcon associates,abcon,a contractor the usps had previously retained and later learned had a number of existing claims against it,necessitating the establishment of the fund.as a result of roslyn prioritized interest,the remaining claimants to the fund,including g c,were left with no recovery.
prior to the order,on december,g c made a motion for summary judgment seeking a determination that roslyn did not possess a perfected security interest in the fund.the district court rejected this argument and concluded that roslyn claim to the fund was senior to g c competing claim.see united states abcon,no.cv,wl.
in this appeal,we review the district court analysis of roslyn interest in the fund and consider whether the general loan and security agreement that created roslyn interest constituted an assignment of judgment for purposes of oblig.law,or a security interest in money under law.we conclude that the general loan and security agreement assignment of all sums recovered from the usps judgment constituted an assignment of money or proceeds received from the usps judgment and not an assignment of the usps judgment itself.as a result,pursuant to law b,roslyn could perfect its interest only by taking possession of the proceeds of the fund.having failed to do so,roslyn interest in the fund is unperfected and therefore junior to g c interest.we thus vacate the order and remand to the district court for further proceedings.

in its motion for summary judgment,g c,relying on the new york uniform commercial code,characterized roslyn security interest in the usps judgment as an interest in money or proceeds from the usps not in the judgment itself and the rights thereto.thus,according to g c,roslyn did not possess a perfected security interest in the money that now constitutes the interpleader fund because a security interest in money is perfected only when the holder of the interest is in actual possession of the money.id.at.g c argued that if roslyn did not hold a perfected interest,then the judgment lien of g c,the judgment liens of the other claimants,and the liens and secured interests of the other claimants to the interpleader fund would,as a matter of law,have priority over the claim of roslyn id.
