factual procedural background 
appellants,who are married,own a home in malibu over the pacific coast highway.they filed a nuisance action in superior court against neighboring homeowners and respondents marvin goodfriend and tina fasbender goodfriend collectively respondents,individually referred to as goodfriend and fasbender.respondents performed an illegal unpermitted remodel,after which they buried construction trash and debris on the hillside of their and appellants properties,in a landslide sensitive area.in may,roit,on behalf of herself and rickley,filed a case against respondents and shahriar yazdani to abate the nuisance and for violation of cc rs case no.judgment was entered on february by judge cesar sarmiento to abate the nuisance the first judgment.
appellants,again represented by roit,filed another action against respondents for nuisance and violation of cc rs based upon the encroachment of fences and foliage on appellants property case no.judgment was entered in that case in april by judge norman tarle the second judgment.
respondents failed to comply with the terms of the second judgment,and appellants filed charging affidavits of contempt in august.roit enlisted the aid of another attorney,christopher campbell.respondents did not take any responsive action or respond to appellants request for informal resolution or comply with the court order.the court issued a order as to the second judgment,directing respondents to make changes in the property and to file weekly progress reports.respondents did not comply with that order and rejected all informal requests for compliance.
after a contempt trial which lasted over several days,the court issued its judgment and order of contempt on february.it found respondents guilty on three counts,fined them each,and sentenced goodfriend to three days in jail.
on march,appellants filed a motion for attorneys fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section they requested fees for roit and for campbell.campbell charged per hour for hours for a total of,and roit charged for hours,for a total of.
in their opposition,respondents did not challenge the necessity or reasonableness of the hours or the hourly rates.respondents questioned the apportionment of the fees requested because findings of guilt were made on only three of nine charges and because portions of the trial were allegedly not related to contempt matters.
on may,the court issued its ruling,which included the following findings 
the object of this rule is to encourage parties to prosecute contempt proceedings and indirectly encourage all parties to abide by the terms of court orders generally.

however,the fees provision of section exists specifically to reallocate costs required to prosecute a contemnor for contempt to the party at fault indeed,based on the tenor of the proceedings in this action,the court finds it difficult to believe that plaintiffs would not have filed contempt proceedings under the circumstances presented,no matter the cost.

under the circumstances,a fees award is appropriately imposed against the goodfriends.
the court finds the hours and rate reasonable considering the circumstances,and roit experience.

supreme court cases 
as noted by the trial court,there is no binding california case authority on this specific issue.our supreme court,however,has addressed the issue of awarding attorney fees to attorneys who act as pro se litigants in a variety of contexts.
in trope katz cal th,the supreme court held that an attorney who chooses to litigate in propria persona and therefore does not pay or become liable to pay consideration in exchange for legal representation can not recover reasonable attorney fees under civil code section as compensation for the time and effort he expends on his own behalf or for the professional business opportunities he forgoes as a result of his decision.id.at.the court reasoning was partially based on language in section which makes it applicable to attorney fees which are incurred to enforce a contract.id.at.relying on the dictionary definition of incur as to become liable for,the court concluded that the language of section requires that a party must have actually paid attorneys fees or has become liable to pay consideration in exchange for legal representation.id.at.trope holding,however,was specifically limited to section.id.at.
several years after trope,the supreme court again had occasion to consider the issue of an attorney fee award in lolley campbell cal th.lolley did not interpret the term incur in the same way as trope.
in lolley,an employee unsuccessfully sought to recover unpaid overtime wages from his employer.he then filed an administrative claim before the state labor commission.he received an award,and the employer appealed.the labor commissioner determined that the employee could not afford counsel and agreed to represent him in an appeal to the superior court.the employee prevailed again in superior court and was awarded back wages plus costs.the superior court denied his request for attorney fees as part of the cost award.the court of appeal affirmed,on the basis that labor code section only requires an unsuccessful party in a superior court appeal to pay attorney fees incurred by the other parties and the employee was not obligated to pay fees to the labor commissioner.the supreme court determined that the term incurred was not synonymous with a personal obligation to pay the fees.it found that california courts have routinely awarded fees to compensate for legal work performed on behalf of a party pursuant to an relationship,although the party did not have a personal obligation to pay for such services out of his or her own assets.fn.omitted.lolley campbell,supra,cal th at.it relied upon plcm group drexler cal th,which rejected the contention that one incurs attorneys fees only when one has paid,or becomes liable to pay,fees from one own assets.lolley campbell,supra,cal th at,citing plcm,supra,cal th at.plcm focused on the fact that the fees were provided pursuant to an relationship.lolley campbell,supra,cal th at.the lolley court distinguished trope because its holding was
