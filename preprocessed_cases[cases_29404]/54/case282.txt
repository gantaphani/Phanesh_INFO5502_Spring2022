in this case,a bondholder sought and obtained a judgment ordering the foreclosure and sale of property subject to a water district bond issued under the provisions of the improvement act of the act sts,et and the municipal improvement act of the act sts,et.undesignated statutory references are to the streets and highways code.the property owner appeals from that part of the judgment ordering a personal deficiency judgment against it and the award of in attorney fees to the bondholder for prosecuting the action.the property owner also appeals from a postjudgment order setting the appellate bond amount,arguing that amount was excessive because the court improperly entered a deficiency judgment.in a,the bondholder challenges the attorney fee and cost award on the ground that the trial court erred by deciding the matter without a noticed motion or consideration of all the evidence.
we reject the property owner contention that failure to index the notice of assessment under the name of the property owner in the county recorder office rendered the lien invalid,and that the property owner was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the assessment.we conclude,however,that the court improperly entered a deficiency judgment against the property owner,and reverse that portion of the judgment.this conclusion renders moot the arguments regarding the propriety of the appellate bond,and we order the trial court to exonerate the bond.
we also conclude the trial court abused its discretion in deciding attorney fees and costs without consideration of all the evidence.accordingly,the matter is remanded for further proceedings to determine attorney fees and costs.

the trial court relied on the talbot case to conclude that laconic had notice of the bond and assessment lien.talbot,supra,d.laconic asserts that,unlike the defendant in talbot,it had no notice that the lien existed.we disagree.
in talbot,the court interpreted the notice sections of the act.first,it concluded that depositing and maintaining the warrant,diagram and assessment in the office of the superintendent of streets or the office of the county surveyor complied with section and provided constructive notice of the contents of these documents.talbot,supra,d at.in so holding,the talbot court rejected the defendant argument that recording meant entering the information so that a person contemplating the purchase of a particular parcel could review the public record with an owner name or parcel number in mind and thereby discover any outstanding bonds representing potential liens.id.at.
