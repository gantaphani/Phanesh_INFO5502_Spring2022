discussion 
a lis pendens is a recorded document giving constructive notice that an action has been filed affecting title to or right to possession of the real property described in the notice.urez superior court d.a lis pendens may be filed by any party in an action who asserts a real property claim.code civ.section defines a real property claim as the cause or causes of action in a pleading which would,if meritorious,affect a title to,or the right to possession of,specific real property if the pleading filed by the claimant does not properly plead a real property claim,the lis pendens must be expunged upon motion under ccp.code,west civ.proc.foll.
section allows the property owner to remove an improperly recorded lis pendens by bringing a motion to expunge.there are several statutory bases for expungement of a lis pendens,including the claim at issue here claimant pleadings,on which the lis pendens is based,do not contain a real property claim.see.unlike most other motions,when a motion to expunge is brought,the burden is on the party opposing the motion to show the existence of a real property claim.see.
the fascenellis moved to expunge pursuant to section of a real property claim section provides in proceedings under this chapter,the court shall order the notice expunged if the court finds that the pleading on which the notice is based does not contain a real property claim.in making this determination,the court must engage in a analysis.rather than analyzing whether the pleading states any claim at all,as on a general demurrer,the court must undertake the more limited analysis of whether the pleading states a real property claim.code,west civ,supra,foll,at.review involves only a review of the adequacy of the pleading and normally should not involve evidence from either side,other than possibly that which may be judicially noticed as on a demurrer.code,west civ,supra,foll,at.therefore,review of an expungement order under section is limited to whether a real property claim has been properly pled by the claimant.code,west civ,supra,foll,at.
because only kirkeby fraudulent conveyance claim relates to real property,we must now determine whether that claim,as pled,affects title to,or the right to possession of,specific real property.we conclude it does.
