under code of civil procedure section a judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing the judgment,including statutory attorney fees otherwise provided by law.a motion to claim enforcement costs must,however,be made before the judgment is satisfied in full,subd.a.
in the present case,plaintiff fessha taye,conservator of the estate of ida mcqueen,prevailed at trial in an action for financial abuse of an elder or dependent adult,for which welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a provides an award of attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff.defendant carol veres reed appealed,but the judgment was affirmed.the parties settled a separate action plaintiff brought after judgment seeking to prevent or reverse defendant transfer of real property to third persons.the question presented is whether plaintiff motion to recover attorney fees incurred both on appeal from the elder abuse judgment and in the separate action over real property assets was subject to the time limitation of section,namely that it be made before the judgment was fully satisfied.
we conclude that as to attorney fees on appeal from the elder abuse judgment,the motion was not subject to section,because plaintiff efforts in opposing defendant appeal of the judgment were not undertaken to enforce the judgment but to defend it against reversal or modification.where a statute provides for attorney fees,they are generally available both at trial and on appeal morcos board of retirement cal d,and the procedure for their recovery is set out by court rule rather than by section.see cal.rules of court,rules c,c.plaintiff separate action to prevent transfer of assets was,however,brought in aid of the judgment enforcement,and fees incurred in that action could only be recovered under section,making them subject to the time limits of section,subdivision a.we will therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the court of appeal,which held both sets of fees subject to section,subdivision a.
factual and procedural background 
ida mcqueen,the conservatee on whose behalf plaintiff is acting,is a physically and mentally disabled woman born in.she uses a wheelchair and is unable to read or write.mcqueen late father established a testamentary trust for mcqueen,giving her the right to live in the family oakland residence held in the trust and to receive the trust net income during her lifetime.defendant reed,an attorney whose father had drafted the will,prepared the order creating the trust.
in,mcqueen left the home for a skilled nursing facility and,eventually,for a community care facility.while she was in the skilled nursing facility,defendant reed obtained mcqueen mark on a power of attorney in favor of mcqueen sister.in,mcqueen uncle,acting in his capacity as trustee of the testamentary trust,sold the oakland home for,without mcqueen consent or authorization from the probate court.reed,the attorney for the trust,distributed the proceeds to various members of mcqueen family,but mcqueen herself received nothing.
plaintiff was appointed limited conservator of mcqueen estate in and brought this action against reed,her brother richard veres who helped reed obtain the power of attorney,and several members of mcqueen family the jury found reed liable for financial elder abuse,breach of fiduciary duty and conversion.based on her liability under the financial elder abuse statute,which contains a costs and fees provision welf,subd.a,the trial court ordered reed to pay plaintiff prejudgment attorney fees and costs totaling more than.the court of appeal affirmed the judgment.this court denied review,and the remittitur issued on june.
while the first appeal in this case was pending,plaintiff brought a separate action against reed,her husband james reed,and their two children,alleging that after the jury verdict against reed,reed and her husband began transferring a number of parcels of real property out of her name and to other family members in order to avoid payment of the judgment in may of,plaintiff voluntarily dismissed that action hereafter the fraudulent transfer action in exchange for the defendants agreement,inter alia,to transfer one of the properties back to reed.
by a series of payments in june and july of,defendant paid plaintiff an amount the parties agreed was equal to the trial court judgment plus accrued interest.defendant check for the final amount was honored on july.
on july,plaintiff filed the motion for costs and attorney fees that is the subject of this appeal.the motion sought in fees and costs incurred in briefing and arguing the appeal and in prosecuting the fraudulent transfer action.the trial court,rejecting defendant argument that her satisfaction of the underlying judgment had cut off plaintiff right to seek fees on appeal,granted plaintiff motion for fees and costs incurred on appeal and in the fraudulent transfer action.
the court of appeal reversed,holding the fee and cost motion was untimely under section,subdivision a.we granted plaintiff petition for review.
discussion 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,provides that when a case of financial elder abuse welf,has been proven,in addition to compensatory damages and all other remedies otherwise provided by law,the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and costs.
title of part of the code of civil procedure is known as the enforcement of judgments law.section provides the judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law.attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph a of paragraph of subdivision a of section.section,subdivision a provides in part the judgment creditor may claim costs authorized by section by noticed motion.the motion shall be made before the judgment is satisfied in full,but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred.
recovery of costs incurred on appeal is statutorily authorized by section,subdivision b the judicial council shall establish by rule allowable costs on appeal and the procedure for claiming those costs.the california rules of address the procedure for recovery of attorney fees on appeal in rule c,which provides a notice of motion to claim attorney fees on appeal under a statute or contract requiring the court to determine entitlement to the fees,the amount of the fees,or both,must be served and filed within the time for serving and filing the memorandum of costs under rule c in an unlimited civil case or under rule c in a limited civil case.rule c,in turn,specifies that a memorandum of costs on appeal is to be filed in the superior court w ithin days after the clerk sends notice of issuance of the remittitur.
plaintiff contends the fees he sought for responding to defendant appeal and prosecuting the fraudulent transfer action were authorized by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,independently of the enforcement of judgments law.as to the appellate fees,specifically,he argues his motion was timely under rules c and c,and in that respect he enjoys the support of two amici curiae,who urge us to hold appellate fees are not governed by the enforcement of judgments law.defendant,on the other hand,maintains that all the fees awarded on plaintiff motion were sought and obtained under section,making the motion untimely under section.
because our analysis of the two sets of attorney fees sought here those incurred on appeal and those incurred in prosecuting the fraudulent transfer action differs,we address them separately.
attorney fees incurred responding to the appeal 
we agree with plaintiff and the amici curiae that where attorney fees are authorized by statute as they were here by welf,subd.a,fees awarded for expenses incurred on appeal from the trial court judgment are not governed by the procedures of the enforcement of judgments law.rather,they are recovered under the procedures set forth in court rules promulgated pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.
nothing in our statutes or court rules suggests appellate fees come within the enforcement of judgments law.the statutes and rules distinctly address three different types of costs and fees prejudgment costs,including attorney fees where authorized by contract,statute or law,subd.a,are recovered through procedures established under section,subdivision a and rules and b appellate costs and fees are recovered under section,subdivision b and rules c and and postjudgment enforcement costs and fees are recovered under the enforcement of judgments law,specifically sections to.
speaking more broadly,our procedural statutes and rules do not treat civil appeals as a part of the enforcement of judgment process.as stated above,the enforcement of judgments law constitutes title of part of the code of civil procedure,while civil appeals are governed by title of that part and by court rules prescribed pursuant to section.under section,subdivision a,the perfecting of an appeal generally stays,inter alia,enforcement of the judgment or order appealed from.similarly,section,subdivision b,part of the enforcement of judgments law,provides for a stay of certain discovery procedures in aid of enforcement i f enforcement of the judgment is stayed on appeal by the giving of a sufficient undertaking.see also,subd.a effect on liens when enforcement of the judgment is stayed on appeal.in all these statutes,enforcement clearly refers to proceedings other than the appeal.
while the enforcement of judgments law does not define enforcement,it nowhere suggests the term encompasses appeals.the law addresses in detail several means of enforcing a judgment,including liens on real and personal property,writs of execution,garnishment of wages and writs of possession or sale.it also addresses in detail the effect and adjudication of third party claims and the procedures governing satisfaction of the judgment.it does not,however,address procedures for appeal from the judgment as already noted,those procedures are set out elsewhere in the code of civil procedure and in the california rules of court.
regarding costs and fees,section,which generally authorizes a judgment creditor recovery of enforcement costs,makes no reference or allusion to the creditor defense of a judgment debtor appeal.section,subdivision a specifies the costs of enforcing a judgment that may be claimed through a memorandum of costs the subdivision lists statutory fees relating to the abstract of judgment,a notice of judgment lien or a writ of enforcement,statutory costs and fees of a levying officer,and costs in connection with discovery of assets,but it makes no reference or allusion to costs incurred defending an appeal.
legislative history connected to a amendment to section stats,ch,confirms that,with regard to attorney fees specifically,the legislature understood fees incurred on appeal to be distinct from fees incurred in enforcing a judgment.the amendment,which added section last sentence was designed to abrogate chelios kaye d,holding the statute did not authorize awarding a judgment creditor attorney fees for enforcement despite an underlying judgment allowing such fees pursuant to a contract provision.see id.at.a committee report noted the contrast between the chelios result contractually authorized fees could not be recovered for enforcement of the judgment and the settled rule that such fees could be recovered if incurred in an appeal the proposed amendment would assure that contract provisions which provide for attorneys fee sic are enforceable regardless of whether they are incurred in enforcing the judgment or in an appeal of the judgment.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added.though the substance of the amendment is not directly relevant to the present case,the italicized language indicates the legislature,in amending section,acted with the understanding that the fees for enforcement of a judgment governed by that law were distinct from fees incurred on appeal from the judgment.
not surprisingly,given the distinct statutory treatment of enforcement and appeal,treatises also address the two topics separately.a practitioner guide to enforcement of judgments ahart,cal.practice guide enforcing judgments and debts the rutter group contains no chapter on appeal from the judgment,and its thorough discussion of enforcement fees and costs,mentions fees and costs on appeal only once,as part of its discussion of when interest on each type of fees and costs prejudgment,enforcement and appellate begins accruing.witkin treatise on civil procedure,similarly,discusses appeals and the enforcement of judgments in completely separate chapters,and discusses recovery of costs and fees incurred in those procedural contexts separately as well.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.enforcement of judgment,witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal.
nor have california decisions regarded appellate attorney fees authorized by statute as substantively dependent on the enforcement of judgments law rather,the substantive statutes themselves have generally been construed as authorizing an award of appellate fees.in serrano unruh cal d,holding section fees in private attorney general action authorizes an award for fees incurred defending an earlier fee award on appeal,we explained it is defendants position that no fees are recoverable for defending the fee award on appeal because the appeal did not independently meet the requirements of section.yet it is established that fees,if recoverable at all pursuant either to statute or parties agreement are available for services at trial and on appeal.in morcos board of retirement,supra,cal d at page morcos,holding government code section fees for successful action to reverse administrative denial of retirement benefits authorizes attorney fees for defending the superior court judgment on appeal,we relied on settled case law which has established the general principle that statutes authorizing attorney fee awards in lower tribunals include attorney fees incurred on appeals of decisions from those lower tribunals.neither decision relies on the enforcement of judgments law or any predecessor statute.
defendant points out that morcos involved a public entity defendant as did serrano unruh,supra,cal d,a class as to which the enforcement of judgments law has only limited application.see.the principle enunciated in morcos,however,has been applied many times in suits between private parties approving appellate fee awards,without any reference to the enforcement of judgments law.see,jankey lee cal th,carpenter jack in the box th,kirby sega of america,th,wilkerson sullivan th,grade way construction golden eagle ins.th.appellate attorney fees authorized by statute do not depend substantively on the enforcement of judgments law.procedurally,as we have seen,they are governed by the rules of court rather than the enforcement of judgments law.
the court of appeal,in holding that all the fees plaintiff sought were subject to the time limits of the enforcement of judgments law,pursued its analysis largely without distinguishing between fees incurred defending the appeal and those incurred prosecuting the fraudulent transfer action.the main decisions upon which the lower court relied ketchum moses cal th globalist internet technologies,reda th jaffe pacelli th carnes zamani cir support its holding,if at all,only as to fees incurred in the fraudulent transfer action none holds or states that appellate fees are recovered pursuant to the enforcement of judgments law 
nor does the first sentence of rule a,upon which the court of appeal also relied,support the conclusion the enforcement of judgments law,rather than the rules of court,sets the procedure for recovery of appellate fees.that sentence states except as otherwise provided by statute,this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney fees and claims for attorney fees provided for in a contract.rule a,italics added.the court of appeal reasoned that the italicized clau
