this case presents the question of whether a judgment entered in one federal court and then registered in a second federal court pursuant to,may be and enforced in a third federal court,a process termed successive registration.under,a judgment from one federal court that is registered in another federal court shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.this statutory language,together with the authorities cited below,persuade us that registered judgments are to be given the same effect as rendered judgments so that permits registration and enforcement of registered judgments in the third district court.we therefore reverse the district court and remand the case.
this case arises out of the class action brought against ferdinand marcos,the former president of the philippines.after president marcos arrived in the united states in,he was served with numerous complaints claiming damages for human rights violations.these cases were consolidated into the federal district court in hawaii.in,the hawaiian federal district court certified the case as a class action.between and,three separate jury trials were held concerning the issues of liability and damages.ultimately,president marcos was cast in judgment for nearly in damages to the class.final judgment on the class action was entered in the hawaiian federal district court on february,hereinafter the hawaiian judgment,and was thereafter affirmed by the ninth circuit.see hilao estate of marcos,cir hilao i.in,the ninth circuit issued its mandate for the hawaiian judgment.
in,the plaintiff registered the hawaiian judgment in the northern district of illinois pursuant to hereinafter the illinois registered judgment,as well as in other jurisdictions located outside of the united states.
on april,the plaintiff registered the hawaiian judgment in the northern district of texas pursuant to.the plaintiff also filed a complaint against the alleging they held legal title to texas property for which the marcos estate held equitable title.the plaintiff sought to enforce the registered hawaiian judgment in texas by foreclosing on that property.
in,the defendants notified the plaintiff that the hawaiian judgment expired pursuant to hawaiian revised statute before the plaintiff had registered the hawaiian judgment in the northern district of texas.recognizing this flaw in the registration,on june,the plaintiff filed a motion in the hawaiian federal district court for an extension of the hawaiian judgment.on june,the hawaiian district court entered an order extending the hawaiian judgment.the hawaiian district court reasoned that the hawaiian judgment was not final until the issuance of the mandate by the ninth circuit in.based on that reasoning,the district court found that the motion for extension was timely filed in the hawaiian federal district court.
in,the ninth circuit reversed and vacated the extension granted by the hawaiian district court.see hilao estate of marcos,cir hilao ii.the ninth circuit held that the date of final judgment was february,the date that the judgment was entered by the hawaiian district court,not the date of the issuance of the mandate by the ninth circuit in.because hrs states that n o extension of a judgment or decree shall be granted unless the extension is sought within ten years of the date the original judgment or decree was rendered,the ninth circuit found that relief on the plaintiff june,motion to extend the judgment was.
on september,the plaintiff timely revived the illinois registered judgment in the northern district of illinois on october,the plaintiff registered the revived illinois registered judgment in the northern district of texas pursuant to.on october,the plaintiff filed a motion to amend the original complaint filed on april,to reflect its intent to enforce the revived illinois registered judgment.arguing that the court should not recognize the illinois registered judgment,the defendants filed a b motion to dismiss.
the texas federal district court denied the plaintiff motion to amend the complaint and granted the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiff suit.the plaintiff timely filed this appeal.
ii.standard of review 
under federal rule of civil procedure a,a court should freely give leave to file amended pleadings when justice so requires.we review the district court denial of the plaintiff motion to amend for an abuse of discretion.foman davis,d.we review de novo an order granting a b motion to dismiss.in re katrina canal breaches litigation,cir.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiff argues that two judgments were properly registered and may be enforced in the northern district of texas the hawaiian judgment,as registered in texas on april,and the illinois registered judgment,as successively registered in texas on october.the enforceability of these judgments is discussed separately.
hawaiian judgment 
the plaintiff argues that the hawaiian judgment did not become final until december,because on that date the hawaiian federal district court entered a final judgment as to all of the consolidated actions in this matter.therefore,the plaintiff asserts that the hawaiian judgment was properly registered in texas federal district court within ten years of its entry and may be enforced in texas.
the defendants counter that res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude the plaintiff from the date on which the hawaiian judgment became final for the purposes of triggering the ten year statute of limitations.according to the defendants,the ninth circuit in hilao ii necessarily decided that the final judgment was rendered by the hawaiian federal district court for this purpose on february.because the plaintiff has already litigated the issue of when the final judgment was entered and the ninth circuit has already reached a conclusion on that issue,the defendants assert that the plaintiff is barred from the issue.
we agree with the defendants that the ninth circuit actually decided the effective date of the hawaiian judgment and that the plaintiffs are precluded from this issue.see united states davenport,cir,cert.denied,d citations omitted discussing res judicata pace bogalusa city sch,cir citations omitted discussing collateral estoppel.moreover,the plaintiff waived its argument on this issue by failing to raise it to the district court until the reply brief to a motion for reconsideration.see browning navarro,cir citations omitted generally speaking a party may not raise an argument for the first time in a petition for rehearing.
because more than ten years passed between the entry of the hawaiian judgment and its registration in texas,the hawaiian judgment expired before it was registered in texas.a judgment may only be registered and enforced at a time when the judgment is still enforceable in the state from which it is being registered.see home port rentals,int l yachting group,cir.as such,the hawaiian judgment may not be registered and enforced by the texas federal district court.
illinois registered judgment 
the plaintiff argues next that permits the illinois registered judgment,which is valid and enforceable in the northern district of illinois to be successively registered and enforced in the northern district of texas.states in pertinent part 
a judgment in an action for the recovery of money entered in any district court may be registered by filing a certified copy of the judgment in any other district when the judgment has become final by appeal or expiration of the time for appeal or when ordered by the court that entered the judgment for good cause shown a judgment so registered shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.
the defendants counter that successive registration is not allowed under because a registered judgment is only derivative of the judgment of the court where it was originally rendered and not an independent judgment of the registering court therefore,a registered judgment can not be.in other words,the defendants argue that the illinois registered judgment is not an independent judgment and,because the hawaiian judgment expired,the illinois registered judgment can not be successively registered.
to support this argument,the defendants assert that the illinois judgment does not qualify as an independent judgment because it was not entered in a federal district court pursuant to.instead,the defendants assert that a registered judgment is merely included in the court docket as an attachment to a certification from the rendering court.
despite the defendants argument,the record clearly indicates that on september,the revived illinois registered judgment was entered by the clerk of court in the northern district of illinois as a separate document entitled judgment in a civil case.there is no merit to the defendants argument that the illinois judgment was not an entered judgment 
the final sentence of clearly states that a registered judgment has the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.in this case,we read that to mean that once the hawaiian judgment was registered in illinois in,the illinois registered judgment had the same effect as any judgment rendered in the northern district of illinois and could be enforced as a judgment rendered in the northern district of illinois 
our cases concerning registered judgments also support the principal that a registered judgment has the same effect as a rendered judgment.for example,in cadle neubauer,cir,we found that under the plain language of,the plaintiff registration of the final judgment in the northern district of texas is treated as a final judgment of the northern district of texas.we reached the same conclusion in home port rentals when we found that a judgment registered in a louisiana federal district court had the same effect as if it had been rendered by a louisiana federal district court.at we simply can not read the plain language of the final sentence of any way other than as equating registration with a new,at least for purposes of enforcement within the district of registration.
other circuits have also taken the position that a registered judgment is equivalent to a new federal judgment.febre,wl,marx,at stanford,at.then judge blackmun agreed with this principle when he wrote for the eighth circuit that 
the language of is clear,unambiguous and seemingly purposeful.if registration is to have the same effect as a judgment,it must,for our present enforcement purposes,mean just that and not something else.to restrict registration to a procedural and collection device for the foreign judgment itself,and to have it expire with a foreign judgment,would give the words of the statute a lesser status than their plain meaning and to make registration something far inferior to a judgment on a judgment.
id.at.in hilao ii,the ninth circuit echoed judge blackman opinion by stating that registering a judgment under is the functional equivalent of obtaining a new judgment of the registration court.at.
the authorities completely satisfy us that the illinois registered judgment was fully enforceable in illinois and had all of the attributes of a judgment rendered by the northern district of illinois.it follows,then,that the illinois judgment may be in the northern district of texas and enforced in texas.as the seventh circuit stated 
upon receiving a certified copy of the judgment,the clerk of the court in which the judgment is being registered merely enters the sister court judgment on the docket.once a certified copy of the final judgment has been so registered,the judgment is treated as it if sic were an original judgment of the registering court.a registered judgment is equivalent to a new federal judgment obtained by filing an independent action on the original judgment it has the same status as a judgment on a judgment.
there is no doubt that if the northern district of illinois rendered a money judgment,that money judgment could be registered in the northern district of texas and enforced in texas pursuant to.if a registered judgment is to be given the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered,we see no reason why the illinois registered judgment should not also be capable of being registered in another federal court and enforced in that court.
examining parallel situations in our judicial system reinforces our conclusion that the illinois registered judgment should be given the same dignity by the northern district of texas as a judgment originally rendered by a illinois federal district court.the supreme court has long held that the full faith and credit clause of the constitution requires a state to give a judgment on a judgment rendered by a different state court equal dignity to a judgment rendered by its own state court.in roche mcdonald,the court held that this principle was not limited to a process in which only two states were involved.in roche,a judgment was entered against the defendant in washington state court.the defendant then moved to oregon,so suit was brought against the defendant upon the washington state court judgment in oregon state court and judgment was again rendered against the defendant.thereafter,the defendant moved back to washington.by then,the original washington judgment had expired,so the plaintiff filed suit against the defendant in washington based on the valid oregon state court judgment.the washington supreme court entered judgment in favor of the defendant holding that because the statute of limitations had run on the washington judgment,the oregon judgment was also not enforceable.
the supreme court reversed the washington supreme court judgment,stating 
the full faith and credit clause of the constitution requires that the judgment of a state court which had jurisdiction of the parties and the in suit,shall be given in the courts of every other state the same credit,validity and effect which it has in the state where it was rendered,and be equally conclusive upon the merits and that only such defenses as would be good to a suit thereon in that state can be relied on in the courts of any other state.
based on roche,it is clear that the full faith and credit clause allows for a state court judgment to be rendered in one state court,sued on in a second state court,and then the judgment on a judgment of the second state court successively sued on in a third state court and that judgment on a judgment enforced by the latter state court.the same result occurs when a plaintiff moves its judgment between federal and state courts.the full faith and credit act,implements the full faith and credit clause of the constitution by stating 
such acts,records and judicial proceedings of any state,territory or possession or copies thereof,so authenticated,shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states and its territories and possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state,territory or possession from which they are taken.
the full faith and credit act has been interpreted to require state courts to give full effect to federal court judgments,see stoll gottlieb,and federal courts to give full effect to state court judgments,see southern jam,robinson,cir.this means that under,a state court judgment may be rendered in one state court,sued on as a judgment on a judgment in a second state court,and then the judgment of the second state court may be successively sued on and enforced by a federal district court.likewise,a judgment rendered in a federal district court may be sued on in a state court,and that state court judgment could be sued on and enforced by a second state court.
at oral argument,the defendants acknowledged that if the plaintiff had moved its judgment through the state court system or between federal and state courts,the plaintiff would be allowed to enforce its judgment as described above.the defendants argued that the illinois registered judgment should be treated differently than the judgment on a judgment in roche because a defendant to a registered judgment does not have the same procedural protections as he would for a judgment on a judgme
