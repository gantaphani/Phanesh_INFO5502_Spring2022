damon chargois and cletus ernster appeal the district court judgment holding them personally liable to dillard department stores,for a judgment originally entered against their law firm partnership.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and proceedings 
damon chargois and cletus ernster formed a law partnership in.they registered it as a limited liability partnership,known as chargois ernster,cellp,with the state of texas in.cellp prosecuted lawsuits against dillard department stores,dillard,alleging that dillard racially discriminated against its customers.in an attempt to solicit business,cellp developed a website in june which included a link using the dillard name and logo.clicking this link took visitors to,a separate website documenting acts of alleged racial profiling by the department stores.
on july,dillard sued cellp in texas state court for trademark infringement and various business torts.it sought damages and an injunction against cellp use of its trademark.on october,cellp professional liability insurer,evanston insurance,filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court,seeking a declaration that its policy did not insure cellp against dillard claims.on november,after voluntarily dismissing the state court lawsuit,dillard filed a in the evanston case against cellp reasserting its allegations and adding federal cyberpiracy and trademark claims.on january,pursuant to the parties agreement,the court dismissed evanston claims for declaratory relief.dillard claims against cellp were all that remained.
on february,while the litigation continued,chargois and ernster executed a separation agreement that provided for dissolution of the partnership on february.cellp registration as an llp was not renewed and,on july,the registration expired under texas law.notwithstanding these facts,the defunct llp remained a party to the dillard litigation,and no party was substituted on its behalf.on november,the court entered a final judgment ordering chargois ernster,to pay dillard.
dillard attempt to collect on the judgment did not succeed on january,in the docket of the evanston case,dillard filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against chargois and ernster in their individual capacities.dillard sought a declaration that the two were personally liable,jointly and severally,for the final judgment entered against cellp.both chargois and ernster were personally served with the complaint,and each moved to dismiss.dillard then restyled its complaint as a first amended complaint,which reasserted the allegations of personal liability against chargois and ernster hereinafter,the action.dillard filed a motion for summary judgment,to which both defendants responded with lengthy opposition briefs.the court granted judgment for dillard in the amount of against chargois and ernster,jointly and severally,and each appealed.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.goodman harris county,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the,but he must point to evidence showing that there is a genuine fact issue for trial to survive summary judgment.id.quotation omitted.
discussion 
chargois and ernster press four main arguments,two of which present issues of federal law and two of which present issues of texas law.we consider the contentions under federal law before turning to the state law issues.
federal law 
subject matter jurisdiction 
appellants first contend that summary judgment in the action was improper because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.they argue that the court exceeded the bounds of its ancillary,or supplemental,jurisdiction.see generally peacock thomas,d kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.this argument fails because it ignores diversity of citizenship as the primary basis for the district court jurisdiction.the parties to the action are citizens of different states and the exceeded thus,the requirements of were plainly satisfied and the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.
due process 
appellants next argue that they were denied due process by the court grant of summary judgment in dillard favor.they argue that they did not participate in the original lawsuit involving cellp and that the court imposition of personal liability upon them in amounts to a denial of due process.
they rely on nelson adams usa,for the proposition that t he law,at its most fundamental,does not render judgment simply because a person might have been found liable had he been charged,d quoting ohio cellular prods.adams usa,newman,dissenting.in nelson,liability was imposed upon the individual shareholder of a defendant corporation at the same moment the pleadings were amended to add that shareholder as a defendant.id.at.the shareholder had no opportunity to respond and contest his personal liability for the award after he was made a party and before the entry of judgment against him,and was therefore deprived of due process.id.at.chargois and ernster,on the other hand,had an opportunity to contest their personal liability for cellp judgment and,in fact,vigorously did so before a judgment was entered against them individually.the nelson court emphasized that the right to contest on the merits one personal liability is just what due process affords.id.at.because chargois and ernster had that opportunity and,indeed,availed themselves of it,there was no due process deprivation 
it is undisputed that cellp was formed in and ceased to exist as a registered llp on july.therefore,the texas revised partnership act trpa applies to this dispute.see trpa c codified at.c appellants advance two main arguments under state law.first,they contend that texas partnership law confers immunity upon them as individual partners,whether of an llp or general partnership.second,they contend that the statute of limitations bars dillard action to hold them personally liable for the judgment against cellp.
immunity from personal liability 
as a general matter,the trpa imposes joint and several liability on individual partners for all debts and obligations of a partnership.section of the trpa provides 
except as provided by section or a,all partners are liable jointly and severally for all debts and obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.
stat.ann.under this provision,appellants are liable for the debts and obligations of cellp unless one of the enumerated exceptions applies.see,robert hamilton et,texas practice ed.in general,each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the partnership.the first exception,concerns the liability of incoming partners and is not relevant in this case.
as for the second exception,trpa a limits liability for partners of registered llps.it provides 
a liability of partner.except as provided in subsection a,a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not individually liable,directly or indirectly,by contribution,indemnity,or otherwise,for debts and obligations of the partnership incurred while the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership.
a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not individually liable,directly or indirectly,by contribution,indemnity,or otherwise,for debts and obligations of the partnership arising from errors,omissions,negligence,incompetence,or malfeasance committed while the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership and in the course of the partnership business by another partner or a representative of the partnership not working under the supervision or direction of the first partner unless the first partner 
a was directly involved in the specific activity in which the errors,omissions,negligence,incompetence,or malfeasance were committed by the other partner or representative or 
b had notice or knowledge of the errors,omissions,neg
