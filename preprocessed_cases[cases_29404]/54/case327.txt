shinji kondo appeals from an order denying his motion to vacate and set aside his default and the default judgment against him.we conclude the trial court erred in entering a default and default judgment against kondo and erred again in denying his motion to vacate them.
facts and proceedings below 
plaintiffs original verified complaint in this action named a number of defendants including kondo and sought damages for intentional interference with economic relationship and prospective economic advantage,defamation,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,unfair business practices,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the complaint alleged numerous acts of wrongdoing by kondo which caused harm to plaintiffs.in response to a demurrer to the complaint plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint again naming kondo as a defendant and alleging facts to show how he had caused them damage.
the trial court sustained a demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend.plaintiffs second amended complaint,also verified,entirely removed kondo as a defendant.he was not named in the caption and all the previous factual allegations involving him were removed.again the trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint and granted plaintiffs further leave to amend.
the verified third amended complaint,which is now the operative pleading in this action,is for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair business practices.the caption of the complaint named three individuals and two corporations as defendants.kondo was not named as a defendant and there are no allegations he did anything which caused harm to plaintiffs.
kondo did not file a responsive pleading to the third amended complaint 
eight months after plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint they filed a notice of errata to add kondo to the caption only.the notice stated the word shinji kondo has been left out in the first caption page of plaintiffs third amended complaint,this is a typographical error only,and the word shinji kondo should have never been left out,and the pleading should be regarded as if the words had never been left out.plaintiffs did not amend the complaint to allege kondo engaged in any conduct causing them damage.
the same day plaintiffs filed their errata adding kondo name to the caption of the third amended complaint they filed a request to enter his default and the court clerk entered the default as requested.
four months later the trial court held a default hearing and awarded plaintiffs judgment against kondo in the sum of.the record is silent as to whether kondo was served with notice of entry of the default judgment.
ten months after entry of the default judgment kondo filed a motion to vacate the default and set aside the subsequent judgment on the ground he had not been served with the initial summons and complaint in the action.he also argued adding him to the caption of the third amended complaint and entering his default on the complaint the same day denied him due process.
the trial court denied kondo motion.from the declarations supporting and opposing the motion the trial court made a factual finding kondo was served with the summons and original complaint and had actual notice of the subsequent proceedings.the court further ruled plaintiffs failure to name kondo in the third amended complaint until the errata added him to the caption was of no consequence since kondo counsel was served with the notice of errata and notice of entry of default.there is no explanation for kondo failure to move to set aside the entry of default.
kondo filed a timely appeal from the order denying his motion.
discussion 
on appeal from an order denying a motion for relief from default or a default judgment we will not disturb the trial court factual findings where,as here,they are based on substantial evidence.it is the province of the trial court to determine the credibility of the declarants and to weigh the evidence thus we accept the trial court findings kondo was served with the original summons and complaint,that he had actual notice of these proceedings and that his counsel was served with the notice of errata and the notice of entry of default.
this does not end the matter,however,because whether the default and default judgment complied with constitutional and statutory requirements are questions of law as to which we exercise independent review 
as we explain below the default judgment against kondo must be set aside.the complaint on which it is based failed to apprise kondo of the nature of the plaintiffs demand against him and neither the third amended complaint nor any subsequent notice informed kondo of the amount of damages plaintiffs were seeking from him.in addition,the default must be vacated because kondo was denied an opportunity to respond to the amendment purporting to add him as a defendant in the action in violation of his rights under code of civil procedure section and the due process clauses of the united states and california constitutions.
i.the default judgment is void because it is based on a complaint which failed to apprise kondo of the nature of the plaintiffs demand or the amount of damages sought against him.
the third amended complaint plainly fails to state a cause of action against kondo because it does not allege any conduct on his part caused any harm,loss or damage on the plaintiffs part 
although the complaint contains a boilerplate allegation each defendant was the agent and employee of the others and contains some charging allegations respecting defendants and each of them these allegations do not result in the complaint stating a cause of action against kondo because he is nowhere mentioned in the body of the complaint.adding kondo name to the caption of the complaint added nothing to plaintiffs causes of action because the caption of the complaint constitutes no part of the statement of the cause of action.
it is well established a default judgment can not properly be based on a complaint which fails to state a cause of action against the party defaulted because,as witkin explains,a defendant who fails to answer admits only facts that are well pleaded.because the third amended complaint alleged no facts with respect to kondo,there were no facts for kondo to admit.
a defendant suffering an erroneous default judgment has three potential avenues of relief a direct appeal from the judgment,a motion to set aside the judgment and a collateral attack on the judgment there are potential roadblocks in each of these avenues.a direct appeal from the judgment must be filed within a specified time,generally not more than days after entry of the judgment similarly a motion for relief from a default judgment under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b or,subdivision a,usually must be filed within six months from entry of the judgment or notice of entry of the default or default judgment,whichever occurs first.a void judgment can be attacked at any time by a motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision d or by a collateral action however,a default judgment is not necessarily void just because it is based on a complaint which fails to state a cause of action 
a default judgment is void if the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter of the complaint or if the complaint failed to apprise the defendant of the nature of the plaintiff demand,or if the court granted relief which it had no power to grant including a default judgment which exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint 
the default judgment in the present case is void for two reasons.the complaint contained no factual allegations with respect to kondo therefore it failed to apprise him of the nature of plaintiffs demand against him in addition,the complaint does not specify the amount of damages plaintiffs seek from kondo it is not possible to calculate an amount of damages from the complaint allegations the request for entry of default did not specify the amount of damages sought and plaintiffs did not serve kondo with any other form of notice of the amount of damages sought from him our supreme cou
