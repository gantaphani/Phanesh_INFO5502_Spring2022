background 
on august,after a jury trial in the superior court for contra costa county,in california,appellees yeo and martini obtained a judgment against stephen turner for more than.according to appellants first amended complaint in the district court,the judgment arose from allegations of various business interference torts by stephen turner against yeo and martini.yeo and martini retained cook and his law firm cook,perkiss lew to assist in collection of the which appears to have continued until march,on october,cook filed a complaint in the superior court for contra costa county on behalf of yeo and martini against stephen turner,alleging that turner,under the express direction of susana turner,had fraudulently conveyed his real and personal property,including his home,to a family limited partnership and a limited liability company,each allegedly controlled by the turners,with the intent to prevent yeo and martini from collecting the money owed on the august,judgment.
on october,in response to the fraudulent conveyance action,stephen and susana turner,suing for themselves and on behalf of their children,filed this action in the united states district court for the northern district of california,claiming violations of the fdcpa and various state laws.subsequently an amended complaint was filed,which included all of the allegations in the original complaint and added rico claims.the amended complaint included wps as a plaintiff on the rico claims and on a california unfair competition act claim.wps was not a plaintiff on the fdcpa claim or on the claims other than the unfair competition act claim.
the first amended complaint 
in their fdcpa claims,the turners alleged that appellees,as part of their efforts to collect on the judgment,dispatched false and misleading mail,fax and numerous insurance companies thought to be debtors of wps,in violation of b,a,according to the turners,these communications falsely represented that the superior court for contra costa county had ordered all accounts,accounts receivable,and other rights generated by stephen turner,or any entity of sic his behalf,including wps,to be turned over to yeo and martini.the turners asserted that because wps was not owned,operated or controlled by stephen turner,the superior court order applied only to stephen turner and not to wps.the turners also claimed that appellees fraudulent conveyance filings in the superior court contained false,deceptive and improper statements.specifically,the turners objected to references to stephen turner prior misdemeanor criminal conviction and a characterization of a turner family golden gate that it was a collusive trust created to assist stephen turner in hiding his assets.the turners also alleged that appellees engaged in conduct to harass,oppress or abuse them,in violation of and this alleged conduct included serving excessive copies of court papers on the turners improperly serving them with documents intended for other parties,such as a nevada limited liability company making false statements in an august,court filing regarding the sale of appellants residence and cook statement to stephen turner that you dirty jew,i take everything away from you.
in their rico claims,the turners,now joined by wps,charged appellees with violating c which prohibits a person from participating,through a pattern of racketeering activity,in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise whose activities affect interstate commerce,and d which prohibits conspiring to violate any of the three antecedent provisions of.the enterprise,according to appellants allegations,was cook law firm.the alleged racketeering activity involved the same mail,fax and telephone communications attributed to cook law firm in the turners fdcpa claims.this racketeering activity,according to appellants,had been continuous since the filing of the subject turnover order dated july,through the present,and resulted in the loss of money for wps,the loss of the prospective economic advantage of developing the fledgling business of wps into a viable business entity for stephen and susana turner,and the turners loss of the prospects of continued and lucrative employment with wps.
the district court,in an order issued march,dismissed the fdcpa portions of the amended complaint on the grounds that the debt in tort not subject to the fdcpa.the district court also dismissed appellants rico claims for failing to satisfy rico continuity requirement,but granted appellants leave to file an amended complaint alleging a rico violation.
the second amended complaint 
on april,the turners and wps filed a second amended complaint in which they expanded upon their earlier rico claims.in this complaint appellants alleged that appellees had sent out hundreds of letters and facsimiles to insurance companies misrepresenting the substance of the superior court activity that amounted to a continuous pattern of related,non sporadic repetitious and highly numbered incidents of illegal racketeering conduct in violation of c and d.each time appellees engaged in this activity,appellants maintained,appellees committed an act of mail or wire fraud that was intended to snare the continual billing activities of wps by having these insurance companies divert payments wave after wave.beside the economic loss appellees allegedly fraudulent conduct caused wps,appellants contended that appellees conduct would have negative economic consequences for stephen and susana turner because the turners had both lost the business expectancy of a good employment relationship with wps,and would not receive their salaries if wps suffered financial harm.appellants maintained that the turner children would also be harmed,since the children were the ultimate beneficiaries of the golden gate trust,the turner family trust which owned wps 
appellants also alleged that 
approximately in march,cook and cook,perkiss lew substituted out as counsel of record on the fraudulent conveyance and other actions,and thus the racketeering activity is closed end and is not expected to repeat.however,when it was going on,it was open ended and was never expected to stop,because turner is in fact judgment proof,and as long as the judgment remains unpaid and cook is on the case,these sort s of improper mailings etc.would be mailed out.it was the filing of the present lawsuit that caused cook and cook,perkiss and lew to withdraw of sic the cases,and thus shifted the activity to closed end.
on august,the district court dismissed the second amended complaint,concluding that appellants had failed to allege any threat of continuing illegal activity,which is required to establish a pattern of racketeering under rico.the court dismissed without prejudice appellants claims,and entered final judgment against appellants.appellants timely filed their appeal on september.this court has jurisdiction under.

standing of stephen turner to pursue this appeal 
because stephen turner has filed for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court,northern district of california,he is no longer a real party in interest in this matter and has no standing to pursue this appeal.when turner declared bankruptcy,all the legal or equitable interests he had in his property became the property of the bankruptcy estate and are represented by the bankruptcy trustee.see a.causes of action are among such legal or equitable interests.sierra switchboard westinghouse,cir.
the trustee in turner bankruptcy case has,in a letter to turner counsel,indicated his willingness to allow turner to proceed with his appeal.however,the letter,the pertinent text of which is set forth in the margin is insufficient to confer authority on turner counsel to prosecute this appeal because it fails to effectuate an actual abandonment of the trustee interest in stephen turner causes of the contrary,the letter contemplates the estate pursuit of these causes of action i n the event that,via this appeal,the dismissal is overturned.section of title of the united states code requires notice and a hearing for abandonment to occur,and bankruptcy rule requires the trustee to give notice of a proposed abandonment to all creditors.nothing in the record indicates that these steps have occurred.accordingly,since we conclude that stephen turner has no standing to bring this appeal,the appeal is dismissed as to him however,we do reach the merits of the appeal as to the other appellants 
discussion 
in enacting the fdcpa,congress sought to counter the abusive,deceptive and unfair debt collection practices sometimes used by debt collectors against consumers.see the act allows aggrieved parties to recover damages,attorney fees and costs.id.a.because not all obligations to pay are considered debts under the fdcpa,a threshold issue in a suit brought under the act is whether or not the dispute involves a debt within the meaning of the statute.slenk transworld,cir.the fdcpa defines debt as any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money,property,insurance,or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal,family,or household purposes see also bloom,cir explaining that the fdcpa applies to debts incurred for personal rather than commercial reasons.the act defines consumer as any natural person obligated to pay any debt.id.the act does not define transaction,but the consensus judicial interpretation is reflected in the seventh circuit ruling that the statute is limited in its reach to those obligations to pay arising from consensual transactions,where parties negotiate or contract for goods or services.bass stolper,koritzinsky,brewster neider,cir citing shorts palmer,obligation to pay for shoplifted merchandise not a debt under the fdcpa because plaintiff has never had a contractual arrangement of any kind with any of the defendants.see also mabe servs,cir obligation to pay child support not a debt under the fdcpa because it was not incurred in exchange for consumer goods or services.
this court has not heretofore had occasion to address the question of whether a tort judgment resulting from conduct qualifies as a debt under the fdcpa.however,the eleventh circuit in hawthorne mac adjustment,cir,ruled on a similar issue and concluded that a tort judgment does not constitute a debt,and,therefore,that the fdcpa does not apply.in hawthorne,the plaintiff was in an accident,allegedly resulting from her negligence,for which the defendant had been assigned subrogation rights.id.at.after the defendant attempted to collect its claim,the plaintiff sued under the fdcpa.id.the district court ruled in the defendant favor,concluding that the obligation at issue did not constitute a debt under the fdcpa,and the eleventh circuit affirmed.id.at.
the core of the appellate ruling in hawthorne was as follows 
by the plain terms of the statute,not all obligations to pay are considered debts subject to the fdcpa.rather,the fdcpa may be triggered only when an obligation to pay arises out of a specified transaction.although the statute does not define the term transaction,we do not find it ambiguous.a fundamental canon of statutory construction directs us to interpret words according to their ordinary meaning.the ordinary meaning of transaction necessarily implies some type of business dealing between parties.in other words,when we speak of transactions,we refer to consensual or contractual arrangements,not damage obligations thrust upon one as a result of no more than her own negligence.while we do not hold that every consensual or business dealing constitutes a transaction triggering application of the fdcpa at a minimum,a transaction under the fdcpa must involve some kind of business dealing or other consensual obligation.because appellant alleged obligation to pay appellee for damages arising out of an accident does not arise out of any consensual or business dealing,plainly it does not constitute a transaction under the fdcpa 
hawthorne,at internal citations omitted.
we agree with this eleventh circuit opinion,and we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing the fdcpa claims.appellees brought the fraudulent conveyance action against stephen turner in an effort to collect a tort judgment.according to appellants own pleadings,that judgment resulted from alleged business interference torts,not any consumer transaction.see hawthorne,at a t a minimum,a transaction under the fdcpa must involve some kind of business dealing or other consensual obligation.bass,at see also bloom,at fdcpa does not apply to debts incurred for commercial reasons.appellants maintain that the fdcpa should apply because the fraudulent conveyance action is based on an underlying business tort judgment,but instead involved allegations that the transfer of a personal residence from stephen turner and other entities to susana turner was to defraud creditors.however,as the district court correctly concluded,appellees efforts are not converted into an attempt to collect a consumer debt merely because the fraudulent conveyance action involved stephen turner home.
turner underlying obligation to pay yeo and martini does not arise out of a consumer transaction,and hence is not a debt within the meaning of the fdcpa.we therefore hold that the fdcpa does not apply to appellees efforts to collect the damages awarded for stephen turner commercial torts.hence,the district court properly concluded that the fdcpa does not apply 
civil liability under rico is premised on violations of one or more of the provisions of.the provisions at issue here are c and d.section c provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
section d states it shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection a,b,or c of this section.
because appellants contended that appellees engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity,not collection of unlawful debt,appellants complaint must allege the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.see sun sav.loan ass dierdorff,cir.
as previously described,the racketeering activity appellants complained of consisted of representations by appellees in mail,fax and telephone communications to various insurance companies believed to be debtors of plaintiff wps,that the superior court for contra costa county had ordered any monies owed to wps to be turned over to appellees.appellants c
