background 
in an effort to create economies of scale unavailable to individual anglers,several commercial fishermen banded together to form the independent fishermen cooperative ifc,incorporated in alaska by gregory kirsch kirsch.ifc founding members included dennis eames,owner of the talia,roger ingman,with his wife jody ingman of the jeanine kathleen,and richard and mitchell eide,owners and masters,at that time,of the rose lee,which is now owned by rose lee llc collectively the owners.ifc members envisioned making boatloads of money by assuming the risks traditionally borne by the fishing industry middlemen.instead of immediately selling the catch at the dock to local fish buyers,ifc decided it would ice,process,package,and transport the fish itself and then sell it for a higher price further down the stream of commerce.
ifc members opted to participate in the ventura santa barbara squid fishing season.as relatively new fishermen to these seas,ifc members lacked relationships with and,consequently,priority access to local fish unloading facilities.speed in unloading the catch and priority dock access are essential because if squid is not brought to port,processed,and frozen within hours,the squid flesh begins to spoil.priority docking and unloading services also return a boat to the sea quickly,thereby maximizing its time devoted to harvesting squid and minimizing its time laid up in port.to obtain priority service,ifc,through kirsch,negotiated with ventura packers to unload and document its members catch.for the season,ifc agreed to pay ventura packers to unload and pack the squid to administer ifc business in ventura with government entities,transportation companies,processors,and cold storages and for priority access to ventura packers unloading facilities.
ventura packers provided the ships with priority service on different occasions during the season.each time a ship was unloaded,ventura packers documented the catch using a california department of fish and game landing receipt california fish ticket,many of which bear the signature of the ship owner or master.the sea yielded a bountiful squid season.ventura packers unloaded a total of tons of squid from the ships tons from the rose lee tons from the talia and tons from the jeanine kathleen.at a sales price of,this squid tonnage amounted to nearly for the ships.despite the profitable fishing season,however,the ships allegedly failed to settle their respective accounts with ventura packers.ventura packers claims that at season end,the jeanine kathleen owed the talia owed and the rose lee was in the red a whopping.the ships,of course,dispute their liability as well as the accuracy of these amounts.
to recover these allegedly unpaid amounts,ventura packers filed suit in state court against ifc.while the state suit was pending,ventura packers filed this in rem admiralty action against the ships pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure h and rule c of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims.ventura packers alleged a necessaries lien under and requested arrest of the ships.the owners intervened and submitted undertakings,a type of maritime bond,in lieu of having the ships arrested.the owners then moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court initially denied the owners motion to dismiss.
the owners answered,and discovery proceeded.the parties for summary judgment.the owners again argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the action.ventura packers responded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper under and the common law.the district court granted the owners motion and dismissed the case.

discussion 
i existence of admiralty 
the precise scope of admiralty jurisdiction is not a matter of obvious principle or of very accurate history.the blackheath.though not confined to vessels,admiralty naturally centers around them,as the great agents of maritime affairs.here,the district court held it lacked admiralty jurisdiction because the contract between ventura packers and ifc was not a wholly maritime contract and its maritime portion could not be severed from its portion without prejudice to the ships.we agree with the district court that the contract is not wholly maritime and is not severable.the district court,however,did not consider whether congress provided an independent statutory basis for admiralty jurisdiction by enacting.
the relevant section of the maritime lien act,provides 
a except as provided in subsection b of this section,a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner 
has a maritime lien on the vessel 
may bring a civil action in rem to enforce the lien and 
is not required to allege or prove in the action that credit was given to the vessel.
b this section does not apply to a public vessel.
ventura packers argues that provides particular elements,which if met,allow the federal district court to exercise its admiralty jurisdiction.the ships respond that admiralty jurisdiction is proper only upon meeting the common law requirement that a maritime contract underlie the necessaries lien.we agree with ventura packers.if a plaintiff demonstrates that he provided necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner,then he may bring a civil action in rem to a federal district court sitting in admiralty.
a.the maritime lien act expresses the elements necessary to invoke the district court admiralty jurisdiction.
a federal court authority to hear cases in admiralty flows initially from the constitution,which extends federal judicial power to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.const.art.iii.congress,in turn,embodied that power in a statute giving federal district courts original jurisdiction of a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.
as the constitution fixed only the original jurisdiction of the supreme court,however,congress remains free to mold the scope of the federal courts admiralty jurisdiction as it pleases,and it does so from time to time.detroit trust v.the thomas barlum.noting that congress may extend admiralty jurisdiction so long as it keeps within a proper conception of maritime concerns.the judiciary act of,for example,conferred upon the federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over all cases arising from seizures made on navigable waters under the laws of impost,navigation,or trade of the united states.see erastus benedict,benedict on admiralty,at.since then,congress has periodically enacted specific legislation extending the conditions under which the federal courts may exercise their admiralty jurisdiction.for example,in,congress extended admiralty jurisdiction to include all cases of damage or injury,to person or property,caused by a vessel on navigable water,notwithstanding that such damage or injury be done or consummated on land.prior to the enactment of,an action in admiralty could not have been maintained against a vessel for damages resulting from its collision with a shore structure.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.
most analogous to this case,in,congress enacted the death on the high seas act dohsa,which defined a cause of action in admiralty w henever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore.on its face,dohsa requires only that a wrongful death occur on the high seas beyond one marine league from shore.if a plaintiff meets those requirements,dohsa seemingly authorizes that she may bring a wrongful death action in admiralty.by contrast,a common law wrongful death action must include the jurisdictional element that the action bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.executive jet aviation,city of cleveland,d.congress,however,omitted any mention of this common law jurisdictional element from dohsa.
although several courts initially presumed that dohsa implicitly contained the common law jurisdictional requirement,see,miller united states,cir,the prevailing view holds that dohsa established independent requirements for the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction.in offshore logistics,tallentire,the supreme court held that admiralty jurisdiction is expressly provided under dohsa because the accidental deaths occurred beyond a marine league from shore,d emphasis added see also executive jet,at.u nder the death on the high seas act,a action arising out of an airplane crash on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of a state may clearly be brought in a federal admiralty court.in tallentire,the court alternatively held even without this statutory provision dohsa,admiralty jurisdiction is appropriately invoked here under traditional principles because the accident occurred on the high seas and in furtherance of an activity bearing a significant relationship to a traditional maritime activity.tallentire,at.by explicating admiralty jurisdiction under dohsa distinctly from admiralty jurisdiction at common law,the supreme court demonstrated that dohsa provides independent elements,which if met,trigger the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts.id.
we discern no meaningful distinction between the maritime lien act and dohsa treatment of admiralty jurisdiction.although both statutes have analogs at common law,each statute expressly and independently provides for a cause of action in admiralty,upon the fulfillment of certain elements.we,therefore,follow the supreme court lead in tallentire and conclude that the maritime lien act supplies a basis for admiralty jurisdiction independent from those bases available at common law.in so interpreting the maritime lien act,we neither add nor subtract from what congress passed into law.specifically,we hold ventura packers must demonstrate that it provided necessaries to a vessel by order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner.see robert derecktor,norkin,the district courts have subject matter jurisdiction by,which provides for maritime suits for failure to pay for necessaries to be provided to a vessel.if ventura packers demonstrates these elements,it may invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts to enforce a necessaries lien in rem.
b.a maritime contract is not needed to invoke admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to the maritime lien act.
the owners argue that ventura packers must establish the common law requirement of a maritime contract before it can invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the district court to enforce a necessaries lien.we disagree.although a maritime contract may support admiralty jurisdiction,it is not an essential prerequisite to a civil action in admiralty to enforce a statutory necessaries lien.
in general,maritime liens,including necessaries liens,exist to keep ships moving in commerce,while preventing them from sailing away from the debts they incur.the theoretical basis for the maritime lien rests on the legal fiction that the ship itself caused the loss and may be called into court to make good.maritime liens arise for the unpaid provision of necessaries,breaches of maritime contracts,unpaid seaman wages,unpaid cargo freight,preferred ship mortgages,as well as in other circumstances.see thomas schoenbaum,admiralty maritime law ed listing cognizable maritime liens.although most maritime liens arise by operation of general maritime law,several are created by statutes,such as the maritime lien act or the ship mortgage act.
some maritime liens are based on breaches of an underlying contract,but such a contract is not a prerequisite to assert a valid maritime lien.see farwest steel barge sea span,cir the district court had admiralty jurisdiction if it was adjudicating either a maritime lien or a contract relating to the repair of an already constructed vessel.citations omitted.for example,a maritime lien for collision is not based upon contract nor is a maritime lien arising from a maritime tort.therefore,the existence of a maritime contract is not an essential precondition of admiralty jurisdiction to enforce a maritime lien it is simply one method by which a maritime lien may arise under general maritime law.see albany ins.istrian express,cir this circuit recognizes a maritime tort lien irrespective of contractual obligations.
like the maritime lien for collision or tort,the maritime lien for necessaries created by is not predicated on the existence of a maritime contract.section does not mention a maritime contract requirement,and we have unearthed no reason to impute one.instead the statute provides for an action in admiralty if necessaries were provided to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner.necessaries provided on the order of the owner do not inherently require a maritime contract,and nothing hints that congress intended the order of necessaries to be synonymous with maritime contract for necessaries.if congress had intended a maritime contract requirement for an action in admiralty to enforce a necessaries lien under the maritime lien act,we believe it would have said as much and not left us to infer that the federal courts jurisdiction rests on an anachronistic common law jurisdictional requirement.
the supreme court decision in the resolute,does not compel a different result.in the resolute,the court considered an action for unpaid seamen wages.id.at.at that time,no statute provided the seamen with a right of action in admiralty,so the seamen invoked the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal district court based on the breach of a maritime contract.id.the defendant countered that the seamen could not assert a valid lien,and thus,the district court lacked admiralty jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.id.at.
the supreme court rejected the defendant argument.the court held that jurisdiction was proper if the contract sued upon was a maritime contract and if the property proceeded against was in the custody of the court.id.at.the question of lien or no lien wa s not one of jurisdiction,but of merits.id.at.
while applicable to common law admiralty actions based on the breach of a maritime contract,we believe the resolute is inapplicable to the case before us.in the resolute,the seamen claimed a lien for unpaid wages,not a statutory necessaries lien like the one claimed by ventura packers.indeed,a statutory necessaries lien was unavailable to the resolute seamen because the maritime lien act was not enacted until years after the resolute.the seamen,therefore,had to demonstrate admiralty jurisdiction by meeting the common law requirements based on the breach of a maritime contract the arrest of the vessel and a maritime contract.whether the seamen held a valid lien remained a question of the merits reserved for the trier of fact.
if ventura packers had asserted admiralty jurisdiction based on breach of contract,the resolute would apply.in that case,ventura packers would have had to prove the arrest of the ships and existence of a maritime contract.the district court interpreted ventura packers suit
