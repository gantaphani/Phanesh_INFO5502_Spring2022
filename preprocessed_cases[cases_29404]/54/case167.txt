in this appeal,we are asked to decide whether a garnishment action brought by geraldine lang in minnesota state court against the social security administration ssa was removed to federal court in a timely manner.the district court held the government complied with the time limit for removal set forth in b.we disagree,and therefore reverse and remand with instructions to the district court to remand this case to state court.
on december,lang obtained a minnesota state court judgment for unpaid child support against her,thomas swanson.the judgment amounted to.at the time,swanson was receiving social security disability benefits from the ssa.five days later,on december,lang served a garnishment summons on the ssa seeking to have her state court judgment satisfied out of swanson social security payments lang pursued the garnishment action in accordance with,under which the united states has agreed to be sued in state court garnishment proceedings brought to enforce child support obligations.
the garnishment summons complied with state law in all respects.lang served the garnishment summons upon anne lewandoski at the ssa field office in paul,minnesota.prior to doing so,lang counsel contacted the ssa to determine who the ssa had designated as its agent to receive orders and accept service of process in matters relating to child support or alimony,c a,and was specifically instructed to serve the garnishment summons on lewandoski.
minnesota law requires a person served with a garnishment summons to respond to the summons by sending the creditor a written disclosure of the garnishee indebtedness,money,or other property owing to the debtor within twenty days,subd.the ssa did not comply with the garnishment summons.instead,the ssa contacted lang counsel requesting a copy of the state court order of judgment for child support arrearages.lang provided the ssa with a copy of the state court order on february.the ssa still did not comply with the garnishment summons by sending lang a written disclosure.instead,on february,the ssa sent lang counsel a letter claiming it could not comply with the garnishment summons because the state court order does not show that it is to collect child support alimony.the state court judgment expressly indicated the judgment was for child support.the ssa letter also claimed it did not have enough information full name and social security number for us to identify the person whose benefit payments it will affect.the garnishment summons specifically listed thomas swanson as the debtor and included his social security number.
on march,after the ssa had still failed to comply with the garnishment summons by providing lang with a written disclosure in accordance with state law,lang served the ssa with a notice of motion and motion indicating she would be asking the state court for a default judgment pursuant to,subd.or,in the alternative,for leave to file a supplemental complaint against the ssa pursuant to,subd.a motion hearing was set for march.the ssa did not serve or file a response to the motion,and did not appear at the hearing.
on april,the state court authorized lang to serve and file a supplemental complaint.lang properly served and filed the supplemental complaint on april.the ssa did not file or serve an answer to the supplemental complaint.
on may,lang properly served the ssa with a notice of motion and motion indicating she would be asking the state court for summary judgment.a motion hearing was set for june.once again,the ssa did not respond to the motion or appear at the motion hearing to oppose summary judgment.as might be expected,on june,the state court entered judgment against the ssa in favor of lang in the amount of,the amount requested in the initial garnishment summons.on june,after the default judgment had been entered,the ssa sent lang counsel a note stating we are unable to process your request.
having properly complied with state garnishment law every step of the way,and now armed with a judgment against the ssa,lang initiated efforts to recoup her child support arrearages.on july,the state court issued a writ of execution directed to the ramsey county mn sheriff.on august,the ramsey county sheriff served a written demand on the ssa at its field office in paul,minnesota.on august,lang served a notice of motion on the ssa indicating she was seeking an order authorizing the ramsey county sheriff to execute the writ of execution and to seize sufficient personal property at the ssa field office to satisfy the judgment.
on august,days after service of the initial garnishment summons days after the service of the supplemental complaint and days after judgment had been entered against the government filed a notice of removal in federal district court seeking to remove lang garnishment action from state court to federal court.in the notice of removal,the government claimed b period for removal has not expired on the grounds the supplemental complaint was commenced with insufficient service of process because it did not comply with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
lang timely moved the district court to remand the garnishment action to state court.lang argued the garnishment summons should be considered the initial pleading for purposes of starting b time limit,rendering the removal untimely.alternatively,lang argued even if the supplemental complaint was the initial pleading for purposes of b s period,the removal was still untimely because the supplemental complaint had been served days before the government removed the case to federal court.
in response,the government argued the supplemental complaint was the initial pleading.the government further argued the notice of removal was timely because the supplemental complaint had not been properly served.see murphy.michetti pipe stringing,indicating formal service is required for b period to begin to run.the government argument was based on its claim that service of the supplemental complaint was insufficient because it did not comply with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.more specifically,the government argued lang was required to,and did not deliver a copy of the summons and the complaint to the united states attorney for the district where the action is brought.i a i 
the district court agreed with the government that the supplemental complaint,rather than the initial garnishment summons,was the initial pleading for purposes of b period for removing an action.the district court further agreed with the government contention that the period had not yet run because service of lang supplemental complaint did not comply with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court then denied lang motion to remand the case to state court.in addition,for reasons we need not discuss for purposes of resolving the timeliness issue,the district court thereafter exercised jurisdiction over the action and granted the government motion to dismiss.lang filed a timely appeal contending,inter alia,the district court erred when it concluded the government removal was timely.
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to remand a case to state court.menz new holland,cir.
on appeal,lang contends the district court erred when it determined the supplemental complaint served days prior to the government notice of removal was the initial pleading for purposes of b,rather than the garnishment summons served days prior to removal.we have not previously decided whether,for purposes of a minnesota state garnishment action,the garnishment summons or the supplemental complaint triggers b time period for removal.the same question was raised in koehnen herald fire insurance,cir,but the manner in which koehnen was resolved made it unnecessary to decide the question.see id.at 
it is again unnecessary for us to decide which event triggers the period,because the government removal was untimely whether the clock started to run when the initial garnishment summons was served or when the supplemental complaint was served.the government argument turns entirely on the premise that service of the supplemental complaint was insufficient to start the ti
