the ministry argues that the cubic judgment is not a blocked asset under tria because executive order unblocked certain iranian assets.in support of its argument,mod cites two cases in which district courts found that tria did not permit the attachment of iranian property because the assets at issue did not fall within tria definition of blocked assets.see bank of new york rubin,wl,weinstein islamic republic of iran,d.however,the reasoning in those cases is inapplicable here.iran interest in the properties in question in rubin and weinstein arose after january,so executive order unblocked those assets.in contrast,iran interest in the acmr arose in october when iran executed the contracts with cubic or at the latest by october,when iran made a payment of approximately on the contracts.see mod cubic,d at.

this case arises from dariush elahi attempt to collect on a default judgment he holds against iran.elahi seeks to attach a million judgment obtained in a contract dispute by the iranian ministry of defense and support of the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran.the district court allowed elahi to attach the judgment,holding that the ministry had waived its immunity from attachment by submitting to the jurisdiction of the court.we have jurisdiction under.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court on the alternative ground that the judgment is subject to attachment under section of the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,stat,codified at note.
background 
the wrongful death default judgment 
cyrus elahi was shot and killed as he left his apartment building in paris,france,on october.elahi islamic republic of iran,d.his brother,dariush elahi,brought a wrongful death action against the state of iran and the iranian ministry of information and security mois in the united states district court for the district of columbia,claiming iranian agents assassinated his brother.id.at.although iran and mois did not appear,the court heard testimony and read documentary evidence relating to the assassination this evidence satisfied the court that iran and mois were liable for elahi death.id.at.it entered a default judgment against iran and mois for million in compensatory damages and punitive damages of million.id.at.it is this judgment that elahi now seeks to satisfy by attaching the cubic judgment.
the contract dispute between cubic defense systems and the iranian ministry of defense 
in october,the predecessor of the iranian ministry of defense and support of the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran mod or the ministry entered into two contracts with an american defense contractor,now known as cubic defense systems cubic,for the sale and service of an air combat maneuvering range acmr for use by the iranian air force.ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran cubic defense systems,d.iran made partial payment on the acmr,but never received it following the iranian revolution of,cubic breached its contract with the ministry and sold the acmr elsewhere.id.in an attempt to recover the acmr or its payments,iran filed a claim against cubic with the claims tribunal in the hague,which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction id.subsequently,iran requested arbitration before the international chamber of commerce icc in zurich.id.having conducted a hearing at which both parties were represented,the icc issued an award for mod,ordering cubic to pay million in damages for breach of contract.id.at.the ministry reduced this icc award to a judgment the cubic judgment in the united states district court for the southern district of california.id.at.
elahi attempt to attach the cubic judgment 
on november,elahi sought a lien against the cubic judgment to satisfy partially his judgment against iran.mod filed a motion seeking a judicial determination that the cubic judgment is immune from attachment by elahi denying the motion,the district court ruled that in waiving its immunity from jurisdiction by submitting to icc arbitration and seeking confirmation of the arbitration award in district court,mod had also waived its immunity from attachment of its property.ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran cubic defense systems,d.
the ministry appealed,and we affirmed the district court holding that elahi could attach the cubic judgment,although we relied on different grounds.cir vacated and remanded,ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran elahi,d per curiam.relying on the structure and traditional interpretation of the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,we held that the two immunities are separate and that mod waiver of jurisdictional immunity did not waive its attachment immunity.id.at.nonetheless,we affirmed the district court determination that elahi could attach the cubic judgment on the ground that mod,as an agency of iran engaged in commercial activity in the united states,fell within a fsia exception to immunity allowing attachment of certain property connected to commercial activity.see id.at see also b.
the ministry appealed to the united states supreme court,which granted certiorari on the limited question of whether mod constituted a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.see ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran elahi,d per curiam.noting that fsia offers broader immunity from attachment to a foreign state than to a foreign state agencies and instrumentalities,the court addressed the question of whether we had properly determined that the ministry was an agency or instrumentality of iran rather than the foreign state itself.id.finding that we had not,the court remanded for reconsideration.id.at.
on remand,we requested two rounds of supplemental briefing and permitted the united states to appear as amicus curiae.as a result of this supplemental briefing,two additional issues have emerged.first,the parties agree that in,elahi applied for and received payment of million from the united states treasury in partial satisfaction of his million compensatory damages award against iran.in receiving this payment,elahi signed a declaration in which he relinquished some,but not all,of his rights to pursue the remainder of his default judgment against iran.specifically,he relinquished his right to punitive damages and his right to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal.office of foreign assets control,department of treasury,payment to persons who hold certain judgments against cuba or iran,see also victims of trafficking and violence protection act of victims protection act,a d as amended by tria,c.
the ministry and the united states both argue that by accepting this payment elahi waived his right to attach the cubic judgment.they contend that the cubic judgment is currently at issue in claim before the claims tribunal in the hague in which iran is attempting to recover,from the united states,inter alia,any value of the cubic contracts in excess of the icc award.
the second new issue is elahi contention that he may attach the cubic judgment under tria,which created an alternative avenue of attachment for certain judgment creditors of terrorist part ies.
discussion 
elahi purported waiver pursuant to his receipt of payment under the victims protection act 
in the fall of,congress directed the secretary of the treasury to make available to certain judgment creditors of iran payments equal to the creditors compensatory damages awards.victims protection act,a.under this statute,a person is eligible to receive payment for certain judgments against iran for harms caused by terrorism.id.a a i.creditors who had filed suit on certain dates were eligible to receive payment,as were those who had received a final judgment by july.id.a a i,ii.under the terms of the victims protection act,elahi was not eligible to receive payment.
in,congress amended the victims protection act in several ways,three of which we highlight here.see tria.first,it expanded the class of judgment creditors eligible to receive payment under the victims protection act to include certain creditors who had filed suit against iran before october,based on claims of terrorism.victims protection act,a a ii as amended by tria c.this amendment made elahi eligible to receive payment under the victims protection act,as he had filed suit before october.see elahi islamic republic of iran,d at noting entry of default judgment on august.second,based on congress recognition of the limited funds available to pay victims with judgments against iran,the amended victims protection act authorized the secretary of the treasury to make pro rata payments on compensatory damages awards.victims protection act,d as amended by tria c.finally,the statute requires a person who accepts a pro rata payment to relinquish certain rights,including the right to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such tribunal.id.a d as amended by tria c.elahi concedes that he waived this right by accepting a pro rata payment under the victims protection act.
iran has brought a claim against the united states in the claims tribunal,claim,for damages based on the of goods,including the acmr that was the subject of the cubic contract,by united states companies who breached contracts following the iranian revolution.related to the acmr,iran contends in its brief to the claims tribunal that the million icc award which became the cubic judgment did not fully compensate it for cubic of goods,and it seeks to recoup the difference from the united states.in that filing,iran distinguished between the cubic judgment and its claim before the claims tribunal,stating,t he of this case,at variance with the icc action,is the losses suffered by iran as a result of the united states of iranian properties.in other words,the cubic judgment itself already adjudicated in the icc action is not at issue in iran claim that it has not been fully compensated by the united states.
we find this concession persuasive in distinguishing between the contractual obligations resolved through the cubic judgment and the united states obligations that will be addressed before the claims tribunal.in essence,claim addresses what liability the united states incurred by failing to restore frozen iranian assets,including the acmr,as required under the algiers accords in contrast,the cubic judgment had resolved cubic liability to iran for of the acmr.
nonetheless,iran argues that the cubic judgment is at issue before the claims tribunal because iran has offered to offset from its demand against the united states in tribunal case any proceeds it receives from the cubic judgment.this argument ignores iran presentation of its claims against cubic to the icc and its resulting judgment against cubic.having arbitrated this dispute before the icc and secured a judgment against cubic for its breach,iran has fully adjudicated its claim against cubic for of the acmr.further,as noted supra,the tribunal has no jurisdiction over claims against private parties,having jurisdiction only to hear counterclaims against such parties the question of whether elahi can attach the cubic judgment is a separate matter from iran claim against the united states.iran claim against cubic has been addressed by a tribunal,resolved by the million arbitration award against cubic,and further reduced to a judgment in the southern district of california 
we hold that the cubic judgment is not at issue before the claims tribunal and therefore that elahi did not waive his right to attach the cubic judgment by accepting a pro rata payment under the victims protection act 
attachment under tria a 
on remand,elahi advances the alternative claim that he may attach the cubic judgment under tria a we agree that congress created,in passing tria,a method of attachment for creditors such as elahi who hold final judgments for harms caused by terrorism.see tria a incorporating by reference a.
under tria,these creditors may attach the blocked assets of a terrorist party.id.specifically,tria a provides 
a in any other provision of law,and except as provided in subsection b of this note,in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism,or for which a terrorist party is not immune under section a of title,united states code,the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution in order to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged liable.
tria a alteration in original.
elahi claim for relief under tria a turns on two factors whether iran is a terrorist party under that statute and whether the cubic judgment is a blocked asset.the first factor is easily answered.tria includes within its definition of terrorist party a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the secretary of state.tria d.iran is subject to this definition,having been designated by secretary of state george shultz as a state sponsor of terrorism.see secretarial determ.january.
we therefore turn to the second factor,whether the cubic judgment fits within tria definition of a blocked asset.tria defines blocked asset to mean any asset seized or frozen by the united states under sections and of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa.tria d a.the ieepa grants the president broad authority to regulate foreign assets when faced with an unusual and extraordinary threat related to a declared national emergency.b.following the hostage crisis in,president carter exercised his authority under ieepa to freeze iranian assets in the united states 
i hereby order blocked all property and interests in property of the government of iran,its instrumentalities and controlled entities and the central bank of iran which are or become subject to the jurisdiction of the united states or which are in or come within the possession or control of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.
exec.order.he delegated to the secretary of the treasury his authority under ieepa to carry out this order.id.pursuant to that authority,the treasury department issued the iranian assets control regulations,codified at part.particularly relevant here is,which blocked the transfer of goods to iran 
no property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states or which is in the possession of or control of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states in which on or after november,iran has any interest of any nature whatsoever may be transferred,paid,exported,withdrawn or otherwise dealt in except as authorized.
following release of the hostages,the united states unblocked most iranian assets and lifted the trade embargo.see exec.order,iranian assets control regulations,codified at pt.however,military goods such as the acmr remained blocked.see et exec.order,notice of president,international traffic in arms regulations,office of foreign assets control,dep of,foreign assets control regulations for exporters and importerss certain assets related to these claims remain blocked in the united states and consist mainly of military and property.
the ministry argues that the cubic judgment is not a blocked asset under tria because executive order unblocked certain iranian assets.in support of its argument,mod cites two cases in which district courts found that tria did not permit the attachment of iranian property because the assets at issue did not fall within tria definition of blocked assets.see bank of new york rubin,wl,weinstein islamic republic of iran,d.however,the reasoning in those cases is inapplicable here.iran interest in the properties in question in rubin and weinstein arose after january,so executive order unblocked those assets.in contrast,iran interest in the acmr arose in october when iran executed the contracts with cubic or at the latest by october,when iran made a payment of approximately on the contracts.see mod cubic,d at.
in sum,we find that the cubic judgment is a blocked asset under tria because it represents iran interest in an asset seized or frozen by the united states under sections and of the international emergency economic powers act.tria d a.because tria a waives attachment immunity for such blocked assets,we hold that elahi may attach the cubic judgment.
mod status under fsia 
the supreme court remand order asks us to determine the status of mod.we answer that question although it is relevant only if our determination,either that the cubic judgment is a blocked asset or that elahi did not waive his right to attach the judgment under the victims protection act,is in error.
all parties agree that,at a minimum,mod is a foreign state for purposes of fsia and that,as such,its assets would be subject to attachment under the narrow set of circumstances set forth in a.the disputed question is whether mod is an agency or instrumentality whose property is subject to attachment under the broader set of exceptions contained in b.the answer turns on whether the entity,here the ministry,is a separate legal person.b.
in answering this question,some courts have created a characteristics test,asking whether,under the law of the foreign state where it was created,the entity can sue and be sued in its own name,contract in its own name,and hold property in its own name.see hyatt stanton,bowers transportes navieros ecuadorianos.on the other hand,circuit courts have adopted a core functions test,asking whether the defendant is an integral part of a foreign state political structure or,by contrast,an entity whose structure and function is predominantly commercial.transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also garb republic of poland,cir roeder islamic republic of iran,magness russian fed n,cir.the united states,in its briefing as amicus curiae,urges us to adopt the core functions test.
in transaero,the circuit considered whether the bolivian air force constituted a part of the bolivian state or an agency or instrumentality of that state for purposes of service of process under fsia.considering fsia purpose,the court noted that fsia codified the restrictive approach to sovereign immunity in which immunity is repealed for commercial acts and preserved for inherently sovereign or public acts.transaero,at accord republic of austria altmann,d in passing fsia,congress intent was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,according to which the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts jure imperii of a state,but not with respect to private acts jure gestionis.the circuit found this restrictive approach to support a core functions test.construing narrowly legislative history that would support applying the characteristics test,the circuit pointed out that the characteristics test suffered a serious defect because any nation may well find it convenient as does ours to give powers of contract and litigation to entities that on any reasonable view must count as part of the state itself,almost any arm of the state would be considered instrumentalities.transaero,at noting that under the legislative history test,the united states departments of state and defense would count as instrumentalities.we agree.a foreign state is nothing more than the sum of its parts in other words,like the united states,the state of iran exists only through its head of state,its ministries,and the myriad administrative offices that collectively embody a sovereign state.more importantly,the foreign state can act only through these entities.
we add that it is illogical to distinguish between a foreign state and agency and instrumentality on the basis that the latter is a separate legal person while the former is not.a central purpose of fsia was to specify the circumstances under which the federal courts could assert jurisdiction over a foreign state.thus,the act presupposes that a foreign state is capable of suing and being sued.indeed,in numerous provisions,the act explicitly anticipates legal actions brought by or against foreign states.see enumerating circumstances in which a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states or of the states id.specifying the manner in which to serve process upon a foreign state or a political subdivision id.limiting immunity from counterclaims in any action brought by a foreign state,or in which a foreign state intervenes.if the touchstone of an agency or instrumentality is whether it can sue or be sued,then these provisions of fsia become superfluous,thereby undermining the scheme of immunity and liability that congress sought to impose.
we adopt the core functions test as the appropriate benchmark for deciding whether an entity should be viewed as a foreign state or as an agency or instrumentality.this analysis has been adopted by each of our sister circuits which has considered the issue,see garb,at roeder,at magness,at,and it is consistent with the purpose and structure of fsia.
the question thus becomes whether mod is inherently a part of the political state or a commercial actor.as the circuit observed in transaero,the powers to declare and wage war are so intimately connected to a state sovereignty that it is hard to see what would count as the foreign state if its armed forces do not.at.we find this reasoning persuasive,although we decline to adopt the circuit categorical rule that the armed forces will always be a part of the foreign state itself.see id.it is possible to imagine situations in which a state would subcontract its defense to paramilitary groups or mercenary forces that would not properly count as part of the state but rather as separate legal person s.however,we adopt a strong presumption that the armed forces constitute a part of the foreign state itself,and that presumption has not been rebutted here.
here,elahi has presented no evidence that mod is a separately constituted legal entity distinct from the iranian state.first nat.city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba bancec,d he has not established that mod is primarily responsible for its own finances,that it is run as a distinct economic enterprise,that it operates with independence from close political control,or that it exhibits any of the than the capacity to sue and be the court has identified as characteristic of a separately constituted legal entity.id.as such,elahi has failed to overcome the presumption that mod constitutes an inherent part of the state of iran.
attachment of the property of a foreign state.
although mod is a foreign state,elahi asserts that he may still attach the cubic judgment under a.under this provision,elahi must satisfy two conditions.first,his judgment against iran must relate to a claim brought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of extrajudicial killing.see id.incorporating by reference a.elahi asserts,and mod has no choice but to concede,that he has satisfied this requirement.second,the property in dispute,the cubic judgment,must be property used for a commercial activity in the united states.id.a.the parties dispute whether elahi has satisfied this second requirement.
section a provides that,under certain circumstances,the property in the united states of a foreign state used for a commercial activity in the united states,shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution upon a judgment entered by a court of the united states.a.focusing on whether iran contract with cubic constituted commercial activity,elahi argues that the cubic judgment was used for commercial activity in the united states because it arose out of mod commercial activity.this analysis begs the question.even assuming the cubic contract constituted a commercial contract for sale of military goods and services,we are still faced with the question posed by a on the use to which mod has put the judgment.the source of the property is not determinative and the mere fact that the property has a nexus or connection to a commercial activity in the united states is insufficient.chevron overseas,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord connecticut bank of commerce republic of congo,cir city of englewood socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir rejecting an argument that property used to house the libyan ambassador to the united nations was subject to attachment under a because the property was acquired in a commercial transaction and reasoning that if acquisition of property in a particular commercial transaction or act indelibly stamped the property as used for commercial activity,even foreign embassies and chancelleries would be subject to execution.plainly congress did not intend a result so inconsistent with recognized principles of international law.
to satisfy a,mod must have used the cubic judgment for a commercial activity in the united states,and this it has not done.we have recently stated that property is used for a commercial activity in the united states when it is put into action,put into service,availed or employed for a commercial activity,not in connection with a commercial activity or in relation to a commercial activity,at emphasis in original.cautioning that fsia does not contemplate a strained analysis of the words used for and commercial activity,we instructed courts to consider the use of the property in question in a straightforward manner.id.the ministry has not used the cubic judgment as security on a loan,as payment for goods,or in any other commercial activity.instead,iran intends to send the proceeds back to iran for assimilation into mod general budget.because repatriation into a ministry budget does not constitute commercial activity,we hold that the cubic judgment is not subject to attachment under a.
conclusion 
we conclude that although elahi may not attach the cubic judgment under a,he may do so under tria.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
when dariush elahi applied for and accepted million from the united states treasury under the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,he relinquished the right to attach property at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal.see,d b,stat.iran ministry of defense mod,and the united states as amicus curiae,argue that elahi has relinquished his right to attach the cubic judgment because it is at issue in iran case before the united claims tribunal i agree.
case involves the status and disposition of iranian military property and assets situated in the united states.one of the pieces of military equipment in dispute in case is the air combat maneuvering range acmr,which mod purchased from cubic on october.because iran has already recovered million from cubic for damages arising out of the cubic contract,the united states is entitled to use the cubic judgment as a setoff against any award in case.
although the cubic judgment will affect the amount of money damages the united states will have to pay,the majority concludes that the cubic judgment is not at issue in case and can be attached by elahi.as a result,the found liable in case no longer have the benefit of the million cubic judgment that otherwise would be deducted by offset.because the majority interpretation of at issue contradicts the term plain meaning and congress intent in passing tria,i respectfully dissent.
tria relinquishment provision 
by enacting tria in,congress expanded the class of judgment creditors eligible to receive payments from the united states treasury for judgments awarded against terrorist part ies.tria a.sponsors expressed the hope that tria would provide american victims previously denied compensation,such as elahi,with some measure of justice.cong.rec,daily ed,statement of harkin.
however,tria justice comes at a cost.those who receive partial compensation must agree to relinquish the right to execute or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such tribunal,tria d b,and recipients must sign an agreement stating 
i hereby relinquish all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such tribunal.
i understand that the relinquishment that i make in the event of any pro rata distribution is irrevocable once the payment is credited to the bank account i have identified in this application.
see payments to persons who hold certain categories of judgments against cuba or iran.
when elahi accepted tria funds in april,he knew that he risked waiving the right to attach the cubic judgment.as early as mod argued before the district court that the cubic judgment is at issue in case between the united states and iran in the hague.see ministry of defense support for armed forces of islamic republic of iran cubic def,d,quoting mod briefing.although i am deeply sympathetic to elahi and his family for their personal loss,relinquishment of the right to attach the cubic judgment is part of the bargain elahi struck by accepting funds from the united states treasury.
ii.plain meaning of at issue 
this case presents a question of statutory interpretation.as such,the first step is determining whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.for our purposes,the language at issue is at issue.
when determining the plain meaning of language,we may consult dictionary definitions.see,chevron overseas congo,cir.black law dictionary defines at issue as t aking opposite sides under dispute in question.black law dictionary ed.similarly,the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed,defines at issue as i n question in dispute.it is evident from these definitions that congress selected a term with a relatively broad meaning.see hegna islamic republic of iran,cir rejecting narrow interpretation of at issue 
the cubic judgment is at issue before the claims tribunal any tribunal must determine the effect of the judgment on the amount of liability owed by the united states.iran has voluntarily pledged to offset the million cubic judgment against any award it wins against the united states in case.if iran keeps its promise,that will affect the claims tribunal determination of the amount of damages the united states will have to pay iran.
significantly,even if iran were to renege on its promise,the cubic judgment would be at issue because the united states could then claim an entitlement to a setoff.under claims tr
