chubb insurance company of canada chubb and bituminous casualty company bituminous appeal the district court order granting marion chapman chapman motion for authority to execute a state court judgment against chubb and bituminous,respectively the insurer and indemnitor of discharged bankruptcy debtor coho resources.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for transfer to the southern district of mississippi,from whence it came.
facts and proceedings 
seldom,on appeal,do we confront cases with odysseys as circuitous and tortured as this one.this bankruptcy appeal stems from a personal injury suit originally filed and tried in state court in jones county,mississippi.in that suit,chapman alleged that in august,he sustained permanent injuries when he fell approximately twenty feet from a platform while working on an oil well owned by coho resources.at the time of the accident,chapman was employed by sauls,sauls,which had contracted with coho to perform repair and service work on coho wells.the contract included an indemnity agreement,under which sauls agreed to defend,indemnify,and hold coho harmless from and against all claims,losses,costs,demands,damages and causes of action without limit and without regard to the cause which are related in any way to the subject matter of the parties agreement.pursuant to this provision,sauls general liability insurer,bituminous,assumed the defense of coho as the defendant in chapman suit.
chapman case was tried before a jury in may.the jury returned a verdict in favor of chapman and awarded in excess of million in damages.a judgment in this amount was entered in mississippi circuit court on june.on june,coho timely filed several motions,seeking,inter alia,judgment notwithstanding the verdict and remittitur.on august,while coho motions were pending,coho filed a voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas coho filed a suggestion of bankruptcy on september,notifying the mississippi state court of the bankruptcy proceedings and the automatic stay.chapman,too was notified of the bankruptcy petition and the deadline for filing claims,but he did not choose to file a proof of claim in those proceedings.
a week later,on october,the mississippi circuit court ruled on coho motions,ordering a remittitur of the damage award to and denying all other motions.the court did not acknowledge the bankruptcy proceedings,and it is unclear whether the court received notice of the stay before it issued its rulings.regardless,chapman accepted the remitted award on october.coho appealed the judgment to the mississippi supreme court in november,but did not post a supersedeas bond.
on november,chapman filed a garnishment action against chubb and bituminous in the circuit court of jones county,mississippi the state court issued writs of garnishment directed to chubb and bituminous in the amount of the remitted jury award.
chubb and bituminous successfully removed the garnishment action to the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi,which ordered chapman to 
petition the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas for permission to lift its stay,or amend its order,to authorize or permit plaintiff to collect on the judgment entered against coho in plaintiff underlying state court proceeding or to otherwise proceed in this court or in state court in that matter,but only to the extent that proceeds of insurance are available to coho,or to indemnify coho,from bituminous casualty company chubb insurance company of canada.
in compliance with this court order,chapman filed a motion for authority to collect execute on state court judgment in the texas bankruptcy court.in his motion,chapman sought to execute the state judgment against bituminous and chubb to the extent that insurance proceeds are available to coho to satisfy subject.
following the completion of briefing and oral argument,the bankruptcy court denied chapman motion.the court concluded that chapman has no remedy,because he is not a claimant in the chapter case and is barred from going forward one way or the other,either in the bankruptcy court or in a mississippi court.
chapman appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the district court in texas.after further briefing and oral argument,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling in part,and modified it in part.first,the district court agreed that,because chapman had failed to file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings,he was not entitled to recover from coho,the debtor.the district court concluded further,however,that chapman could proceed against coho nominally to recover from insurers such as chubb,coho general liability insurer.the court ruled additionally that,as bituminous is not coho insurer but its indemnitor,and the liability of its indemnitee,coho,had been extinguished by discharge,bituminous liability as coho indemnitor was likewise extinguished.finally,the district court recognized that the mississippi circuit court had issued its ruling on coho motions after the petition for bankruptcy was filed and while the automatic bankruptcy stay was in effect.the district court nevertheless declined to address whether the state court rulings and remitted judgment were void,electing to leave it up to the mississippi courts to determine which judgment will be enforced.bituminous and chubb timely filed notices of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo 
chapman authority to proceed against third parties 
chubb first asserts that chapman is forever barred from proceeding against coho insurers because he failed to file a proof of claim in coho chapter proceedings chubb argument in this regard is based largely on perceived policy considerations.according to chubb,chapman failure to file a proof of claim or otherwise notify the bankruptcy court of its debt frustrates the very purpose of the bankruptcy code and prevents an orderly administration of the debtor estate.
we and other courts have squarely rejected chubb argument it is entirely without merit.a operates as an injunction against actions against a debtor subsequent to a discharge of a debt.the bankruptcy discharge and injunction serve to give the debtor a financial fresh start.as a general rule,a creditor must file a proof or notice of claim during bankruptcy proceedings to preserve its claim against the debtor.if a creditor neglects to file such notice,the injunction will act to shield the debtor from the creditor 
the discharge and injunction,however,are expressly designed to protect only the debtor,and do not affect the liability of any other entity for the debt accordingly,courts are in near unanimous agreement that e permits a creditor to bring,and proceed in,an action nominally directed against a discharged debtor for the sole purpose of proving liability on its part as a prerequisite to recovering from its insurer.in houston edgeworth in re edgeworth we endorsed this approach,explaining that it makes no sense to allow an insurer to escape coverage for injuries caused by its insured merely because the insured receives a bankruptcy discharge and noting that s uch a result would be fundamentally wrong.
in short,even though chapman failure to file a proof of claim in coho bankruptcy proceedings is a bar to continued prosecution of claims against coho,it does not affect his claims against,such as general liability insurers.the policy is not intended to provide a method by which an insurer can escape its obligations based simply on the financial misfortunes of the insured.the district court properly granted chapman motion for authority to proceed against coho insurers 
status of chapman remitted state judgment
