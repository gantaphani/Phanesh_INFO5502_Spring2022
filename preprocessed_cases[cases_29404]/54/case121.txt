were the prevailing party in a suit against the state of ohio.the district court included in its final judgment on the merits an award of reasonable attorney fees.eleven months later,the district court entered judgment quantifying the fee award.in a subsequent order,the court held that were entitled to interest on attorney fees running from the date of the merits judgment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm decision of the district court.
background 
in september,the state of ohio,through the ohio department of administrative services das and the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction drc,received bids for the construction of the toledo correctional institution administration building.pursuant to the ohio minority business enterprise act mbea,ohio ann,the das and drc set aside bidding for the construction work for businesses mbes only.therefore,otherwise qualified were excluded from bidding on the project on racial grounds.
on september,associated general contractors of ohio and associated general contractors of northwest ohio collectively agc filed suit pursuant to against sandra drabik,director of the das,and reginald wilkenson,director of the drc collectively the state.agc alleged that its members,who are ohio building contractors,were denied the opportunity to bid on the construction project.agc challenged the constitutionality of the mbea,and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
the district court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits.on november,the court entered judgment in favor of agc,holding the mbea unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement.see associated contractors of ohio,drabik,no,wl,at.the judgment included a statement that agc was a prevailing party under,and that the court was exercising its discretion to award agc reasonable attorney fees and costs.see id.the state appealed the district court decision,and this court affirmed.see associated contractors of ohio,drabik,cir,cert.denied,d.
pursuant to stipulation and order of the district court,agc filed its application for attorney fees on january.during february and march,on three occasions,the district court granted the state motions for extensions of time to respond to agc fee application.then on april,the state moved for a stay of the district court decision regarding attorney fees pending the merits appeal.the district court denied the state motion on may.thereafter,the state filed its fourth motion for an extension of time to respond to agc fee application,and the court granted the motion.finally,on july,the state filed its response.
on october,the district court entered judgment granting agc motion for attorney fees in the amount of.on november,the state filed a notice of appeal from the district court judgment quantifying agc fee award.
on october,the state moved for a stay of enforcement of the attorney fee award pending appeal,and for approval of a supersedeas bond equal to the full amount of the award.on december,the district court granted the state motion,and ordered that the state post a bond or make a cash deposit with the clerk in the full amount of the judgment and accrued interest.subsequently,agc moved to clarify or amend the district court order of december,seeking interest on the attorney fee award from november,the date of the district court judgment awarding agc reasonable attorney fees.in its response to agc motion,the state argued that interest should accrue only from october,the date the attorney fee award was quantified.
on january,the district court granted agc motion to clarify its order of december.the district court held that interest on the attorney fees accrued from november,the date of the judgment on the merits.the state filed a timely notice of appeal

iii.discussion 
interest on attorney fees pursuant to a 
initially,we note that this court has never expressly decided the issue of whether an award of attorney fees awarded pursuant to accrues interest under a.section provides,in pertinent part interest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court such interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment a.most of our sister circuits have either expressly or impliedly concluded that the any money judgment provision of includes a judgment awarding attorney fees.see,eaves county of cape may,cir friend kolodzieczak,cir bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir midamerica fed.sav.loan express,cir foley city of lowell,cir jenkins state of missouri,cir fleming county of kane,cir mathis spears,copper liquor,adolph coors,cir en banc.we have found no cases rejecting this rule.
because we see no reason to distinguish between judgments for attorney fees and judgments for other types of damages,we also construe the term any money judgment as including a judgment awarding attorney fees.we agree with the first circuit that short of straining,the plain language of section a does not appear to permit a contrary result.foley,at.
we note that our resolution of this issue serves the underlying purpose of,which is to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss from the time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment by the defendant.kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d quoting poleto consol.rail,cir.because a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future,the only way a party can be made whole is to grant interest from the time of the award of fees.any other rule would effectively reduce the judgment for attorneys fees dalton,cir.moreover,awarding interest on a fee award serves the purpose of awarding such fees to the prevailing party,since it would more nearly compensate the victor for the expenses of the litigation.copper liquor,adolph coors,cir.
we also note that the award of interest on attorney fees is in no sense a windfall.defendants will suffer no actual prejudice or unfair burden by the accrual of interest,since they will have use of the money until payment,and the rate of interest,pursuant to a,is set at the treasury bill rate.see a.importantly,allowing an attorney fee award to bear interest will eliminate the losing party incentive to delay payment.see dalton,at.accordingly,we join our sister circuits in concluding that the phrase any money judgment in a includes a judgment awarding attorney fees.
timing of accrual of interest on attorney fees pursuant to a 
we now turn to the following issue whether an award of attorney fees accrues interest,pursuant to,from the date of the judgment that unconditionally entitles the prevailing party to reasonable attorney fees,or the date of the judgment quantifying that fee award.
agc contends,and the district court agreed,that attorney fees accrue interest from the date of the merits judgment that establishes the prevailing party unconditional entitlement to such fees.agc suggests that this is the better approach,and notes that several circuit and district courts have adopted this approach.agc argues that delaying the accrual of interest until determination of the fee amount would frustrate the underlying purpose for interest on fee awards,which is to compensate counsel for a successful effort.appellees br.at citing jenkins,at.
the state argues that,where the district court enters judgment stating that the prevailing party is entitled to a fee award,but does not quantify the amount of the award until a later date,interest does not begin to accrue pursuant to a until the court fixes the amount of the award.the state asserts that the supreme court,this circuit,and several other circuit courts have held that the monetary damages must be meaningfully ascertained before interest accrues pursuant to.appellants br.at.the state argues that an award of attorney fees must be quantified before it is meaningfully ascertained.
the issue of whether interest on attorney fees accrues,pursuant to a,from the judgment which unconditionally establishes a party right to attorney fees or from the judgment quantifying the award is one of first impression in this court.the circuit courts are split on this issue.compare eaves county of cape may,cir holding that interest is calculated from the date of judgment quantifying attorney fees midamerica fed.sav.loan express,cir same,with friend kolodzieczak,cir holding that interest is calculated from the date of judgment unconditionally entitling the prevailing party to attorney fees bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir same jenkins state of missouri,cir same mathis spears,same copper liquor,adolph coors,cir en banc same.
kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno 
because of the state and the third and tenth circuits reliance on the supreme court decision in kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d we start our discussion with that case.in bonjorno,the supreme court considered two issues relevant for our purposes,neither of which,however,involved the timing of interest accrual on an attorney fee award.first,the court addressed the issue of whether,pursuant to a,interest on damages should be calculated from the date of verdict or the date of the judgment.see id.at.at that time,there was a circuit split on the issue.see id.at.those courts that held interest accrued from the verdict based their decisions on the policy underlying the postjudgment interest of the plaintiff for loss of the use of the money id.the court concluded,however,that the plain language of,and the absence of legislative intent to the contrary,required that interest run from the date of the entry of judgment rather than the date of verdict.see id.at.
the second issue the court addressed was whether interest on damages should be calculated from the date of a judgment that was subsequently vacated as it was unsupported by the evidence.see id.at.the court discussion of this issue was brief.first,the court recognized that the purpose of postjudgment interest is to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss from the time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment of the defendant.id.at.quoting poleto consol.rail,cir.next,the court noted that w here the judgment on damages was not supported by the evidence,the damages have not been ascertained in a meaningful way.id.at.finally,the court asserted that it would be counterintuitive to believe that congress intended postjudgment interest to be calculated from a judgment on damages not supported by the evidence.id.at.based on the foregoing,the court concluded that interest should not be calculated from the date of a legally insufficient judgment.see id.
third and tenth circuit approach 
two of our sister circuits have concluded that interest on an attorney fee award accrues from the judgment quantifying the award see eaves county of cape may,cir midamerica federal sav.loan express,cir.these courts assert essentially two interrelated bases for their decision.first,they hold that interest accrues,pursuant to,only on a sum certain.see eaves,at midamerica,at.second,they suggest that the supreme court decision in borjorno dictates the conclusion that interest accrues only from a sum certain.see eaves,at midamerica,at.we address each of these conclusions in turn.
sum certain 
in eaves county of cape may,the third circuit concluded that,pursuant to a,interest on an attorney fee award runs from the date that the district court entered judgment quantifying the award,rather than the date the court enters a judgment that awards reasonable attorney fees.at the eaves court interpretation of the a term money judgment led it to conclude that a money judgment must be comprised of a definite and certain designation of the amount which plaintiff is owed by defendant.id.at quoting penn terra department of envtl,cir emphasis in original.
the eaves court based its conclusion regarding the proper interpretation of money judgment term on that court prior interpretation of the term enforcement of a money judgment found within the former b of the bankruptcy code see id.the eaves court adopted its unsupported statement in penn terra that a money judgment need only consist of two elements,one of which is a definite and certain designation of the amount which plaintiff is owed by defendant.id.at quoting penn terra,at.accordingly,the eaves court suggested that it was constrained to agree with the defendant that a simply does not permit interest on an attorney fee award to run from the date that the court initially determines that the prevailing party is entitled to an award if the amount was not also quantified and included in that judgment.id.at.
we are admittedly puzzled by the third circuit reliance on its penn terra decision when construing the term money judgment in a.in penn terra,the court was required to determine whether an action was an attempt to enforce a money judgment,and thus an exception to the exception to the automatic stay provision,a.at.the court noted that the provision should be construed narrowly so as to leave to the states as much of their police power as a fair reading of the statute allows.id.at emphasis in original.the court suggested a second reason to construe the term narrowly so as to give the states sufficient latitude in bringing actions that generally should not be stayed for reasons of either policy or practicality.id.therefore,we question the propriety of looking to penn terra for guidance in construing the any money judgment term of a in this context.moreover,the eaves court did not identify,in our opinion,any persuasive support for its contention that the term money judgment is commonly construed to require the determination of a sum certain in the context of an award of attorney fees 
like the eaves court,the tenth circuit found that interest on an attorney fee award runs from the date the district court entered judgment quantifying the award.see midamerica,at.the court found this rule consistent with the traditional notion that interest should not accrue on an unliquidated damage amount.id.at citing fleming county of kane,cir.the court did not,however,articulate why this traditional notion should apply in the context of an award of reasonable attorney fees.we note also that the seventh circuit case relied on by the midamerica court does not support its contention that there is such a traditional notion.
we respectfully decline to accept the third and tenth circuits assertions that,in the context of an award of attorney fees,the term money judgment is commonly understood to require an award of a fixed sum to the prevailing party.rather,our review of the cases addressing this issue demonstrates a general rule that a judgment that unconditionally entitles a party to reasonable attorney fees is the money judgment contemplated by.see,friend kolodzieczak,cir interpreting in the context of an attorney fee award louisiana power light kellstrom,cir same bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir same jenkins state of missouri,cir same mathis spears,same copper liquor,adolph coors,cir en banc same.we note that those few courts that hold a money judgment does not include a judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees do not offer any benefit for this narrow reading of,and we can see no benefit to reading in the quantification of fees requirement.
application of kaiser aluminum chemical bonjorno 
the third circuit in eaves also stated that its decision was dictated by the supreme court decision in bonjorno.at.the eaves court suggested that a district court judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees is the functional equivalent of the unliquidated liability verdict in bonjorno.id.at.noting that the supreme court rejected the argument that interest should run from the date of the verdict,the third circuit concluded that a party is not entitled to interest on an attorney fee award until that award is quantified and entered as part of a judgment.see id.the court relied to a large extent for this proposition,not on the supreme court decision,but rather on its own decision,subsequently reversed,in that same case.see id.at referring to bonjorno kaiser aluminum chem,cir.once again we note that the supreme court based its conclusion that interest did not run from a verdict on the plain language of a,which states that interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment.a emphasis added.
the midamerica court similarly asserted that the supreme court decision in bonjorno dictated the result it reached.the court stated that the rule that interest on attorney fees does not accrue until such fees are quantified was consistent with the bonjorno requirement that interest on any type of damages should not accrue until the damages are meaningfully ascertained.id.at quoting bonjorno,at.the midamerica court apparently interpreted the supreme court requirement that damages be ascertained in a meaningful way as a requirement that such damages be reduced to a sum certain.this interpretation overlooks the context of the supreme court application of that rule.the supreme court statement that damages must be ascertained in a meaningful way was made in the context of its discussion of whether,pursuant to,interest runs from the date of a vacated judgment that was unsupported by the evidence.we do not dispute that a judgment that is subsequently set aside is not ascertained in a meaningful way.see,skalka fernald envtl.restoration mgmt.corp,cir stating that interest runs from the date of any judgment that is not entirely set aside.but here,in contrast,we are dealing with a valid,final judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees.we believe that the rule permitting interest to run from the initial judgment awarding such fees comports with the supreme court requirement that damages be ascertained in a meaningful way prior to accruing interest.see louisiana power light kellstrom,cir bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir.
we note that the state has attempted to blur the line between the supreme court discussion of the issues it addressed in bonjorno.the supreme court discussion regarding the requirement that damages be ascertained in a meaningful way before accruing interest was part of its resolution of the issue of whether interest accrues on a vacated damages judgment,not,as the state represents as part of its resolution of the issue of whether interest accrues on a verdict or judgment.even a cursory glance of the supreme court bonjorno opinion would make clear that this is an inaccurate and misleading representation of that court discussion.
the distinction is important,we believe,because it makes clear that the supreme court was not stating that meaningfully ascertained means a sum certain in the context of an award of attorney fees.the court simply did not indicate that we must read into a requirement that an award of attorney fees as part of a final judgment on the merits must first be quantified prior to accruing interest.when a judgment is vacated it is legally void and unenforceable.a judgment,which has not been vacated or reversed,and which unconditionally awards reasonable attorney fees,is a valid and enforceable money judgment.as such,reasonable attorney fees are sufficiently ascertained.coal,gulf,cir.
we note that several of our sister circuits have concluded that bonjorno does not dictate the results reached in midamerica and eaves.see,louisiana power light kellstrom,cir holding that bonjorno did not overrule circuit precedent that interest accrues from the date of the judgment establishing the right to attorney fees bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir finding support in bonjorno for its conclusion that costs accrue interest from the date of the merits judgment that included an award of unquantified costs jenkins state of missouri,cir concluding that interest accrues from the judgment establishing a party unconditional right to attorney fees,and rejecting a claim that bonjorno dictated a different result.
despite the state assertions to the contrary,bonjorno and this court cases interpreting do not dictate the result it is seeking.this circuit has taken a approach when applying in different contexts after bonjorno.we have refused to narrowly construe this provision,but rather have resolved interpretation issues with due regard to equitable considerations where relevant.while we have remained faithful to the supreme court dictates in bonjorno,we have also ensured that the purpose of is served.we have applied kaiser to hold that interest runs from the date of the judgment that is not entirely set aside.skalka,at holding that plaintiffs are entitled to interest from the date of entry of an initial,partial unappealable judgment,rather than the final,appealable judgment disposing of all claims see also adkins asbestos,cir holding that interest properly runs from the date of judgment after remand,rather than vacated judgment coal,at holding that interest properly accrues from the date of the initial district court judgment,rather than from the date that the plaintiff consented to remittitur on remand arthur langenderfer,johnson,cir holding that interest does not properly accrue from the date of a vacated judgment.
the issue we address here,however,is unlike those addressed by the supreme court in bonjorno and the sixth circuit cases cited above.in none of those cases was an award of attorney fees at issue.rather,those cases addressed whether the plaintiff was entitled to interest on a money judgment that was subsequently vacated,reversed or in some way altered.in bonjorno,adkins,and johnson,a common sense approach was taken in interpreting a,and that approach led invariably to the conclusion that an award of damages unsupported by the evidence is not entitled to accrue interest,even though part of a money judgment.similarly,in coal resources,we concluded that even though the initial judgment was subsequently reduced by remittitur,interest ran from the initial judgment since damages had been sufficiently ascertained at that time.at.finally,in skalka,we construed the term judgment in a to include a partial,judgment,even though that interpretation was potentially burdensome to defendants.at.our precedent requires,then,that interest accrue on an award of damages from a judgment not entirely set aside on appeal.
here,the district court entered a final judgment on the merits that included an award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party pursuant to.this judgment was fully supported by the evidence.see associated contractors of ohio,drabik,cir,cert.denied,d.at the time the initial judgment was entered,the district court concluded that,in order to make agc whole,the state was required to pay agc reasonable attorney fees.there exists no reason,in either the language or history of,nor in binding precedent,that prevents this court from holding that interest accrues on an attorney fee award from the judgment which unconditionally entitles the prevailing party to such fees 
we believe that an award of interest on attorney fees running from the date of the judgment entitling the prevailing party to such fees,albeit unquantified,is consistent with the requirements of bonjorno.such interest would not accrue on an award of damages,including attorney fees,if later reversed.if the state had succeeded in its appeal on the merits,and the original judgment been vacated or reversed,agc would not be entitled to interest on attorney fees from the date of that judgment.however,since the district court judgment has been upheld on appeal,agc has been,since entry of judgment on the merits,entitled to its reasonable attorney fees.
copper liquor approach 
having concluded that a money judgment includes a judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees,and that bonjorno and the law of this circuit do not dictate the rule advanced by the state,we turn to those cases advanced by agc that conclude that attorney fees accrue interest from the date of the judgment unconditionally awarding such fees.we note that these cases both pre and bonjorno.
in copper liquor,adolph coors,the fifth circuit articulated a general rule to be applied in determining the relevant judgment for purposes of determining when interest begins to run on an award of attorney fees and costs to a victorious plaintiff,cir en banc.the court determined that t he relevant judgment for purposes of determining when interest begins to run on at
