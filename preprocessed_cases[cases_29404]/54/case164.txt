these are appeals by robert frank and lorin ahlers from their convictions and sentences.frank was convicted on counts,including mail fraud,conspiracy to defraud the united states,making false statements,obstruction of justice,and money laundering,and he was acquitted on two counts.he challenges the district court rulings concerning the admission of evidence,the denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial,a jury instruction,the calculation of the base offense level for his sentence,the assessment of an enhancement,and an upward adjustment imposed for his role in the offense.ahlers was convicted on nine counts,including wire fraud,conspiracy to defraud the united states,obstruction of justice,and money laundering,and he was acquitted on one count.he challenges the district court rulings concerning the admission of evidence,the denial of his pretrial motion to sever,the denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial,the calculation of the base offense level for his sentence,and the failure to grant his motion for a downward sentencing departure.we affirm the district court in all respects.
frank was convicted in federal court in for burning down the house of iowa district court judge thomas nelson,who had entered an adverse ruling against him.the indictment in the instant case charged frank and ahlers with devising and participating in a scheme to defraud the united states in relation to its efforts to collect a fine and restitution payments arising from that arson conviction.the government case against both defendants was premised largely upon the theory that they had agreed with others to hide frank assets from the government and to lie about the existence and ownership of those assets.
after the verdict was returned against them,both defendants filed motions for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure and alternatively for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.they contend that the district court erred in denying these motions because there was insufficient evidence to convict them of any offense.they argue generally that they committed no crimes because all of the assets that the government contends were owned by frank were actually owned by others,and thus there could not have been any false statements,fraud,obstruction,concealment,or money laundering regarding those assets.
in reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,giving the government the benefit of any reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.united states howard,cir.we reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.in reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial,we affirm a district court ruling absent a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.united states,cir.a new trial should be granted only if the evidence weighs heavily enough against the verdict that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.id.quoting united states rodriguez,cir.
viewing the evidence presented to the jury in the light most favorable to the government,we hold that it can not be said that a juror must have had a reasonable doubt as to any count of conviction,and we are unable to conclude that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.both defendants motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial were thus properly denied.
frank was convicted on counts of mail fraud in violation of.these convictions require proof that frank voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated in a scheme to defraud the united states by concealing his assets,that he entered into the scheme with the intent to defraud,that he knew that it was reasonably foreseeable that the mails would be used,and that he used the mails in furtherance of the scheme.see united states bearden,cir.
in,frank was released from prison on parole from his arson conviction.one of the conditions of his parole required him to make payments on the fine and restitution order imposed on him following his conviction.to aid in monitoring his ability to pay,he was required to submit monthly financial reports to the sentencing court probation office disclosing,inter alia,all employment that he engaged,income that he received,and vehicles that he owned during the relevant month.seventeen of frank mail fraud counts charged him with executing a scheme to defraud the united states,inhibiting its efforts to collect on the financial judgment,by mailing the probation office monthly financial reports that did not accurately reflect his assets and income.while frank reported virtually no assets or income on the financial reports,the government presented evidence that he in fact owned many motor vehicles and that he had significant income from work done for sproule construction and for kw sales a business that the government contends was created at the request of frank to hide his income from the government.after reviewing the evidence,we conclude that it was sufficient to sustain frank conviction on each of these counts.
three counts charged frank with mail fraud based upon three letters to the united states attorney office,each of which asserted that a man named irvin valentine did not have the money to pay a debt that he allegedly owed to frank.frank had earlier advised the government during a debtor examination that he had lent money to valentine,and the united states had thus initiated a garnishment action against valentine.valentine testified at trial,however,that there was no such debt.there was evidence that frank,prior to sending the letters,had bought cars using the money that he had falsely claimed to have lent to valentine.the mail fraud counts were based on the government contention that because of the letters sent by frank,it pursued the wrong avenue of collection and was impeded in its ability to garnish his income.frank concedes in his brief that the testimony of valentine that there was no such debt may preclude the granting of a judgment of acquittal,but he nevertheless asserts that a new trial is justified.we disagree with frank apparent position that,while a reasonable jury could have found him guilty on these counts beyond a reasonable doubt,the evidence relating to the letters weighs heavily enough against the verdict that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.
the final two mail fraud counts related to the use of the mail to transfer titles for a dakota truck and a cutlass automobile,both of which the government contends frank purchased out of state.frank,however,argues that there was no fraud involved in the transactions involving these vehicles,so there can be no fraud involved in sending the titles through the mail.
the cutlass was purchased under the name of cross creek stables,a body shop for used cars operated by john helm.helm testified that frank,who had been his friend for many years,had approached him and stated that h e needed to use my license to buy a few cars in order to m ake a little money.helm testified that,during this discussion,frank explained that he could get a license himself because he owed money,and that he c ould have no assets because the government would probably take all of his assets.the government presented evidence that frank had purchased the cutlass at an auction in wisconsin using the name of cross creek stables,and that the vehicle title was mailed to cross creek stables in iowa.helm testified that frank then asked him to register the car in iowa in his business name in exchange for one hundred dollars.in light of this evidence,frank argument that the car was purchased by cross creek stables and was never in frank name is beside the point.the transaction was fraudulent,according to the government theory,precisely because the title to the cutlass was never in frank name despite the fact that he was the real party in interest and that he was the one who purchased the car from the auction.
the government presented evidence that the dakota truck was purchased by frank in illinois,at which time frank falsely represented to the seller that he owned a car dealership named kw sales and that the sale was a transaction.the government evidence showed that the seller mailed the title to frank in iowa,pursuant to frank instructions,that frank then transferred title to kw sales,and that frank later sold the car and received.frank argues simply that the truck was purchased by kw sales and that t he title was in the name of kw sales.frank has failed,however,to discredit the government evidence that he fraudulently acquired and transferred title to the truck by falsely using the kw sales name.
both defendants were convicted on five counts of wire fraud in violation of.the essential elements of wire fraud are a scheme to defraud,the use of interstate wires incident to the scheme,and an intent to cause harm.united states frost,cir.according to the government,part of the defendants scheme to defraud the united states by concealing frank assets involved the sale of a corvette belonging to frank.ahlers sent five interstate that the government contends were in furtherance of this scheme.these contained factual misrepresentations and details about plans to conceal the source and identity of the proceeds from the sale of the corvette.after reviewing the content of these,we conclude that a reasonable jury viewing them could have determined that both defendants were guilty on the five counts of wire fraud beyond a reasonable doubt.
both defendants were convicted of obstructing justice in violation of.the count charged obstruction and aiding and abetting the obstruction of justice in relation to the administration,supervision,and execution of the financial obligations imposed on frank.the government provided evidence of several examples of such conduct,including evidence that the defendants planned with others to give false information to the grand jury,that frank had told an auto dealer to withhold information from investigators,that the defendants contacted another auto dealer who had had business dealings with frank during the grand jury investigation,and that the defendants conducted transactions in names other than frank to avoid the enforcement of the prior judgment against frank.this evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.
frank was convicted on a second count of obstructing justice in violation of for moving,concealing,and refusing to advise law enforcement agents of the location of a chrysler lebaron,for the purpose of obstructing justice and with the knowledge that a court order had been issued to seize the vehicle.relatedly,frank was convicted of removal of an asset to avoid seizure in violation of a for moving the lebaron before it was seized,with knowledge that there was a federal court order to seize the vehicle,for the purpose of inhibiting or impairing the government lawful authority to seize the vehicle.the government presented evidence that he moved the vehicle to the basement of a cottage in illinois after he had reason to know of a seizure order for the car,that he later moved the vehicle sixty miles away to the top of a bluff in wisconsin,and that,when asked by agents about the car,he became agitated and responded that he could not provide any help.in light of this evidence,we affirm the jury verdict with respect to these counts.
both defendants were convicted of money laundering in violation of a b i and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of h.the statute required the government to prove that each of the defendants conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction,knowing that the property involved in the transaction represented the proceeds of unlawful activity,and knowing the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of the unlawful activity.see a b i.the transaction at issue in the convictions was the sale and transfer of title to a corvette.the government presented evidence that frank and ahlers received five cashiers checks in exchange for the corvette,which checks were separately cashed at different banks,and that frank received the proceeds of the checks.the government contends that the funds involved represented the proceeds of mail fraud because neither the corvette nor the proceeds from its sale were reported on frank mailed monthly statements,wire fraud relating to the use of to sell the corvette,and obstruction of justice.the government evidence tended to show that the transaction was negotiated and structured so as to conceal or disguise the proceeds of the sale.the conspiracy count was based on evidence that the two defendants agreed to engage in the offense of money laundering,with respect to the corvette transaction and several other financial transactions involving the proceeds of fraud and obstruction.we conclude that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to convict both defendants on the and conspiracy counts.
finally,frank was convicted on sixteen counts of making false statements,based upon the monthly reports that he submitted to the probation office that were also at issue in seventeen of his mail fraud counts,and both defendants were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the united states,based upon their acting in agreement with each other,and others,to conceal frank assets and income.our examination of the record reveals no reason to conclude that a reasonable jury could not have returned guilty verdicts on these counts.
while he was in prison for the arson conviction,frank wrote letters to his mother in which he directed that certain actions be taken with regard to assets that the government contends frank owned and had concealed from the government at the time of his arson conviction and that frank contends he had legally transferred to others before the arson conviction.both defendants argue that the district court erred in allowing these letters into evidence.they contend that the letters were either irrelevant or that,to the extent that they had relevance,their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,see.the government contends that the letters were relevant to the issue of whether frank continued to own or have a financial interest in assets that he had denied belonged to him.
the letters clearly had some relevance to issues concerning concealment or intent to defraud and the existence of a longstanding plan to hide and refuse to disclose assets that frank was obligated to report to the government.furthermore,any unfair prejudice presented by the letters was minimized by their redaction,to the satisfaction of frank and ahlers,to remove any reference to arson or criminal case or parole or anything having to do with the prior criminal matter.we thus hold that the district court did not err in admitting frank letters.
ahlers contends that the district court erred in allowing him and frank to be tried together.although ahlers filed a pretrial motion for severance,he did not renew the motion at the close of the government case or at the close of all of the evidence,and we thus review the denial of the motion for plain error.see united states mathison,cir,cert.denied,d.to succeed on review of the denial of the motion to sever,ahlers must show an abuse of discretion by the trial court as well as prejudice affecting his substantial rights and an extraordinary reason to reverse.id.quoting united states rogers,cir,cert.denied,d.we conclude,for the reasons that follow,that the evidence of prejudice and abuse of discretion adduced here by ahlers has not met this heavy burden.
in counts,and of the first indictment,and both counts of the second indictment,frank was the only defendant.in counts,and of the first indictment,both defendants were charged.thus,while frank was indicted on more counts than ahlers was,ahlers was not charged with any counts that frank was not also charged with.all counts were tried together over the course of a trial.
rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure allows a district court to grant a severance of defendants if it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder.see.a.the united states supreme court has noted that the joinder and severance rules are designed to promote economy and efficiency and to avoid a multiplicity of trials,so long as these objectives can be achieved without substantial prejudice to the right of the defendants to a fair trial.zafiro united states,d internal quotations omitted.
we have noted that generally defendants charged in a conspiracy should be tried together,particularly where proof of the charges against the defendants is based upon the same evidence and acts.united states boyd,cir,cert.denied,d.a district court may depart from this general rule by granting a severance only upon defendant showing of real prejudice,which may be demonstrated by showing either that the defendants defenses are irreconcilable or that the jury will be unable to compartmentalize the evidence as it relates to the separate defendants.united states washington,cir,cert.denied,d.
ahlers does not argue that his defense was irreconcilable with frank he argues only that the jury could not compartmentalize the extensive evidence offered against frank from the evidence offered against him.according to ahlers,he was prejudiced at the long and drawn out multiple count trial by certain testimony relating to the counts involving frank but not him.ahlers argues that in the jury eyes,if frank was guilty of all these offenses and had association with ahlers,then ahlers must also be guilty on things that were alleged that they did in concert.
ahlers reliance on united states baker,cir,cert.denied,d,is misplaced.in baker,where evidence not admissible against the defendant seeking severance,yet implicating him in the crime for which he was convicted,came in through the case against the,we concluded that it was the rare case in which severance should have been granted.id.at.here,in contrast,ahlers concedes in his brief that the evidence at issue that was presented against frank had absolutely nothing to do with ahlers.the risk of prejudice here is thus much more speculative than it was in baker.
in assessing the jury ability to compartmentalize the evidence against joint defendants,we consider the complexity of the case,whether any of the defendants was acquitted,and the adequacy of the jury instructions and admonitions to the jury.united states ghant,cir.though there were a large number of counts in this case,all of them were connected by the government theory that frank and ahlers were engaged in a plan of hiding and lying about assets,and the defendants theory of defense was common to all counts.the district court clearly and extensively instructed the jury,both at the beginning and the end of trial,to view the case of each separately,and there is nothing to suggest that the jury did not do so.in fact,neither of the defendants was convicted on all counts,and on one of the counts,frank was convicted while ahlers was acquitted,which is a good indication that the jury made efforts to compartmentalize the evidence against each defendant.ahlers has failed to show an abuse of discretion by the district court,prejudice affecting his substantial rights,and an extraordinary reason to reverse.
frank was convicted of obstructing justice in relation to the government attempt to seize a chrysler lebaron pursuant to a court order.he contends that a jury instruction related to this count was erroneous because it did not require commission of an overt act to convict him on the charge of obstruction of justice,as he argues requires.a district court has wide discretion in formulating a jury instruction.united states darden,cir,cert.denied,d,d.if the instructions,taken as a whole,fairly and adequately submitted the issues to the jury,we will affirm.united states lalley,cir.
the jury instruction that frank challenged read as follows 
count of the second indictment charges defendant,robert frank,with the crime of obstruction of justice.that crime has three essential elements,which are 
one,defendant robert frank moved,concealed and refused to advise federal law enforcement agents of the whereabouts of a vehicle which they were authorized by federal court order to seize 
two,defendant knew that a court order had been issued for the seizure of the vehicle 
three,by moving,concealing,and refusing to advise federal law enforcement of the whereabouts of the vehicle,defendant corruptly endeavored to obstruct the due administration of justice in connection with the efforts of the united states to seize the vehicle and to partially satisfy the judgment imposed in the case of united states of america robert frank.
endeavor means any effort or any act or attempt to effectuate an arrangement or to try to do something,the natural and probable consequences of which is to influence,obstruct or impede the due administration of justice.
corruptly means that a defendant acted with an improper or evil motive or with the purpose of obstructing the due administration of justice.
for you to find defendant frank guilty of the charged offense,the government must prove each of the three essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt otherwise you must find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense.
at trial,frank objected to the third element of the instruction,while he now objects to the first element though the language in the first element that he now challenges is substantially similar to the language in the third element that he objected to at trial.the government contends that frank has waived his right to challenge the instruction first element on appeal because,by failing to object to it at trial,he failed to satisfy the requirement of federal rule of criminal procedure d that an objecting party inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.assuming for the sake of argument that frank has not waived his right to object,he has failed to show that the district court erred in its instruction to the jury.
frank argues that t he issue here is whether requires some overt act to obstruct justice,not just a failure to do something.we see no need to consider the issue that frank poses because the instruction,viewed in its entirety,clearly requires the commission of an overt act as opposed to a mere failure to do something.the instruction required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that frank corruptly endeavored to obstruct justice.as the definitional section of the instruction states,the government was thus required to prove that frank acted with an improper or evil motive and engaged in any effort or any act or attempt to effectuate an arrangement or to try to do something.the language that frank now challenges refused to advise was,moreover,specifically changed from failed to advise at frank request.a refusal is itself an overt act that the government was required to prove pursuant to the instruction as a part of its showing that frank corruptly endeavored to obstruct justice.furthermore,moving and concealing,which are both required in addition to refusing to advise,are themselves overt acts,neither of which can be accomplished by merely failing to do anything.frank argument that the jury instruction permits conviction for a mere failure to do something in the absence of an overt act is without merit.
the district court increased frank offense level pursuant to of the united states sentencing guidelines.this section requires a enhancement if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.under this section,the defendant is accountable for his own conduct and for conduct that he aided or abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused,comment.the commentary to the sentencing guideline provides a list of examples of the types of conduct that will support an enhancement,which includes not only committing perjury but also suborning perjury,producing or attempting to produce a false record during an official investigation or judicial proceeding,and other conduct prohibited by the provisions of the united states code.see,comment.b,c,i.
frank contends that the court erred in imposing an enhancement for obstruction of justice because the court did not specifically find that he committed perjury and because the other grounds relied upon for the enhancement inhered in the allegations of fraud,money laundering,and false statements themselves.we review the imposition of the enhancement for clear error.united states orchard,cir.we extend great deference to the district court decision to grant an enhancement for obstruction of justice.united states,cir per curiam.
the united states supreme court,in interpreting the sentencing guidelines provision at issue here,has stated that if an accused challenges a sentence increase based on perjured testimony,the trial court must make findings to support all the elements of a perjury violation in the specific case.united states dunnigan,d.the commentary to,however,provides that committing perjury is but one example of a broad range of conduct that will trigger the enhancement.here,the district court stated that the sentencing enhancement was based upon something other than a finding of perjury,namely,a combination of the fact that frank told something other than the complete truth during his testimony and the facts contained in paragraph of frank presentence investigation report.paragraph provided the following reasons for granting the enhancement frank encouraged kimberly welch and jackie schoenauer to give false testimony to the grand jury and they did so frank told dave weber not to disclose any information concerning some vehicles that frank had given to weber to sell frank gave materially false trial testimony,which was rejected by the jury frank made false oral and written statements to the government concerning his assets several times during the investigation of the instant offenses and frank took steps to conceal assets that were the subject of the investigation.
because the district court made the factual findings that frank committed most of the obstructive conduct described in paragraph,it was required to apply the enhancement,whether or not its finding that frank told something other than the complete truth would independently support the enhancement.any error that the district court may have made by basing the enhancement,in part,on frank failure to tell the complete truth during his testimony is thus harmless,as the court also made findings of fact that themselves would have required imposition of the enhancement.
frank maintains that obstruction of justice inhered in the charges of fraud,money laundering,and false statements themselves and that granting an upward adjustment thus amounted to double counting.he contends that his situation is comparable to that of the defendant in united states werlinger,cir,who had been convicted on a single count of embezzlement.we held that werlinger attempt to conceal his embezzlement prior to an fbi investigation of the crime was part of the embezzlement itself and thus could not be used to establish willful obstruction of justice for purposes of enhancing his sentence under.id.at.as explained below,however,frank situation is distinguishable from that of werlinger because he was convicted on multiple counts that were grouped together for sentencing purposes.
section of the sentencing guidelines directs that when a defendant has been convicted on more than one count,groups of closely related counts should be formed by applying rules found in.see a.in frank case,all of his counts of conviction were grouped together to form a single group pursuant to b because,according to frank presentence investigation report,each of the offenses of conviction involved the same victim,society and the offenses are connected by a common criminal objective or constitute part of a common scheme or plan.section a directs that in the case of counts grouped together pursuant to b,the offense level applicable to the group is the offense level for the most serious of the counts comprising the group,the highest offense level of the counts in the group.in frank case,the district court found that the sentencing guideline corresponding to the and conspiracy offenses,as charged in counts and of the first indictment,produced the highest offense level.thus,under the grouping rules,frank convictions on the counts other than the two offenses were disregarded in calculating the adjusted offense level.
among the counts that frank was convicted on were two counts of obstruction of justice.application note to of the sentencing guidelines provides the following procedure for such a situation if the defendant is convicted both of an obstruction offense and an underlying offense,the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense under subsection c of the offense level for that group of closely related counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the adjustment specified by this section,or the offense level for the obstruction offense,whichever is greater.in accordance with this procedure,the obstruction adjustment was applied to the convictions.
the obstruction adjustment applies to any obstructive conduct in respect to the official investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense where there is a separate count of conviction for such conduct,comment.as we have stated,a defendant separate count of conviction for obstructive conduct is a sufficient foundation for the enhancement.united states herr,cir quoting united states olunloyo,cir alteration in original.the jury convicted frank on the two counts based on the evidence presented by the government that frank obstructed justice in multiple ways,which were summarized in paragraph of frank presentence investigation report as noted above.much of the obstructive conduct that the government provided evidence of at trial was conduct that did not provide the basis for frank two convictions.the conduct underlying the convictions overlapped with,but went well beyond,the conduct underlying the convictions.the imposition of the obstruction adjustment is not an impermissible double counting because the district court expressly identified obstructive conduct unrelated to the conduct underlying the convictions,and the adjustment would have been identical had the conduct on which it was premised not included any of the obstruction of justice inherent in the money laundering.the district court did not err in imposing the adjustment for obstruction of justice pursuant to the grouping rules set forth in the sentencing guidelines.
the district court increased frank offense level pursuant to a of the sentencing guidelines,which is applicable when a defendant is an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.we review the district court decision to assess a sentencing enhancement based upon a defendant role in the offense for clear error,and the government has the burden to prove that such an increase is warranted.united states johnson,cir,cert.denied,d.frank does not challenge the district court finding that the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,but he contends that the district court erred by finding that he was an organizer or leader.
we have interpreted the terms organizer and leader rather broadly.united states miller,cir.application note of lists several matters that a court should consider in determining whether a defendant was an organizer or leader the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.the presentence investigation report had recommended the enhancement because the evidence showed that there were more than five individuals involved,that frank played a leadership role in directing the activities of others as part of his criminal conduct,and that he received a greater share of the proceeds from his criminal activity,and the district court adopted these fi
