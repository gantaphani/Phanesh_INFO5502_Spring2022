coverage for diagnosis and treatment of infertility at payment rate,benefit payments to during a calendar year.the calendar year deductible is waived.coverage does not include laboratory medical procedures involving the actual in vitro fertilization process.insurance code section health and safety code section cost single family boldface omitted.
westmont college declined to buy coverage for infertility treatment.one factor in the college decision was the coverage high price.
appellant could not become pregnant without medical assistance.able to afford only limited infertility treatment that proved ineffective,appellant sued blue cross in,alleging causes of action for unfair competition and false advertising bus.appellant sought recovery of her expenses for the infertility treatment she received above blue cross annual limit,and for her pain and suffering from losing her chance to bear a child.
blue cross moved for summary judgment.it argued it had complied with health and safety code section by offering coverage for infertility treatment.the motion disputed appellant contention that section obligated blue cross to provide a certain amount of coverage at a particular premium.according to blue cross,section left the amount and cost of coverage to negotiation between blue cross and westmont college.agreeing with blue cross,the court entered summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.this appeal followed 
discussion 
section obligated blue cross to offer coverage for treatment of infertility.the statute provides 
a every health care service plan contract shall offer coverage for the treatment of infertility under those terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the group subscriber and the plan b for purposes of this section treatment for infertility means procedures consistent with established medical practices in the treatment of infertility by licensed physicians and surgeons including,but not limited to,diagnosis,diagnostic tests,medication,surgery,and gamete intrafallopian transfer.
appellant contends westmont college health plan with blue cross violates section.we disagree.section obligates blue cross to offer coverage for infertility treatment,and leaves to blue cross and westmont college mutual agreement the amount and cost of that plan shall offer coverage as may be agreed upon,subd.a.blue cross complied with the statute by offering such coverage,which the college declined 
appellant contends blue cross did not comply with section because the policy in annual benefits was not enough to address a typical plan member infertility.according to appellant,only about percent of couples suffering infertility can be successfully treated for less than the plan annual cap on benefits plus the patient percent copayment.some infertility therapies cost,according to appellant,nearly to succeed.a annual benefit,she argues,is akin to an insurer pretending to provide full coverage against earthquake damage to a building by offering a benefit of only.appellant might be correct that in earthquake coverage,or dollars for infertility treatment,does not provide full coverage,but nowhere does section state the coverage that the parties negotiate must be full.nevertheless,appellant suggests blue cross must cover the entire cost of appellant infertility treatment to comply with the statute.she states 
a benefit of per year can not constitute coverage for treatment for infertility within the meaning of the statute because is usually insufficient to diagnose,let alone provide all established medical treatment procedures for,infertility used by licensed physicians and surgeons.
her argument for full coverage finds no support in the statute language,and it is the statutory language which we must follow.
appellant alternatively contends the policy must cover treatment for infertility on the same terms and conditions as other medical conditions covered by the plan,without for example lower or higher and deductibles.she argues the limit and percent copayment are not close to the terms that blue cross applies to other medical conditions in westmont college plan.blue cross proposed coverage for treatment of infertility therefore,according to appellant,does not satisfy the statutory mandate that blue cross treat infertility the same as other bodily dysfunctions.
to support her demand for greater coverage,appellant ignores statutory language that says blue cross need only offer coverage under terms and conditions to which westmont college and blue cross agree.reaching beyond the statute language,she drags forward the uncodified preamble to section which recites the legislature findings in passing the legislation.citing the preamble,she contends the policy coverage for treatment of infertility and all other medical conditions must be the same because the preamble states 
the legislature finds and declares the following infertility is a medical illness or condition similar to other illnesses or conditions that is created by the malfunction of other bodily organs,and thus is no different than other illnesses of conditions and should be treated for purposes of insurance the same as any other body d y sfunction.insurance coverage for infertility is uneven,inconsistent,and frequently subject to arbitrary decisions which are not based on legitimate medical considerations.stats,ch.
legislative findings and statements of purpose in a statute preamble can be illuminating if a statute is ambiguous briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.but a preamble is not binding in the interpretation of the statute.moreover,the preamble may not overturn the statute language.id.at,d,peralta community college dist.fair employment housing com.cal d.here,no ambiguity exists in the statute to help appellant the statute obligates blue cross to offer coverage,and blue cross did so.the legislature refusal to dictate the amount of coverage and its cost is not is silence.we may not make a silent statute speak by inserting language the legislature did not put in the legislation.camarena state personnel bd.th,d.
the legislature knows how to establish a health plan coverage and costs when it chooses.for example,in,it enacted a mental health insurance mandate.the mandate obligated health plans to provide coverage not merely offer it for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness equal to coverage that the plans applied to other medical conditions the statute dictated that the terms and conditions of coverage that shall be applied equally to all benefits under the plan contract,shall include,but not be limited to,the following maximum lifetime benefits.copayments.individual and family deductibles,subd.c.
