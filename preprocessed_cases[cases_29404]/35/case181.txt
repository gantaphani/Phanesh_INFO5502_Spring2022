introduction 
appellants people for the ethical treatment of animals,and john robbins referred to collectively as peta appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained demurrers without leave to amend filed by respondent california milk producers advisory board cmab to peta amended complaint.peta sued cmab,inter alia,claiming its happy cows advertising campaign violated california unfair business practices act ucl business and professions code sections et,because the advertisements were false and deceptive.the trial court sustained the demurrers after concluding cmab was not a person as defined by the ucl and,thus,the state board was not subject to suit under that remedial statutory scheme.
we agree with the trial court that public entities,including cmab,are not persons who are subject to suit under the ucl and,therefore,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
peta operative complaint was filed on december,and included three separate causes of action arising out of the same alleged facts.the sole remedy sought by the complaint was injunctive relief.the complaint names only the cmab as a defendant and alleges it to be a n agricultural advisory board,created by a marketing order issued by the california department of food and agriculture.marketing order advisory boards are administrative instrumentalities of the california secretary of food and agriculture the secretary and have no independent ability to implement policy or other actions without the approval of the secretary.food.among the cmab functions is the power and duty,subject to the secretary approval,to recommend promotional programs.cal.of food and,marketing branch,marketing order for research,education,and promotion of market milk and dairy products in,eff,incorporating amendments through,art.ii,milk marketing order see also food.in this regard,it was noted in gallo cattle california milk advisory bd.cir,that s ince its formation,cmab has conducted an integrated program for the promotion of milk and dairy products which includes advertising,merchandising,public relations,education and research.cmab spends the majority of its annual budget promoting dairy products made from raw milk such as fluid milk,cream,butter,cottage cheese,yogurt,cheese and ice cream.in doing so,cmab attempts to increase the demand for milk produced by the california dairy farmers.
the complaint alleges that for approximately the last two years,the cmab has been engaged in an advertising program known as the happy cows campaign,which peta contends is explicitly and implicitly untrue,deceptive,and misleading.it will suffice for this appeal to refer to the complaint introductory statement for a description of the nature of the alleged misrepresentations contained in cmab advertisements 
this is a complaint seeking a permanent injunction against the defendants to prevent ongoing deceptive advertising practices in the false representations of the california dairy industry made in its happy cows advertisements.the theme of these advertisements is to portray spacious,grassy pastures on beautiful,rolling hills with a few cows grazing and wandering about and enjoying the ease,luxury,and contentment of life as a dairy cow in california.the tag line for each of the ads is great cheese comes from happy cows.happy cows come from california.in reality,however,the vast majority of california dairy cows live anything but easy,comfortable lives.they routinely spend their lives in dry lots of grassless dirt which become and remain mud throughout some months of the year,in sharp contrast to the fictional,idyllic setting of the ads.they are repeatedly impregnated and then milked throughout their pregnancies.their calves are taken away shortly after birth,many of whom are then condemned to veal crates.they commonly suffer from painful maladies from their intensive rearing.and when their worn bodies can no longer meet the inordinately high production demands of the industry,they are slaughtered.while plaintiffs do not ask the court to rule on whether california cows are truly happy,the nature of this complaint is that the conditions under which most california dairy cows are kept are so materially different in a way that matters to,and misleads,consumers than those depicted in the ads as to render them unlawfully deceptive and,therefore,subject to injunctive relief under california law.
the complaint first cause of action alleges cmab happy cows campaign violates california prohibition against false and deceptive business advertising et,while the third cause of action alleges the advertisements violate a specific form of prohibited false advertisements,those associated with environmental misrepresentations.et the second cause of action was brought under the general provisions of the ucl.et as noted,peta sought injunctive relief only.
demurrers were filed by cmab in response to the complaint raising two principal legal objections to each of the three causes of action first,cmab contended that it was not a person as defined by the false advertising and ucl statutes,and thus it could not be sued for alleged violations of those statutory prohibitions.second,it demurred on the additional ground that the cmab lacked the legal capacity to sue and be sued,and thus,there was a misjoinder of parties.
the trial court sustained the demurrers on the first ground asserted that is,based on the conclusion that cmab was not within the statutory definition of entities which could be sued under the ucl consumer remedy regimes.in so ruling,the trial court relied principally,although not exclusively,on california medical regents of university of california th,d california medical 
the standard by which we review the trial court decision to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.citation.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,palm springs tennis club rangel th,d.
