opinion of the court 
pernod ricard usa,llc pernod appeals the decision of the united states district court for the district of delaware that the label of havana club brand rum,a rum sold in the united states by bacardi,bacardi,is not a false advertisement of the rum geographic origin under section a b of the lanham act,a b.because we agree with the district court that no reasonable interpretation of the label as a whole could lead to the conclusion that it is false or misleading,we will affirm.
background 
a.the original havana club rum and its trademark 
this case is the latest battle in a lengthy war between pernod and bacardi,two multinational distilleries,over the use of the words havana club to sell rum in the united states.though the convoluted history of the conflict has been recounted at length elsewhere,a portion of it requires retelling 
before the start of the cuban revolution,the arechabala family produced havana club brand rum in cuba,sold it locally,and exported it for sale in the united states.in,following the communist revolution in cuba,the cuban government expropriated the arechabalas business without compensation.three years later,the united states began to enforce a trade embargo against cuba.the embargo,which continues to this day,generally prevents the importation of cuban goods and is administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac.despite the embargo,the cuban government in,through a company called cubaexport,managed to register with the united states patent and trademark office uspto the words havana club as a trademark for use in connection with rum.in,through a series of transfers,the cuban government assigned its claimed interests in the arechabala family old business to a joint venture the jv,of which pernod ricard,pernod parent corporation,is a member that transfer included the uspto registration for the havana club mark,and,in,ofac specifically approved the transfer of the trademark to the jv.however,in,ofac retroactively revoked its permission for that transfer.the mark then remained registered to cubaexport until july,when the registration expired after ofac denied permission for renewal of the mark.
bacardi sales of havana club brand rum 
in,bacardi filed a federal trademark application for use of the havana club mark on rum in the united states and,for a short time in,bacardi imported from the bahamas and sold in this country a nominal amount of rum labeled with that mark.soon after those limited sales,the jv filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to enjoin bacardi use of the havana club trademark.while that action was pending,bacardi purchased from the arechabala family any remaining rights they might have had to the havana club mark and the related goodwill of the business,along with any rum business assets the family owned.later,following ofac revocation of permission for the transfer of the havana club mark to the jv in,the jv case against bacardi was dismissed.see havana club holding,galleon,cir.
in august,just days after cubaexport federal trademark registration of havana club expired,bacardi began selling rum in florida using havana club as the brand name.the rum was distilled in puerto rico and was made using the arechabala family recipe bacardi took three years to develop the product,due to regulatory and production requirements,and,according to a member of the arechabala family,it turned out to be almost identical to the original havana club rum made by the family in cuba.the bottle in which bacardi rum was sold appears below.
on the front of the bottle,the phrase havana club appears in large stylized letters,followed by the word brand in much smaller letters.below that,in letters of prominent though slightly smaller size than those in the brand name and in a different font,the words puerto rican rum appear.beneath that,in smaller letters and different color ink,the label says havana club rum.the words havana club are also repeated several times around the neck of the bottle.the back of the bottle includes a statement in clearly legible type that reads as follows 
havana club rum is a premium rum distilled and crafted in puerto rico using the original arechabala family recipe.developed in cuba circa,this finely crafted spirit uses black strap molasses,a slow fermentation process,five times distillation and white oak mellowing to create a velvet smoothness that is clean and round to the palate.
the words havana club rum and the web address also appear on the back of the bottle above a health warning,which is followed by a number containing the letters havana and,in small print,the phrases produced by havana club,san juan,and havana club is a trademark.
c.the instant case 
in,shortly after bacardi began its sales of the havana club rum made in puerto rico,pernod filed this false advertising suit under section a b of the lanham act,asserting that the labeling of bacardi bottle,particularly the use of the words havana club,misleads consumers to believe that the rum is produced in cuba.at the conclusion of a bench trial,in which pernod presented unrebutted survey evidence that approximately eighteen percent of consumers who looked at the havana club rum bottle were left thinking that the rum was made in cuba or from cuban ingredients the district court ruled in favor of bacardi.the court found that the havana club brand name reflected the cuban heritage of the rum recipe.according to the court,bacardi has a first amendment right to accurately portray where its product was historically made and,therefore,plaintiff can not demonstrate that defendant use of havana club violates the lanham act.app.at.the district court also said that,because the havana club label clearly and truthfully provides the origin of bacardi rum,and is not deceptive app.at,there was no need to analyze actual or likely consumer deception app.at.the district court thus bypassed pernod survey evidence,holding that a court is permitted to find,as a matter of law,that no reasonable consumer could be misled by the challenged advertising.app.at.
pernod timely appealed the district court decision on the sole ground that the court erroneously failed to consider the survey evidence presented by pernod.
it appears that this false advertising dispute is a proxy for the real fight the parties want to have,which is over the right to the exclusive use of havana club as a trademark.under the peculiar circumstances of the cuban trade embargo and the attendant denial of an opportunity to register and protect havana club as a mark for rum in the united states,pernod has turned to the false advertising provision of the lanham act,a b section a b provides in pertinent part 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
b in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
to establish a false advertising claim under the lanham act,a plaintiff must prove 
that the defendant has made false or misleading statements as to his own product or another that there is actual deception or at least a tendency to deceive a substantial portion of the intended audience that the deception is material in that it is likely to influence purchasing decisions that the advertised goods traveled in interstate commerce and that there is a likelihood of injury to the plaintiff in terms of declining sales,loss of good will.

pernod submitted a consumer survey at the trial and asserts that the district court was required to consider it when determining if bacardi havana club label amounted to a misleading statement of geographic origin.according to pernod,r esolution of the pivotal legal question of whether an advertisement,like bacardi usa label,implies an inaccurate message to a sufficient number of consumers virtually demands survey research because it centers on consumer perception and memory.appellant op g br.at quoting fed.judicial,reference manual on scientific evidence ed.bacardi responds,in line with the district court reasoning,that the initial step in analyzing a statement challenged as false advertising is to determine what message is conveyed.appellee ans g br.at quoting united states healthcare,blue cross of greater,cir.and,bacardi emphasizes,our precedent provides that s ometimes this determination may be made from the advertisement on its face.id.quoting united states healthcare,at.
to address the competing arguments before us,we must first consider the district court reasoning in greater detail.the court admitted pernod survey evidence but decided at step one of the analytical process that no false or misleading statement was made,so no survey evidence was needed.indeed,the court questioned whether havana club is even an actionable statement under a b because i t is not that it is a statement of fact capable of being proven false.app.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.havana club is,said the court,not the same as made in havana or even havana rum,such as would impart a specific,verifiable claim.id.but,assuming for the sake of analysis that the words havana club do constitute an actionable statement,the court turned to what it saw as the unique question presented by this case,namely,is geographic origin more akin to heritage or to the source of production id.at.
after considering the development of the right of action arising from a false designation of origin and exploring the meaning of origin,the district court discounted the relevance of the precedents it had just reviewed.it drew a distinction between a a,which is the subsection of a that is focused on trademarks and,more generally,unfair competition,and a b,which is the subsection at issue here and addresses false advertising.section a a forbids,among other things,false or misleading representations that may deceive consumers about the origin of goods or services,while a b forbids false or misleading representations as to the geographic origin of goods and services.in light of the addition of the modifier geographic to the word origin in a b,the district court considered authority regarding a a to be not particularly instructive on the meaning of geographical origin as used in a b.app.at.
the court acknowledged that the supreme court has held in a a a case that origin refers to the producer of the tangible goods that are offered for sale,and not the author of any idea,concept,or communication embodied in those goods.dastar twentieth century fox film.a pplying that focus to the interpretation of geographical origin,the district court said,would implicate the place of manufacture,rather than the source of that product recipe or its heritage.app.at.nevertheless,relying on a decision of the trademark trial and appeal board ttab,an administrative tribunal in the uspto,the court considered it plausible that the term geographic origin in the false advertising context may be broad enough to embody a product heritage,including its history and recipe.id.citing corporacion habanos,anncas,a product may be found to originate from a place,even though the product is manufactured elsewhere.but,according to the reasoning of the district court,regardless of whether one considered geographic origin as simply a question of where something is made or,instead,took the broader heritage approach to the question of geographic origin,pernod claim failed,and it did so for reasons that made survey evidence irrelevant.
as to the place of manufacture,the court was persuaded that t he havana club label clearly and truthfully provides the origin of defendant rum,and is not deceptive.app.at.the label proclaims the contents of the bottle to be puerto rican rum and specifically says the rum is distilled and crafted in puerto rico.app.at.the district court saw no room for deception in that quoting the decision of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in mead johnson abbott,cir,amended on denial of reh g,cir per curium the district court said,survey research does not determine the meaning of words or set the standard to which objectively verifiable claims must be held.app.at.
turning to the question of heritage,the court declared that havana club rum has a cuban heritage and,therefore,depicting such a heritage is not deceptive.app.at.under this broader interpretation of the term geographic origin,pernod survey evidence was necessarily irrelevant,in the court view,because bacardi should have a first amendment right to accurately portray where its rum was historically made as opposed to claiming that the product is still made there.id.at.the court found it particularly important that bacardi havana club rum is based on the arechabala family original havana club recipe.
while we may not agree with every aspect of the foregoing analysis we are persuaded that the district court carefully reasoned opinion reaches the right result on the particular facts of this case.more specifically,we conclude,as did the district court,that the havana club label,taken as a whole,could not mislead any reasonable consumer about where bacardi rum is made,which means that survey evidence has no helpful part to play on the question of what the label communicates regarding geographic origin.
the central conceptual problem before us is whether language can be clear enough that its meaning is beyond reasonable dispute.pernod is of course correct that the issue in false advertising cases is whether an advertisement,like bacardi label,implies an inaccurate message appellant op g br.at.that is somewhat of a tautology,but pernod choice of the word implies is apt because it rightly indicates that the words themselves have meaning beyond the subjective inferences of any individual reader or listener.words,malleable though they may be over time,must still,of necessity,be repositories of commonly accepted meaning at any given point in time.were it otherwise,ordinary discourse would be impossible.
while they lack the precision of numbers,words must,as nearly as possible,be accorded an objectively reasonable meaning if law is to have any fair claim as an instrument of justice.proof of that is found throughout the law.see,wilson quadramed,cir holding that we read the federal debt collection practices act to protect the least sophisticated consumer,which includes the gullible as well as the shrewd,because the act is a consumer protection law,but we preserv e a quotient of reasonableness and presum e a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care quoting united states fin,cir internal quotation marks omitted victor nebraska,when reviewing a jury instruction that defines reasonable doubt,it is necessary to consider the instruction as a whole and to give the words their common and ordinary meaning.citing estelle mcguire,u,old colony comm r,in interpreting statutory language,the plain,obvious and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious,narrow,hidden sense internal quotation marks omitted karedes ackerley,cir c ourts must give the disputed language a fair reading in the context of the publication as a whole.challenged statements are not to be read in isolation,but must be perused as the average reader would against the whole apparent scope and intent of the writing and that i t is the meaning reasonably attributable to the intended reader that controls.emphasis added and removed hatfill new york times,cir applying a reasonable reader standard under virginia law to a motion to dismiss a defamation claim temme bemis,cir a contract meaning is a matter of law where there is no contractual ambiguity,there is no need for extrinsic evidence and no factual dispute that precludes summary judgment.when interpreting contracts,terms are given their ordinary and popular meaning internal citations omitted united paperworkers int l union misco,u,arbitrator applying collective bargaining agreement can not ignore the plain language of the contract.
while most of these examples are from areas of law that do not require,as does the law of false advertising,a studied effort to understand what words mean from the perspective of members of the consuming public,they do show that there is and must be a point at which language is used plainly enough that the question ceases to be what does this mean and becomes instead now that it is clear what this means,what is the legal consequence.
the mead johnson decision demonstrates the principle.in that case,the seventh circuit considered whether the phrase choice of doctors could be misleading.the court acknowledged that,in the context of a false advertising case,whether a claim is false or misleading is an issue of fact rather than law,but it went on to say that t he sort of survey evidence mead johnson gathered would not support a conclusion by a reasonable person that abbott claim was false or implied a falsehood.mead johnson,at reciting language added to.recognizing that there is a baseline meaning to some words that put them beyond any credible claim of misunderstanding,the seventh circuit said,never before has survey research been used to determine the meaning of words,or to set the standard to which objectively verifiable claims must be held.mead johnson,at.
though the mead johnson opinion is not without its detractors,see rebecca tushnet,running the gamut from a to b federal trademark and false advertising law,hereafter tushnet,we agree with its general proposition that there are circumstances under which the meaning of a factually accurate and facially unambiguous statement is not open to attack through a consumer survey.in other words,there may be cases,and this is one,in which a court can properly say that no reasonable person could be misled by the advertisement in question mead johnson,at survey evidence is inappropriate when it is all but impossible to call the advertising claim at issue misleading.
here,there is a factually accurate,unambiguous statement of the geographic origin of havana club rum.the label clearly states on the front that the liquor is puerto rican rum and,on the back,that it is distilled and crafted in puerto rico.no reasonable consumer could be misled by those statements,and the rest of the label does not put those statements in doubt pernod counters,however,that the words havana club are misleading as to the geographic origin of the rum.if we were dealing with those words in isolation,we might agree.there are administrative decisions that do see corporacion habanos,at holding that the trademark havana club was primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive when used on cigars not produced in cuba in re bacardi,at affirming denial of registration to bacardi for use of the trademarks havana select,habana clasico,old havana,havana primo,and havana clipper,in connection with the sale of rum because the marks were primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive because purchasers belief that the rum products originate in havana,cuba,is a mistaken belief.
but,as we have already emphasized,we are not dealing with those words in isolation.this is not a trademark case,and certainly not one addressing trademark registration,no matter how much pernod may wish it were.we are obligated in this false advertising case under a b to look at the words havana club in the context of the entire accused advertisement,the label of the rum see,am.italian pasta new world pasta,cir considering the phrase america favorite pasta in context of the product whole packaging castrol pennzoil,cir holding that it is appropriate to analyze the message conveyed in full context forschner,arrow trading,f d,holding that the whole challenged advertisement must be considered sandoz pharm.richardson vicks,aff,cir same scotch whiskey ass consol.distilled,considering the phrase loch a moor in context of the whole bottle of whiskey on which it was used.and viewed in that context,any thought a consumer might have that the words havana club indicate the geographic origin of the rum must certainly be dispelled by the plain and explicit statements of geographic origin on the label.
put another way,even if the words havana club,taken in isolation,may be understood as indicating a product geographic origin in havana,cuba,those same words can not mislead a reasonable consumer who is told in no uncertain terms that havana club is a brand of rum made in puerto rico.am.italian pasta,at holding that the phrase america favorite pasta in context of the product whole packaging was not an actionable statement under a b mead johnson,at adding language to holding a reasonable person would not interpret the phrase choice of doctors to be false or imply a falsehood even in light of survey evidence to the contrary forschner,at,holding that the phrase swiss army knife when used in conjunction with the statement made in china to describe a multifunction knife was not a false advertisement under a b as a matter of law because it did not lend itself to being construed as a statement of geographic origin even though roughly of the relevant public believe d mistakenly that a swiss army knife is manufactured in switzerland hamilton brown shoe wolf,holding that,as a matter of law,a trademark used on shoes,the american girl,was not a geographical or descriptive term.
under these circumstances,a district court can properly disregard survey evidence as immaterial,because,by definition,a does not forbid language that reasonable people would have to acknowledge is not false or misleading a lanham act a,forbidding any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact.a contrary holding would not only be out of keeping with the language of a,it would undermine the purpose of subsection a b by subjecting advertisers to a level of risk at odds with consumer protection mead johnson,at drawing a distinction between misleading statements and statements which may be subject to misunderstanding section a forbids misleading as well as false claims,but interpreting misleading to include factual propositions that are susceptible to misunderstanding would make consumers as a whole worse off by suppressing truthful statements that will help many of them find superior products.
we hasten to add that cases like the present one should be rare,for one hopes that a case with truly plain language will seldom seem worth the time and expense of contesting in court.that this particular case,and related ones,have been litigated so intensely is due,it seems,to the unusual political baggage and branding potential involved.a word of caution is nevertheless in order,so that our holding today is not taken as license to lightly disregard survey evidence about consumer reactions to challenged advertisements.before a defendant or a district judge decides that an advertisement could not mislead a reasonable person,serious care must be exercised to avoid the temptation of thinking,my way of seeing this is naturally the only reasonable way.thoughtful reflection on potential ambiguities in an advertisement,which can be revealed by surveys and will certainly be pointed out by plaintiffs,will regularly make it the wisest course to consider survey evidence 
finally,we emphasize once more that our conclusion in this case says nothing of whether the words havana club are eligible for registration as a trademark.the word havana carries a long legal history in trademark cases.see corporacion habanos,u.at holding that the trademark havana club was primarily geo
