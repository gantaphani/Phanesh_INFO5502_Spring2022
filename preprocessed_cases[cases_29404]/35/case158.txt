defendant merck,merck manufactured and marketed vioxx,a drug.vioxx was pulled from the market on september,after a study indicated that the drug created a risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.the plaintiffs in this action brought suit against merck.the plaintiffs do not assert that they suffered any adverse effects from taking vioxx.instead,they assert that,due to its cardiovascular risks,vioxx was less safe than other,less expensive,pain relievers.the plaintiffs seek recovery,on behalf of all persons and entities in california who paid for vioxx,of the difference in price between what they paid for vioxx and what they would have paid for a safer,equally effective,pain reliever.alleging that merck knew about the dangers of vioxx but engaged in a campaign to hide or explain away those risks,the plaintiffs pursued causes of action for unfair competition bus,ucl,false advertising bus,fal,the consumers legal remedies act,et clra,and unjust enrichment 
plaintiffs moved for certification of a class action.after considering thousands of pages of documents,the trial court denied the motion,concluding that common issues of fact did not prevail over individual issues.the court also concluded that the named plaintiffs,who were all individuals,did not possess claims typical of prescription drug benefit providers who had paid all or part of the purchase price of vioxx for their subscribers.these providers are referred to by the parties as payors or tpps.
plaintiffs appeal,arguing,in part,that the supreme court intervening decision in in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d,tobacco ii undermines the trial court rationale.we conclude that the trial court ultimate decision is consistent with tobacco ii,and is supported by substantial evidence.we therefore affirm 
factual and procedural background 
risks and advertising 
vioxx is an drug.aspirin is an nsaid,as is naproxen,which is sold under the trade name aleve.nsaids work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase.there are two such enzymes,known as and.earlier nsaids,such as aspirin and naproxen,inhibit both cox enzymes.inhibiting,however,leads to a risk of adverse gastrointestinal effects.therefore,drug manufacturers sought a selective cox inhibitor,which would inhibit only,and,in theory,result in pain relief without the usual risk of adverse gastrointestinal effects.the first such inhibitor was celecoxib,marketed by pfizer under the trade name celebrex.the second inhibitor was rofecoxib,which was marketed by merck under the name vioxx.
it was subsequently determined that,although vioxx inhibited pain without the risk of adverse gastrointestinal effects of other nsaids,vioxx caused a greater risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.it is beyond the scope of this opinion to consider or discuss the scientific basis for this,although it is speculated that the enzyme has an effect,and selective inhibition of this enzyme may therefore cause the formation of dangerous blood clots.
around the time of vioxx initial release,merck sponsored a study on vioxx,called the vigor study.the goal of the study was to establish merck hypotheses that vioxx was equally effective at pain relief as naproxen and substantially safer from a gastrointestinal point of view.the vigor study did establish both of these points.however,the group of vigor participants who were taking vioxx experienced a statistically significant greater amount of adverse cardiovascular events than the group of vigor participants who were taking naproxen.barring coincidence,only two possible explanations existed for this result either vioxx caused adverse cardiovascular events or naproxen protected against them there was no existing scientific evidence that naproxen had any effect.nonetheless,when the results from the vigor study were published in the new england journal of medicine in november,the article suggested that the results were due to naproxen being,a theory referred to by the parties as the naproxen hypothesis.ultimately,the naproxen hypothesis would be proven false.
the vigor design,its results,and the way those results were a key point in plaintiffs understanding of the history of the case.according to plaintiffs,merck advertised vioxx to the public through press releases,commercials and magazine advertisements as safe,without mentioning its cardiovascular risks.similarly,plaintiffs allege that merck represented to prescribing physicians through marketing representatives,product labels,letters,and published studies that vioxx did not cause a risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.plaintiffs allege that after the vigor study,merck knew or should have known that vioxx was unsafe from a cardiovascular point of view,but rather than acknowledge this,merck downplayed any cardiovascular risk and instead clung to the baseless naproxen hypothesis.merck withdrew vioxx from the market on september,after another study indicated that vioxx was indeed responsible for an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.plaintiffs allege that merck knew about this risk for years,but intentionally deceived the public,and physicians,about it in order to increase sales.
gravamen of plaintiffs complaint 
while plaintiffs pursue four causes of action ucl,fal,clra,and unjust enrichment,each cause of action is based on the same general theory of relief the plaintiffs assert that,as vioxx was no more effective than generic naproxen at relieving pain,and less safe than generic naproxen,vioxx was actually worth no more than generic naproxen.vioxx,however,was a drug and generally cost more than generic naproxen.as merck misled consumers into paying more for vioxx by misrepresenting it as safer than generic naproxen,plaintiffs sought the difference between the price paid for vioxx and the price which would have been paid for generic naproxen.in their declarations,the named plaintiffs did not assert that they would have purchased generic naproxen instead of vioxx they simply stated that had they been informed that equally effective and safer alternatives were available,they would not have purchased vioxx.merck attempted,through discovery,to determine which alternative drug the named plaintiffs would have used had they known about the risks of vioxx.the plaintiffs responded that the drug they would have used was irrelevant.what matters,according to plaintiffs,is that they paid for vioxx believing that it was better than a generic nsaid,when,in fact,vioxx was no better than and was perhaps worse than a generic nsaid.thus,a generic nsaid is a proper conservative estimate of the true value of the vioxx received.
plaintiffs motion for class certification 
on july,plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification,seeking to certify the class of a ll individuals or entities in california who,from june,to october,inclusive,paid some or all of the purchase price for the prescription drug vioxx manufactured by merck,plaintiffs supported their motion with substantial documentation intended to show that merck representations to the public and prescribing physicians were all part of a common,unified campaign to downplay or outright ignore the cardiovascular risks of vioxx which were known to merck.while the precise details of the representations and omissions need not be discussed here,we note that,in general,merck advertisements did not address the cardiovascular risks at all.in contrast,adverse cardiovascular data from the vigor study was disclosed to physicians via the publication of the study and vioxx labeling,but merck attempted to downplay the significance of that data by advancing the naproxen hypothesis pointing to favorable data culled from other studies and making reassurances that vioxx was safe.indeed,plaintiffs allege in their complaint that an april label revision on vioxx would have revealed the cardiovascular risk to someone with enough medical knowledge to make sense of merck warning,but that this was undermined by a press release stating that the significance of the cardiovascular findings from the vigor study was unknown and that merck was confident in the efficacy and safety profile of vioxx.
plaintiffs also relied on the declaration of a medical expert,john david abramson,to the effect that merck representations were biased and misleading and a responsible physician who received the full and accurate disclosure of information about the risks and benefits of vioxx would not have prescribed it as there were on the market other alternatives that were as effective safer.plaintiffs also relied on the declaration of an expert in pharmaceutical economics to the effect that,if generic naproxen is used as the comparator,the proper mathematics exist to enable the price differential to be calculated on a basis 
merck opposition 
merck opposed the certification motion with an equally impressive quantity of documentation designed to establish that individual,rather than common,issues prevailed.merck relied on the many different warning labels used on vioxx and several published vioxx studies in order to demonstrate that merck representations regarding vioxx risks changed over time and were not,in fact,common.
merck also submitted evidence suggesting that plaintiffs theory of the vioxx was no better,and less safe,than generic a vast oversimplification,where the truth involved many patient and issues.for example,merck submitted the declaration of david silver,its medical expert,to the effect that,prior to the advent of inhibitors,numerous patients suffered potentially side effects from traditional nsaids.silver stated that,it was estimated that each year people in the united states died as a result of the most common complication of nsaids,gastrointestinal bleeds,and over were hospitalized.he stated that one out of six deaths in the country was attributed to nsaids,by far the most of any drug class.as such,while generic naproxen was safer from a cardiovascular standpoint than vioxx,naproxen was not safer from a gastrointestinal standpoint.silver stated that,for patients with a history of serious gastrointestinal problems who had already tried,and been unable to tolerate,traditional nsaids,a inhibitor like vioxx may have been the only appropriate option.silver estimated that approximately of his patients who tried naproxen could not tolerate it.moreover,setting aside the gastrointestinal risks of traditional nsaids,some patients simply did not respond to them,but did respond to vioxx.in other words,while,overall,one could say that vioxx was no more effective than traditional nsaids,for the patients for whom naproxen failed to work,vioxx was more effective.
data from some of the tpps also supported this conclusion larger tpps have pharmaceutical and therapeutics p t committees,which are responsible for determining which drugs are on their approved lists of drugs from which doctors can prescribe for patients on their plans.the evidence indicates that some p t committees did a substantial amount of research into the risks of vioxx,without unquestioningly accepting merck naproxen hypothesis for the adverse cardiovascular effects noted in the vigor study.indeed,some large tpps gathered their own data on the possible cardiovascular risks of vioxx.the documentation indicates that the p t committees of some tpps were well aware of the potential cardiovascular effects of vioxx,which resulted in vioxx usage being approved in only limited circumstances.under the plans of some tpps,vioxx was approved only when the patient had a history of gastrointestinal disease or had first tried two traditional nsaids without success.thus,those tpps only paid for vioxx if it had been determined that,for each particular patient,vioxx was safer,or more effective,than traditional nsaids.for patients who obtained their prescription drug benefits through such tpps,those patients could not obtain vioxx unless vioxx was safer,or more effective,than traditional the patient chose to pay the purchase price for vioxx independently.
merck also submitted further evidence that generic naproxen was not an appropriate comparator,based on what actually occurred when vioxx was pulled from the market.silver stated that when vioxx was removed from the market f ew,if any of his patients were able to be successfully transferred to naproxen which is unsurprising given that there was reason to put them on a inhibitor in the first instance.data from one of the tpps bears this vioxx was removed from the market,the majority of its vioxx patients switched to another inhibitor.finally,merck submitted anecdotal evidence that there are individuals who would happily take vioxx,knowing its risks,if it were back on the market today.
in sum,silver stated that,t he process by which a physician decides whether and what to prescribe for a pain patient requires an individualized approach that applies a physician clinical judgment to each patient unique situation.this decision requires a physician to assess a number of factors which vary from patient to patient,including,among others a.the condition being treated,including the nature,location,and extent of the pain b.the risks and benefits associated with the drug c.the anticipated dose and duration of the prescription d.the patient medical history,including any past gastrointestinal problems or drug reactions or allergies e.the potential for adverse interactions with a patient other medications f.the anticipated degree of patient compliance g.the drug cost and the patient insurance coverage and h.the patient concerns regarding treatment and his or her perception of the severity of the pain.
silver also testified that different physicians rely on different sources of information in deciding which drug to prescribe this is particularly true depending on the physician specialty.excerpts from the depositions of the physicians who prescribed vioxx to the named plaintiffs support this conclusion.daniel wallace testified that he subscribes to upwards of medical journals,and also gets information from professional meetings as well as pharmaceutical representatives.he adamantly stated that no pharmaceutical sales representative could convince him to prescribe a drug he otherwise does not wish to prescribe.timothy obermiller testified that he learns about the risks and benefits of drugs from pharmaceutical representatives,papers on clinical trials,his colleagues,continuing education,and the pharmacy department at a hospital.joan gabriella heinsheimer stated that she does not trust the drug industry to perform its own scientific research.she relies on clinical use information gathered over time,journal articles,and an online epocrates database which is updated regularly and free from commercial bias.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification,largely on the issue of individual,rather than common,issues prevailing.while the trial court agreed with plaintiffs that the issue of merck alleged misrepresentations and omissions was subject to common proof,the trial court otherwise rejected plaintiffs overall view of the case.in other words,the court concluded that plaintiffs could not proceed on the theory that vioxx was no more effective,and less safe,than naproxen,because such a determination can not be made,but is dependent on each individual patient specific medical needs and history.similarly,the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs can not establish damages by using generic naproxen as a comparator,because whether vioxx was,in fact,no better than generic naproxen was an issue subject to individual proof for each patient.in short,while the trial court agreed that plaintiffs could attempt to establish that merck advertising was all part of a common scheme to misrepresent,the trial court concluded that the elements of reliance and damages were matters of individual proof,and that these issues prevailed over the matters subject to common proof.as such,the trial court denied class certification.additionally,the trial court concluded that the named plaintiffs claims were not typical of the claims of tpps,although,presumably,if this were the only problem with plaintiffs class action,the class could be redefined to exclude the tpps.
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.after the notice of appeal was filed,our supreme court decided tobacco ii.plaintiffs argue,on appeal,that the trial court ruling was erroneous under the standards reaffirmed by the supreme court in tobacco ii 
contentions on appeal 
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge all aspects of the trial court ruling.first,they argue that the trial court erred in finding the individual plaintiffs claims are not typical of the claims of the tpps.second,they argue that the trial court erred in concluding that individual issues prevailed on the element of reliance,because they could establish reliance on a basis and,in any event,reliance is unnecessary to their ucl and fal causes of action.finally,plaintiffs argue that their method of calculating damages is subject to common proof.finding no error,however,we affirm the trial court order denying class certification.
discussion 
standard of review 
because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification i n the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.tobacco ii,supra,cal th,d.we consider the court rationale,not only its result.accordingly,we will analyze the reasons given by the superior court in denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.caro procter gamble th,d.where a certification order turns on inferences to be drawn from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d.
class action requirements 
in order to maintain a class action,certain prerequisites must be met,specifically,the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.akkerman mecta,th,d.
the predominance factor requires a showing that questions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members.in re cipro cases i ii th,d.to determine whether the questions of fact and law at issue in the litigation are common or individual,it is necessary to consider the individual causes of action pleaded,and the issues raised thereby.

the ucl and fal 
the ucl defines unfair competition to mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by the fal.bus.in turn,the fal prohibits the dissemination of any advertising which is untrue or misleading,and which is known,or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known,to be untrue or misleading.bus.in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that merck conduct violated all four prongs of the,unfair and fraudulent,and violative of the fal.on appeal,plaintiffs pursue only the argument that merck advertising was fraudulent under the ucl and fal.
consumer class actions under the ucl serve an important role in the enforcement of consumers rights.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.they make it economically feasible to sue when individual claims are too small to justify the expense of litigation,and thereby encourage attorneys to undertake private enforcement actions.through the ucl a plaintiff may obtain restitution injunctive relief against unfair or unlawful practices in order to protect the public and restore to the parties in interest money or property taken by means of unfair competition.these actions supplement the efforts of law enforcement and regulatory agencies.the california supreme court has repeatedly recognized the importance of these private enforcement efforts.ibid.
our supreme court has stated,w hile the scope of conduct covered by the ucl is broad,its remedies are limited.citation.a ucl action is equitable in nature damages can not be recovered we have stated that under the ucl,p revailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.the ucl balances relaxed liability standards with limits on liability.id.at,d.

plaintiffs claims are not typical of those of tpps 
the trial court concluded the named plaintiffs claims were not typical of the claims of the tpps on the basis that merck present ed persuasive evidence that the decisionmaking that goes into purchasing vioxx on an individual basis is entirely distinct from the process for putting it into a group formulary.plaintiffs challenge the rationale behind this finding.they argue that the decisionmaking process of the tpps is wholly irrelevant.instead,plaintiffs contend that the claims of tpps are subsidiary to those of the individual plaintiffs.that is to say,if an individual patient,acting in reliance on merck misrepresentations,paid too much for vioxx,the tpp which paid a portion of that purchase price should also be entitled to recover.
the flaw in plaintiffs analysis is that it treats the tpp as a passive entity which simply pays its share of the cost of any prescription written for any of its members,with no independent say in the matter.while some tpps may have,in fact,vioxx for use in all patients,the evidence also indicates that other tpps were not so passive.
p t committees made their own decisions as to whether,and in what circumstances,vioxx was indicated.many conducted regular reviews of all published literature regarding the drugs in their formularies some even conducted their own research studies.
with respect to plaintiffs clra claim,we would consider whether the misrepresentations were material to the tpps.clearly,the evidence supports the trial court conclusion that whether merck misrepresentations were material to individual patients is a completely different inquiry from whether the misrepresentations were material to p t committees,whose sole purpose was to investigate which drugs were appropriate for their respective tpps formularies.similarly,with respect to the ucl claim,in considering whether the representation was likely to mislead,we consider the audience to whom the misrepresentation was directed.whether an individual patient or physician was likely to be misled by merck representations is a completely different inquiry from whether a sophisticated p t committee,with substantial resources and the ability to conduct its own research,was likely to be misled.as such,the trial court did not err in concluding the individual plaintiffs claims were not typical of the claims of the tpps.
additionally,we note that the evidence indicates that the claims of some tpps would be completely at odds with plaintiffs theory of the case.plaintiffs pursue a theory that vioxx was no more effective,and less safe,than naproxen or other traditional nsaids.but the evidence indicated that there were some tpps who would only pay for vioxx if the patient had a history of gastrointestinal disease or had first tried two traditional nsaids without success.while these tpps may or may not have a claim against merck,it clearly can not be based on the theory which plaintiffs seek to pursue,because,for these tpps,every penny they paid for vioxx was paid for a patient for whom a traditional nsaid was not a viable medical option.thus,plaintiffs claims are clearly not typical of these tpps,whose payments were based on facts the plaintiffs have virtually conceded are atypical 
individual issues 
the trial court found that,as to the issue of reliance or materiality,the issue could not be resolved on a basis and instead depended upon an individual determination with respect to each class member.indeed,the trial court found that the plaintiffs offered no evidence indicating the inquiry can be conducted on a basis,and that merck had introduced overwhelming evidence that it could not be.
the trial court found that the decision to prescribe vioxx is an individual decision made by a physician in reliance on many different factors,which vary from patient to patient.the trial court quoted from silver declaration,indicating eight individual factors which a physician must assess in determining whether and what to prescribe for pain.the trial court was also persuaded by merck anecdotal evidence that some patients would rather assume the known risk of taking vioxx in exchange for pain relief,thereby mandating an individual inquiry into patient desires.the trial court noted,plaintiffs adduce no evidence that will distinguish between class members to whom the cardiac risks posed by vioxx were material and those to whom they were not.the trial court also specifically rejected the plaintiffs argument that reliance could be presumed by the materiality of the misrepresentation,concluding that in the absence of common evidence as to what consumers perceived or what they would find material,the inference did not apply.
on appeal,plaintiffs draw this court attention to merck alleged common campaign of hiding the cardiovascular risks of vioxx,arguing that such common misrepresentations support a common inference of reliance.plaintiffs suggest that merck hid an increased risk of death,associated with vioxx,and argue,there can be nothing more material than an increased risk of death.plaintiffs argument is a vast oversimplification of the matter,and one which overlooks all of the evidence to the contrary on which the trial court relied.
first,evidence indicated that vioxx did not present an increased risk of death compared to traditional nsaids for all patients.traditional nsaids killed people per year due to gastrointestinal bleeds.for patients with stomach ulcers or other gastrointestinal risk factors,traditional nsaids presented a higher risk of death than the risk of cardiovascular death posed by vioxx.second,evidence indicated that the cardiovascular risks of vioxx were not material for all patients.some patients would still take vioxx today if it were on the market some physicians would still prescribe it regardless of risks.indeed,it can not be disputed that other drugs pose similar,or even greater,risks of death than vioxx,but are still in,for some patients,the benefits outweigh the risks.third,merck introduced substantial evidence that all physicians are different and obtain their information about prescriptions from myriad sources.for those physicians with a distrust of statements made by the pharmaceutical industry,merck statements could not have been material.for those patients whose tpps required of vioxx or would only pay for vioxx under certain circumstances,the tpp decision likely would override any patient or physician reliance on merck statements.fourth,physicians consider many factors in determining which drug to prescribe,including the patient history and drug allergies,the condition being treated,and the potential for adverse reactions with the patient other medications in addition to the risks and benefits associated with the drug.when all of these factors are a part of the prescribing decision,the materiality of any statements made by merck to any particular prescribing decision can not be presumed.all of this evidence supports the trial court conclusion that whether merck misrepresentations were material,and therefore induced reliance,is a matter on which individual issues prevailed over common issues,justifying denial of class certification with respect to the clra claim 
individual issues and fal 
as discussed above,remedies under the ucl are limited to injunctive relief and restitution.as an injunction is unavailable when there is no threat that the misconduct is likely to be repeated in the future,and vioxx was withdrawn from the market in,injunctive reli
