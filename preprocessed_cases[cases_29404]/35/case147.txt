factual and procedural background 
factual background 
skype provides voice over internet protocol service that enables its customers to make calls to telephone numbers throughout the united states and to many foreign countries.it offers monthly calling plans that it describes as unlimited.for example,skype offers an unlimited world calling plan that it describes as allowing unlimited calls to countries.it also offers an unlimited canada plan.
on an internet page listing its plans,a numerical superscript in the manner of a footnote designator appears immediately after the word unlimited in the title unlimited canada.the numerical superscript in the title references a link at the bottom of the page stating in a much smaller font,mostly in blue text,a fair usage policy applies.this link leads the reader to the terms of the fair usage policy on another page.
the fair usage policy states that the calling plan is limited to hours per day,minutes per month and numbers called per day.it states that calls in excess of these limits will incur the normal rates and connection fees.the policy also states that calls to mobile telephones in out of the countries are not included.
chapman purchased a subscription to the unlimited canada calling plan in december.she believed at the time that there was no limit on either the number of minutes that she could use or the number of calls that she could make for a fixed monthly fee.she did not notice the language fair usage policy at the bottom of the internet page and did not read the policy.she used her calling plan freely and was charged overage fees when her use exceeded the limits.
trial court proceedings 
chapman filed a class action complaint against skype in may alleging that skype has engaged in deceptive advertising and has misled its customers by labeling as unlimited calling plans that are limited as to the number of minutes and number of calls.she alleged on her own behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated throughout the united states counts for unjust enrichment,seeking restitution and disgorgement negligent misrepresentation,seeking damages intentional misrepresentation,seeking damages violation of the ucl,seeking restitution,disgorgement and an injunction violation of the false advertising law,seeking restitution and disgorgement and violation of the clra,seeking damages,restitution,disgorgement and an injunction.
skype filed a general demurrer to each count alleged in the complaint.the trial court stated at the hearing that the term unlimited was qualified by the footnote on the same internet page and that chapman had failed to allege justifiable reliance.the court sustained the demurrer to each count with leave to amend.
chapman filed a first amended complaint in december alleging the same six counts and seeking the same relief.she also alleged that she purchased the skype subscription individually and not through any business entity and used the subscription for both personal and business purposes and is thus a consumer for purposes of the consumer legal remedies act.
skype filed a general demurrer to each count alleged in the first amended complaint skype also requested judicial notice of excerpts from its website showing the existence of the website,how it is set up and the manner in which it interacts with customers.it argued among other things that the website excerpts showed that a subscriber was required to click a box affirming that i agree to the skype terms of service before purchasing any subscription,and that a hyperlink at the underscored words took users to the terms of service stating that subscriptions are subject to the fair usage policy,with a hyperlink to the fair usage policy.skype argued that such a clickwrap agreement is enforceable and that chapman was bound by the terms of the fair usage policy.
chapman opposed the demurrer and the request for judicial notice.she also requested judicial notice of a guide and a policy statement by the federal trade commission ftc and a joint policy statement by the ftc and the federal communications commission.
the trial court granted the requests for judicial notice and sustained the demurrer to each count without leave to amend.the court stated with respect to the count for unjust enrichment that,having agreed to be bound by skype terms of service,chapman was bound by the terms of the fair usage policy.the court stated that the footnote reference to the fair usage policy was clearly conspicuous and,because defendant clearly disclosed the terms of its usage through the use of a superscript containing terms to which plaintiff had to agree before she purchased the service,it can not be said that defendant was unjustly enriched.plaintiff clearly received the benefit of her bargain as she is deemed to have had actual notice of the terms of the contract she signed.loeffler wright.this finding informs the analysis of the discussion of the following causes of action.the court sustained the demurrer to the counts for negligent and intentional misrepresentation for the same reasons.
the trial court concluded with respect to the counts for violation of the ucl and the false advertising law that chapman had failed to adequately allege an unfair,fraudulent or unlawful business act or practice and failed to adequately allege a violation of the false advertising law.the court stated with respect to the fraudulent prong of the ucl and the false advertising law,defendant clearly disclosed the terms of its usage,and to which plaintiff had to agree before she purchased the service 
the trial court also stated that chapman had adequately alleged that she was a consumer for purposes of the clra,but concluded the service representations were not unfair or deceptive.it stated further that chapman clearly indicated that she read and understood the challenged conditions before purchasing the service.indeed,since any party signing up for skype service would have to agree to the fair usage policy,plaintiffs have not shown that any customer of skype would likely be deceived.
the trial court entered a judgment dismissing the complaint in april.chapman timely appealed the judgment.
contentions 
chapman contends skype representations of its calling plans as unlimited are false and deceptive,and the disclosure in its fair usage policy is inadequate to avoid misleading consumers she adequately alleges counts for violation of the ucl,the false advertising law and the clra,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment based on false and deceptive advertising and she is entitled to leave to amend to correct any deficiency.

chapman adequately alleges counts for violation of the ucl and the false advertising law based on deceptive advertising 
a.the ucl and the false advertising law 
the ucl prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising,and any act prohibited by the false advertising law.bus.the false advertising law generally prohibits advertising that contains any statement which is untrue or misleading,and which is known,or should be known,to be untrue or misleading.the remedies available to a private plaintiff under the ucl and the false advertising law include injunctive relief and restitution,kasky nike,cal th,d,kasky.
the ucl and the false advertising law prohibit not only advertising which is false,but also advertising which,although true,is either actually misleading or which has a capacity,likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse the public.citation.thus,to state a claim under either the ucl or the false advertising law,based on false advertising or promotional practices,it is necessary only to show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.citations.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.this is determined by considering a reasonable consumer who is neither the most vigilant and suspicious of advertising claims nor the most unwary and unsophisticated,but instead is the ordinary consumer within the target population.lavie procter gamble th,d.likely to deceive implies more than a mere possibility that the advertisement might conceivably be misunderstood by some few consumers viewing it in an unreasonable manner.rather,the phrase indicates that the ad is such that it is probable that a significant portion of the general consuming public or of targeted consumers,acting reasonably in the circumstances,could be misled.id.at,d.
the question whether consumers are likely to be deceived is a question of fact that can be decided on a demurrer only if the facts alleged in the complaint,and facts judicially noticed,compel the conclusion as a matter of law that consumers are not likely to be deceived.people mckale cal d,klein chevron,th,d klein morgan v.at t wireless services,th,d.
chapman adequately alleges deceptive advertising 
chapman contends skype representations of its calling plans as unlimited are false and deceptive,and the disclosure in its fair usage policy is inadequate to avoid misleading consumers.she argues that its use of the word unlimited together with a disclaimer in the fair usage policy contradicting that express claim is deceptive as a matter of law.we need not decide whether skype use of the word unlimited constitutes a false statement for these purposes because the ucl and the false advertising law prohibit deceptive advertising even if it is not actually false.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.we also need not decide whether skype use of the word unlimited in this context is deceptive as a matter of law,but only whether the trier of fact reasonably could conclude that consumers are likely to be deceived.ibid.
we conclude that the answer is yes.the trier of fact reasonably could conclude based on the facts alleged in the complaint and those judicially noticed that consumers are likely to believe that skype unlimited canada italics added calling plan offers unlimited calling within the united states and canada for a fixed monthly fee,and that they will fail to notice the disclosure to the contrary in the fair usage policy.again,the facts alleged and those judicially noticed are that a numerical superscript appears immediately after the word unlimited in the title of the plan,which refers to a footnote at the bottom of the same internet page stating in a much smaller font mostly in blue text,a fair usage policy applies.the words a fair usage policy are linked to a separate page where limits on the unlimited plan are set forth.a reasonable interpretation of the words fair usage policy is that they suggest a policy to protect against misuse of the service provided.they do not necessarily suggest to an ordinary consumer that the unlimited plan is actually limited as to the number of minutes and number of calls.those words therefore do not necessarily,and as a matter of law,alert a reasonable consumer to the need to follow the link to learn the details of those limits.
we believe on this record that whether a reasonable consumer would read the fair usage policy and discover the limits on the unlimited calling plan is a question of fact.we thus can not conclude as a matter of law that those limits are so conspicuous and apparent that consumers are not likely to be deceived.klein,supra,th at,d.moreover,the fact that skype ultimately discloses the limits in its fair usage policy does not excuse its practice of labeling the plan unlimited in its initial dealings with potential customers.chern bank of america cal d.we therefore conclude that chapman adequately alleges deceptive advertising and that the sustaining of the demurrer to her counts for violation of the ucl and the false advertising law on this basis was error 
chapman adequately alleges actual reliance 
skype also argues that chapman fails to allege facts showing that she suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the alleged violation bus,italics added for purposes of the ucl and the false advertising law and suffer ed any damage as a result of the alleged violation,italics added for purposes of the clra.to satisfy these requirements at the pleading stage a plaintiff must allege facts showing that he or she suffered an economic injury caused by the alleged violation.kwikset superior court cal th,d,kwikset.because reliance is the causal mechanism of fraud in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d,this requires pleading facts showing actual reliance,that is,that the plaintiff suffered economic injury as a result of his or her reliance on the truth and accuracy of the defendant representations.kwikset,supra,at fn,d.
kwikset,supra,cal th,d,involved allegations of false advertising in violation of the ucl and the false advertising law.the plaintiffs alleged that they would not have purchased the product if not for the false representation that it was made in id.at,d.kwikset concluded that this but for allegation was sufficient to allege both causation and economic injury as required under business and professions code section.id.at,d.contrary to skype argument,however,kwikset did not hold or suggest that an allegation that the plaintiff would not have purchased the product if not for the false representation was the only way to satisfy the causation requirement.
kwikset,supra,cal th,d,stated that the california supreme court in in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th,d,held that a plaintiff proceeding on a claim of misrepresentation as the basis for his or her ucl action must demonstrate actual reliance on the allegedly deceptive or misleading statements,in accordance with principles regarding the element of reliance in ordinary fraud actions in re tobacco ii cases,supra,at.consequently,a plaintiff must show that the misrepresentation was an immediate cause of the conduct in re tobacco ii cases,at,d.however,a plaintiff is not required to
