in,the procter gamble company and the procter gamble distributing company hereinafter jointly referred to in the singular as p g filed this action against the amway corporation amway and certain of its distributors asserting claims under section a of the lanham act,a,and utah common law.the district court subject matter jurisdiction was based on,and.in march,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on some of p g claims and dismissed the remaining claims.p g appealed and,in august,this court reinstated the lanham act and tortious interference claims and remanded the case for further proceedings.proctor gamble haugen,cir.in june,the district court dismissed all claims against amway and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the distributor defendants with respect to p g tortious interference claim.p g again appealed,and this court affirmed the district court dispositive rulings,thereby leaving only p g lanham act claim against the distributor defendants to be litigated.procter gamble haugen,cir.
in the present appeal,p g now challenges the district court dismissal of that remaining lanham act claim on the grounds that p g failed to preserve and produce to defendants relevant electronic data and p g expert testimony was inadmissible at trial.p g also appeals two rulings issued by the district court prior to dismissal.lastly,p g seeks reassignment of the case to a different district court judge on remand.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,affirm two rulings,reverse the order of dismissal,remand for further proceedings,and deny p g request for a reassignment of the case on remand.
p g is the manufacturer and distributor of numerous products for personal care,household use,and consumption.on august,p g filed its complaint in this case against,among others,defendant randy haugen,a utah citizen and distributor of amway consumer products,and two utah corporations,freedom associates,and freedom tools incorporated,utilized by haugen in his amway distribution business.p g complaint alleged that in,haugen disseminated a message to thousands of other amway distributors falsely stating that the president of p g had recently appeared on television,announced that he the president of p g was associated with the church of satan,and stated that a large portion of the profits from different p g products were used to support the church of satan.p g complaint further alleged that,as a result of haugen message and its dissemination,p g lost customers concerned about supporting satan through their purchase of p g products.p g complaint asserted claims against haugen and his corporations under the lanham act and utah state law 
in its initial efforts at assessing damages,p g assigned one of its own employees,steven mcdonald,who worked as a financial analyst and profit forecaster,to analyze whether,and if so,how much,the satanism rumors had impacted the sales and market share of the p g products referred to in haugen message.in his effort to do so,mcdonald turned to market share information that was available to p g from an unrelated,company called information resources incorporated iri.app.at.iri regularly gathered scanner data of consumer purchases from grocery stores,drug stores and mass market merchandisers,throughout the united states,and,pursuant to a contract with p g,in turn compiled and maintained various electronic market share database s for p g use.id.at.these databases contain ed market share information for a given product type,detergent powder and correlate d sales to factors such as price,advertising,coupons,and display.id.notably,the databases were maintained on a rolling basis meaning that a t any given time,they contain ed monthly data for the prior months and weekly data for the prior weeks,and as iri added new data to the databases,it simultaneously deleted old data from the databases.id.p g,primarily for marketing purposes,contracted with iri for production of and access to databases pertaining to p g consumer products.in turn,p g employees regularly accessed the databases,via terminals at p g facilities,and incorporated some of the information into reports.
after mcdonald allegedly concluded that the iri data available to him was inconclusive regarding the effects of the satanism rumor on the sales of p g products,p g hired two expert witnesses,robert hall and harvey rosen,to investigate and testify regarding this issue.like mcdonald,both hall and rosen turned to the iri data to conduct their analyses.according to the record,hall focused his analysis on ten p g products for sixty markets covering december through may.id.at.rosen,using archival data specially purchased from iri by p g for an approximate cost of as opposed to the data regularly made available by iri to p g,focused his analysis on five p g products tide,crest,pampers,downy and charmin id.at see id.at.
at issue in this appeal is the extent to which defendants requested production of the iri market share data from p g and,in turn,the extent to which p g complied with those requests.according to defendants,they made three requests pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure for production of,or access to,the iri data.the first such discovery request pointed to by defendants occurred on november,when defendants asked p g to produce for inspection and copying a ny documents which p g believe d evidence d loss of sales or revenues resulting from defendants conduct,including summaries of product sales during and immediately prior to the time in question in the geographic areas which p g believe d were impacted,as well as,f or comparison purposes,similar documents evidencing sales and revenue for all other areas in the united states,during the same time periods id.at.
the second request pointed to by defendants occurred approximately five months later,on april,when defendants asked p g to produce for inspection and copying the following categories of documents s ummaries of product sales at the retail level in the states of utah,nevada,and texas from april,to the present f or comparison purposes,similar documents evidencing sales and revenues for all other areas in the united states during the same time period m emoranda,correspondence,or other documents indicating sales strategies and plans which were implemented during the same time period a ny market forecasts or analyses within your possession which express an opinion,a forecast,or an analysis as to whether the sales of any products produced by p g and marketed in the united states we re expected to increase or decrease in the next five years a ny document which refer red to amway corporation or competition with amway products from april,until april,and a computation of any category of damages claimed by p g and all documents or other evidentiary material,not privileged or protected from disclosure,on which such computation wa s based,including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered.id.at.
the third and final request pointed to by defendants occurred on october,when amway,while still a defendant in the case,requested from p g a host of documents pertaining to the a lleged harm to p g reputation and purported damages,including a ll documents explaining or analyzing changes in p g market share,by region,product,and any other classification,since.id.at.
in addition to these three discovery requests,defendants contend the district court issued four separate orders directing p g to produce the iri data before it ultimately sanctioned p g for failing to comply.the first of those orders was issued on january,by the magistrate judge in response to defendants motion to compel discovery.id.at.it directed p g to provide a description of the nature of injuries and losses it ha d sustained and,to the extent that it ha d sufficient information to do so,provide a computation of each category of damages within the meaning of rule a c by february.id.at.
the second court order cited by defendants was issued on july,by the magistrate judge in response to defendants motion to compel production of documents related to p g damage claim.that order directed p g to produce,within thirty days,at least boxes of responsive documents for tide laundry detergent and documents responsive to request,and of defendant haugen third request for production of documents,which concern ed p g alleged damage to its reputation.id.at.the order further stated 
after defendants have inspected the tide documents,they will provide p g with a list of responsive documents.for each p g brand that competes with an amway product,p g will then produce all the responsive documents within a reasonable time,but efforts should be made to complete the production within days of service of amway list.
the third court order cited by defendants was issued on december,by the magistrate judge.on that date,the magistrate judge conducted a hearing on various motions.during the course of the hearing,the magistrate judge instructed p g to produce to amway and presumably the other defendants within days from the date of the hearing the iri data relating to the competing products from which p g ma d e its claim of loss.id.at.in making this order,the magistrate judge clarified the scope of what p g was required to produce if you p g have it in usable electronic data base format,so that that electronic data base could be programed sic to draw down the material in a variety of constructs,that then that ought to be produced in that form.if it is not available in that form but is only available in a reproduction format,then the reproduction format would be what you need to produce.id.at.the magistrate judge further stated i not going to require you p g to construct a whole new system to provide the information,but you must provide the data you have,and if you have a system that will allow for an analytical assessment of the information within that system,then they ought to have an opportunity to access that in its electronic form.id.at.notably,the magistrate judge acknowledged,after making his ruling,that amway had not previously requested this information,information on products other than tide from p g.the magistrate judge also indicated that he would not be imposing any sanctions on p g for any alleged failure to produce evidence.
on february,the magistrate judge issued an order memorializing his ruling during the december,hearing.in particular,the order stated that by january,p g was required to produce iri data for p g products that compete with amway products.id.at.if p g has this information in a usable electronic data base format,so that the data could be programmed to draw down the material in a variety of constructs,it should be produced in that form.if p g has a system that will allow for an analytical assessment of the information within that system,defendants must be provided an opportunity to access it.if the iri data is not available in an electronic form but is only available in a reproduction format,then the reproduction format should be produced id.at.notably,the order again implied that p g had not previously been required to produce such information to defendants id.at in addition to production governed by prior orders,p g must produce the following.
the fourth and final order cited by defendants was issued by the district court during a hearing held on february,regarding motions.during that hearing,the district court heard arguments regarding the distributor defendants motion to compel documents going to damages.id.at.in support of their motion,defendants argued,as they do now on appeal,that they began seeking iri data in november of.although defendants acknowledged that the document requests they served on p g in november did not specifically name the iri data,they argued that the document requests effectively encompassed that data.id.at it was specifically named,but it would encompass it.defendants also acknowledged that the december,order issued by the magistrate judge was the first time that p g had been directly instructed to produce data.id.at then december,finally,the court orders p g to produce iri data.although defendants admitted p g had provided them with the iri data used by rosen in analyzing damages,they argued they were entitled to all of the iri data that p g had access to during the course of the litigation,and that,due to p g alleged failure to produce such data,they were entitled to dismissal of p g claims for lost profits.
in response to defendants arguments,p g noted that defendants had been provided with access to all of the iri data that rosen had access to in preparing his expert report,and that this data was sufficient to allow them to adequately challenge rosen testimony at trial in this regard,p g clarified that it was not interested in pursuing loss of profits for any products but the three consumer products that rosen had focused on in his expert report.id.at.p g further noted that,in a similar case being litigated between the parties in texas,iri had offered to provide to counsel for defendants all or any data in the possession of iri that the defendants wanted,which was all of the data regarding the competing products,but that iri was going to charge a large fee for doing so.id.at.thus,p g argued,defendants were effectively attempting to persuade the court to pass this cost on to p 
in reply,defendants asserted they were entitled to production of all the iri data available to p g from november,when p g employee mcdonald first began looking at the data to assess lost,through december.defendants further asserted that,during the time p g subscribed to the iri database,p g could have downloaded that information and maintained it,but they failed to do that.id.at.lastly,defendants acknowledged that the magistrate judge,in ordering p g to produce data,had limited that production to the data previously provided to p g own experts.
ultimately,the district court ruled well,on the iri data,it seems to me the only question mean,you p g can look and see if you got something you may have that you did think you had,and if you do,produce it.and then you p g can say what you do have.and then you defendants can decide what you want to ask me to do about it.and you p g can respond to that,all right id.in other words,the district court did not order p g to purchase any additional archival data from iri for defendants benefit.instead,the district court limited its order of production to only that iri data in the possession of p 
on april,defendants filed a motion for sanctions as a result of p g alleged spoliation of electronic market share data.id.at.in support of their motion,defendants first asserted that the iri data available to p g employees from november through december was critical to the defense.id.at.more specifically,defendants argued that their economic expert,finis welch,need ed access to all the iri data to determine whether the repeating of the satanism message by the defendants had any economic impact,lost sales on p g business.id.at.according to defendants,a lthough welch agree d that iri data constitute d the best information for studying any economic effect of the rumor message,he believe d that rosen use of highly selective data provide d no scientific basis for his conclusions.id.as a second basis for their motion,defendants argued that p g had wilfully failed to preserve the iri data.id.at.according to defendants,p g did nothing to preserve the data,not only after it had been requested several times,but even after production had been ordered by the court on four separate occasions.id.as a third basis for their motion,defendants argued that p g was well aware of the importance of the iri market share data to the case.id.at.in support of this assertion,defendants argued that p g provided its own experts with access to the iri database,but then saved only the material that it provided to rosen,the archival information it purchased from iri for purposes of the case.id.at.as a fourth basis for their motion,defendants argued that p g,by failing to produce all of the iri data,violated several court orders.id.at.lastly,defendants argued that the entry of a default judgment in their favor was the appropriate sanction for p g alleged wrongful conduct.
p g filed a response opposing defendants motion for sanctions.in that response,p g first noted that it had simply been an online subscriber to the data provided by iri,and that its subscription contract did not allow it to download all of the information contained in iri databases.second,p g noted that,even if had sought to download all of the information in iri databases,it would have been required to purchase a mainframe computer like the one owned and used by iri.in other words,p g asserted that iri data was so massive that p g computer system could not handle a download of the iri databases.id.at.third,p g asserted that it had produced to defendants all documents in its possession that incorporated or referenced the iri data accessed by its employees.fourth,p g asserted that the iri data,in the form regularly accessed online by p g employees for marketing purposes,would not have been helpful in assessing damages in this case.in support of this assertion,p g noted that it had to purchase worth of archival data from iri in a special format,grouped by for its expert,rosen,and that such data had already been provided to defendants.fifth,p g noted that iri had offered to make the databases available to defendants,but that defendants had refused to pay for the information.lastly,p g argued that it had not violated any orders issued by the magistrate judge or the district court.to the contrary,p g asserted that it had complied with the discovery orders of january,july,and december,and that it was accumulat ing,and w ould shortly be producing,the documentation requested by defendants in.id.at.
on july,the district court held a hearing on defendants motion for sanctions.defendants argued,in pertinent part,that p g could have provided a terminal to the defense to access the iri data at no cost,and that the magistrate judge had,in fact,directed p g to do so in december of.get access.let the defendants have access to the information at no cost.id.at.defendants further argued that t he problem wa s they p g never preserved what they should have preserved in the first place.id.at.in other words,defendants argued that,beginning in or,p g should have preserved all of the iri online data it had access to.p g,in response,asserted that it had preserved and provided defendants with w hatever data was downloaded from iri database through p g normal business practices and used in any way,shape or form for business purposes id.at.p g emphasized,however,that at no time did it ever own,or have authority to download,all of the information contained in the iri database.lastly,p g noted that iri was willing to sell any archival data to defendants that they might want.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court made no ruling,but instead took the matter under advisement.
on august,the district court issued a order granting defendants motion for sanctions.the order stated,in full 
defendants motion for sanctions was heard by the court on july.
the court has reviewed the file,considered the arguments of counsel,reviewed the memoranda supporting and opposing the motion,and has reviewed governing authority.after due consideration of the foregoing,the court grants defendants motion and dismisses this case with prejudice for each of the following three reasons in other words,each reason standing alone would be sufficient for the court ruling in this matter 
based on the reasons and arguments set forth by defendants in support of their motion,the court is convinced that plaintiffs have failed to preserve relevant electronic data that plaintiffs knew was critical to their case and to the defense.the court is also persuaded that plaintiffs have violated four separate discovery orders requiring production of said data.
based on the reasons and arguments set forth in defendants motion and supporting memoranda,the court finds that it would be basically impossible for defendants to defend this case without the electronic data that has not been produced and apparently is no longer available.defendants would need access to all relevant iri data to determine whether the satanism message produced lost sales with respect to all of the products included in said satanism message.
the court finds that damages testimony and studies based on five or fewer of the more than forty products at issue here would not be admitted in evidence under rule of the federal rules of evidence and the daubert line of cases regarding the admissibility of expert testimony.such testimony clearly would not be based upon sufficient facts or data to be admissible in this court.since plaintiffs damages evidence would not be admissible,plaintiffs claims must fail.
defendants motion to dismiss this case with prejudice is granted for each of the foregoing three reasons discussed.all other outstanding motions in this case are moot.each party shall bear its own costs.
the primary focus of p g appeal is on the district court august,order dismissing the case.although that order cited three reasons for dismissing the case,p g argues,and we agree,that the order was actually grounded on two separate bases p g alleged wrongful conduct and the prejudice allegedly suffered by defendants as a result thereof,and the purported inadmissibility of p g expert testimony.p g challenges both.as outlined in greater detail below,we agree with p g that neither of these bases justify dismissal and we therefore reverse the order of dismissal and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
sanction of dismissal 
p g asserts several challenges to the portion of the district court august,order dismissing p g action as a sanction for p g f ailure to preserve relevant electronic data before addressing the specific arguments made by p g,we must first resolve the threshold question of what standard of review to apply to that portion of the district court decision.
the district court did not cite to any rule or authority in its order granting defendants motion for sanctions.because,however,defendants motion relied largely upon federal rule of civil procedure b,we presume the district court likewise relied on that same rule in dismissing the action based on p g alleged failure to preserve electronic data and the resulting prejudice allegedly suffered by defendants.rule b authorizes a district court to sanction a party who fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery included among the available sanctions is a n order dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof.b c.in reviewing a district court decision to dismiss an action under rule b,we generally apply an abuse of discretion standard.see creative gifts,ufo,cir.
although a district court is afforded discretion in choosing an appropriate sanction,that discretion is limited in that the chosen sanction must be both just and related to the particular claim which was at issue in the order to provide discovery.ehrenhaus reynolds,cir internal quotation marks omitted.dismissal with prejudice represents an extreme sanction,and thus is considered appropriate only in cases involving willfulness,bad faith,or some fault on the part of the party to be sanctioned.chavez city of albuquerque,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in many cases,a lesser sanction will deter the errant party from further misconduct.ehrenhaus,at.because dismissal with prejudice defeats altogether a litigant right of access to the courts,it should be used as a weapon of last,rather than first,resort.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
before imposing dismissal as a sanction,a district court should ordinarily evaluate the following factors on the record the degree of actual prejudice to the other party the amount of interference with the judicial process the culpability of the litigant whether the court warned the party in advance that dismissal of the action would be a likely sanction for noncompliance and the efficacy of lesser sanctions.gripe city of enid,cir quoting ehrenhaus,at.this list,hereinafter referred to as the ehrenhaus factors,is not exhaustive,nor are the factors necessarily of equal weight.chavez,at.only when the aggravating factors outweigh the judicial system strong predisposition to resolve cases on their merits is dismissal an appropriate sanction.ehrenhaus,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as discussed in greater detail below,we conclude in this case that the district court erred in imposing dismissal as a sanction for p g alleged misconduct.not only did the district court fail to consider the ehrenhaus factors on the record,our own independent review of the record on appeal suggests that several of the ehrenhaus factors weighed in favor of p g,and that,in any event,the extreme sanction of dismissal was clearly inappropriate under the circumstances presented here.
failure to consider ehrenhaus factors on the record 
p g argues that the district court order of dismissal must,at a minimum,be reversed due to the district court failure to address on the record any of the ehrenhaus factors.we agree.as we have said in the past under similar circumstances,the district court failure to provide a detailed evaluation of these factors on the record makes it impossible for us to engag e in any meaningful review of the trial court decision.mobley mccormick,cir.although defendants assert that the district court order of dismissal incorporated by reference the arguments asserted in their motion for sanction,which in turn addressed the ehrenhaus factors,it is unclear from the record whether the district court agreed with the defendants assessment of each of those factors.moreover,as discussed in greater detail below,our independent review of the record refutes many of the arguments made by defendants in their motion.thus,we must hold that the district court failure to address the ehrenhaus factors on the record amounts to an abuse of discretion.id.
culpability of p g 
p g argues that,even aside from the district court failure to address the ehrenhaus factors on the record,the sanction of dismissal was inappropriate because there was no basis for concluding that it acted willfully,in bad faith,or with culpability.more specifically,p g argues that the only action it conceivably failed to take was to create a computerized database out of all the online iri data that ever had been available to it from through,even though it never actually had accessed,much less downloaded,the vast majority of the data,which were being deleted and replaced continuously by iri.aplt.br.at.
our independent review of the record on appeal persuades us that p g was indeed faced with a dilemma regarding preservation and production of the iri data.as noted,p g did not possess nor own that data.rather,the record indicates that the data was compiled,possessed,and owned by iri,which in turn provided p g with access to that data for a fee.although the iri data in general could be deemed to have fallen within certain of defendants discovery requests,it is unclear precisely how p g was to produce that data to defendants.the most reasonable alternatives appear to have been a providing defendants with regular online access to the information,b attempting to download and archive the information at p g facilities,or c paying iri to provide the archived data to defendants that said,each of these alternatives involved a considerable downside.the first option,providing defendants with regular online access to the information,would not necessarily have satisfied defendants discovery requests due to the rolling nature of the iri database.in other words,it appears from the record that defendants were interested in obtaining a concrete set of data,a set of data with established beginning and ending dates rather than merely access to the rolling database.as for the second option,p g downloading and archiving the data at its own facilities,the record appears to be uncontroverted that p g did not have the computer capacity to do so and would,in fact,have had to purchase a mainframe computer to do so the third option,purchasing archival data from iri,bore a considerable economic expense.according to p g,the cost of obtaining the requested archival data from iri would have been somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty million dollars 
although the district court order of dismissal makes reference to p g fail ing to preserve relevant electronic data,the district court offered no explanation of what it meant by relevant electronic data,and what steps it believed p g could and should have taken to preserve such data.app.at.moreover,at no time during the litigation did the district court or the magistrate judge ever address either of these issues.as noted in p g opening brief,the first court order expressly mentioning iri data was the magistrate judge december,order.that order directed p g to provide defendants with iri data possessed by p g,and thus arguably failed to clarify p g duties regarding preservation production of the iri data available to p g online as opposed to the iri data that was actually downloaded by p g employees and incorporated into reports.to be sure,the december,order mentioned the possibility of p g providing defendants with access to any computer systems that allowed for analysis of the iri data.however,that order was again framed in terms of iri data possessed by p g,and thus arguably failed to address the unique circumstances of this case.
similarly,the district court expressly addressed the iri data on only one occasion before entertaining defendants motion for sanctions and dismissing p g case.specifically,on february,after hearing oral arguments regarding defendants motion to compel evidence,the district court simply directed p g to ensure that it had produced all data in its possession.in other words,the district court did not order p g to purchase any additional archival data from iri for defendants benefit.
given these circumstances,it is simply unclear what the district court considered p g duties to have been regarding preservation and production of the data.in turn,it is impossible to conclude that p g acted with the requisite culpability to justify the sanction of dismissal.
prejudice to defendants 
in its order of dismissal,the district court found that it would be basically impossible for defendants to defend this case without the electronic data that has not been produced and apparently is no longer available.app.at.more specifically,the district court stated defendants would need access to all relevant iri data to determine whether the satanism message produced lost sales with respect to all the products included in said satanism message.id.
p g challenges this finding as groundless.aplt.br.at.according to p g,defendants defended themselves without all of the data in a parallel texas action brought by p id.at.indeed,p g alleges,the court in that texas case rejected defendants argument that they would be unable to defend themselves unless they could get all of the iri data to which p g had temporary access in prior years.id.in the instant case,p g notes,defendants have received all of the information,documents and materials in the possession,custody,or control of p g and its experts,and defendants also had the opportunity to purchase directly from iri any additional data they believed was necessary id.
we conclude,after examining the record on appeal,that the district court finding of prejudice,unsupported by any detailed explanation,is clearly erroneous.see generally olcott delaware flood,cir we accept the district court factual findings underpinning its sanctions order unless clearly erroneous.as noted in the background section,p g paid iri to compile and offer it access to the data for marketing purposes.when this litigation began,p g initially attempted to use the iri data available to it online for purposes of assessing the damages,if any,that resulted from the satanism rumors.according to p g,however,the online data was not organized in a way that allowed for such analysis.accordingly,its sole remaining expert on damages,rosen,requested that p g purchase archival data from iri that was formatted in a different fashion than the online data,by zip code.p g complied with this request,and rosen in turn based his damages analysis on the archival data.although defendants now assert that it was necessary for them to have had access to all of the iri online data in order to rebut rosen testimony,this assertion is supp
