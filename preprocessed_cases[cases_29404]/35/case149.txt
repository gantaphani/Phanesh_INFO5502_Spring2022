the trial court certified a class of all persons who purchased listerine,in california,from june through january.in our previous decision in this matter,filed july,we granted pfizer petition for writ of mandate,concluding the trial court ruling,which certified a class consisting of all persons who purchased listerine in california during a period,was overbroad.

factual and procedural background 
the proposed class action complaint.
on january,galfano filed a consumer action against pfizer in his individual capacity and on behalf of all others similarly situated,based upon pfizer alleged misrepresentations and failure to disclose material information in the marketing,labeling,advertising and sale of listerine mouthwash.galfano pled that pfizer advertised and promoted listerine in a misleading manner by indicating the use of listerine can replace the use of dental floss in reducing plaque and gingivitis.the complaint asserted causes of action for breach of express warranty,false advertising under section and unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practices under section 
with respect to the class action allegations,galfano alleged he represented a ll persons who purchased listerine,in california,from approximately june of to the date of judgment in this action 
galfano motion for class certification.
on september,galfano filed a motion for class certification.galfano sought to certify the following class all persons who purchased listerine with labels that state as effective as floss,in california,from june,through january,the class period.
in seeking class certification,galfano contended the class is ascertainable,the class is so numerous as to render joinder impracticable,an overwhelming community of interests exists among the class,the class representative has claims typical of the class,and the named plaintiff and his counsel adequately represent the class.
pfizer opposition to class certification.
pfizer opposed class certification,arguing the case is replete with factual issues that only can be determined upon individual inquiry of each class member,and which individual inquiries predominate over any common issues.pfizer enumerated those issues as follows whether each class member saw or read a label if so,which of the labels was seen or read whether the consumer was deceived or misled by,or relied on,the label if so,whether that was part of the bargain and caused the consumer to buy listerine if so,whether the consumer suffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of the alleged deception or reliance and if so,the amount of damages or restitution,given that prices vary and most consumers will not have records of the price s they paid.
pfizer reasoned a consumer may have purchased listerine not because of any alleged deception but because he was brand loyal,he wanted a breath freshener,his dentist recommended it,due to a price promotion,or because the consumer read the label admonition to floss daily or not a replacement for floss and did not take away any alleged deceptive message,each of which is an individual issue that can not be resolved on a basis.
trial court ruling.
after hearing the matter,the trial court issued an order on november,certifying a broad class,on an basis,consisting of all persons who purchased listerine,in california,from june through january.
in its written ruling,the trial court noted w hile proposition amended section standing requirements to prosecute ucl claims by mandating that a private party suffer an injury in fact and lose money or property as a result of the practice,whether the standing requirements for class members also changed under the ucl is an open issue.italics added.
the trial court reserved jurisdiction to modify the class definition,decertify the class,or replace galfano with a new class representative.in certifying the class,the trial court also severed the breach of warranty claim,pending determination of the viability of the ucl claims in subsequent phases of the proceedings.
the trial court also expressed numerous reservations concerning the remedies available to the class.specifically,upon proof of false or misleading advertising,or of a fraudulent or unfair practice,injunctive relief may be available.however,any restitutionary relief may be problematic.insofar as the advertising and labeling is no longer in use,injunctive relief may not be appropriate.with respect to restitutionary relief,the requirements of injury in fact or lost money or property as a result of the conduct of defendant pfizer,as imposed by proposition,may preclude recovery on a class basis.similarly,proof of the claim for restitutionary disgorgement appears problematic,to the extent there must be some correlation between the amount of restitutionary relief and conduct justifying recovery.the court further has reservations with respect to the remedies on plaintiff breach of warranty claim,as the measure of damages is defined under commercial code.
despite its stated reservations,the trial court certified the class in accordance with galfano broad definition.
pfizer writ petition our previous decision in this matter.
on december,pfizer filed the instant petition for writ of mandate,seeking vacation of the trial court order and entry of a new order denying class certification.
this court issued an order to show cause 
in an opinion filed july,we addressed,inter alia,whether each member of the putative class asserting a claim under the ucl or the fal must,in the language of proposition,have suffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of such violation,or whether this standing requirement is only applicable to the class representative or named plaintiff.
we concluded proposition requires private representative actions to satisfy the procedural requirements applicable to class action lawsuits.ballot,general,official title summary.i n order to meet the community of interest requirement of code of civil procedure section,which requires,inter alia,the class representative to have claims typical of the class,it is insufficient if the class representative alone suffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition or false advertising.the class members being represented by the named plaintiff likewise must have suffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of such violation.
we further concluded that unless an action under the ucl or the fal is brought by the attorney general or local public prosecutors,the mere likelihood of harm to members of the public is no longer sufficient for standing to sue.persons who have not suffered any injury in fact and who have not lost money or property as a result of an alleged fraudulent business practice can not state a cause of action merely based on the likelihood that members of the public will be deceived.
further,inherent in proposition requirement that a plaintiff suffered injury in fact as a result of the fraudulent business practice or false advertising,italics added is that a plaintiff actually relied on the false or misleading misrepresentation or advertisement in entering into the transaction in issue.
we concluded the trial court ruling,which certified a class consisting of
