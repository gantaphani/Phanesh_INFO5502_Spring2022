pallco enterprises,pallco,appeals from a judgment of the trial court finding that advertising displays erected on the property of denton and carolyn beam the beams are not a public nuisance.pallco contends the court erred in deferring to the california department of transportation caltrans on the nuisance issue and otherwise misapplied the provisions of the state outdoor advertising act hereafter the outdoor advertising act or the act bus,et and its associated regulations.we affirm the judgment.
facts and proceedings 
the beams are the owners of a parcel of real property the property along state highway in the city of rancho cordova.in,the beams predecessor obtained a permit to maintain an advertising display on the property facing east,with dimensions six feet by ten feet and the bottom four feet above the ground permit.in,a permit was issued to maintain a display on the same structure facing west permit.the dimensions of this display were seven feet by twenty feet and five feet above the ground.at the time,there were no regulations on the size of advertising displays.neither permit authorized illumination.
in,the federal government enacted the highway beautification act et.in response,the state amended the outdoor advertising act in to provide,among other things,that no advertising display may be placed within feet of another display on the same side of the highway.bus,subd.d.at the time of this amendment,another advertising display existed within feet of the beam displays,making the beam displays nonconforming.as defined by the outdoor advertising act,a nonconforming display is one that was lawfully placed,but that does not conform to the provisions of the act,or the administrative regulations adopted pursuant to the act,that were enacted subsequent to the date of placing.bus.
the beams purchased the property in.at the time,the display was seven feet by twenty feet in size and both east and west displays were illuminated.
pallco,doing business as orion outdoor media,controls approximately advertising displays.pallco sought to construct a new advertising display on property owned by tom tuohy west of the beams property.however,because the beam displays were within feet of the proposed location for the pallco display,pallco plans required removal of the beam displays.
pallco initially offered to purchase the beam displays,but this was rejected by the beams.pallco offered to pay the beams per month for years.during its discussions with the beams,pallco informed them their displays were illegal and subject to removal.the beams investigated pallco claim in january and determined the displays were legal but nonconforming.at one point,tuohy met with the beams and offered them in a little brown paper sack to eliminate their displays.the beams were told if they did not agree,their displays might become blocked by trees or a trailer.two months later,trees and a trailer appeared in front of the beam displays.
viacom outdoor advertising viacom,the lessee of the beam displays,initiated this lawsuit against pallco.pallco filed a against viacom and the beams.the dispute between viacom and pallco was later settled.the amended against the beams alleged both a public and a private nuisance based on violations of the outdoor advertising act.in particular,pallco alleged the beam displays had been illuminated and raised higher than the original permits allowed.pallco sought removal of the beam displays.
the beams met with caltrans in the summer of,six to eight months after being sued,to discuss the legality of their signs.at the meeting,the beams informed caltrans of the dimensions of their displays and presented a copy of the.
on september,the beams moved for a stay of the proceedings based on the primary jurisdiction of caltrans over pallco claims.that motion was apparently denied,as the matter proceeded to trial.
in april,the beams received a citation from caltrans regarding the raising and illumination of their displays.the beams met with caltrans and agreed to stop illuminating their displays.on may,caltrans sent the beams a letter indicating the physical configuration of their displays is legal and the beams have agreed not to illuminate their displays.the letter continued therefore,the violation issued on april,violation number has been corrected,and the subject displays are in compliance with the outdoor advertising act and its regulations.the displays may remain as configured and the applicable outdoor advertising permits may remain in force.
pallco was tried to the court,which issued a tentative decision.pallco requested a statement of decision.the court issued a proposed statement of decision finding the beam displays not to be a nuisance.in its statement,the court relied heavily on the prior determination by caltrans that the displays are in compliance with the outdoor advertising act.judgment was entered for the beams,including an award of costs as the prevailing party.
discussion 
pallco challenges the trial court conclusion the beam displays do not constitute a nuisance.in a more or less scattershot and redundant fashion,pallco argues the court improperly deferred to caltrans,misread the statutes and regulations applicable to outdoor advertising displays,ignored other applicable laws,incorrectly concluded pallco has no property interest worthy of protection and failed to make adequate findings in its statement of decision.we shall attempt to rearrange and synthesize pallco arguments so that they may be addressed in a coherent fashion.
regulation of outdoor advertising 
in,the legislature first regulated the use of advertising structures.however,this initial regulation was concerned only with matters of safety,structural integrity and decency.traverso people ex rel.of transportation cal th,d,traverso.three decades later,in an attempt to spearhead state legislation to beautify american cities,the federal government enacted the highway beautification act of.traverso,supra,at,d.in response,the california legislature amended the outdoor advertising act,greatly expanding the state regulatory authority over outdoor advertising by creating stricter standards for the erection and maintenance of billboards.citations.state regulation was extended to every mile of every major road in california with emphasis placed not only on public safety and welfare,but also on protecting the public investment in california highways and on aesthetic considerations.citation.id.at,d.
as amended,the outdoor advertising act declares that the regulation of advertising displays adjacent to public highways is necessary to promote the public safety,health,welfare,convenience and enjoyment of public travel,to protect the public investment in such highways,to preserve the scenic beauty of lands bordering on such highways,and to insure that information in the specific interest of the traveling public is presented safely and effectively bus.the legislature found outdoor advertising to be a legitimate commercial use of property adjacent to roads and highways,subd.a and an integral part of the business and marketing function that should be allowed to exist in business areas subject to reasonable regulation,subd.b.
under the outdoor advertising act,no advertising display may be placed in a business area if the display exceeds feet in height and feet in width,or square feet in total area,excluding the support structure.bus,subd.a.no advertising display may be placed within feet of another display on the same side of the highway or within feet of an interchange,subd.d.however,the foregoing does not apply to displays or displays in existence on august,that are permitted by city or county ordinance,subds.e e.
no advertising display may be placed without first obtaining a permit from caltrans.bus.any advertising display that is placed or exists in violation of the act is a public nuisance and may be removed by any public employee.bus.caltrans may revoke any permit and remove or destroy any display for failure to comply with the act after days written notice.bus.however,the remedies provided in the act for removal of illegal advertising displays are cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.bus.
deferring to caltrans 
pallco contends the trial court improperly deferred to caltrans to resolve the issues presented in this litigation.in its statement of decision,the court said 
the outdoor advertising act delegates to the department of transportation the authority to promulgate orders and regulations to implement the statute.caltrans has,in fact,adopted extensive and detailed regulations regarding outdoor advertising signs.caltrans also has responsibility for enforcement of the statute.section et of the regulations set forth the procedures by which caltrans deals with violations.the regulations provide a comprehensive system to enforce the federal and state standards regarding highway advertising while at the same time protecting individual property rights by allowing a period of time for correction of violations before an unlawful sign is removed.
in the circumstances,the court has a limited role in determining whether a regulation or the agency interpretation of its regulation is invalid.pallco makes no facial challenge to the regulation itself.pallco challenges the agency interpretation and application of its regulations.
pallco contends that the business and professions code section provision that the remedies of the statute are cumulative and not exclusive empowers the court to order removal of the signs.however,the arguments made by pallco essentially require the court to substitute its independent judgment on the facts and policy already determined by caltrans.the court has no authority to do so 
pallco contends that because this matter is one for the abatement of a nuisance,it is not controlled by the outdoor advertising act or caltrans.according to pallco,the was not an administrative action involving caltrans but an action for public and private nuisance authorized under the outdoor advertising act and focusing on a continuing nuisance.pallco cites business professions code section which,as indicated previously,states the remedies provided by the act are not exclusive to other remedies provided by law.
while it is true this matter is not a caltrans administrative proceeding under the outdoor advertising act,and such administrative proceeding may not be the exclusive vehicle for remedying an advertising display alleged to be a nuisance,it is nevertheless also true the sum and substance of pallco claim is that the beam displays are a nuisance solely because they violate the act.pallco does not claim the displays are unsafe or otherwise threaten adjacent property or the public.thus,the determination of whether the displays constitute a nuisance turns,in the first instance,on a proper interpretation of the act.
pallco argument that the trial court improperly deferred to caltrans concerns the agency interpretation of the relevant statutes and regulations.among other things,the court accepted caltrans interpretation that the owner of an offending display may have days to correct the situation and such correction does not require bringing the displays into conformity with current law.we shall address these arguments in the following parts.
correction period 
pallco contends caltrans erroneously interpreted the act and regulations to allow the beams days to remove the illumination from the displays.pallco argues this period is intended only as a notice and opportunity to defend,not an opportunity to correct.pallco further argues an interpretation of the outdoor advertising act to permit a correction period conflicts with common law and runs afoul of the highway beautification act,thereby subjecting the state to a loss of federal highway funds.
business and professions code section reads the director may revoke any license or permit for the failure to comply with this chapter and may remove and destroy any advertising display placed or maintained in violation of this chapter after days written notice caltrans regulations elaborate on this notice period.california code of regulations,title,section hereafter regulation states the owner has days from the date of the certified mailing of the violation notice to respond as follows correct the violation,or remove the display,or appeal to the director in writing pursuant to the provisions of regulation b reg,subd.e.
pallco contends regulation conflicts with business and professions code section,because the latter was intended only to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard,not an opportunity to correct.pallco argues the trial court improperly deferred to caltrans interpretation on this issue.we disagree.
in matters of statutory construction our fundamental concern is with legislative intent.brown kelly broadcasting cal d.in order to determine intent we begin with the language of the statute itself.ibid.if the language is clear,there is no need to resort to other indicia of intent and no need for further construction.lungren deukmejian cal d.
business and professions code section permits the director to revoke a license or permit and remove and destroy an advertising display placed or maintained in violation of this chapter after days written notice this provision is susceptible to two interpretations,depending on whether the after days written notice clause applies to remove and destroy or placed or maintained.if the former,an advertising display that is placed or maintained in violation of the act may be removed and destroyed after days written notice,regardless of whether the display is corrected during the days.if the latter,an advertising display may be removed and destroyed only if it is placed or maintained in violation of the act after days written notice.in other words,if at the end of the period the display is no longer placed or maintained in violation of the act,it has been corrected,it may no longer be removed and destroyed.
ordinarily,we give great weight to the interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency empowered to promulgate regulations to advance its purpose unless the interpretation is clearly erroneous.norman unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.if not clearly erroneous,such interpretation will normally be accepted.southern cal.lab.management.committee aubry th,d.
in support of its contention regulation conflicts with business and professions code section,pallco relies on traverso,supra,cal th,d,and the fact section is silent about any opportunity to correct a violation of the act.this reliance is misplaced.
in traverso,the state high court concluded business and professions code section,which at the time provided for a notice stats,ch,satisfied due process requirements.the court indicated due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard,and a right to be heard is implicit in the notice requirement.traverso,supra,cal th at,d.according to the court the period can serve only one function to allow the billboard owner sufficient time to investigate and,if appropriate,to contest caltrans determination that a violation has occurred.nothing in the act or the regulations indicates that caltrans would refuse to afford the billboard owner a hearing on request.id.at,d.
traverso does not answer the question presented here.the issue there was whether the notice requirement satisfies due process.the court concluded a right to be heard is implicit in the notice requirement.however,the court was not asked and did not consider if the period could also be used to correct an illegality.cases are not authority for propositions not considered therein.mckeon mercy healthcare sacramento cal th,d.
as for the silence of business and professions code section on whether there is an opportunity to correct,that section is also silent on whether the purpose of the notice requirement is to allow the offender an opportunity to object or to be heard.no significance should therefore be placed on such silence.
caltrans has interpreted business and professions code section to provide an opportunity to object to the notice,request a hearing,correct the violation,remove the display,or appeal the notice to the caltrans director.reg.there is nothing clearly erroneous in this interpretation.as discussed above,affording a right to correct is one of two possible interpretations of the statutory language.while pallco argues this interpretation is inconsistent with the intent of the act to eliminate nonconforming uses,pallco ignores the fact business and professions code section and regulation apply to all advertising display owners,not just those with nonconforming uses.pallco interpretation would eliminate the right to correct under all circumstances.this is inconsistent with a desire to bring offending advertising displays into compliance with the act as soon as possible.those served with a violation notice would have only one option short of removing the display,to fight the charge,thereby dragging out the process and depleting public resources.we conclude caltrans properly interpreted business and professions code section to allow an opportunity to correct the alleged violation.
pallco contends that,to the extent the period provides a right to correct,the beams were on notice of the violation at least by the time this lawsuit was filed,which was much longer than days before the illumination was removed.thus,pallco argues,the beams forfeited any right to correct by waiting until after they were cited by caltrans.
we disagree.it is one thing for caltrans to give notice of a violation of the act and quite another for a private party to give such notice by way of a lawsuit.caltrans is the agency charged with enforcement of the act,and the period is an element of the act.it is only notice by caltrans that triggers the period.bus.as already explained,the days is not intended solely as a notice period and,thus,the fact the offender is on notice for more than days is irrelevant.furthermore,notice by way of a private lawsuit can hardly substitute for notice by caltrans.to accept pallco interpretation and permit the period to begin upon suit by a private party would mean any time a display operator is sued by a competitor for a violation of the act,it must immediately correct the situation or forever lose the right to do so.this is not a reasonable interpretation of the act.
the meaning of correct 
as stated previously,regulation allows an owner days from the date of notice to c orrect the violation.reg,subd.e.other options available are to remove the display or appeal to the director of caltrans.reg,subd.e.pallco contends the right to correct the violation means,in the case of a nonconforming display,to bring the display into conformance with the act.in other words,it is not enough just to remove the offending feature of the display,such as in this case by removing illumination.the display must be made to comply with the current version of the act.thus,according to pallco,because the beam displays are nonconforming due to their location within feet of another display,the displays must be removed in order to be corrected.
pallco contends caltrans incorrectly interpreted the act to permit a nonconforming display to be returned to its nonconforming condition.this interpretation,pallco argues,is inconsistent with the public policy in favor of eliminating nonconforming uses.pallco further argues this interpretation treats owners of nonconforming displays better than owners of conforming displays.
as stated previously,we defer to caltrans interpretation of the act to the extent it is not clearly erroneous.in this instance,we find nothing clearly erroneous in caltrans determination that the word correct means a return to the conditions existing at the time the offending change to the display was made.under pallco interpretation,the only way the beam displays could be made to conform to the act in its present form is to remove them.however,regulation already provides removal as an option to the owner.reg,subd.e.thus,correct must mean something else.
excepting when clearly otherwise intended or indicated,words in a statute should be given their ordinary meaning and receive a sensible construction in accord with the commonly understood meaning thereof.county of los angeles frisbie cal d.the american heritage dictionary defines correct as t o remove the errors or mistakes from,t o remove,remedy,or counteract a malfunction,for example,or t o adjust so as to meet a standard or other required condition.american heritage dict.new college ed.under these definitions,a display that is made unlawful or improper by the addition of illumination could be corrected by removal of the illumination.this would remedy or counteract the offending condition and return the display to the condition extant before the error or mistake arose.
regulation gives the display owner the option to c orrect the violation.reg,subd.e.the violation in this instance is the addition of illumination.if the agency intended that the owner be required to bring the display into conformance with current law,one would expect the regulation to say something like correct the display.it does not.
as for unequal treatment of owners of conforming and nonconforming displays,we find none.both owners are treated the same in that both must eliminate the offending feature from their displays in order to correct them.
when the violation is determined 
pallco contends the trial court was required to consider the circumstances existing at the time their was filed rather than at the time of trial to determine if there was a violation of the outdoor advertising act.pallco argues that,once the displays were modified by adding illumination,no return to the status quo could remedy the situation.according to pallco,the addition of illumination was a new placement of an advertising display requiring a new permit,and removal of the illumination was a further placement requiring yet another permit.
business and professions code section reads no person shall place any advertising display within the areas affected by the provisions of this chapter in this state without first having secured a written permit from the director or from his authorized agent.business and professions code section defines to place to include the maintaining and the erecting,constructing,posting,painting,printing,tacking,nailing,gluing,sticking,carving or otherwise fastening,affixing or making visible any advertising display on or to the ground or any tree,bush,rock,fence,post,wall,building,structure or thing.it does not include any of the foregoing activities when performed incident to the change of an advertising message or customary maintenance of the advertising display.
the foregoing definition of to place suggests the term is limited to acts associated with the establishment of a display by any means on virtually any type of medium and does not include acts associated with making an existing display more visible,either by raising,enlarging or illuminating it.however,california code of regulations,title,section defines customary maintenance as not including any of the following,all of which acts are considered as a placing of a new advertising display raising the height of the display from ground level.relocating all or a portion of a display.adding a facing to a single facing display.increasing any dimensions of a facing turning the direction of a facing.adding illumination or a changeable message with the exception of a light box,tit,subd.b,italics added.
accepting caltrans interpretation of to place to include the addition of illumination,it is nevertheless evident caltrans interprets this definition not to encompass a change in a display that has been corrected after notice of a violation.pallco objection to relying on the circumstances existing at the time of trial rather than at the time the was filed is really just another way of challenging caltrans interpretation of the notice to allow for correction of the deficiency.pallco argues that,once a change has been made,it can not be unmade within the notice period.as explained previously,caltrans rejects such an interpretation,and so do we.
pallco argues allowing the beams to correct their violation long after it occurs will encourage a veritable cat and mouse game that could be played out by billboard operators maintain the nuisance until one of the six or eight overworked caltrans inspectors catch them.pallco argues under the t
