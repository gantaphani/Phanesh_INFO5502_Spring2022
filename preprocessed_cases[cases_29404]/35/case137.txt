business and professions code section,subdivision a section a provides that it is unlawful to advertise in a commercial electronic mail known as spam if the advertisement contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information.the issue this case presents is whether,under this section,it is unlawful to send commercial advertisements from multiple domain names for the purpose of bypassing spam filters.we hold that,on the undisputed facts of this case,the answer is no.
factual background 
the internet is an international network of interconnected computers that enables millions of people to communicate with one another and to access vast amounts of information from around the world.reno american civil liberties union.in order for the internet to function,each entity connected to it,computer,router,network,must have a unique numeric address.a unique identifier is required to enable one connected computer or network to identify and send information to another connected computer or network.those unique addresses are known as internet protocol addresses or ip addresses.citation.national advertising,network solutions,d,national advertising.an ip address consists of four sets of numbers separated by periods kremen cohen cir,such as.ip addresses function much like social security numbers or telephone numbers each ip address is unique and corresponds to a specific entity connected to the internet.national advertising,supra,at.
because the number strings that make up ip addresses can be difficult to remember,the internet community developed the domain name system,which enables users to link a numeric ip address to a unique and easier to remember domain name,thereby making it more convenient for users to access particular addresses on the internet.national advertising,supra,d at.domain,of at least two groups of alphanumeric characters,each known as a string,separated by a period or dot.the last farthest to the the domain.the string is the domain name and identifies the person or organization internet computer site.thomas network solutions.
in march,plaintiff craig kleffman filed this class action in state court against defendants vonage holdings,vonage america,and vonage marketing,vonage,asserting a claim under section a.as noted above,that section makes it unlawful to advertise in a commercial advertisement that contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information.in relevant part,kleffman alleged the following vonage,by and through its marketing agents,sent him unsolicited advertisements for its broadband telephone services using different domain names and.these different domain names can all be traced to a single physical address in nevada where vonage marketing agent is located.none of these domain names provides any indication to the recipient or its spam filter that the advertisement is from vonage.vonage use of these multiple domain names reduces the likelihood that an internet service provider isp will identify these advertisements as spam and block them before they reach the email inboxes of kleffman and class members.an isp may block a message because a domain name is associated with the sending of high volumes of spam,so recipients could easily block all of vonage advertisements i f vonage and its marketing agents were to use a single domain name to send those advertisements.vonage could have easily and less expensively sent all of its advertisements using a single domain name,and the only reason it used multiple domain names is to mislead email service providers and recipients,and their spam filters.in other words,vonage essentially creates multiple identities,as represented by the multiple domain names,in order to spread out the total volume of its advertisements and reduce the volume sent via each domain name,a strategy deliberately calculated to trick the isps into believing there are multiple senders,when in actuality the emails are sent for the ultimate single beneficiary vonage.the multitude of from identities falsifies and misrepresents the true sender identity and allows unwanted commercial email messages to infiltrate consumers inboxes.vonage use of multiple domain names to bypass spam filters,its failure to use a single domain name in sending its advertisements,and its failure to identify vonage in the domain name from which the advertisements were sent,through the use of a generic subdomain name such as,constitute falsified and misrepresented header information prohibited by section a.
after vonage removed the case to federal court,it moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing the complaint failed to state a claim under section a.the district court agreed and dismissed the action with prejudice and without leave to amend,stating kleffman does not actually allege that the content of vonage email was false,misrepresented or forged,and indeed points to nothing misleading about any single given email.the headers are allegedly falsified because,though they literally and truthfully identify the sender,they are part of a mechanism to avoid legislation and therefore imply that they originate from different sources.however,under the plain language of the statute,which requires that an email message contain a falsified,misrepresented or forged header,the claim fails.the failure to send mail from a single domain name that includes the word vonage is simply not a misrepresentation in any ordinary sense of the word.moreover,while kleffman might characterize an email as containing the implicit misrepresentation i am not from the same sources as the others,this is more than the plain language of the statute would bear.
kleffman appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,the ninth circuit asked us to decide the following question does sending unsolicited commercial advertisements from multiple domain names for the purpose of bypassing spam filters constitute falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information under section a we granted the ninth circuit request 
discussion 
at issue here is the scope of section a,which makes it unlawful to advertise in a commercial advertisement that contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information.as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task in considering this issue is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.people cole cal th.
in resolving the parties disagreement over the meaning of section a,it is useful to begin by noting the matters on which they agree.there is no dispute here that the domain names in question were part of the header information within the meaning of section a there also is no dispute that the domain names used to send vonage advertisements,and reflected in the header information of these advertisements,actually exist and are technically accurate,literally correct,and fully traceable to vonage marketing agents.finally,there is no dispute that,in light of this conceded fact,the neither contained nor were accompanied by falsified or forged header information within the meaning of section a.thus,the parties agree that the question here is whether the contained or were accompanied by misrepresented header information within the meaning of that section.
vonage answer to this question is relatively straightforward.it asserts that header information is not misrepresented within the meaning of section a unless it contains a false representation of fact.vonage reasons that,when the legislature drafted the statute,this was the established legal definition of the term misrepresent for purposes of the tort of misrepresentation,and nothing indicates the legislature intended to use the term in section a to convey some other meaning.applying this definition,vonage argues that advertisements from multiple domain names with fully accurate and traceable header information do not violate the statute because they contain no false representation.
kleffman,quoting cooley superior court cal th,asserts that vonage construction violates the rule of statutory construction that c ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.he reasons that because section a also expressly prohibits falsified header information,misrepresented header information must encompass something in addition to a false statement of fact otherwise,the term misrepresented adds nothing to the statute and has no meaning.
instead,kleffman asserts,in defining the term misrepresented for purposes of section a,we should look to other statutory claims in the false advertising sections of the business and professions code,such as section,which prohibits fraudulent business practices,and section,which prohibits false or misleading advertising.these statutes,kleffman argues,apply where advertising is not actually false,but thought likely to mislead or deceive,or is in fact false.by their breadth,they encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive.in kleffman view,this established legal definition is what we should presume the legislature had in mind when it drafted section a to prohibit misrepresented header information.alternatively,kleffman asserts,we should,construe the term misrepresent in accordance with its ordinary meaning as set forth in several lay dictionaries,i,to give a misleading representation or idea of something 
applying these tests,kleffman argues the at issue here contained or were accompanied by misrepresented header information within the meaning of section a.in kleffman view,the problem is not that the were sent from multiple domain names,or that the domain names did not include the word vonage.indeed,kleffman expressly disavows any requirement that an advertiser use a single domain name or identify in the domain name the contents,the name of the sending party,or the advertiser identity.the problem,kleffman asserts,is the random,varied,garbled,and nonsensical nature of the multiple domain names,which created the misleading or deceptive misrepresentation that they were from different entities when in fact they were all from vonage via its solo marketing agent.according to kleffman,the use of multiple garbled and nonsensical domain names was unnecessary and serve d no purpose but to conceal the single source of these advertisements in order to bypass spam filters,which block when a domain name is associated with the sending of high volumes of spam.therefore,the garbled and nonsensical nature of the domain names evidence d an intent to bypass spam filters that does not exist with multiple domain names in and of themselves.in short,kleffman argues,section a permits advertisements sent from multiple domain names,but only if they are not deceptive by virtue of their utterly random and nonsensical nature.
there are several problems with kleffman analysis.first,his view that we should look to sections and fails to account for the significant linguistic differences between those statutes and section a.unlike section a,neither section nor section uses the word misrepresented or any form of that word.rather,as relevant here,section applies to statements that are untrue or misleading italics added,and section applies to advertising that is unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading italics added.thus,these statutes expressly use the term misleading that kleffman asserts we should read into section a in order to define the term misrepresented.this approach contravenes the principle that w hen the legislature uses materially different language in statutory provisions addressing the same subject or related subjects,the normal inference is that the legislature intended a difference in meaning.citation.people trevino cal th.
second,kleffman approach,including his reliance on dictionaries that use the word mislead to define the word misrepresent,overlooks the language of the provision that immediately follows section a.section,subdivision a,prohibits the sending of an advertisement with a subject line that is likely to mislead a recipient.italics added.thus,in the very next provision of the same statute,the legislature expressly used the likely to mislead language kleffman would use to define the word misrepresented in section a.this approach contravenes the principle that when different words are used in contemporaneously enacted,adjoining subdivisions of a statute,the inference is compelling that a difference in meaning was intended.people jones cal d,italics omitted see also briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,w here different words or phrases are used in the same connection in different parts of a statute,it is presumed the legislature intended a different meaning.it also ignores the principle that when a statute contains a list or catalogue of items,a court should determine the meaning of each by reference to the others,giving preference to an interpretation that uniformly treats items similar in nature and scope.moore california state bd.of accountancy cal th.under this principle,the meaning of the word misrepresented in section a takes color from the other words listed in the same provision falsified and forged not from the distinctly different likely to mislead language found in the next provision,section,subdivision a.
moreover,it is significant that the language in section,subdivision a,fully articulating the standard applicable to subject lines likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances is virtually identical to the language that,only months before section passage,a california appellate court announced for applying sections and.see lavie procter gamble th,standard for claims under and is whether the ordinary consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances is likely to be deceived or misled lavie.thus,the legislature clearly knew how to draft language invoking the likely to mislead standard of sections and.that it did so in drafting section,subdivision a,but not in drafting the immediately preceding a significantly undermines kleffman argument.
nevertheless,kleffman argues that the relevant legislative history supports his construction of section a.he acknowledges that,other than repeat section a language verbatim,the legislative analyses of the statute enacting bill bill reg.sess.did not discuss the provision or mention the types of header information that would violate it.instead,he relies principally on a legislative analysis of a subsequent bill that amended section a and other sections bill reg.sess,which stated that the federal act did not preempt the right of action under state law against those who send spam with misleading or falsified headers.assem.com.on business profession,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.based on this statement,kleffman asserts that the legislature shorthand for misrepresented,or forged seems to be misleading.
to the extent the statutory language,read in context,remains ambiguous,such that legislative history is relevant see people.gonzalez cal th,it does not support kleffman position.the very next sentence of the analysis kleffman quotes stated that the amendment to section a was intended to merely provide language and ensure a private right of action against spammers who use falsified headers,which is not in conflict with federal law.assem.com.on business profession,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.several other analyses repeated this statement explained that the amendment created a private right of action for falsified.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,bill ensure s a private right of action against spammers who use falsified headers and creates a stand alone section for falsified emails to avoid confusion as to what parts of existing state law are preempted by federal law and what parts remain viable in this area assem.com.on appropriations,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,creates section for falsified reading analysis,bill reg.sess.as amended,same rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,same.thus,kleffman overstates the significance of the imprecise and summary language contained in the isolated statement he cites.
moreover,in other respects,the legislative history of the amendment to section a reflects a careful and purposeful distinction between the terms misrepresented and misleading.the legislative counsel digest of the amending bill as introduced stated that existing law prohibited the sending of an advertisement that contains or is accompanied by certain falsified,misrepresented,obscured,or misleading information.bill reg.sess.as introduced.in the next version of the bill,this statement was revised to explain that existing law prohibited the sending of an advertisement that contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,obscured,or forged header information,or if the has a misleading subject line.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.june.this revised language expressly recognized the linguistic differences between subdivision a and of section.thus,the legislative history of the amendment does not support kleffman view that misrepresented in section a means misleading or likely to mislead.
more broadly,for several reasons,we can not reasonably interpret the statute as making it unlawful to use the multiple domain names at issue in this case.first,it seems evident the legislature did not intend section a generally to prohibit the use of multiple domain names.at the same time it enacted that section,the legislature addressed the subject of multiple domain names by passing another,subdivision c that prohibits the use of scripts or other automated means to register for multiple electronic mail accounts from which to send,or enable another to send,an unsolicited commercial advertisement.if mere use of multiple domain names,which requires registration of multiple electronic accounts,constituted misrepresented header information for purposes of section a,then section,subdivision c,would be essentially useless.of course,in construing section a,we must avoid interpretations that would render related provisions unnecessary or redundant.people fierro cal th.notably,as explained above,kleffman concedes that mere use of multiple domain names does not in and of itself violate section a.
second,it also seems evident the legislature did not intend section a to make it unlawful to use a domain name in a single that does not make clear the identity of either the sender or the on whose behalf the advertisement is sent.to begin with,a domain name in a single that does not identify the sender,the,or any other person or entity simply does not make any representation regarding the source,either express or implied,within the common understanding of that term,so it can not be said to constitute misrepresented information within the meaning of section a moreover,a contrary conclusion would raise significant preemption problems.federal law provides that the act supersedes any statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages,except to the extent that any such statute,regulation,or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.b.regarding the scope of this provision,a congressional committee report stated that a state law requiring some or all commercial to carry specific types of labels,or to follow a certain format or contain specified content,would be preempted,reprinted in cong.admin.news.relying on this statement,the ninth circuit has held that a state law requiring an from field to include the name of the person or entity who actually sent the or who hired the sender constitutes a content or labeling requirement that is clearly subject to preemption.citation.gordon virtumundo,cir,gordon.thus,construing section a as requiring this kind of information would contravene the rule that courts should,if reasonably possible,construe a statute in a manner that avoids any doubt about its constitutional validity.citations.association for retarded citizens department of developmental services cal d,see also county of los angeles superior court cal th,supremacy clause of the federal constitution prohibits a state court from applying state law that is inconsistent with federal law.reinforcing application of this general principle in this case is the legislative history of the amendment to section a,which explains that a purpose of the amendment was to conform the statute to the act.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.again,as explained above,kleffman agrees that section a does not require a domain name in a single to include such identifying information.
given these conclusions,we find that a single with an accurate and traceable domain name neither contains nor is accompanied by misrepresented header information within the meaning of section a merely because its domain name is,according to kleffman,random,varied,garbled,and nonsensical when viewed in conjunction with domain names used in other an with an accurate and traceable domain name makes no affirmative representation or statement of fact that is false.it is true that the term misrepresent may encompass situations where someone,having undertaken to provide information regarding a matter,fails to disclose all facts that materially qualify the limited facts disclosed.citations.randi muroc joint unified school dist.cal th.however,this principle does not apply here.contrary to kleffman assertion,as a matter of law,the use of an accurate and traceable domain name in an can not reasonably be understood to be an implied assertion that the source of that is different from the source of another containing a different domain name.this is especially true in this case,given that the header information in each of the kleffman allegedly received contained the term greatcallrates in the part of the sender address that preceded the domain name therefore,the sender failure to include additional information did not render the header information misrepresented.and,absent a misrepresentation,use of a given domain name can not constitute misrepresented header information within the meaning of section a,even if the sender chose the domain name for the purpose of bypassing spam filters 
moreover,as a practical matter,the rule kleffman would have us using multiple domain names violates section a if those names are random,varied,garbled,and nonsensical is unworkable.kleffman offers no definition of these terms and no standard for applying them as amici curiae supporting vonage assert d etermining whether a domain name is sensible,nonsensical,random,or is so subjective as to make the inquiry meaningless.advertisers,distributors,and even casual senders of commercial advertisements,as broadly defined by section,subdivision c would face tremendous uncertainty about whether their actions run afoul of this undefined standard.we would add that the uncertainty inherent in kleffman construction is especially problematic given that a violation of section a constitutes a misdemeanor that is punishable by imprisonment in county jail for up to six months,subd.c see people avery cal th,where reasonable constructions of statute prescribing criminal penalties stand in relative equipoise,courts generally adopt construction more favorable to offender.
kleffman insists his construction is consistent with the relevant legislative history.although acknowledging that the legislative analyses of section a enacting bill did not mention the types of header information that would violate the statute,he cites a letter written by the legislative author of both the enacting bill and its amendment,which stated examples of violations of section could include,among other things,t he use of multiple email addresses domain names created for the sole purpose of bypassing and blacklists.however,this statement is entitled to no weight,because we do not consider statements of a bill author or any other legislator unless they reiterate legislative discussion and events leading up to the bill passage martin szeto cal th,and kleffman concedes there is no evidence the statement he cites meets this requirement
