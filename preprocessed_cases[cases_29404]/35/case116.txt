this appeal concerns a preliminary injunction entered in a false advertising case under a of the lanham act,a.viance,llc viance released several advertising statements expressing serious safety concerns regarding the use of wood treated with osmose,osmose wood preservative called mcq in response to these advertisements,osmose brought this suit against viance,alleging that the advertisements constituted false advertising in violation of a of the lanham act and various state laws because certain studies performed by viance did not support the broad safety concerns raised in the advertisements.viance responded in kind via counterclaims,alleging that osmose had engaged in false advertising of its own by releasing advertisements that inaccurately bolstered its mcq product.each side moved for a preliminary injunction.after a lengthy hearing,the district court granted osmose motion for a preliminary injunction against viance,but denied viance motion for a preliminary injunction against osmose.viance appeals only the entry of injunctive relief against it.after careful review,we affirm in part,vacate one provision of the injunction and remand the balance with instruction that it be modified to remove any first amendment concerns.
background 
viance and osmose are competitors in the wood preservative market.each develops,manufactures,and sells preservatives used to protect wood against rot,decay,and insect attack.both companies sell wood preservatives,but the products differ in how the copper is introduced in the wood.viance manufactures and sells a preservative called acq,which stands for alkaline copper quaternary.in acq,copper is solubilized in a solution.throughout the early part of this decade,acq was the dominant product in the market.at that time,osmose used the technology in its own products under a license from viance.
in the early,osmose also began to develop a new technology that used micronized copper suspended in solution,instead of solubilized copper as used in acq.osmose trademarked this technology and markets it as micropro.osmose used the micropro technology to create a wood preservative to compete with acq.it called this new preservative mcq,which stands for micronized copper quaternary.osmose began marketing its mcq product in early.osmose has obtained certification from the icc evaluation service an association that issues evaluation reports for building products and material to determine whether they comply with model building codes for its mcq product,but mcq has not been certified by the america wood protection association awpa.viance acq is approved by both organizations.the development of mcq has eaten into acq share of the wood preservative market.
after the introduction of mcq into the market,viance began testing the efficacy of mcq.
viance testing 
sem testing 
viance first step was to purchase commercially available wood and send it to a lab to be analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem.viance theorized that,unlike the soluble copper ions found in acq,the suspended micronized copper particles found in mcq might not penetrate the wood in sufficient quantities to provide the necessary protection against microorganisms that produce soft rot.it sought to verify this concern through sem testing.according to viance,the sem results verified its doubts because the studies showed insufficient penetration of copper into the cell walls and a concentration of copper in the cell walls of wood that was significantly lower than wood.kevin archer of viance presented the findings at the international research group on wood protection conference.in his presentation,archer concluded that the copper concentration in the cell walls of wood was significantly lower than in wood treated with acq but that the long term performance implications in ground contact were unknown.archer did not produce a paper describing the methods and results of the sem tests in conjunction with his presentation.
field stake testing 
viance then undertook field stake tests on wood.field stake tests are an accepted method of testing the effectiveness of a wood preservative.in the tests,stakes are treated with preservative and placed in the soil.the stakes are then evaluated periodically for decay.stakes treated with the preservative being tested are often measured against untreated stakes and stakes treated with a proven preservative to evaluate the tested preservative relative performance.the tests performed by viance began in april and may of in hilo,hawaii,and tanegashima,japan.for these particular tests,viance bought commercially available square posts treated with either acq or mcq and cut stakes from the corners of each viance hired darrel nicholas,a wood scientist at mississippi state university,to inspect and rate the stakes.he concluded that mcq stakes were performing poorly and that it is apparent that the mcq formulation is not performing in ground contact as would be expected for a commercial wood preservative.he qualified his findings,however,by noting that additional data would be required to confirm his concern about the performance of products.nicholas has not inspected the stakes since his initial inspection.
viance then conducted an survey of wood.viance hired a private investigation firm to search central florida for posts showing signs of decay.in july,that firm prepared a report noting that it had visited eighteen sites and interviewed numerous retailers and builders and that none had experienced or heard of any problems regarding premature decay in products.
viance continued to search.in november,it discovered posts allegedly showing premature decay in baton rouge,louisiana.viance hired timber products inspection,timber products,an independent company that inspects and tests wood products,to test the eleven posts removed from the baton rouge site.viance chose the posts to extract.timber products rated the posts on the awpa scale,a point scale of soundness in which represents sound wood and represents total failure on november,timber products issued a report november tp report in which it rated all eleven mcq posts removed from the louisiana site as a or on the scale.timber products also noted that its report should not be considered as acceptance or rejection for the grade,treatment or physical quality of the tested material.
sometime in late or early,viance discovered posts allegedly showing signs of premature decay in alpharetta,georgia.the posts were allegedly installed in september or october of.viance selected posts and had timber products assign them a visual rating.timber products also took fourteen of the posts and subjected them to a more thorough investigation.on january,timber products released another report summarizing its findings january tp report.of the posts visually inspected,posts rated a,eleven rated a,five rated a,two rated an,and one rated a.of the fourteen posts subjected to further examination,four posts rated a,five posts rated a,two posts rated a,two posts rated an,and one post rated a.the january tp report contained the same disclaimer that the report should not be considered as acceptance or rejection for the grade,treatment or physical quality of the tested material.
over the course of its search,viance estimates that it inspected roughly posts,of which were treated with mcq.thus,they investigated roughly posts.
viance advertisements 
after receiving the timber products reports,viance issued two press releases titled decaying posts confirm performance concerns with micronized copper wood preservatives and hidden danger in your backyard.the press releases contained various statements related to both its testing and safety concerns regarding the use of wood.for instance,one release begins by stating viance has uncovered evidence that micronized copper quaternary mcq preservative has failed to prevent decay of wood posts at several subdivisions in the southeastern united states.another release begins findings on posts at residential locations reveal dramatic evidence that wood treated with micronized copper preservative mcq is decaying more rapidly than anticipated.the releases go on to reference timber products role in the testing.the releases also contain statements raising concerns about the safety of posts.for instance,the first states the decay,verified by timber products inspection tpi,is considered unacceptable for providing structural integrity for residential and commercial uses and the severity of the decay on these micronized posts raises alarming consumer safety concerns about structures built using micronized copper treated wood.the second states these decay findings raise serious concerns about the structural integrity and safety of outdoor structures,such as decks and fencing,built with micronized copper preservative within the last three years.viance also sent an email with the subject line is a treated wood lawsuit in your future containing the statement the safety of your customers and clients is at stake if your projects support structures are being built with micronized treated wood that can not adequately resist decay.
response to viance advertisements 
viance advertisements prompted responses from multiple parties.osmose published its own press release criticizing viance studies.timber products also issued a press release clarifying its role in the viance study and the limitations of its report.timber products noted that it tested only the posts that viance directed it to test and that it did not identify a random sampling for testing,that there was a subjective element in rating the posts,that no comparable study existed for other preservatives,that it was an independent agency retained by viance and did not advocate for any particular preservative,and that it hoped the information in its clarification would preclude interested parties from using the report to make generalizations that may not be supported by the report.a group of members of the lumber community also banded together and issued a release and a letter to viance asking it to abandon its campaign.
on march,osmose filed a complaint against viance and several of its officers and employees alleging false advertising under a of the lanham act and various related false advertising claims under georgia law.in addition to monetary damages,osmose sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining viance from making false or misleading statements critical of micropro technology,mcq,or other micronized copper wood preservative systems.at that time,osmose also sought a temporary restraining order tro.the district court granted the motion for the tro on march.
on april,viance filed both an answer denying the allegations of the complaint and counterclaims against osmose and several of its officers and employees asserting false advertising claims under a of the lanham act and various related claims under georgia law.viance sought money damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining osmose from making false or misleading statements to bolster its micronized copper products.on april,viance also filed a motion for a tro.the district court denied that motion on april.
the district court held a hearing on both parties motions for a preliminary injunction from june,to july.in an order issued on september,the district court granted osmose motion for a preliminary injunction and denied viance motion for the same.the injunction contains the following specific provisions 
defendants may publish the results of the survey performed by viance and the field stake tests conducted in hawaii and japan.
defendants are enjoined,however,from claiming or implying that those studies demonstrate that structures built using micronized wood are unsafe,pose a threat to consumers,or are structurally unsound.
defendants are enjoined from claiming or implying that the studies demonstrate that micronized copper preservatives are defective in general or are less effective than solubalized copper preservatives.
defendants may not draw their own conclusions about what the studies indicate and then attribute those conclusions to the studies themselves unless the data in the studies clearly support such conclusions.any conclusions attributed to the studies must be stated in the studies themselves or must be readily apparent from the data contained in the studies.
defendants may not indicate or imply that any conclusions or opinions stated in their advertisements concerning the effectiveness of micronized copper preservatives or the safety of structures built with micronized wood are verified or endorsed by timber products.
defendants may not claim or imply that osmose micropro process was not certified as epp by scs,or that scs did not consider life cycle analysis including efficacy analysis in awarding epp certification to osmose micropro process.
viance timely appealed the preliminary injunction entered against it

iii.discussion 
a district court may grant a preliminary injunction only if the movant establishes the following a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying case,the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,the harm suffered by the movant in the absence of an injunction would exceed the harm suffered by the opposing party if the injunction issued,and an injunction would not disserve the public interest.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.viance argues that the district court erred in several respects.first,viance argues the district court clearly erred in concluding that osmose had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success because its advertisements were not literally false.second,viance argues that the district court abused its discretion by entering injunctive relief against it on a point on which it had requested injunctive relief against osmose.third,viance argues that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the balance of the preliminary injunction factors weighed in favor of granting injunctive relief.finally,viance argues that the terms of the preliminary injunction violate the first amendment because it is not restricted to commercial advertising or promotional statements 
likelihood of success 
section a of the lanham act provides,in relevant part,as follows 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which

shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
in order to establish the requisite likelihood of success on a false advertising claim,the movant must establish that the ads of the opposing party were false or misleading,the ads deceived,or had the capacity to deceive,consumers,the deception had a material effect on purchasing decisions,the misrepresented product or service affects interstate commerce,and the movant has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the false advertising.axiom worldwide,at internal quotation marks omitted.
literal falsity of statements regarding mcq 
the first element of a false advertising claim is satisfied if the challenged advertisement is literally false,or if the challenged advertisement is literally true,but misleading.johnson johnson vision care,contacts,cir.when determining whether an advertisement is literally false or misleading,courts must analyze the message conveyed in full context,and must view the face of the statement in its entirety id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the distinction between literally false and merely misleading statements is often a fine line.axiom worldwide,at.the ambiguity of the statement at issue,or the lack thereof,is significant.statements that have an unambiguous meaning,either facially or considered in context,may be classified as literally false.united indus.clorox,cir.as the meaning of a statement becomes less clear,however,and it becomes susceptible to multiple meanings,the statement is more likely to be merely misleading.time warner cable,directv,cir i f the language or graphic is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,the advertisement can not be literally false.see also clorox,at stating that as claims become more attenuated or suggestive they are less susceptible to a literally false characterization.literal falsity is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.axiom worldwide,at.
meaning of the statements 
the district court construed the various statements in the advertisements as tests prove or establishment claims,placing the burden on osmose to demonstrate that viance tests do not establish the proposition for which they are cited.in contacts,we explained that the plaintiff burden in proving an advertisement to be literally false should depend on whether the defendant advertisement cites consumer testing.at citing fleet smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,cir rhone poulenc rorer pharms.marion merrell dow,cir castrol,quaker state,cir advertising that cites such testing is classified as an establishment claim.id.in order to prove the literal falsity of such a claim,the plaintiff must prove only that the tests did not establish the proposition for which they were cited.id.
in concluding that viance advertising claims were tests prove or establishment claims,the district court specifically cited the following statements from the press releases 
t he severity of the decay on these micronized posts raises alarming consumer safety concerns about structures built using micronized copper treated wood.
viance is concerned that decay occurring this early in the service life of wood poses a substantial safety hazard to consumers with structures built from micronized wood.id.at.
these findings provide evidence that micronized wood is prone to premature decay,and viance believes that its continued use raises serious consumer safety concerns.id.
these decay findings raise serious concerns about the structural integrity and safety of outdoor structures,such as decks and fencing,built with micronized copper preservatives within the last three years.
we are very concerned about the safety of possibly millions of consumers whose decks and other structures were built with micronized wood because the wood may be subject to early failure and possible collapse.id.
and the following statements from the email 
the safety of your customers and clients is at stake if your projects support structures are being built with micronized treated wood that can not adequately resist decay.
our findings show that micronized wood will lead to problems with structural integrity.id.
we are concerned that micronized copper wood preservative systems fail to prevent decay and termite attack,thereby compromising the dependability of the wood used to build support structures.in the case of raised decks,this poses a considerable safety hazard as deck supports we believe will fail.id.
we agree with the district court classification of viance statements as tests prove or establishment claims.the references to findings or decay findings clearly refer to the results of viance testing as captured in the field stake tests and,most particularly,the timber products reports.the statements then use those findings as support for conclusions regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq or structures built using posts.thus,the district court did not clearly err in classifying these statements as establishment claims.because the advertising statements were tests prove or establishment claims,the burden of proof on osmose was only to demonstrate that the field stake tests and the survey results captured in the timber products reports do not support the conclusions viance draws with regards to the safety and efficacy of mcq.see,quaker state,at.in other words,osmose,as a plaintiff challenging tests prove or establishment claims,does not have to affirmatively prove that viance safety concerns are false rather,osmose has to prove only that viance tests do not support viance conclusions.
viance contends that most of these advertising statements are a combination of factual statements,which it contends are truthful,and statements of opinion.for instance,it points to the statement these findings provide evidence that micronized wood is prone to premature decay,and viance believes that its continued use raises serious consumer safety concerns.it argues that this statement is composed of two assertions.first,the assertion that the findings show premature decay,which it argues is literally true.and second,the assertion that viance believes the use of treated wood raises serious safety concerns,which it argues is a opinion for several reasons,viance argument does not persuade us that the district court clearly erred in determining these statements were literally false.
even taken in isolation,viance purported statements of opinion might be reasonably interpreted as being more than a simple statement of opinion.statements of opinion are generally not actionable.see,pizza hut,papa john int l,cir bald assertions of superiority or general statements of opinion can not form the basis of lanham act liability.but viance statements regarding serious safety concerns arguably could be construed as more than general statements of opinion.representations that the use of a particular product poses a considerable safety hazard because of a risk of failure or that structures built with micronized wood might be at risk because the wood may be subject to early failure and possible collapse arguably are reasonably interpreted as more than subjective statements regarding the efficacy or superiority of a product.instead,they can be viewed as expressing an objective risk of serious consequences that fairly implies a basis for that statement.see restatement of unfair competition cmt.some representations of opinion may imply the existence of facts that justify the opinion.viance cites pizza hut for the proposition that a statement is one of fact if it admits of being adjudged true or false in a way that admits of empirical verification.at internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the proposition of serious safety risks because of premature failure of wood arguably is one that could be judged true or false based on empirical testing of the product.viance,in fact,attempted to undertake that testing in its field stake tests and surveys.
but we need not decide whether these purported statements of opinion viewed in isolation are actionable because the context in which these statements appear makes it clear that the district court reasonably interpreted these statements as making unambiguous establishment or tests prove claims.this court has recognized the importance of context when analyzing false advertising claims.see contacts,at it is true that a court must analyze the message conveyed in full context,and that the court must view the face of the statement in its entirety,rather than examining the eyes,nose,and mouth separately and in isolation from each other.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also clorox,at in assessing whether an advertisement is literally false,a court must analyze the message conveyed within its full context.avis rent a car,hertz,cir discussing the importance of context and viewing the advertisement in its entirety when determining literal falsity.viance purported statements of opinion regarding serious safety concerns were generally made in the same sentence as a reference to its findings or decay findings,which referred to the field stake tests and,most particularly,the survey results described in the timber products reports.and when its statements of opinion were not located in the same sentence as a reference to the findings,reference to the findings can be found in the closely surrounding text.viewing the entire mosaic,avis,at internal quotation marks omitted,the references to the decay findings were linked to the expressions of safety concerns in a way that clearly indicated that the findings were the basis of and support for the expressions of safety concerns.see castrol pennzoil,cir finding claims actionable when defendant sought to substantiate its claims of superiority by reference to testing.
beyond that,there are several statements that are not even fairly subject to the sort of parsing that viance proposes.for instance,one advertisement states that t he severity of the decay on these micronized posts raises alarming consumer safety concerns about structures built using micronized copper treated wood.the other states that these decay findings raise serious concerns about the structural integrity and safety of outdoor structures,such as decks and fencing,built with micronized copper preservatives within the last three years.and the email states that our findings show that micronized wood will lead to problems with structural integrity.none of these statements express anything arguably in the form of an opinion.instead,they directly link the findings from viance studies to problems with mcq or concerns for the structural integrity and safety of wood and structures built from it.on their face,these statements are unambiguous establishment claims.and given that the statements that viance seeks to classify as a mixture of fact and opinion were intimately linked with these statements,the district court did not clearly err in determining that the foregoing statements made unambiguous establishment claims.
in sum,we can not conclude that the district court was clearly erroneous in its findings as to the meaning of viance statements.the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the claims were establishment claims unambiguously asserting that the tests supported the structural integrity and safety concerns expressed in the advertisements.
evidence in support of the district court factual findings 
having determined the meaning of the statements,we turn to the district court finding that the statements were literally false because viance broad conclusions concerning the safety of structures built with wood were not adequately supported by viance field stake and tests.the district court gave three particular bases for its finding.first,viance drew broad conclusions about the safety of structures built with wood,but it never inspected structures built with wood.instead,it only inspected fence posts and lot markers in its survey and stakes in its field stake test.second,viance had to go to considerable trouble to find any posts showing decay in its survey,and ultimately only found that thirteen of the posts it inspected were rated a or lower.the district court concluded that such a low percentage did not support broad generalizations about the integrity or safety of structures built with wood.third,the reports by the inspecting parties on the survey and field stake tests were subject to qualification.relative to the survey,timber products specifically qualified its reports as not providing the basis for any conclusion as to the grade,treatment,or physical quality of posts.todd greer,vice president of timber products,also made several statements qualifying the findings in the reports.and in connection with the field stake tests,nicholas qualified his concerns by noting that additional data would be required to confirm concerns about the performance of mcq in applications.yet nicholas never inspected the stakes after his initial inspection,nor did he know if viance had either.in light of those considerations,the district court concluded that the tests did not support broad conclusions about the safety of structures built with wood.we examine in turn these three grounds for the district court finding.
testing of fence posts and stakes 
viance first attacks the district court reliance on the fact that viance tested only fence posts and stakes,but not structures.viance does not dispute that it did not test structures built with wood,but does dispute the conclusion which it attributes to the district court that tests on stakes and fence posts are not sufficient to form conclusions as to the safety of structures built with wood.in support of its argument,viance cites to testimony establishing that the posts tested in the survey are the exact type of posts used to build structures and that what matters is testing wood in ground contact,not the specific use of the wood prior to the testing.viance also points to testimony establishing that field stake testing is a standard industry method for testing the efficacy of wood preservatives.
the district court did not fully explain why viance testing of fence posts and stakes could not support safety concerns regarding structures built with wood.we see two possible interpretations of this first rationale of the district court.the district court may have meant that the particular tests performed did not purport to indicate that the decay revealed was indicative of the structural weakness and safety concerns expressed in viance advertisements.as the district court said in this regard viance did not test the effect of the alleged decay on the integrity of structures built with mcq treated wood.to the extent this was the reasoning of the district court,it is not clearly erroneous in fact,evidence indicates that viance tests did not assess the effect of the alleged decay on the structural integrity of the wood.as thus understood,the district court appropriately relied on the fact that viance tests did not support the broad conclusions regarding the structural integrity and safety of wood expressed in viance advertisements.we adopt the foregoing construction of the district court reasoning and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the tests performed did not support viance conclusions regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq 
ii.district court analysis of the results of the survey 
the district court found thirteen of the posts examined showed decay at a rating of or below.the district court thus found that only of the posts showed significant decay,a percentage the district court found was too low to support serious concerns regarding the structural integrity and safety of wood.viance attacks the district court calculations as to the percentage of posts that showed decay and its conclusion that such a low percentage did not support serious safety concerns.viance contends that although it saw roughly posts in its survey,it did not analyze all of them.thus,viance argues that using as the baseline for the percentage that showed decay was error.it also claims that the district court finding that thirteen of the posts were rated or less also is not supported by the record.that being the case,viance argues that the district court conclusion that of the posts showed decay is not supported by the record.viance suggests that an appropriate analysis shows that of the total posts analyzed by timber products,nineteen of the georgia posts analyzed rated or lower and eleven of the louisiana posts rated or lower therefore,roughly of the posts showed decay,a percentage sufficient to support serious safety concerns.
the district court reasoning on this point has four components the threshold rating at which a post should be counted as having significant decay,the number of posts decayed under that standard,the number of posts comprising the total sample,and whether the resulting percentage of decayed posts supports a conclusion of serious safety concerns.
although viance never clearly challenges the district court use of as the threshold rating for countable decay,viance does suggest in its own calculation that any post rated or lower should count as decayed.however,viance cites no dispositive evidence in this record to support its apparent conclusion that any rating below a perfect denotes decay indicative of serious safety concerns.to the extent that viance challenges the district court use of as the threshold rating,the district court was not clearly erroneous.in timber products release clarifying its role in the reports,it noted that the decay ratings in the reports were based on a subjective determination and that others might have assigned slightly different ratings.and chris barber testified that although a rating of denoted sound wood,he would not classify anything with less than a as less than sound.the district court could have reasonably concluded there was not a clear line of demarcation between posts rated and posts rated.in light of the evidence in this record,the district court did not clearly err in choosing a rating of as the threshold level of countable decay for its calculations.
given that threshold rating,the next component of the district court basis is the number of posts inspected that had a rating of or lower.the district court counted thirteen posts with a or lower,but did not explain how it arrived at that number.our independent review of the record suggests the district court number may be incorrect.the january report shows that eight of the posts from the alpharetta site that timber products visually inspected rated or lower.the november report shows that all eleven posts inspected from the baton rouge site rated a or,but does not distinguish between the two ratings.assuming,to the benefit of viance,that ten of those posts rated a and only one rated a,eighteen of the posts from both the alpharetta and baton rouge sites visually inspected by timber products rated a or lower 
the next component is the total sample size of posts.the district court made several factual findings in this regard.it found that viance spent substantial time and resources in an effort to find posts showing decay,that viance searched numerous sites for posts,and that viance inspected roughly posts.in light of those findings,the district court concluded that was the appropriate sample size.record evidence supports these findings.viance initial efforts uncovered no signs of decayed posts.despite visiting eighteen sites and talking to numerous retailers and builders,the private investigator hired by viance could find no problems suggesting premature decay in wood.viance nevertheless continued its search for signs of decay.preston,viance director of research,testified that viance sent groups to numerous sites looking for posts,and multiple documents corroborate that testimony.and archer,also of viance,testified that viance inspected roughly posts and estimated that were treated with mcq.viance argues that some of those posts were encased in concrete or otherwise not amenable to further testing and thus should not be counted in the total sample size.viance,however,produced no evidence indicating what percentage of those posts were in concrete or otherwise inaccessible,nor did it indicate what percentage of the accessible posts that were not tested by timber products showed signs of decay based on viance own inspection.given that viance spent substantial time and effort to find posts showing decay,that it only called timber products in to inspect posts from the baton rouge and alpharetta sites,and that it failed to produce evidence quantifying decay on the other posts it inspected,the district court could have reasonably concluded that it was appropriate to use all posts that viance inspected as the total sample size that being the case,we calculate the appropriate percentage of decayed posts as eighteen out of,or 
the final,and key,link in the district court chain of reasoning on this point is whether the percentage of decayed posts found in the study supports the conclusions drawn in viance advertising statements regarding serious safety and structural integrity concerns in relation to posts.the district court found the percentage of decayed posts to be.although this calculation may be in error,as long as the higher percentage,still satisfies the conclusion that the percentage of decayed posts does not raise serious safety concerns,then the district court ultimate finding that the results of the studies do not support the conclusions in the advertisements is not clearly erroneous.although the district court did not cite any testimony supporting the conclusion that was not sufficient to support the serious concerns raised in the advertisements,kamden,a professor of wood science and technology at michigan state university,testified that in his own survey of mcq,of the posts had issues.given that number,he concluded that mcq was a robust,very good wood preservative.in light of that testimony,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the percentage of samples showing decay in viance studies,be it or up to,was not sufficient to support the safety concerns raised in the advertisements.
iii.district court reliance on qualifying language in the test reports 
lastly,viance attacks the district court reliance on qualifying language in the timber products reports and nicholas report on the field stake tests.in its reports,timber products noted that the reports did not provide any basis for any conclusion as to the grade,treatment,or physical quality of the posts tested.likewise,in his field stake test reports,nicholas noted that additional field stake test data will be required to confirm this concern about the performance of mcq in ground contact applications.the district court found that those limitations lowered the support the reports provided for viance broad claims about safety concerns.viance points out that todd greer,vice president of timber products,testified that he had no problem with viance drawing conclusions regarding micronized copper based on the timber products reports.it also contends that nicholas qualification did not suggest viance conclusions were wrong.
the district court reliance on the limiting qualifications in the viance tests was not clearly erroneous.although neither of the qualifications explicitly state that viance conclusions are wrong,they both certainly undermine the breadth of the conclusions that viance seeks to draw from the studies.moreover,other statements,such as the statement by todd greer in his declaration that a claim or suggestion that properly treated outdoor structures built with micronized copper wood may be unsafe or may prematurely fail in service is not warranted by any of the findings contained in either of these reports,further undermine the broad conclusions that viance attempts to attribute to its studies 
in sum,the district court did not clearly err in determining that viance statements regarding mcq were literally false.we interpret its first basis as focusing on whether the particular tests performed supported the broad conclusions regarding structural integrity and safety expressed in the viance advertisements.given that interpretation and the record support for the district court finding in that regard,and in light of the other two strong bases relied on by the district court,the results of the survey and the limiting qualifications in the several reports the district court did not clearly err in finding that the tests cited do not support the conclusions drawn in the advertisements regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq.
literal falsity of statements regarding timber products 
in point of the injunction,the district court enjoined viance as follows 
defendants may not indicate or imply that any conclusions or opinions stated in their advertisements concerning the effectiveness of micronized copper preservatives or the safety of structures built with micronized wood are verified or endorsed by timber products.
the district court found that statements in the advertisements referencing timber products asserted that timber products shared viance concerns about mcq.the district court specifically referenced the statement the decay,verified by timber products inspection tp,is considered unacceptable for providing structural integrity for residential and commercial uses.viance contends that statement is literally true.viance assigns the following meaning to that sentence timber products verified the decay found in the posts,and in viance opinion,the decay supports concerns with structural integrity.it then argues that the assertion that timber products verified the decay found in the posts is literally true thus,the statement is at most misleading.the line between literally false and misleading is not always a clear one,but it is a fine line,and we will only reverse the district court if its findings are clearly erroneous.axiom worldwide,at.
we do not believe the district court clearly erred.the advertisements relied heavily and repeatedly on timber products and its independence and reputation.significantly,several assertions in the advertisements unambiguously stated that timber product findings raised serious concerns about structural integrity and safety.bearing in mind that the decay findings,timber products,and safety and structural integrity concerns regarding mcq are repeatedly linked in context,we can not conclude that the district court clearly erred in determining that viance advertisements unambiguously asserted that timber products verified or endorsed viance conclusions regarding the safety of mcq.
also the district court did not clearly err in finding that any statement that indicated that timber products verified or endorsed any conclusions or opinions regarding the efficacy of mcq or the safety of structures built with wood is literally false.both timber products reports state that t his inspection report should not be considered as acceptance or rejection for the grade,treatment,or physical quality of the material.the reports simply catalog timber products visual inspection rating of the posts tested.the reports do not draw any conclusion as to what those ratings indicate about the performance or safety of mcq.moreover,todd greer stated in his declaration that the reports do not provide the basis for a conclusion that wood treated with a micronized copper preservative or using a micronized copper wood treating system is unsafe or will fail prematurely in service.he also stated that b ased on the scientific data to which timber products inspection,has access,including its own inspections,it can not conclude and has not concluded that micronized copper treated wood treating systems,including mcq,are not as effective and reliable as any other major wood preservative treating system.finally,he noted that had timber products been aware of viance intended use of reports in viance press releases,timber products would not have performed the services referenced therein.in light of the evidence,we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court clearly erred in concluding that viance statements asserting that timber products endorsed or verified its safety concerns were literally false.
the remaining elements regarding a substantial likelihood of success 
as noted above,a movant must establish the following elements in order to establish the requisite likelihood of success on a false advertising claim the ads of the opposing party were false or misleading,the ads deceived,or had the capacity to deceive,consumers,the deception had a material effect on purchasing decisions,the misrepresented product or service affects interstate commerce,and the movant has is likely to as a result of the false advertising.axiom worldwide,at internal quotation marks omitted.having dealt with literal falsity,we turn to viance challenges to the second,third and fifth elements 
consumer deception 
the classification of an advertisement as literally false or true but misleading affects the movant burden with respect to the element of consumer deception.if the court deems an advertisement to be literally false,then the movant is not required to present evidence of consumer deception.contacts,at.if,on the other hand,the court deems the advertisement to be true but misleading,then the movant is required to present evidence of deception.id.because the district court did not clearly err in determining the statements at issue were literally false,it correctly found that evidence of consumer deception was not required.
materiality of the deception 
even if an advertisement is literally false,the plaintiff must still establish materiality.id.at.in order to establish materiality,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant deception is likely to influence the purchasing decision.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a plaintiff may demonstrate this by showing that the defendants misrepresented an inherent quality or characteristic of the product.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court found that the materiality of viance false statements was because the advertisements attacked an inherent quality of mcq,namely its ability to prevent decay and preserve the structural integrity of wood.viance challenges the element of materiality only in relation to the statements concerning timber products.it claims first that the district court made no finding in this regard and second that the statements concerning timber products were not material.
the district court general finding of materiality appears to focus on whether statements expressing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq were material.viance has not challenged that finding insofar as it focuses on the statements regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq.the materiality of statements regarding timber products is equally,however,in that the statements regarding timber products are actionable because those statements indicate that timber products verified and endorsed viance concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq.because the actionable statements regarding timber products are intimately tied with viance concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq,those statements are material in that they misrepresent the same inherent quality or characteristic of mcq,namely its ability to prevent decay and preserve structural integrity.moreover,the heavy reliance on timber products independence and reputation enhances the likelihood that misrepresentation would influence purchasing decisions.thus,the district court did not clearly err in determining that the statements regarding mcq were material.
viance also contends that the district court failed to make the required finding of an injury or likelihood of injury with regards to the timber products statements and that such a finding is not supported by the record.the district court discussed the likelihood of injury from the statements in its analysis of irreparable injury as a factor in favor of a preliminary injunction.for the reasons stated below in section,the district court did not clearly err in finding a likelihood of injury from the statements.and for the reasons stated above in section,the injury flowing from statements regarding timber products is inherent in the injury resulting from statements regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq because the statement that timber products verified and endorsed those concerns is intimately tied to those safety concerns.thus,the district court did not clearly err in finding the statements regarding timber products injurious.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that osmose demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits in its lanham act claim.
b.the remaining preliminary injunction requirements 
the district court found that the remaining preliminary injunction factors all weighed in favor of issuing injunctive relief.viance argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that there was a substantial threat of irreparable injury to osmose,that the balance of harms favored enjoining viance,and that granting the injunction would not disserve the public interest.specifically,viance argues that the district court abused its discretion by essentially presuming irreparable harm and that its statements were not likely to cause irreparable harm to osmose.it next argues that its advertisements caused no harm to osmose,while the injunction seriously hampers its own ability to debate the subject,shifting market perception.finally,it argues that the injunction harms the public interest in the free flow of scientific and commercial information.
irreparable harm 
we note at the outset that the district court found there was a likelihood of irreparable harm to osmose without applying any presumption on the issue.the district court discussed the presumption of irreparable harm that had been accorded in false advertising cases where the defendant advertisements were literally false and comparative,but expressed some doubt as to whether such a presumption was still appropriate in light of ebay mercexchange,llc,d,and axiom worldwide,at.the district court concluded that no presumption was necessary because the advertisements,on their face,would likely cause irreparable harm.it reasoned that the advertisements contained serious indictments of the safety of products that would likely be remembered by consumers.it also noted that the stated goal of viance campaign was to put osmose out of business,which would obviously harm osmose.because the district court did not rely on a presumption of irreparable injury,we need not decide whether such a presumption still applies in the wake of ebay.even in the absence of a presumption,the district court conclusion as to the likelihood of irreparable harm was not an abuse of discretion.the inference that the serious nature of the claims in the advertisements would irreparably harm osmose goodwill and market position is certainly reasonable.viance argues that such harm was unlikely because the intended audience of the advertisements were industry professionals.first,given that one release was titled hidden danger in your backyard,it appears that the target audience for the advertisements was not solely industry professionals.second,to the extent that the advertisements were directed at companies that supply lumber to consumers,the concerns voiced in the advertisements could reasonably affect their purchasing decisions as well 
balance of harms 
the district court found that the balance of harms weighed in favor of granting the injunction because the ads could seriously damage osmose goodwill among consumers and the treated wood industry while viance would not be seriously harmed because it could still publish its test results.the district court finding in this regard was not an abuse of discretion.the harm on osmose side flows naturally from the likelihood of irreparable injury.and given the scope of the injunction,any arguable harm to viance is limited.point of the injunction specifically allows viance to publish the results of its testing.viance is also permitted to publish conclusions that are stated in the studies or readily apparent from the data contained in the studies.thus,viance concern that it is hindered in engaging in the scientific debate regarding the efficacy of mcq is overstated.although viance argues that the effect of the injunction will be to shift market perception against viance,that hardly seems likely.stopping these advertisements does not disparage viance product or inappropriately bolster osmose product.the effect of the injunction is only to prohibit viance from advertising generalizations regarding osmose product that the district court has determined are unsupported by viance current studies.
public interest 
the district court found that the public was served by preventing viance from disseminating broad conclusions regarding the safety of wood that exceeded the findings of its studies because the public interest is served by preventing customer confusion or deception.again,the district court did not abuse its discretion in drawing that conclusion.viance argues that the public is served by the free flow of commercial and speech on topics of consumer safety.but the free flow of scientific information regarding any concern of consumer safety is not hindered here because viance may still publish tests results and conclusions that are readily apparent from those results.thus,the injunction,as crafted,only prevents unsupported statements.such an injunction does not disserve the public interest.
injunction against commenting on osmose epp certification 
viance argues that the district court abused its discretion by enjoining it regarding osmose environmental advertisements because it neither identified nor analyzed any statements by viance to that effect.we agree.
in pertinent part,the district court enjoined viance as follows 
defendants may not claim or imply that osmose micropro process was not certified as epp by scs,or that scs did not consider life cycle analysis including efficacy analysis in awarding epp certification to osmose micropro process.
the district court did not identify any advertising statement in which viance claimed that micropro was not certified as an environmentally preferable product epp by scientific certification systems scs or that scs did not consider life cycle analysis in awarding epp certification to the micropro process liability follows under a of the lanham act when a party uses a false or misleading representation of fact.a.without such a misrepresentation,there is no basis for liability.because the district court has not identified any statement in which viance made such claims,it has not identified a proper basis for point of the injunction.
the district court did discuss epp certification in the portion of its order dealing with viance motion for a preliminary injunction against osmose.viance requested a preliminary injunction against certain advertising statements by osmose regarding micropro epp certification,claiming that the statements falsely implied that micropro technology was certified by the epa.the district court denied viance request,finding that it had failed to demonstrate that the statements were literally false or misleading or that the statements had the capacity to deceive consumers into believing mcq was epa certified.the district court never linked this finding of fact to its decision to enjoin viance from claiming micropro was not certified as epp by scs or that scs did not consider life cycle analysis,including efficacy analysis,in awarding epp certification to the micropro process.even if the district court had linked that finding of fact to point of the injunction,viance failure to establish that osmose advertising statements falsely implied that micropro technology was certified by the epa is not a proper basis for point of the injunction because,as we noted above,the district court did not find any statement in which viance claimed that micropro technology was not certified epp by scs or that scs did not consider life cycle analysis,including efficacy analysis,in awarding epp certification to micropro technology.
because the district court did not identify any statement in viance advertisements that supports point of the injunction,the district court abused its discretion in entering that provision accordingly,we vacate point of the injunction.
first amendment concerns 
viance argues that the injunction operates as an unconstitutional prior restraint because by its terms it could apply to protected speech.specifically,it argues that the literal terms of the injunction would prohibit it from engaging in many actions beyond commercial speech,such as petitioning the government,publishing scientific papers,arguing before certification organizations,or even giving testimony in this litigation.we agree and remand with instructions that the scope of the injunction be limited to statements made in commercial advertising and promotion.
i t is well settled that false commercial speech is not protected by the first amendment and may be banned entirely.pennzoil,at.under the lanham act,a court may issue an injunction to prevent the use of a false or misleading representation of fact in commercial advertising or promotion,a b.in this case,points through of the injunction prohibit viance from claiming or implying that its studies support concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of mcq or that timber products verified or endorsed thos
