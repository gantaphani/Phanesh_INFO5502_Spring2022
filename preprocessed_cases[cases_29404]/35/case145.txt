evidence presented on the motion for summary judgment 
in december,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.evidence presented in connection with the motion included the following 
plaintiff was born rickie donnell ross.throughout his life,he has gone by the names ricky ross and rick ross,and was at one time dubbed with the nickname freeway ricky ross.during the,plaintiff organized and ran a vast enterprise.his network of associates packaged and transported cocaine for sale directly into at least six different states,and indirectly into many others.at the height of plaintiff operation,he sold as much as million worth of cocaine a day.he eventually amassed a fortune worth hundreds of millions of dollars,and he owned dozens of properties as well as legitimate businesses.
in,plaintiff was arrested in ohio and charged with trafficking cocaine and was indicted on separate charges in texas.he pled guilty to the charges in both ohio and texas and received lengthy sentences.while in prison,plaintiff helped to uncover a ring of dirty cops,who planted evidence and framed innocent people using false evidence.plaintiff testimony helped to free approximately wrongly convicted men and he was rewarded with a significantly reduced sentence,leading to his release from prison in.
just six months after his release,plaintiff was arrested again and subsequently convicted on new charges of conspiracy to traffic cocaine.while plaintiff was in prison this time,a journalist interviewed him and wrote a piece regarding plaintiff former cocaine supplier,who in the had close ties to the nicaraguan contras.the story gained significant exposure,and in the plaintiff received widespread coverage regarding his peripheral role in the iran contra scandal.over the years,plaintiff has also been the subject of numerous television shows focusing on his erstwhile criminal empire.
in,plaintiff discovered that roberts was using the name rick ross,when he saw a magazine article about up and coming rappers.still in prison,plaintiff contacted a lawyer to write a cease and desist letter,but neither plaintiff nor the lawyer ever received a meaningful response.plaintiff was eventually released from prison in.
meanwhile,roberts lived a life far removed from that of plaintiff.roberts is a professional rap musician who goes by the stage name rick ross.early in his career,he spoke about how the criminal ross life story grabbed him.roberts has recently denied,however,that his performing name is based on plaintiff.he claims instead that the name is a play on the phrase big boss,an old nickname from his high school football days.
roberts lyrics frequently include fictional stories about running cocaine operations.he is a former correctional officer a piece of information not conducive to his career as a rapper,and one that he has attempted to hide.in approximately,roberts released his first commercial single,hustlin,in which he rapped about selling cocaine and which repeated the refrain everyday i hustlin,a phrase previously used by plaintiff in interviews when describing his life as a criminal.roberts first commercial cd,port of miami,was released in.since that time,he has released numerous additional albums and has achieved tremendous commercial success.his music has been produced,distributed,sold by defendants maybach music group,slip n slide records,and universal music group.
contentions and the trial court ruling 
in moving for summary judgment,defendants argued that plaintiff causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations.defendants contended that the statute of limitations began to run at latest in,upon the first commercial use by roberts of the name rick ross,and that the single publication rule codified by,prevented plaintiff from seeking damages for any subsequent use of his name or persona.defendants further argued that plaintiff action was barred by the doctrine of laches.
plaintiff opposed defendants motion,arguing that the single publication rule did not foreclose his claims because,at a minimum,each new album released by defendants constituted a new and separate publication.
the trial court accepted defendants argument.it found that roberts first use of the name rick ross occurred no later than,and that plaintiff claims all accrued at that time.according to the trial court,roberts subsequent uses of the name rick ross did not constitute further actionable publications and,in any event,plaintiff claims were barred by laches.
although we are not convinced that the trial court rulings on either of these grounds were correct,we need not analyze them at length,because,as discussed below,we conclude defendants first amendment rights provide a complete defense to all of plaintiff claims.
