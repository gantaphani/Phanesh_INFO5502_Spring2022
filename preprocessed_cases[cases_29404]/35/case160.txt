in two published decisions the united states district court for the central district of california denied class certification in putative class actions brought by current and former users of the prescription drug paxil against glaxosmithkline,gsk,the drug manufacturer,which alleged gsk had deceptively advertised paxil as.relying upon those decisions and alvarez may stores th,d alvarez,which applied established principles of collateral estoppel to class certification issues,the trial court granted gsk motion for summary adjudication precluding this case from proceeding as a class action,ruling kevin johnson superior court lawsuit against gsk sought to certify the identical putative class,pursuing the same legal claims,as had been disallowed in the federal actions.because the class issues actually litigated in the federal court paxil cases differ from those presented by johnson putative class action,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
johnson first amended complaint 
paxil,a drug manufactured and distributed by gsk,is prescribed for conditions including depression,panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.on january,johnson filed his original complaint and on july,a first amended putative class action complaint against gsk on behalf of all california residents who had taken paxil after and had become addicted to it or had suffered withdrawal symptoms when they attempted to stop taking it the complaint asserted causes of action for negligent misrepresentation,concealment,negligence,strict product liability and violation of california unfair competition law bus,et section,largely on the basis gsk had falsely and deceptively advertised paxil as.
johnson alleged he was prescribed paxil in early for moderate anxiety caused by the stress of work and family.johnson further alleged,albeit without specifying the timing,that he had seen television and heard radio advertisements stating paxil had few side effects and was not addictive in addition,his doctor never informed him of any side effects or symptoms.for a short while the drug was effective johnson felt euphoric and better able to deal with stress.johnson,however,began suffering from fatigue and sexual dysfunction,motivating him to discontinue using paxil in january.when johnson stopped,he experienced severe physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms,including headaches,heart palpitations and the sensation of electric shocks throughout his body.even after one year johnson continued to suffer from,among other symptoms,insomnia and the electric shock sensation.johnson alleged he would not have taken paxil had these symptoms been explained to him by his doctor,who himself was inadequately warned by gsk about these symptoms.
johnson class definitions 
the first amended complaint defined the putative class as all california residents,who are not deceased,who have been prescribed,and have taken paxil at any time after,and who have suffered or continue to suffer from withdrawal episodes or symptoms,or those who have become addicted are unable to stop taking paxil for fear of these symptoms.in response to the trial court request at a status conference for a definite class definition,in a joint statement filed june,the class definition was revised to include all california residents,who are not deceased,who have been prescribed,and have taken paxil at any time after until the present.
gsk motion for summary adjudication 
on january,gsk filed a motion for summary adjudication to preclude johnson lawsuit from proceeding as a class action.gsk asserted under the collateral estoppel principles applied to class action determinations by division four of this court in its decision in alvarez,supra,th,d united states senior district judge mariana pfaelzer decisions denying class certification in in re paxil litigation paxil i and in re paxil litigation paxil ii barred johnson class action claims.johnson filed an opposition addressing the collateral estoppel issue gsk replied and the court heard oral argument on february.at the hearing the trial court requested further briefing on whether the denials of class certification in paxil i and paxil ii satisfied all of the required elements for collateral estoppel.following receipt of the supplemental briefs requested by the court,the matter was submitted.
on august,in paxil i,supra,the plaintiffs moved under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule to certify five nationwide subclasses of paxil users,differentiated by whether the user was still taking paxil and the type of relief sought,in an action asserting claims including negligence,breach of express and implied warranty and violation of state unfair competition laws.the district court described the initial motion for class certification,including the proposed class definition,as deficient c ontrary to established constitutional standards,it failed to take into account differences in state law.as well,the m otion improvidently downplayed the individual factual and legal issues that inevitably arise when prosecuting a personal injury tort lawsuit that centers around the effects of a pharmaceutical drug on the human body.paxil i,at.consequently,the plaintiffs substantially modified the class definitions in their reply papers and proposed subclasses,grouping together plaintiffs in states with similar laws.id.at.one proposed subclass was for a ll persons who have used paxil and who reside in states,including california which are identical to california unfair competition law where plaintiff need not show reliance,causation or damage.in a footnote the plaintiffs argued,if the court does not certify the five state subclasses then at the very least it should certify a subclass of california plaintiffs under the unfair competition law.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion,generally finding they had failed to define a manageable class and had failed to demonstrate that a manageable trial plan exist ed that would make a class action lawsuit feasible.paxil i,supra,at.among other issues,the court was concerned whether the differences in state laws within each of their groupings were nonmaterial and whether the individual issues in the case,such as the symptoms and injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiffs and whether they had seen the paxil advertisements,were an overarching barrier to class action treatment.id.at.the court explained,in part,questions regarding typicality merge into questions regarding adequacy.t he ability of an individual to recover against gsk will likely turn on issues of actual causation.the determination of these issues is by necessity a process that requires a focus on the individual plaintiff and no class representative can possibly represent such individual plaintiffs without encountering a conflict of interest somewhere along the line.these conflicts make the class representatives and class counsel,despite their apparent best intentions,inadequate under rule a.id.at.notwithstanding its grave doubts about the viability of any class action proposal,the court granted the plaintiffs leave to file one more class certification motion.id.at.
on march,the plaintiffs filed a second motion for class certification proposing only two classes.the equitable relief class consisted of california residents who took prescribed paxil after december,and sought injunctive relief prohibiting certain gsk advertising statements and restitution pursuant to section.paxil ii,supra,at.the district court again denied the motion for class certification.paxil ii,at.the court explained its general concern about the nature of the putative class,the putative plaintiffs have all consumed paxil,but the similarities end there.not all of them have suffered adverse consequences and the ones that have suffered such consequences may have done so because of reasons unrelated to their ingestion of paxil s ome plaintiffs may never have seen or heard the statements sought to be enjoined or may have received medical advice from their physicians that would have counteracted gsk allegedly deceptive statements.these differences would generally make a group unsuitable for class treatment for a number of reasons,not the least of which is the potential for conflicts of interest among the class members.ibid.
notwithstanding the court negative description of the classwide claims,however,accepting the plaintiff representations concerning the breadth of section prior to its amendment by proposition,the district court held t here is no serious dispute the proposed equitable relief class meets rule a numerosity and commonality requirements.paxil ii,supra,at.rather,class certification was denied because,focusing on the proposed class representatives themselves,the court concluded they had failed to satisfy rule a adequacy requirement.t he lack of cohesion that section arguably allows raises the concern that a person who has not been affected in any way by the allegedly deceptive statements is given the responsibility of vigorously prosecuting an action seeking to enjoin those statements.the prospect is thereby raised that if this litigation were protracted,or if the possibility of restitution were eliminated,see infra,the vigor with which the class representatives might pursue this action may suffer.paxil ii at,fn.omitted.
alvarez may stores.
in what appears to have been a case of first impression in california,the court in alvarez,supra,th,d held the doctrine of collateral estoppel permits a prevailing party to enforce a ruling denying class certification,made in a prior action,against an absent putative class member seeking to pursue a class action.id.at,d w hen a prevailing party seeks to enforce a ruling denying class certification against an absent putative class member,the general principles of collateral estoppel apply.prior to the lawsuit against it in alvarez,the department store employer had twice defeated efforts to certify a class of past and present area sales managers,who alleged the company had misclassified them as exempt employees and failed to pay required overtime compensation.in each of those earlier cases the trial court concluded the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a community of interest.id.at,d.the second denial of class certification was affirmed on appeal,the court of appeal holding it would not be proper to certify plaintiffs as class representatives for a class whose members are so dissimilar in their interests.common questions of fact could not predominate.duran,wl nonpub.opn.duran.see alvarez,at,d.
the alvarez court held the duran and alvarez complaints each alleged the same general misconduct concerning the same policies and procedures,occurring over approximately the same period of time.the same putative class of present and former employees was alleged in both cases and the alvarez plaintiffs conceded they were,by definition,included within the putative duran class.alvarez,supra,th at,d.the court also noted the duran and alvarez plaintiffs used the same attorneys.alvarez,at.moreover,the alvarez plaintiffs did not contend their interests were not adequately represented in the duran case.concluding that principles of collateral estoppel applied to preclude class certification of the alvarez suit,the court held the duran plaintiffs were virtual representatives of the alvarez plaintiffs,emphasizing the interested parties,their claims,and their counsel are the same.alvarez at,d.
the trial court order granting summary adjudication in favor of gsk on the class issues 
the trial court granted gsk motion on march,ruling the district court denials of class certification in paxil i and paxil ii collaterally estopped johnson from proceeding with a class action.the trial court stated,the in re paxil court twice considered and rejected a class identical to the one johnson seeks.alvarez and principles of collateral estoppel bar johnson from again pursuing certification.johnson filed a timely notice of appeal.see morrissey city and county of san francisco d.an order,whatever form it may take,which has the effect of denying certification as a class action,is an appealable order alvarez,supra,th at,fn,d.
discussion 
standard of review 
the trial court application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion is a question of law subject to de novo review.noble draper th,d.although paxil i and paxil ii are decisions by a federal court,because the district court was exercising diversity jurisdiction,california law determines their preclusive effect.see semtek international lockheed martin,d see also taylor sturgell,fn,d,f or judgments in diversity cases,federal law incorporates the rules of preclusion applied by the state in which the rendering court sits.
the doctrine of collateral estoppel issue preclusion and class action determinations 
collateral estoppel generally 
res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits.res judicata,or claim preclusion,prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.mycogen monsanto cal th,d.
a prior decision precludes relitigation of an issue under the doctrine of collateral estoppel only if five threshold requirements are satisfied first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.lucido superior court cal d,accord,pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,d,see alvarez,supra,th at,d see also branson growers th,d a lthough a second action between the parties on a different cause of action is not barred by res judicata,nevertheless the first judgment operates as an estoppel or conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.the party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.lucido,at,pacific lumber,at,d.
even if all these requirements are satisfied,however,a court must analyze the public policies underlying the doctrine before concluding that collateral estoppel should be applied in a particular case.pacific lumber state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d,lucido superior court,supra,cal d at.i n deciding whether to apply collateral estoppel,the court must balance the rights of the party to be estopped against the need for applying collateral estoppel in the particular case,in order to promote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation,to prevent inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system,or to protect against vexatious litigation.clemmer hartford ins.cal d,accord,alvarez,supra,th at,d.
requirements for class certification 
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.drug stores,superior court cal th,d.similar to the commonality,typicality and adequacy of representation requirements of rule t he community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.drug stores,at.
the adequacy inquiry serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.citation.to assure adequate representation,the class representative personal claim must not be inconsistent with the claims of other members of the class.morgan,superior court th,d accord,capitol people first state of developmental services th,d.similarly,the purpose of the typicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the interests of the class.citation.typicality refers to the nature of the claim or defense of the class representative,and not to the specific facts from which it arose or the relief sought.citations.the test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury,whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs,and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.seastrom neways,th,d.
a class action also must be the superior means of resolving the litigation,for both the parties and the court.citation.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.citation.r elevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress the alleged wrongdoing.citation.b ecause group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.newell state farm general ins.th,d see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,benefits of class action evaluated by interest of each putative class member in controlling his or her case personally potential difficulties in managing a class action nature and extent of already pending litigation by individual class members involving the same controversy and desirability of consolidating all claims in a single action before one court.
principles of collateral estoppel apply to relitigation of class action determinations 
if all five elements required for application of collateral estoppel are present,the doctrine is fully applicable to preclude relitigation of issues finally resolved as part of a class certification determination in a prior proceeding.see alvarez,supra,th at,d bufil dollar financial group,th,d explaining alvarez,but reversing trial court application of collateral estoppel because,in light of differences in class definition,defendant employer failed to establish the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation was identical to that decided in the former proceeding.for example,if a putative class representative,after unsuccessfully litigating a class certification motion,simply dismisses his or her lawsuit without prejudice and then refiles it either in the same or different county and once again seeks class certification for the identical class,general principles of collateral estoppel will preclude relitigation of the class issues.the same result will obtain if the second putative class action lawsuit is pursued by a named representative in privity with the original,unsuccessful putative class representative 
to be sure,california has a strong public policy that encourages the use of the class action procedure.drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,richmond dart industries,cal d.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress for claims which would otherwise be too small to warrant individual litigation.drug stores,at,d.at the same time,as our colleagues in division four explained,it would be manifestly unfair to subject a defendant to a revolving door of endless litigation.in cases where a party had a full opportunity to present his or her claim and adequately represented the interests of a second party who seeks the same relief,principles of equity,p ublic policy and the interests of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.alvarez,supra,th at,d.
the trial court erred in ruling collateral estoppel precluded johnson efforts to pursue his section paxil claim as a class action 
a.the issue of adequacy of representation actually litigated and determined in paxil ii is not identical to the adequacy or typicality issues presented by johnson putative class claim 
the propriety of class certification was actually and necessarily litigated in paxil i,supra,and paxil ii,supra,and the district court orders denying certification were final and on the merits.however,even if we were to accept,as did the trial court,the alvarez court application of the doctrine of virtual representation to enforce a ruling denying class certification against an absent putative class member not otherwise in privity with the named representatives involved in the earlier litigation see alvarez,supra,th at,d but see fn,above,only four of the five required elements for application of collateral estoppel are present in this case.the first of the issue to be precluded from missing 
being a matter of issue preclusion,collateral estoppel is naturally confined to issues actually litigated.citations.a corollary is that the issue decided previously be identical with the one sought to be precluded.citations.accordingly,where the previous decision rests on a different factual and legal foundation than the issue sought to be adjudicated in the case at bar,collateral estoppel effect should be denied.wimsatt beverly hills weight.internat.th,d see united states golf ass arroyo software th,d.precisely defining the issue previously decided and the one sought to be precluded is critical.
both paxil i and paxil ii were litigated before the voters approved proposition on november,effective the following day,which significantly restricted the previously broad standing requirements for pursuing a private cause of action under section.prior to their amendment by proposition,section and related provisions permitted any person acting for the general public to sue for relief from unfair competition and did not predicate standing on a showing of injury or damage.see californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,buckland threshold enterprises,th,d.as amended by proposition,business and professions code section now limits standing in a section action to certain specified public officials and to any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of unfair competition.
in paxil ii the plaintiffs relied upon standing concepts to argue section unifies the otherwise disparate plaintiffs by broadly defining the cause of action and by allowing individuals to sue as private attorney generals.plaintiffs allege that the california statute,by focusing on whether the defendant has made misleading statements,dispenses with the need to determine whether those statements ultimately made it to the in an unaltered form.under plaintiffs reading,then,section allows one who has never been exposed to the allegedly deceptive statements,and who might have received accurate instructions from his physician,and even benefitted from paxil,to not only be a part of a class,but to actually represent the class.paxil ii,supra,at,italics added.
the district court assume d for the purposes of the class certification that section ha d the broad scope that plaintiffs ascribe d to it.paxil ii,supra,at.based,in part,on that assumption the court concluded there was no serious dispute that the proposed equitable relief class met rule a numerosity and commonality requirements id.at the federal law analogue to california class requirements of numerous parties and common questions of law or fact.nonetheless,focusing on the putative class representatives themselves the district court denied class certification because individuals who had not seen or heard gsk allegedly deceptive statements would not be adequate representatives of the putative class t he lack of cohesion that section arguably allows raises the concern that a person who has not been affected in any way by the allegedly deceptive statements is given the responsibility of vigorously prosecuting an action seeking to enjoin those statements.the prospect is thereby raised that if this litigation were protracted,or if the possibility of restitution were eliminated,the vigor with which the class representatives might pursue the action may suffer.paxil ii,at,fn.omitted.
unlike the claims of the named plaintiffs in paxil ii,johnson section claim based on gsk allegedly deceptive advertising of paxil as must be based on an allegation of injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of gsk unfair competition bus.indeed,contrary to the district court description of the named plaintiffs in paxil ii as individuals who may never have been exposed to the allegedly deceptive statements johnson alleged he had seen the television advertisements and heard the radio advertisements stating paxil had few side effects and was not addictive.thus,in no small part because of the significant change in the legal landscape in which section claims may be asserted as a result of proposition the single issue on which the district court denied class certification in paxil ii is materially different from the issue of adequacy of representation presented by johnson attempt to pursue a section class action on behalf of paxil users.lucido superior court,supra,cal d at,identical issue requirement addresses whether identical factual allegations are at stake in the two proceedings,not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are the same.it is not simply,as gsk contends,a matter of whether the broad class description and legal theories were the same in the two cases.
the district court denial of class certification in paxil i,supra,similarly does not preclude determination of the class issues in this case because paxil i focused is,actually litigated and propriety of certifying a nationwide class of paxil users.id.at.that question,of course,is not presented by johnson putative class action on behalf of california consumers of paxil.see bufil dollar financial group,supra,th at,d reversing trial court application of collateral estoppel to denial of class certification when subsequent class proposed was subset of class denied certification and attempted to cure deficiencies of denied class.the footnote suggestion by the paxil i plaintiffs that the district court should consider certifying a subclass of california plaintiffs under section did not elevate the issue to one that was actually litigated.indeed,that suggestion appears,in part,to have been the basis for the court allowance of a renewed attempt by the plaintiffs to certify a more limited class in paxil ii.
b.the primary rights theory does not permit application of collateral estoppel absent an identity of issues actually and necessarily litigated and finally decided on the merits 
in alvarez,supra,th,d,responding to the plaintiffs argument the denial of class certification in the earlier duran case should not preclude litigation of the class issues because the causes of action asserted in the two complaints alvarez plaintiffs included a classwide section cause of action among their wage and hour claims,which was apparently not asserted in court held,although the causes of action are not identical,the principle of collateral estoppel does not depend on the legal theory used but the primary right asserted.citations.the primary right asserted in each case was the right to litigate claims in a class action lawsuit.alvarez,supra,th at,d.
relying on alvarez,gsk argues the primary right asserted in paxil i and paxil ii,on the one hand,and the case at bar,on the other hand,is the right to litigate claims involving paxil in a class action that the differences in the issues actually litigated discussed in the preceding section of this opinion are immaterial to the application of collateral estoppel.the trial court,as well,quoted the alvarez court language regarding primary rights in rejecting johnson argument that identity of issues does not exist because rule,which governed the class determinations in paxil ii,purportedly differs from code of civil procedure section.
that application of collateral estoppel does not depend on the legal theory advanced in the successive lawsuits is well established.see,interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court d.former judgment is not a collateral estoppel on issues which might have been raised but were not just as clearly,it is a collateral estoppel on issues which were raised,even though some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented were not bufil dollar financial group,supra,th at,d.but that principle,central to the collateral estoppel doctrine,is in no way related to the primary rights theory,a theory of code pleading crowley katleman cal th,d,that implicates matters of claim preclusion res judicata,not issue preclusion or collateral estoppel.see slater blackwood cal d,under california primary rights theory,even when there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated,the invasion of one primary right gives rise to a single cause of action a valid final judgment on the merits in favor of a defendant serves as a complete bar to further litigation on the same cause of action see also mycogen monsanto,supra,cal th at,d,doctrine of res judicata promotes judicial economy by ensuring all claims based on the same cause of action must be decided in a single suit if not brought initially,they may not be raised at a later date.
moreover,the procedural right to prosecute a claim as a class action,a means to enforce substantive law by collectively litigating substantive claims washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,see alch superior court th,d,shares none of the characteristics of a cause of action as defined by the primary rights theory.see crowley katleman,supra,cal th at,d,primary rights theory provides that a cause of action is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff,a corresponding primary duty of the defendant,and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.a primary right in its simplest form is the plaintiff right to be free from the particular injury suffered.slater blackwood,supra,cal d at.the procedural means for protecting that right can not be confused with the right itself.
in sum,the primary rights theory does not relieve the party asserting collateral estoppel from its obligation to demonstrate the issue actually litigated and finally decided in the first action,regardless of legal theory advanced,is identical to the factual issue as to which preclusion is sought.gsk failed to carry that burden.
conclusion 
to avoid possible uncertainty as to the reach of our reversal of the trial court order granting gsk motion for summary adjudication,we emphasize we are not deciding johnson has established the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.see lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.similarly,we do not hold that johnson claims or gsk potential defenses to those claims are typical of the class or that johnson has proved he can adequately represent the class.see ibid.those issues are properly considered by the trial court in a motion for class certification.all we decide today is that johnson attempt to pursue his section claim against gsk as a class action is not precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
disposition 
the order granting summary judgment on the class certification issues is reversed.johnson is to recover his costs on appeal.
other named plaintiffs were george grair and lynn booker.for reasons unrelated to class certification,the trial court dismissed with prejudice all of booker claims on june,and grair claims on may.
