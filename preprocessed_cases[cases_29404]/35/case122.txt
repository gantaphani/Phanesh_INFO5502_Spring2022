plaintiff kevin trudeau challenges a federal trade commission ftc press release that reported the settlement of a case the agency brought against him for false and misleading advertising.trudeau alleges that the press release is itself false and misleading,and that,in issuing it,the ftc exceeded its statutory authority and violated his first amendment rights.the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review trudeau claims and,in the alternative,that trudeau failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
this case raises a host of complicated questions regarding the jurisdiction and authority of federal courts.in the end,however,it comes down to whether trudeau has the right to take a red pencil to the language of the ftc press release.he does not.consequently,although we disagree with the district court jurisdictional holding,we affirm its dismissal for failure to state a claim.
plaintiff trudeau is a author and producer of radio and television infomercials.he has used his books and infomercials to promote a wide variety of products as cures for medical conditions ranging from cancer and multiple sclerosis to hair loss and obesity.he has also been an outspoken critic of the ftc.
in and,trudeau began marketing two new products in infomercials.he billed the first,a calcium supplement called coral calcium supreme,as an effective treatment for cancer,multiple sclerosis,lupus,heart disease,and high blood pressure.he marketed the second,a product called biotape that consists of adhesive strips resembling electrical tape,as a space age mylar that connects the broken circuits in the body.trudeau ftc,d,internal quotation marks omitted.trudeau claimed that biotape could provide permanent relief from debilitating back pain,as well as pain due to arthritis,sciatica,and migraine headaches.
in june,the ftc filed a complaint against trudeau in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,alleging that trudeau marketing of coral calcium supreme and biotape was false and misleading,in violation of the federal trade commission act,et.the commission also filed a motion for an order to show cause why trudeau should not be held in contempt for violating a court order that,among other things,prohibited him from making unsubstantiated claims about consumer products.on july,the parties agreed to,and the court entered,a stipulated preliminary injunction barring trudeau from making the challenged representations about coral calcium supreme and biotape.eleven months later,after trudeau had once again started advertising coral calcium supreme,the ftc asked the court to hold trudeau in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction.on june,the court granted the commission motion,held trudeau in contempt,and ordered him to halt all advertising of coral calcium supreme.see trudeau,d at.
on september,the parties agreed to,and the court entered,a stipulated final order for permanent injunction and final judgment final order that resolved all pending ftc complaints against trudeau.the final order permanently enjoin s and restrain s trudeau from producing,disseminating,or making any representation in an infomercial aired or played on any television or radio media.final order at.the order contains an exception permitting trudeau to make representations in the television or radio media in connection with any book,newsletter or other informational publication,provided that the publication does not refer to a product or service that trudeau is promoting,is not an advertisement for any product or service,and is not sold,promoted,or marketed in conjunction with any product or service that is related to the content of the publication.id.at.this exception is limited to infomercials that do not misrepresent the content of the book,newsletter or informational publication.id.the order further bars trudeau from marketing any product containing coral calcium and from making representations regarding the benefits of any product unless the representations are true and not misleading.id.at.
the final order also enters j udgment against trudeau for equitable monetary relief in the amount of two million dollars,id.at,but states that n o portion of any payments under the judgment herein shall be deemed a payment of any fine,penalty or punitive assessment,id.at.in addition,the order states that trudeau expressly den ies any wrongdoing or liability for any matters,and that t here have been no findings or admissions of wrongdoing or liability other than the finding against kevin trudeau for contempt for violating the july stipulated preliminary injunction.id.
on september,five days after entry of the final order,the ftc posted on its website a press release entitled kevin trudeau banned from infomercials,and subtitled trudeau settles claims in connection with coral calcium supreme and biotape.app.the press release is the central focus of trudeau suit against the commission.
the first two paragraphs of the release describe the general contours of the settlement incorporated in the final order.the first sentence states 
a federal trade commission settlement with kevin prolific marketer who has either appeared in or produced hundreds of bans him from appearing in,producing,or disseminating future infomercials that advertise any type of product,service,or program to the public,except for truthful infomercials for informational publications.
id.after further describing the terms of the settlement,the first paragraph ends with this statement trudeau agreed to these prohibitions and to pay the ftc million to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain.id.
the second paragraph details the settlement financial terms.it states that trudeau is paying in cash and transferring residential property located in ojai,california,and a luxury vehicle to the commission to satisfy the million monetary judgment against him.id.
the pertinent remaining portions of the press release are the third and sixth paragraphs,and a disclaimer at the end of the text.the third paragraph contains a quotation from lydia parnes,acting director of the ftc bureau of consumer protection,which states 
this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years other habitual false advertisers should take a lesson mend your ways or face serious consequences.
id.the sixth paragraph contains additional details about the terms of the final order.it states that the 
settlement announced today permanently bans trudeau from appearing in,producing,or disseminating infomercials that advertise any product,service,or program and,regardless of the advertising medium used to make the claim,from making representations that any product,program,or service can cure,treat,or prevent any disease or provide health benefits.
id.the paragraph also explains that t he order ban on future infomercials exempts infomercials for books,newsletters,and other informational publications.id.finally,the release concludes with the following disclaimer 
note this stipulated final order is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendants of a law violation.a stipulated final order has the force of law when signed by the judge.
id.at bolded in original.
the press release remains on the ftc website to this day at the corner,it prominently features a link to related documents,one of which is a copy of the final order.five months after the press release was posted,trudeau asked the ftc to edit remove the webpage.the ftc refused,and this suit followed.
on february,trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the united states district court for the district of columbia,seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief.the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliat ed against trudeau for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterize d,compl,and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented,id,the final order.that conduct,trudeau asserted,exceeded the ftc authority under f and violated the first amendment.compl.the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b.
the district court granted the ftc motion to dismiss.first,the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under section of the administrative procedure act.trudeau,d at.second,the court held,in the alternative,that trudeau claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law.id.at 
trudeau now appeals.we review the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo.see mwani bin laden.we apply the same de novo standard to the dismissal for failure to state a claim.see gilvin fire.in determining whether a complaint fails to state a claim,we may consider only the facts alleged in the complaint,any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint and matters of which we may take judicial notice.eeoc francis xavier parochial.in this case,both the ftc press release and the final order were attached as exhibits to trudeau complaint.see compl.
we begin with the district court dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.the dismissal implicates two different jurisdictional questions,which we address below.
the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over trudeau claims because the ftc press release was not final agency action under of the apa,trudeau,d at.although the ftc pressed this jurisdictional position below,it did not brief it on appeal and declined to make it at oral argument.see oral arg.tape.nonetheless,because the district court determined that final agency action requirement was jurisdictional and granted the ftc motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,we must address the question.see lobue christopher,we must,of course,examine not only our own jurisdiction but also that of the court below,regardless of whether the parties have neglected the issue,addressed it only obliquely,or even tried to waive it.
section of the apa states,inter alia,that a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.the district court interpreted this provision to mean that the presence of final agency action is a jurisdictional issue.trudeau,d at.the apa,however,is not a statute.as the supreme court held in califano sanders,the apa does not afford an implied grant of jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency action,d because declaration that final agency action is subject to judicial review is not a grant of jurisdiction,even if we were to infer by negative implication that agency conduct not amounting to final agency action is not reviewable,that inference would not deprive a federal court of any jurisdiction it otherwise has.
it is true that some of our opinions have loosely referred to the final agency action requirement as jurisdictional.that is hardly surprising,as j urisdiction is a word of many,too many,meanings.arbaugh y h,d quoting steel citizens for better environment,d or,as judge friendly and justice frankfurter put it more poetically,the word is a verbal coat of too many colors.in re beck industries,cir friendly,quoting united states tucker truck lines.frankfurter,dissenting.in reliable automatic sprinkler consumer prod.safety comm n,however,we made clear that,where judicial review is sought under the apa rather than a particular statute prescribing judicial review,the requirement of final agency action is not jurisdictional,emphasis added.and in a case decided just last month,we followed reliable,reaffirming that the apa final agency action requirement is not jurisdictional.see center for auto safety nhtsa,citing reliable.at 
although the apa does not confer jurisdiction,what its judicial review provisions,do provide is a limited cause of action for parties adversely affected by agency action.see center for auto safety,accordingly,we will need to address the final agency action limitation of in part iii,where we consider whether trudeau has a valid cause of action for his claims against the ftc.see reliable,at if there was no final agency action,there is no doubt that appellant would lack a cause of action under the apa.
finally,because the apa neither confers nor restricts jurisdiction,we must still determine whether some other statute provides it.for that,we are assisted by trudeau complaint,see compl,which draws our attention to the general statute.section gives the district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.as we discuss in part iii,trudeau asserts that three different causes of action are applicable to his claims the apa a nonstatutory action,independent of the apa,appellant br.and the first amendment directly.section is an appropriate source of jurisdiction for all three 
a second jurisdictional question at issue in this case is whether the united states has waived its sovereign immunity,so that trudeau may bring his claims against the ftc.see fdic meyer,d sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature.the ftc raised sovereign immunity as a bar before the district court but,once again,did not mention immunity in its appellate briefs and declined to discuss it at oral argument.see oral arg.tape.
the district court suggested,see trudeau,d at,and trudeau maintains,that congress provided the necessary waiver of immunity in the second sentence of apa,which reads 
an action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency acted or failed to act shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the united states or that the united states is an indispensable party.
trudeau has limited the relief he seeks to a declaratory judgment and an injunction,and there is no doubt that waives the government immunity from actions seeking relief other than money damages.dep t of army blue fox,d see hubbard epa,dronenburg zech.nonetheless,the ftc argued in the district court that waiver was limited in two additional respects.according to the ftc the waiver applies only to actions arising under the apa and since review under apa is limited to final agency action,the waiver of sovereign immunity is similarly restricted to conduct that falls within that compass.
we have previously,and repeatedly,rejected the ftc first argument,expressly holding that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity applies to any suit whether under the apa or not.chamber of commerce reich,there is nothing in the language of the second sentence of that restricts its waiver to suits brought under the apa.the sentence waives sovereign immunity for a n action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages,not for an action brought under the apa.
our previous examination of the legislative history of this sentence confirms that conclusion.congress added the sentence to when it amended the section in.see,stat,sess.as we have explained,t he judiciary committees of both houses,in their reports on the amendment,identified as the measure clear purpose elimina tion of the sovereign immunity defense in all equitable actions for specific relief against a federal agency or officer acting in an official capacity,alaska railroad,emphasis in original quoting,at and,at,cong,moreover,the senate report plainly indicated that congress expected the waiver to apply to nonstatutory actions,and thus not only to actions under the apa.the committee does not believe,the report stated,that the amendment partial elimination of sovereign immunity,as a barrier to nonstatutory review of federal administrative action,will create undue interference with administrative action,at,cong,at emphasis added.
although we have never directly considered the contention that the final agency action requirement of restricts waiver of sovereign immunity,our holding that the waiver is not limited to apa hence that it applies regardless of whether the elements of an apa cause of action are the linchpin of the ftc argument.moreover,the language of the waiver sentence again provides no support for the ftc contention.while the sentence does refer to a claim against an agency and hence waives immunity only when the defendant falls within that category it does not use either the term final agency action or the term agency action.nor does the legislative history refer to either limitation.to the contrary,the house and senate reports repeated declarations that congress intended to waive immunity for any,at,and all,id.at,at,cong,at,actions for equitable relief against an agency make clear that no such limitations were intended.
in sum,we hold that apa waiver of sovereign immunity permits not only trudeau apa cause of action,but his nonstatutory and first amendment actions as well.we also hold that the waiver applies regardless of whether the ftc press release constitutes final agency action.accord presbyterian church united states,cir holding that the government attempt to restrict the waiver of sovereign immunity to actions challenging agency action as technically defined in offends the plain meaning of the amendment red lake band of chippewa indians barlow,cir rejecting the contention that the waiver in exists only to allow review of a final agency decision,and holding that t he waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section is not dependent on application of the review standards of the apa.the district court therefore had jurisdiction to hear trudeau suit under,and its dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to rule b was erroneous.
having concluded that there is jurisdiction,we now turn to whether trudeau has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.although the district court erroneously dismissed the action pursuant to rule b,we could nonetheless affirm the dismissal if dismissal were otherwise proper based on failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.francis xavier parochial,at see reliable,at.
trudeau complaint asserts two claims against the ftc.first,he contends that the ftc exceeded its statutory authority under f when it issued the press release.section f provides that the ftc shall have power to make public from time to time such portions of the information obtained by it as are in the public interest.f.trudeau argues that,by intentionally and deliberately misrepresent ing the nature of the stipulated order in its press release,compl,the agency acted contrary to the public interest and therefore in excess of its authority under f.second,trudeau claims that issuance of the press release violated his first amendment rights.he contends that the commission intended to retaliate against him for expressing his negative opinions about the ftc by issuing a press release that falsely characterize d the stipulated order as containing a finding of wrongdoing or liability on his part.compl.
whether these are claims upon which relief can be granted depends in part on whether there is a cause of action that permits trudeau to invoke the power of the court to redress the violations of law that he claims the ftc has committed.see generally davis passman,d.it also depends on whether the allegations of trudeau complaint are legally sufficient to state the violations he claims.we consider the cause of action question in this part,and the sufficiency of trudeau claims in part iv 
as we have noted,trudeau identifies three causes of action that he asserts authorize his suit the apa a nonstatutory action and the first amendment directly each involves certain complexities of analysis.
first,it is clear that the apa suppl ies a generic cause of action in favor of persons aggrieved by agency action.dep t of human res.dep t of health human,see supra note.moreover,the apa scope of review provision permits us to grant trudeau request to hold the press release unlawful if we find it contrary to constitutional right because of the asserted first amendment violation,or in excess of statutory authority because it exceeded the ftc powers under f.b,c the problem with relying on the apa,however,is that limits causes of action under the apa to final agency action.center for auto safety.thus,although the absence of final agency action would not cost federal courts their jurisdiction,see supra part ii,it would cost trudeau his apa cause of action.
as the district court noted,we have never found a press release of the kind at issue here to constitute final agency action under the apa.see trudeau,d at.we first considered this question nearly sixty years ago in hearst radio fcc,in which a plaintiff alleged that the fcc had issued a defamatory publication that it knew to be false.the difficulty with the plaintiff challenge,we said,was that suits under the apa are limited to agency action,and that the fcc publication did not come within the definition of that term.id.at.the apa defines agency action as includ ing the whole or part of an agency rule,order,license,sanction,relief,or the equivalent or denial thereof,or failure to act.in hearst radio,we concluded that,a mong these words,the only one approaching applicability to the publication is the word sanction,and that the definition of that word does not cover an act such as the fcc publication.at see invention submission rogan,cir following hearst radio 
we have twice questioned the continued validity of the hearst radio decision.impro products,block,see indus.safety equip.ass n,epa.in industrial safety equipment ass n,epa,for example,we said that an agency intent on penalizing a party through adverse publicity,especially false or unauthorized publicity,might well merit a review of its action as a sanction.at but we have never had the need either to reconsider hearst radio,or to consider whether it is distinguishable.see indus.safety equip.ass n,at resolving case on the ground that,because plaintiffs offered no evidence that the publication was false or intended to penalize plaintiffs,it could not qualify as a sanction impro products,at resolving case on statute of limitations grounds.and the ftc insists that we are bound by hearst radio to conclude that its press release is not subject to apa review because it does not constitute agency action 
second,trudeau argues that he may maintain his case as a nonstatutory action.as we held in chamber of commerce reich,i f a plaintiff is unable to bring his case predicated on either a specific or general statutory review provision,he may still be able to institute a review action.at.because j udicial review is favored when an agency is charged with acting beyond its authority,dart united states,e ven where congress is understood generally to have precluded review,the supreme court has found an implicit but narrow exception,closely paralleling the historic origins of judicial review for agency actions in excess of jurisdiction.griffith flra.pursuant to this case law,judicial review is available when an agency acts ultra vires,even if a statutory cause of action is lacking.aid ass for lutherans united states postal,
trudeau contends that his f claim falls within the core of the doctrine of nonstatutory review because the issuance of a false and misleading press release exceeds the ftc authority to disseminate information in the public interest.f.the ftc counters that nonstatutory review is available only when an agency violate s a clear and mandatory statutory prohibition or a specific and unambiguous statutory command,and that f does not fit that bill.appellee br.quoting griffith,at.there certainly is no question that nonstatutory review is intended to be of extremely limited scope,griffith,at,and hence represents a more difficult course for trudeau than would review under the apa assuming final agency action for acts in excess of statutory authority,c.
third,trudeau asserts that he has a direct cause of action under the first amendment.we have inferred such a cause before and the ftc concedes that it is available to trudeau,see oral arg.tape at.such a cause would,however,be limited to trudeau claim of unconstitutional retaliation,and would not also would the claim that the press release exceeds the ftc statutory authority.
in sum,but for apa requirement of final agency action,the cause of action provided by the apa offers trudeau the more inclusive covering both his f and constitutional claims and more expansive as compared to the narrow scope of nonstatutory review vehicle for asserting his claims.by the same token,if trudeau claims would fail review under the apa even assuming the press release satisfied the requirement of,they could not succeed under any other vehicle.as we explain in the next part,we have concluded that trudeau claims would indeed fail,even with the benefit of that assumption.we are permitted to proceed in this manner because w hether a cause of action exists is not a question of jurisdiction,and may be assumed without being decided.air courier conference am.postal workers union,d citing burks lasker,d see impro products,at assuming that an allegedly false and misleading press release constituted final agency action,but holding that relief was nonetheless barred by the statute of limitations.
having found that there is jurisdiction to consider trudeau claims,and having assumed that there is a cause of action available to assert them,we now discuss why the allegations of trudeau complaint are nonetheless legally insufficient to state claims upon which relief can be granted.in subpart a,we identify an essential element of both of trudeau claims in subpart b,we explain why the existence of that element may be resolved on a motion to dismiss and in subpart c,we conclude that trudeau has failed to establish that element as a matter of law.
an essential element common to both of trudeau claims is the contention that the ftc press release is false or misleading trudeau complaint charges that the ftc retaliated against him by issuing a press release that falsely characterize d,compl,and intentionally misrepresented,id,the final order.that conduct,the complaint asserts,both exceeded the ftc authority under f and violated the first amendment.compl.similarly,trudeau appellate briefs charge that the ftc exceeded the authority granted by f by releasing a materially false and misleading news release,appellant br.citing compl.and violated the first amendment by disseminating false information about the stipulated order in retaliation for trudeau protected activity,id.at citing compl.
the district court suggested that,to succeed on his claims,trudeau would have to establish that the press release was obviously false.trudeau ftc,d at.as that stricter standard is unnecessary to resolve the case,we do not address it.that said,we do believe that trudeau must show that his allegations are sufficient to establish that the press release was at least false or misleading our insistence on that standard is justified because those are the claims that trudeau made in the district court and in his appellate briefs and because he cites no case that would support a lesser standard 
that standard is also justified by the interests that are at stake here.as we said in ftc cinderella career finishing schools,in the course of holding that f authorizes the ftc to issue factual press releases concerning pending adjudicatory proceedings 
if the unsophisticated consumer is to be protected in any measure from deceptive or unfair practices,it is essential that he be informed in some manner as to the identity of those most likely to prey upon him utilizing such prohibited conduct.certainly advice through news media as to actions being taken by a government agency in his behalf constitutes a prophylactic step addressed ultimately to the elimination of the conduct prohibited by the statute.the commission,in attempting to bring its action relative to what it has reason to believe is unlawful conduct to the attention of the widely spread public by the issuance of factual press releases,is,we conclude,acting within its authority as defined by the statute.
although there are important interests on the other side of the balance as well,they do not arise in a case involving the dissemination of information that concerns a document regarding a commercial matter,the final order and that is neither false nor misleading 
trudeau insists that whether the ftc press release is false or misleading is a question of fact that can not be determined on a motion to dismiss under rule b.
it is true that the federal rules of civil procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim,and that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d see swierkiewicz sorema,d.it is thus possible that,had trudeau complaint simply alleged that the ftc issued a false press release about him that was retaliatory and beyond the ftc authority,his complaint might have survived a motion to dismiss.see sparrow united air lines.of course,the text at issue would eventually have been flushed out by a motion for summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.but it also is possible for a plaintiff to plead too much that is,to plead himself out of court by alleging facts that render success on the merits impossible.id here,trudeau complaint makes quite clear which text he regards as false specified sentences in the press release,and why he regards it as false because of specified inconsistencies with the final order.and because he has attached all of the relevant text to the complaint,see compl.ex.a final order id.ex.b press release,it is appropriate for a court to examine that material in ruling under rule b.see francis xavier parochial,at see also kaempe myers,ramsey,cir durning first boston,cir.
moreover,although i n considering the claims dismissed pursuant to rule b,we must treat the complaint factual allegations as true and must grant plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts alleged,sparrow,at,we are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,papasan allain,d,or to accept inferences drawn by plaintiffs if such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint,kowal mci commc ns,see papasan,at.trudeau contends that whether a statement is false is always a factual matter and never a legal conclusion.we do not agree that the truth or falsity of a statement can never be decided as a matter of law.
moldea new york times,for example,involved an analogous situation a district court grant of summary judgment to a defamation defendant on the pleadings and without discovery,modified on reh g.based solely on a comparison of the plaintiff book and the book review that allegedly mischaracterized it,the district court concluded that defamatory statements in the review were not actionable as a matter of law because no reasonable juror could find them to be false.at.on appeal,we agreed with the district court as to two of the statements in the review.id.at see moldea,at 
we have also applied this no reasonable juror or no reasonable person test to a motion to dismiss.see browning clinton,affirming the dismissal of a defamation claim under rule b because no reasonable person would be able to infer that the defendant was accusing the plaintiff of deceitfulness so have other circuits we will do so here as well 
trudeau alleges that the ftc press release falsely and misleadingly characterizes the final order in four respects it falsely stat es that trudeau had been banned entirely from infomercials,erroneously impl ies that the settlement was a judicial finding that trudeau was a habitual false advertiser,falsely impl ies that the million was a fine,and conspicuously omit s the fact that there has been no finding of false advertising.appellant br.we consider each of these allegedly false and misleading assertions and implications,id.at,below.
first and foremost,trudeau objects to the press release repeated use of the word ban to describe the final order.appellant br.for example,the headline of the release states kevin trudeau banned from infomercials.app.similarly,acting director parnes is quoted as stating this ban is meant to shut down the infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years.id.at.trudeau contends that the use of the term ban or banned is inaccurate and misleading in two respects.appellant br.
trudeau argues that the word ban is misleading because the order did not completely bar trudeau from infomercials the agreement expressly permits trudeau to produce and appear in infomercials for books and other publications.id.but the release does not say that trudeau is completely barred from infomercials.to the contrary,the very first sentence of the release notes the precise caveat to which trudeau avers a federal trade commission settlement with kevin trudeau broadly bans him from disseminating future infomercials that advertise any type of product,except for truthful infomercials for informational publications.app.at emphasis added.and the sixth paragraph states that t he order ban on future infomercials exempts infomercials for books,newsletters,and other informational publications.id.at.
trudeau also insists that the term banned is inapposite because he agreed,as part of the stipulated order,not to produce certain types of infomercials the sort of coercion implied by the term banned never figured into the settlement.appellant br.emphasis in original.trudeau did agree,and the first paragraph of the release makes that quite clear to the reader,stating that trudeau agreed to these prohibitions to settle the ftc charges.app.at.but trudeau agreement to the order terms does not render the word ban inapposite.the dictionary defines ban as to prohibit esp ecially by legal means the dissemination of,webster new international dictionary philip babcock gove,emphasis added,and that is exactly what the final order did,see final order at listing prohibited business activities emphasis added id.at declaring that t his part ii prohibits the making of any representations for specified products emphasis added moreover,because the final order was entered by the district court,it surely is coercive trudeau may disregard the order only upon pain of punishment for contempt,a penalty he has previously received.see final order noting that the district court had previously found trudeau in contempt for violating the july stipulated preliminary injunction see also id.declaring that the provisions of this order are binding upon defendants id.at providing that the district court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter for purposes of enforcement of this order.
trudeau second contention is that the press release erroneously implies that the settlement represents a judicial finding that trudeau was a habitual false advertiser.in particular,he focuses on the release third paragraph 
this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years,said lydia parnes,acting director of the ftc bureau of consumer protection.other habitual false advertisers should take a lesson mend your ways or face serious consequences.
app.at.trudeau does not contend that the ftc or its officials acted improperly by asserting their own views.his contention is that a reader could reach no conclusion other than that the court had found trudeau to have engaged in false advertising,and had imposed a ban as punishment.appellant br.emphasis added.
that contention is wrong.by its use of quotation marks,the paragraph makes clear that the statement is that of acting director that of the district court.moreover,by the time a reader gets to that quotation,he or she has already read the italicized subtitle of the release,which states trudeau settles claims with coral calcium supreme and biotape underlining added,as well as the release first paragraph,which states that trudeau agreed to the provisions of the order to settle the ftc charges.app.at.and before concluding the release,the reader will also see the bolded note stating note this stipulated final order is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendants of a law violation.id.at italics added.given this context,no reasonable reader could conclude that the acting director parnes assertions reflected a judicial finding.appellant br.
trudeau next contends that the press release inaccurately characterizes the million that he must pay under the order.here,he focuses on paragraph two of the release,which states 
trudeau is paying in cash and transferring residential property and a luxury automobile to the commission to satisfy the million monetary judgment against him.
appellant br.quoting app.at emphasis added by appellant.according to trudeau t he fund was part of a voluntary settlement agreement and not a judgment at all.nevertheless,the news release overtly characterizes it as a fine,and thus misleads readers into the belief that it was imposed by the court as a punishment for false advertising.appellant br.
trudeau contention suffers from three fatal defects.contrary to his premise,the million fund is in fact part of a judgment against him,as the final order expressly states.see final order at entering judgment for equitable monetary relief in the amount of two million dollars.contrary to his assertion,the news release nowhere,overtly or otherwise,characterizes the million as a fine.and contrary to his implication,the press release makes clear,repeatedly,that the fund was part of a voluntary settlement agreement.see,app.at subtitle trudeau settles claims id.at announcing an ftc settlement with kevin trudeau id.stating that trudeau agreed to pay the ftc million to settle charges.
finally,trudeau asserts that the press release is misleading because it fails to expressly state,as the final order did,that there had been no findings or admissions of wrongdoing or liability with respect to trudeau.final order.as we said above,we do not believe that a reasonable reader could construe the press release as suggesting that there had been such a finding accordingly,an express disavowal was unnecessary to prevent such a reader from being misled.in any event,the online version of the is the version upon which trudeau focuses his attention contains a link to the final order,prominently displayed in bold at the corner of the webpage.the link permits any interested reader to compare the release with the order itself,including its disavowal of a judicial finding.see final order.with the terms of the order just two mouseclicks away,any potential misreading of the release can easily be averted.
the district court found that the differences between the press release and the stipulated order are minor or illusory.trudeau ftc,d at.we agree.contrary to trudeau contention,this is not a case in which only a highly skilled jurist or an ftc staff member,carefully parsing the language of the publication,would not be misled.reply br.rather,this is a case in which no reasonable person could misinterpret the press release in the ways that trudeau suggests.accordingly,trudeau complaint is legally insufficient to state a claim.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing trudeau complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
