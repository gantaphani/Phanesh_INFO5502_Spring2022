microsoft moved to strike plaintiff claim for restitution and any reference to restitution in the third amended complaint.the motion was predicated on a single sentence from korea supply any award that plaintiff would recover from defendants would not be restitutionary as it would not replace any money or property that defendants took directly from plaintiff.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.focusing on the word directly,microsoft argued that indirect purchasers those who purchase from someone other than the not obtain restitution because they paid no money directly to defendant.respondent court agreed with microsoft because plaintiff alleges no facts in the third amended complaint to show that he or any purported class member purchased a wireless device directly from microsoft and therefore could be eligible under the rule stated in korea supply to receive restitution from microsoft,the allegations of the third amended complaint are insufficient to support the remedy of restitution,and all allegations seeking restitution should be stricken.
