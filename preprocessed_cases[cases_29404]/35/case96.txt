in this decision,we determine whether an order denying a pretrial special motion to dismiss under nevada statute,is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine first recognized in cohen beneficial industrial loan.we previously considered related issues under oregon law in englert macdonell,cir,and california law in batzel smith,cir.we find that nevada statute is similar to oregon,and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
factual and procedural history 
on october,scott ferrell,an attorney practicing law in orange county california,sent demand letters to metabolic research,metabolic,at its address in las vegas,nevada,and to general nutrition centers,gnc,at its address in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.the demand letters purported to notify the recipients that they had violated california civil code,the california consumer legal remedies act clra,by falsely advertising the properties and potential benefits of a product named stemulite,which they marketed as a natural fitness supplement.ferrell represented that he was acting on behalf of michael campos,thomas hess,and sarah jordan,all of whom he alleged purchased stemulite in california,in reliance on the supposed false advertising,and had not received the purported benefits.ferrell further claimed that he was acting on behalf of a purported class of persons.in this decision,ferrell,his clients,and his prospective clients will be collectively referred to as ferrell,unless otherwise indicated.
in his demand letters,ferrell set out what he contended were representative false claims and summarized what he contended constituted violations of the clra.ferrell demanded that metabolic and gnc cease their false advertising of stemulite,identify all consumers who purchased stemulite within the applicable limitations period,and provide each of these consumers with an appropriate refund.in addition,ferrell demanded that metabolic and gnc disgorge all revenues from sales of stemulite for consumers who could not be identified and implement an appropriate corrective advertising campaign,including a labeling disclaimer.
ferrell concluded the letters with an offer to compromise and allowed metabolic and gnc thirty days from the date of his letters to agree to an injunction that include d an appropriate disclaimer in which case,ferrell agreed to take no further action,except to enforce the injunction.however,if metabolic and gnc chose not to accept the offer,ferrell stated that he would file a lawsuit presumably in california and seek all available relief 
on november,metabolic filed a lawsuit in nevada state court against ferrell,his putative class action plaintiffs,and various does,all identified as california residents,charging extortion.see.allowing treble damages for racketeering in aid of extortion metabolic complaint further charged racketeering based upon multiple publications of the demand letter to metabolic,to gnc and to gnc principals,conspiracy to engage in racketeering,civil extortion,tortious interference with contract,and tortious interference with prospective economic relations,interfering with the agreement between metabolic and gnc.metabolic sought declaratory relief and punitive damages.metabolic lawsuit directly referenced ferrell demand letter,which metabolic characterized as an accusation of mail fraud,in violation of.metabolic,in apparent anticipation of an motion by ferrell,expressly relied upon flatley mauro,which metabolic characterized as holding that communications are not privileged under california analogous statute,if the demands constitute extortion or blackmail as a matter of law.
on december,ferrell removed the case to the united states district court for the district of nevada based on complete diversity of citizenship.ferrell filed an answer on january,and on january,ferrell filed a special motion to dismiss based upon nevada statute.john,at 
metabolic filed a response to ferrell special motion to dismiss,and the district court held a hearing on april.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court denied the motion and directed metabolic to prepare an appropriate order.
in its order dismissing ferrell motion,the district court found that ferrell had not established that the demand letter to metabolic constituted a communication in furtherance of the right to petition because it concluded that nevada legislation only protected communications made directly to a governmental agency and did not protect a demand letter sent to a potential defendant in litigation.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
our jurisdiction is typically limited to final decisions.see also in re korean air lines,cir.generally,a final judgment is entered at the end of a case,permitting a single appeal to address all issues.see digital equip.desktop direct.however,there is a narrow class of decisions termed collateral orders that do not terminate the litigation,but must in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system nonetheless be treated as final.id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.in cohen beneficial industrial loan,the supreme court promulgated the collateral order doctrine,recognizing that such orders should be subject to immediate appeal.whether the district court order qualifies as an appealable collateral order under cohen will determine our jurisdiction.digital,at.we consider our jurisdiction de novo.andersen united states,cir.
a party pursuing an interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine must show that the order being appealed meets three criteria.it must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will hallock,internal quotation marks omitted.these requirements are applied strictly,in order to avoid the collateral order doctrine swallowing up the final judgment rule.see id.at a lthough the court has been asked many times to expand the small class of collaterally appealable orders,we have instead kept it narrow and selective in its membership.digital,at t he narrow exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered citation omitted.additionally,we do not limit our consideration to the single case before us.we must instead identify the category of cases to which our case belongs and consider a rule that will work for all cases in the category,regardless of whether the order in question is correct.digital,at t he issue of appealability under is to be determined for the entire category to which a claim belongs,without regard to the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a particular injustice averted by a prompt appellate court decision.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
applying this protocol,we must first identify the category of cases which must be considered in determining the need for immediate appeal.it might have been possible to look at all the cases dealing with litigation within this circuit as constituting a single category.indeed,it appears that all of the statutes adopted by the states in the ninth circuit have many components in common.however,deeper inspection has persuaded us that,while all of the statutes have common elements,there are significant differences as well,so that each state statutory scheme must be evaluated separately.accordingly,we have reached different conclusions with respect to the applicability of the collateral order doctrine after examining oregon law in englert macdonell,cir denying an immediate appeal of an motion to dismiss as a collateral order,and california law in batzel smith,cir granting an immediate appeal of an motion to dismiss as a collateral order.therefore,we consider only whether the denial of a special motion to dismiss brought under nevada statute qualifies as an immediately appealable order under cohen.
turning to that task,in englert we found it unnecessary to address the first two cohen requirements because the order at issue did not satisfy the third whether it would be effectively unre
