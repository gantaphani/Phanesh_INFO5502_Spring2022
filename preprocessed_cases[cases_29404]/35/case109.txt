this is an appeal from an injunction against the owner and operators of a nevada company that inspected homes for construction defects and encouraged homeowners to file claims against their builder under a nevada statute.del webb communities,the developer of a retirement community where the company inspected many homes,sued,alleging that the defendants business practices violated federal and state law.the district court permanently enjoined the defendants from soliciting performing residential inspections providing inspection reports in del webb nevada developments,by means of illegal,unlicensed and false practices,such as the representations,express or implied,that they,or any of them are properly licensed under nevada law to perform structural inspections properly licensed under nevada law to perform,provide or communicate inspection reports are acting as representatives or agents under the authority of del webb we conclude that the general prohibition against operating by means of illegal,unlicensed and false practices is too vague to stand.we affirm the remaining provisions of the injunction but reject the district court reliance on nevada common law of champerty to create a tort cause of action for which del webb could obtain relief.we therefore vacate the injunction in part and affirm in part.
background 
mojave construction is a sole proprietorship operated by charles leslie partington.partington had a limited nevada b contractor license but no structural inspection license under chapter of the nevada revised statutes.john wilson operated mojave chapter claims division under a management and agreement with partington.wilson held neither a contractor nor an inspector license.the claims division name refers to chapter of the nevada revised statutes,which governs actions involving constructional defects.shuette beazer homes holdings.the statute allows a homeowner who has notified his builder of constructional defects to sue the builder for damages if the builder does not repair the defects within a reasonable time.see nrs horton district court.damages under chapter include the cost of hiring an expert to a scertain the nature and extent of the constructional defects.nrs f.instead of charging homeowners directly for its inspections,mojave relied on this provision to obtain payment.mojave contracts required homeowners to submit invoices for the inspections to the and request payment and stated that mojave would collect its inspection fee if or when the builder reimbursed the homeowner.the contracts assigned mojave the the right to recover any and all inspection fees from the builder if the builder fails to pay all the inspection fees.
mojave inspected many homes in sun city anthem,a del webb retirement community in henderson,nevada mojave distributed fliers,posted placards,and advertised through a website.mojave fliers and placards included statements that the home inspections were free referred to the inspections as builder inspections referred to the inspectors as representatives experts from both mc mojave construction your builder,his subcontractors and agents and stated that it had a construction lic.mojave various advertisements and solicitations also included statements that the inspections were done by both mojave and the builder inspection team and that construction items found to be deficient would be repaired at no cost to the homeowners.mojave advertisements and solicitations encouraged homeowners to file chapter claims seeking compensation for home repairs against del webb.
mojave provided homeowners with engagement letters for several law firms to begin chapter actions based on defects listed in the inspection reports that mojave generated.the engagement letters required the homeowners to pay all litigation costs if the homeowners terminated the relationship but obtained home repairs.one of the law firms,angius terry,paid mojave when a homeowner signed an engagement letter and more if the chapter action succeeded.this law firm sent del webb letters instructing it to communicate only with the law firm,not the homeowners,about the homeowners claimed construction defects,even though del webb provided warranties for its homes beginning in.
del webb sued partington mojave and wilson in nevada federal court,seeking damages and injunctive relief.the district court preliminarily enjoined mojave from conducting further inspections.in ruling on summary judgment motions,the district court held that mojave agreements violated nevada prohibition against champerty and maintenance,based on mojave use of its own funds and resources to instigate and prosecute chapter actions in which it had no interest and based on the requirement in mojave contracts with homeowners that they pay mojave fees from the amounts obtained from del webb.the district court also held that mojave was required to have a chapter license to perform its inspections and that mojave had falsely represented in its advertising and solicitations that it had such a license.
the district court issued a permanent injunction.the court findings of fact and conclusions of law included that mojave committed a tort by violating nevada prohibition against champerty violated the nevada deceptive trade practices act by performing inspections without the license required under chapter violated both the nevada deceptive trade practices act and the lanham act by representing that the home evaluations were free and that mojave was affiliated with del webb and tortiously interfered with del webb warranty contracts with homeowners by instructing del webb to communicate only with the lawyers filing the chapter action.the permanent injunction provided 
it is hereby ordered that mojave,partington,wilson,and their affiliates and others acting in concert with defendants,are enjoined from soliciting performing residential inspections providing inspection reports in sun city anthem,or any other del webb nevada developments,by means of illegal,unlicensed and false practices,such as the representations,express or implied,that they,or any of them are properly licensed under nevada law to perform structural inspections properly licensed under nevada law to perform,provide or communicate inspection reports are acting as representatives or agents under the authority of del webb 
the parties resolved the damages claim and stipulated that the permanent injunction was the final judgment.mojave timely appealed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under a.lonberg city of riverside,cir.we will reverse an order of injunction only if the district court abused its discretion.ebay,cir.we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.id.
iii.analysis 
a.the general prohibition against illegal,unlicensed and false practices 
rule d requires an injunction to state its terms specifically and describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained.d b c.the benchmark for clarity and fair notice is not lawyers and judges,who are schooled in the nuances of the law,but instead the lay person,who is the target of the injunction.reno air racing ass n,mccord,cir see also schmidt lessard,d t he specificity provisions of rule d are no mere technical requirements.the rule was designed to prevent uncertainty and confusion on the part of those faced with injunctive orders,and to avoid the possible founding of a contempt citation on a decree too vague to be understood.
the permanent injunction prohibits the defendants from soliciting performing residential inspections providing inspection reports by means of illegal,unlicensed and false practices.the order identifies three prohibited practices as examples such as of illegal,unlicensed and false practices falsely representing that the defendants are properly licensed under nevada law to perform structural inspections properly licensed under nevada law to perform,provide or communicate inspection reports are acting as representatives or agents or under the authority of del webb.even with these examples,the general prohibition against using illegal,unlicensed and false practices is too vague to be enforceable.the examples of prohibited past conduct do not sufficiently define what additional future conduct will be covered 
the broad prohibition against soliciting performing residential inspections providing inspection reports by means of illegal,unlicensed and false practices is vacated.we next consider the injunction specific prohibitions.
b.the specific prohibitions against misrepresentations 
misrepresenting mojave affiliation with del webb 
during argument,mojave clarified that it does not challenge the injunction prohibition on representing that it is affiliated with del webb or its parent,pulte.that portion of the injunction is affirmed.
misrepresenting mojave license 
mojave does challenge the injunction against representing that it was properly licensed under nevada law to conduct its inspections.the district court held that chapter of the nevada revised statutes requires a license for the inspections mojave conducted,and that nrs gave del webb standing to challenge mojave practices.
nevada statutes are interpreted according to their plain meaning unless it clearly appears that the legislature did not intend such a meaning.city of reno constr.trades council of.we must not interpret a statute to render words or phrases superfluous or make a provision nugatory.ass clark,internal quotations omitted.
the text of chapter makes its application to mojave inspections clear.chapter requires a ny person who engages in the business of,acts in the capacity of,or advertises or assumes to act as an inspector to obtain a certificate from the state of nevada.nrs.an inspector is a person who examines any component of a structure and prepares or communicates an inspection report.nrs.an inspection report is an analysis,opinion or conclusion,regarding the condition of a structure,that is p rovided after an inspection,in a written report,for or with the expectation of receiving compensation for the report and d esigned to describe and identify the inspected systems or structural components of the structure,their physical condition,any material defect and any recommendation for evaluation by another person.nrs.
mojave argument that it did not provide inspection reports with the expectation of receiving compensation for the report,see nrs,is unpersuasive.mojave acknowledged that its business plan was to be paid for its inspection work through the proceeds that homeowners received from the chapter claims.mojave contracts required the homeowner to pay its fees and expenses out of the chapter payments received from the homebuilder.the contracts assigned the homeowners right to those payments to mojave if the homeowners were unable to collect the full cost of inspection.mojave did,therefore,expect ultimately to receive compensation for its inspection reports.
nrs contains eight express exceptions.mojave relies on the exception for any person who provides an estimate of cost,repair or replacement of any improvements upon real estate.nrs.mojave argues that the c ost of repair or replacement estimates in construction defect claims were all mojave reports ultimately were used for,if they were used at all.mojave argument is not supported by the language of the exception,which focuses on the person who provided the inspection report and not on how the report was ultimately used.nor is mojave argument supported by the record,which shows that the inspection reports identified structural deficiencies but did not provide cost estimates to repair or replace them.the exception under section does not apply.
mojave remaining arguments have no basis in chapter text.mojave first contends that chapter applies only to inspections conducted for sales.the statute explicitly excepts certain inspections unrelated to real estate sales,which would be unnecessary if the statute covered only inspections mojave next argues that licensed general contractors inspections do not require a chapter license.chapter explicitly excepts from its licensing requirement individuals holding licenses under chapters,and.nrs.there is no exception for general contractors licensed under chapter.cramer.dep t of motor vehicles,refusing to recognize an unenumerated exception when the statute contained enumerated exceptions mojave final argument is that chapter does not apply to inspections used in chapter actions because the nevada legislature did not intend homeowners to pay fees for inspections to use in chapter actions.but chapter does not regulate the fees that inspectors charge homeowners or how those fees are paid.nrs,the only provision that mentions compensation,simply states that chapter requirements apply only to those inspections for which compensation is expected.the district court correctly nevada law required mojave to obtain licenses under chapter to perform its inspections and that mojave misrepresented that it had the required license.
mojave argument that del webb lacked standing to challenge its practices is also unpersuasive.nrs provides that a n action may be brought by any person who is a victim of consumer fraud.power district court,per curiam.nrs e includes in the definition of consumer fraud a deceptive trade practice as defined in nrs to,inclusive.nrs makes it a deceptive practice knowingly to conduct one business or occupation without all required state,county or city licenses.
mojave argues that del webb was not a victim of consumer fraud because del webb is neither a consumer of mojave services nor a business competitor.the statute does not support this argument.the statute allows any person who is a victim of consumer fraud to sue.nrs.the word consumer modifies fraud,but does not limit any person or victim.see surety adco credit,declining to limit any person in another nevada statutory private right of action for similar reasons.nrs defines the kinds of actions that constitute consumer fraud not by referring to a certain type of victim,but by other nrs sections defining deceptive trade practices and other offenses.see nrs.
mojave acknowledges that a victim of consumer fraud need not be a consumer of the defendant goods or services.see serv.excel,d,allowing a business competitor to sue under nrs.mojave argues that southern service limits nrs standing to consumers and business competitors.southern service holds that a business competitor has standing to sue under nrs but does not state that only consumers of a good or service or competitors providing such a good or service have standing.there is no basis in the text of nrs or in southern service to limit standing to a group broader than consumers but no broader than business competitors.
the standing issue turns on whether mojave business practices directly harmed del webb.serv,d at.the district court found that mojave illegal structural inspections and provision of reports based thereon and misrepresentations of authority to perform such services and of a relationship with del webb in dealing with the public has damaged del webb relationship with consumers and threatens to continue to harm del webb business,reputation and good will and to exposure to chapter litigation based on illegal inspections and inspection reports.neither in its briefing nor at oral argument did mojave challenge this finding or explain why it was insufficient to establish the direct injury needed to give del webb standing to sue 
because nevada law provides a basis for the specific prohibitions mojave challenges,it is unnecessary to address whether the lanham act provides an additional and similar statutory basis for granting the same relief but the district court reliance on nevada common law of champerty as a separate basis for the injunction does merit discussion.
champerty and maintenance 
champerty generally refers to an agreement in which a person without interest in another litigation undertakes to carry on the litigation at his own expense,in whole or in part,in consideration of receiving,in the event of success,a part of the proceeds of the litigation.schwartz eliades,per curiam quoting martin morgan drive away,cir.maintenance refers to a person assisting in litigation in which he has no interest.vosburg equip.zupancic,see also in re primus,d put simply,maintenance is hel
