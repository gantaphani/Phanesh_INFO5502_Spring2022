philip morris usa,philip morris,appeals a judgment awarding jodie bullock million in punitive damages after a jury trial.a jury previously had awarded in compensatory damages.philip morris contends the punitive damages award is barred by res judicata as a result of the settlement of an action by the california attorney general against philip morris and other cigarette manufacturers,and the award is unconstitutionally excessive.philip morris also challenges the award of prejudgment interest from the date of the verdict.we conclude that each of these contentions is without merit.
this action involves a different cause of action from the prior action by the attorney general so res judicata is inapplicable.in addition,philip morris conduct in intentionally deceiving smokers and the public in general for several decades concerning the adverse health effects of cigarette smoking,while formulating its cigarettes so as to make them more addictive,and aggressively advertising to youths and others before july,was extremely reprehensible.in light of such extreme reprehensibility,including the vast scale and profitability of philip morris misconduct,and its strong financial condition,the million in punitive damages,approximately times the compensatory damages award,is not unconstitutionally excessive.finally,the trial court properly awarded prejudgment interest from the date of the verdict pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a and rule of the california rules of court.in light of these conclusions,we will affirm the judgment and the order awarding prejudgment interest.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
betty bullock smoked cigarettes manufactured by philip morris for years from,when she was years old,until she was diagnosed with lung cancer in.she smoked philip morris marlboro brand of cigarettes until,and then switched to its benson hedges brand.she died in february.
scientific and medical professionals in the united states and worldwide generally agreed by the late that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer,after several epidemiological studies reached that conclusion.philip morris and other cigarette manufacturers sought to cast doubt on the increasing body of knowledge supporting the conclusion that smoking caused lung cancer and sought to assuage smokers concerns.to that end,philip morris and other cigarette manufacturers issued a announcement in newspapers throughout the united states in january entitled a frank statement to cigarette smokers.the announcement stated,recent reports on experiments with mice have given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung cancer in human beings,and stated that d istinguished authorities point ed out that there was no proof that cigarette smoking caused cancer and that numerous scientists questioned the validity of the statistics themselves.
the frank statement stated,we accept an interest in people health as a basic responsibility,paramount to every other consideration in our business.we believe the products we make are not injurious to health.we always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.it announced the formation of the tobacco industry research committee and stated,we are pledging aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health.this joint financial aid will of course be in addition to what is already being contributed by individual companies.in charge of the research activities of the committee will be a scientist of unimpeachable integrity and national repute.in addition there will be an advisory board of scientists disinterested in the cigarette industry.a group of distinguished men from medicine,science,and education will be invited to serve on this board.these scientists will advise the committee on its research activities.in the years that followed,the tobacco industry research committee and its publicists disseminated the message that there was no proof that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer and other diseases through news releases,distribution of research and editorial materials favorable to the tobacco industry,personal contacts with editors,journalists,and producers,and other means.
philip morris for many years publicly continued to insist that there was no consensus in the scientific community that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer and that philip morris was actively pursuing scientific research to resolve the purported controversy,while privately acknowledging that there was no true controversy,that its true goal was to discredit reports that linked smoking with lung cancer,and that it had no intention of funding research that would reveal the health hazards of smoking.the tobacco institute,a trade organization funded by philip morris and other cigarette manufacturers,issued a press release in discrediting a recent article and stating that the views that smoking caused cancer are a subject of much disagreement in the scientific world and the cause or causes of lung cancer continue to be unknown.the tobacco institute stated in a press release in that the tobacco industry was vitally interested in getting the facts that will provide answers to questions about smoking and health,and described the industry research efforts as a crusade for research in the agricultural stations,the scientific laboratories,and the great hospitals and medical centers of the nation.it stated,the industry does not know the causes of the diseases in question.
a cigarette company executive appearing before congress in on behalf of several cigarette manufacturers,including philip morris,stated that n early everyone familiar with these difficult problems will agree that there is a very high degree of uncertainty whether smoking causes cancer or any other disease.later that year,the tobacco institute issued a press release stating,research to date has not established whether smoking is or is not causally involved in such diseases as lung cancer and heart disease,despite efforts to make it seem otherwise.the matter remains an open question for resolution by scientists.the press release stated,we are earnestly trying to find the answers,and,if there is something in tobacco that is causally related to cancer or any other disease,the tobacco industry wants to find out what it is,and the sooner the better.if it is something in tobacco or the smoke,i am sure this can be remedied by the scientists.
philip morris chief executive officer and chairman of the executive committee of the tobacco institute,joseph cullman iii,stated on the television news program face the nation cbs,if any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to human health,we are confident that we can eliminate that ingredient.he stated further,we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous we do accept that.the tobacco institute issued a report in entitled smoking and health the continuing controversy,stating,scientists have not proven that cigarette smoke or any of the thousands of its constituents as found in cigarette smoke cause human disease.the tobacco institute issued a report in entitled the cigarette controversy why more research is needed,and emphasized that it is not known whether smoking has a role in the development of various diseases a great deal more research is needed to uncover the causes and the mechanisms involved in their onset.the report stated that the theory that cigarette smoking causes various diseases is just that,a theory and stated,there were basic flaws in the methods used in the major epidemiological surveys that cast doubts on the accuracy of the claimed correlations.
contrary to its repeated public pronouncements,philip morris privately acknowledged the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and other diseases and sought to avoid promoting any research that would reveal that link.an internal document prepared by philip morris in for purposes of research and development stated,carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds in smoke,and provided a partial list of carcinogens in cigarette smoke.
a memorandum from a philip morris research scientist to its president stated of the council for tobacco research,the successor of the tobacco industry research committee,it has been stated that ctr is a program to find out the truth about smoking and health.what is truth to one is false to another.ctr and the industry have publicly and frequently denied what others find as truth.let face it.we are interested in evidence which we believe denies the allegation that cigarette smoking causes disease.notes from a meeting of cigarette company executives and legal counsel state that the tobacco industry research committee was set up as an industry shield and that the council for tobacco research has acted as a front.
william farone,a chemist employed by philip morris as a scientific researcher beginning in and as director of applied research from to,testified at trial that scientists working for philip morris knew that cigarette smoking caused cancer many years before he began to work for the company.farone testified that during his years at philip morris there was no controversy among its scientists as to whether smoking caused diseases,and that public statements that it was not known whether smoking played a role in the development of various diseases and that a great deal more research was needed to identify the causes of the diseases were false.he testified that another public statement challenging the epidemiological research as inconclusive was a misleading and that philip morris scientists knew that cigarette smoke contained carcinogens and that the carcinogens caused cancer.
farone testified that thomas osdene,philip morris director of research,and others told him on several occasions that osdene real job and the job of scientists working under him was to maintain the appearance of a scientific controversy concerning smoking and health.moreover,farone testified that philip morris performed no animal toxicity studies of cigarettes in the united states,pursuant to a gentleman agreement with other cigarette manufacturers,but arranged for a company in germany to perform toxicity tests on animals there.other philip morris scientists explained to farone that the reason for testing cigarettes abroad was so the results would not be available by subpoena in the united states.the test results were sent to osdene,usually at his home,who would report the results to other philip morris scientists verbally and destroy the written records.
philip morris conducted animal research in the united states on the addictive effects of nicotine in the early.it sought to develop a substitute for nicotine that would produce the same addictive effects but without the adverse cardiovascular effects of nicotine.philip morris closely guarded the results of its research and threatened to sue its former scientists who proposed publication of an article.philip morris successfully developed nicotine analogs and had the ability to remove nicotine from cigarettes,but did not do so.moreover,philip morris added urea to cigarettes,which becomes ammonia when heated,to enhance the effect of nicotine.philip morris added approximately different substances to tobacco in cigarettes to enhance the flavor and for other purposes.a former philip morris research scientist who worked for the company in the early testified,never once in my whole time at the company did i hear any concern for the customer,other than one scientist who was complaining that he was repeatedly repeatedly having his research changed in direction any time he came upon some hot research.
philip morris heavily advertised its cigarettes on television in the and,until the federal government banned cigarette advertising on television in.television advertising had a particularly strong influence on youths under the age of,for whom there was a positive correlation between television viewing time and the incidence of smoking.philip morris print advertisements for marlboro and other cigarette brands in,when bullock began smoking at the age of,and generally in the years from to,depicted handsome men and glamorous young women.some advertisements featured slogans such as loved for gentleness and the gentlest cigarette you can smoke.
the attorney general of california,on behalf of the people of california,and the california director of health services filed a complaint against several cigarette manufacturers,including philip morris,and other tobacco industry organizations in.they alleged that the defendants had conspired to deceive the public concerning the adverse health effects of smoking by suppressing truthful information and spreading disinformation.they also alleged that the defendants had specifically targeted minors in their advertising and marketing campaigns.the attorney general and director of health services alleged counts for recovery of the value of medi cal benefits provided to treat injuries and illnesses welf,restraint of trade in violation of the cartwright act bus,et violation of the false claims act,et and unfair competition bus,et.they sought compensatory and punitive damages,civil penalties and a permanent injunction.similar actions were commenced against the same defendants in other states.
philip morris and other cigarette manufacturers entered into a master settlement agreement msa with states,including california,in settling the civil litigation by the states against the manufacturers.the manufacturers denied the allegations of wrongdoing and admitted no liability,but agreed to several restrictions on the advertising and promotion of cigarettes.they also agreed to dissolve the tobacco institute,the council for tobacco research,and the council for indoor air research,and agreed not to target youths as smokers or potential smokers,suppress research on the health hazards of smoking,or make any misrepresentation of fact concerning the health consequences of smoking.the participating cigarette manufacturers also agreed to pay several billion dollars per year to the states,with each manufacturer responsible for a portion of the total payment according to its market share.the trial court in the action by the attorney general and the director of health services entered a consent decree and final judgment consent decree in december,incorporating the msa.
philip morris issued a statement on its internet site in december acknowledging for the first time,there is an overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer,heart disease,emphysema and other serious diseases in smokers.smokers are far more likely to develop serious diseases,like lung cancer,than.there is no safe cigarette.these are and have been the messages of public health authorities worldwide.the statement also acknowledged that cigarette smoking is addictive.
trial court proceedings and prior appeal 
betty bullock sued philip morris in april seeking to recover damages for personal injuries based on products liability,fraud and other theories.the jury returned a special verdict in september finding that there was a defect in the design of the cigarettes and that they were negligently designed that philip morris failed to adequately warn bullock of the dangers of smoking before july,that it intentionally and negligently misrepresented material facts and made a false promise that it intentionally concealed material facts before july,and that each of those acts of misconduct was a cause of bullock injury.the jury found that philip morris was guilty of malice,fraud or oppression with respect to each count.the jury awarded bullock in compensatory damages,including in noneconomic damages for pain and suffering,and later awarded her billion in punitive damages.the trial court entered a judgment on the jury verdict.
the trial court denied philip morris motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and denied in part its motion for a new trial,but granted the new trial motion as to excessive damages,with the condition that the court would deny the new trial motion if bullock consented to reduce the punitive damages award to million.she consented to the reduction.the court entered an amended judgment in january awarding a total of in compensatory and punitive damages.both parties appealed the amended judgment.betty bullock died in february 
on appeal,we concluded that the refusal of philip morris proposed instruction prohibiting punishment for harm caused to others was error and that the punitive damages award therefore must be reversed,but that there was no error in the compensatory damages award or the finding of oppression,fraud or malice.bullock philip morris usa,th.we therefore reversed the judgment as to the amount of punitive damages only and remanded the matter for a new trial limited to determining the amount of punitive damages id.at.
the jury in the limited retrial returned a special verdict on august,awarding bullock million in punitive damages.the trial court entered an amended judgment on december,awarding in compensatory damages,pursuant to the prior judgment,and million in punitive damages.the court denied philip morris motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the court granted bullock motion for prejudgment interest on the punitive damages award from the date of the verdict.philip morris timely appealed the amended judgment and the order granting the motion for prejudgment interest.
contentions 
philip morris contends the consent decree bars any award of punitive damages in this case under the res judicata doctrine the million punitive damages award is unconstitutionally excessive and the award of prejudgment interest from the date of the verdict was error.
discussion 
res judicata is inapplicable 
res judicata,or claim preclusion,precludes the relitigation of a cause of action that was litigated in a prior proceeding if three requirements are satisfied the present action is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the parties in the present action or parties in privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding.boeken philip morris usa,cal th.res judicata not only precludes the relitigation of issues that were actually litigated,but also precludes the litigation of issues that could have been litigated in the prior proceeding.busick workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,amin khazindar th.
for purposes of res judicata,a cause of action consists of the plaintiff primary right to be free from a particular injury,the defendant corresponding primary duty and the defendant wrongful act in breach of that duty.mycogen monsanto cal th,mycogen.the violation of a primary right gives rise to only a single cause of action.ibid.the plaintiff indivisible primary right must be distinguished from both the legal theory on which the plaintiff seeks relief and the remedy sought.the plaintiff may seek various remedies based on different legal theories,all arising from a single cause of action.ibid.
t he cause of action is based upon the harm suffered,as opposed to the particular theory asserted by the litigant.citation.even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated,one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief.hence a judgment for the defendant is a bar to a subsequent action by the plaintiff based on the same injury to the same right,even though he presents a different legal ground for relief.citations.thus,under the primary rights theory,the determinative factor is the harm suffered.when two actions involving the same parties seek compensation for the same harm,they generally involve the same primary right.citation.boeken philip morris usa,supra,cal th at.
the primary right that bullock seeks to vindicate in this action is based on her personal injuries.those personal physical and emotional injuries differ from the economic injuries and injuries to market competition alleged by the attorney general and the director of health services in their complaint.we therefore conclude that this action involves a different primary right and a different cause of action than the prior action that was resolved by the consent decree.res judicata does not apply 
the punitive damages award is not unconstitutionally excessive 
due process limitation on punitive damages 
punitive damages may be imposed under state law to further a state legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.bmw of north america,gore.gore.states have considerable flexibility in determining the appropriate level of punitive damages to allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case.ibid.the amount of punitive damages offends due process under the fourteenth amendment as arbitrary only if the award is grossly excessive in relation to the state legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.see also state farm mut.automobile ins.campbell.state farm.
a court determining whether a punitive damages award is excessive under the due process clause must consider three guideposts the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.citation.state farm,supra,at.the defendant financial condition also is an essential consideration for a court reviewing a punitive damages award under california law,and is a permissible consideration under the due process clause in determining the amount of punitive damages necessary to further the state legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.simon san paolo holding,cal th,simon.
on appeal,we defer to findings of historical fact if they are supported by substantial evidence,and we independently assess each of the three guideposts and determine de novo whether the punitive damages award is excessive under the due process clause.state farm,supra,at cooper industries,leatherman tool group.cooper industries simon,supra,cal th at fn.as the california supreme court stated in simon,supra,at page,while we must,under cooper industries,supra,assess independently the wrongfulness of a defendant conduct,our determination of a maximum award should allow some leeway for the possibility of reasonable differences in the weighing of culpability.in enforcing federal due process limits,an appellate court does not sit as a replacement for the jury but only as a check on arbitrary awards.citation.
degree of reprehensibility 
the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct is the most important indicator of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.state farm,supra,at gore,supra,at.the united states supreme court in state farm,supra,at page,stated we have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.citation.the existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.it should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages,so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant culpability,after having paid compensatory damages,is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.citation.
a court properly may consider the defendant similar wrongful conduct toward others in determining the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct toward the defendant.as we stated in bullock philip morris usa,supra,th at pages 
a state generally has no legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of the state jurisdiction.state farm,supra,at.a basic principle of federalism is that each state may make its own reasoned judgment about what conduct is permitted or proscribed within its borders,and each state alone can determine what measure of punishment,if any,to impose on a defendant who acts within its jurisdiction.citation.id.at.moreover,a defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff,not for being an unsavory individual or business.due process does not permit courts,in the calculation of punitive damages,to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct fn.omitted.id.at,citation omitted.this does not mean,however,that the defendant similar wrongful conduct toward others should not be considered in determining the amount of punitive damages.johnson ford motor cal th,fn.d,johnson.
the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct toward the plaintiff depends in part on the scale and profitability of the course of conduct of which the defendant conduct toward the plaintiff is a part.johnson,supra,cal th at.t he court in state farm noted that conduct involving repeated actions was worse than,and could be punished more severely than,conduct limited to an isolated incident.state farm,supra,at.fn.omitted.johnson,supra,at.the state farm court stated that even l awful conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant action in the state where it is tortious,but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.state farm,supra,at.the california supreme court in johnson stated,to consider the defendant entire course of conduct in setting or reviewing a punitive damages award,even in an individual plaintiff lawsuit,is not to punish the defendant for its conduct toward others.an enhanced punishment for recidivism does not directly punish the earlier offense it is,rather,a stiffened penalty for the last crime,which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.ewing california,d.by placing the defendant conduct on one occasion into the context of a business practice or policy,an individual plaintiff can demonstrate that the conduct toward him or her was more blameworthy and warrants a stronger penalty to deter continued or repeated conduct of the same nature.johnson,supra,at,fn.johnson stated further,the scale and profitability of a course of wrongful conduct by the defendant can not justify an award that is grossly excessive in relation to the harm done or threatened,but scale and profitability nevertheless remain relevant to reprehensibility and hence to the size of award warranted,under the guideposts,to meet the state interest in deterrence nothing the high court has said about due process review requires that california juries and courts ignore evidence of corporate policies and practices and evaluate the defendant harm to the plaintiff in isolation.id.at.
philip morris knew that the consensus among scientific and medical professionals was that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer and other serious diseases,that its cigarettes contained many carcinogens,and that smokers suffered lung cancer and other serious diseases at rates far greater than nonsmokers.despite that knowledge,philip morris and other cigarette manufacturers for many years conducted a public campaign designed to obscure and deny the truth.philip morris falsely asserted that there was no consensus in the scientific and medical community concerning the adverse health effects of smoking and that the relationship between smoking and health was unknown.philip morris assured its customers that if it learned that any cigarette ingredient caused cancer it would remove that ingredient,and falsely stated that it did not believe that smoking was hazardous.philip morris repeatedly asserted that more research was needed and that it was diligently pursuing that research,but avoided sponsoring any research that would reveal the hazards of smoking and went to great lengths to avoid disclosing its own toxicological data.rather than remove nicotine from its cigarettes as it had the ability to do,philip morris added urea to its cigarettes to enhance the effect of nicotine so as to further exploit its customers addiction and gain new customers.its customers included individuals such as bullock who first began to smoke as youths before july,attracted in part by an aggressive advertising campaign in television,print and other media that was particularly appealing to youths.
the harm caused by philip morris misconduct was physical rather than economic because the evidence shows that bullock suffered a debilitating and terminal illness,lung cancer,as a result of philip morris fraudulent scheme.the first reprehensibility factor listed by the court in state farm,supra,at page,whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic,therefore weighs in favor of high reprehensibility.the second factor,whether the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others ibid,also weighs in favor of high reprehensibility because the evidence shows that philip morris knew that many smokers would suffer death or serious injury as a result of smoking but,for pecuniary gain,sought to convince its customers and the public in general that the health concerns were unfounded.
the third reprehensibility factor,whether the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability state farm,supra,at,ordinarily is relevant only if financial vulnerability made the target more vulnerable to the defendant wrongful conduct or exacerbated the harm,such as where the harm caused by the defendant conduct was economic.see gore,supra,at infliction of economic injury,especially when done intentionally through affirmative acts of misconduct citation or when the target is financially vulnerable,can warrant a substantial penalty,cited in state farm,supra,at.the united states supreme court has reviewed the amount of punitive damages under the due process clause only in cases involving economic harm.state farm,supra,at insureds bad faith action against an insurer gore,supra,at purchaser fraud action against a car dealer txo production alliance resources.plur.opn.of stevens,slander of title action pacific mutual life insurance haslip.insureds fraud action against an insurer see also cooper industries,supra,at unfair competition.we have no trouble concluding,however,that in a case involving physical harm,the physical or physiological vulnerability of the target of the defendant conduct is an appropriate factor to consider in determining the degree of reprehensibility,particularly if the defendant deliberately exploited that vulnerability.gore,supra,at.because the evidence shows that nicotine is an addictive drug that makes smokers highly vulnerable to rationalization of their injurious behavior,and that philip morris for many years and through extensive efforts deliberately exploited that vulnerability through a deceptive,publicity campaign,manipulation of the narcotic effect of nicotine in cigarettes and other means,we conclude that this factor weighs in favor of high reprehensibility.
the fourth and fifth factors are whether the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.state farm,supra,at philip morris efforts to cast doubt on information concerning the adverse health effects of smoking involved repeated intentional and deliberate actions through various means and for several decades,and the evidence shows that philip morris intended to deceive smokers and the public in general.bullock was only one of many smokers affected by philip morris nationwide efforts to disseminate misleading information and create a false controversy concerning the adverse health effects of smoking.these factors therefore also weigh in favor of high reprehensibility.
finally,philip morris earned well over billion in profits,in dollars,from through the original trial date in,arising in large part from the domestic sales of tobacco products those profits presumably resulted in no small part from philip morris wrongful conduct.we therefore conclude that the vast scale and profitability of the course of misconduct johnson,supra,cal th at weighs in favor of high reprehensibility.
because each of the five factors weighs in favor of high reprehensibility and in light of the vast scale and profitability of its actions,we conclude that philip morris misconduct was extremely reprehensible 
disparity between actual harm and punitive damages 
the second guidepost is that punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages or to the actual or potential harm to the plaintiff.gore,supra,at,accord,state farm,supra,at.c ourts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.state farm,supra,at.
the united states supreme court has consistently rejected the notion that a mathematical formula or fixed ratio defines the constitutional limit.the high court in gore stated,we have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula,and i t is appropriate to reiterate our rejection of a categorical approach.gore,supra,at.similarly,state farm stated,w e decline again to impose a ratio which a punitive damages award can not exceed,and there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass.state farm,supra,at.state farm stated further,however,our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate,however,that,in practice,few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process multipliers are more likely to comport with due process,while still achieving the state goals of deterrence and retribution,than awards with ratios in the range of to citation or,in this case,of to.ibid.
state farm explained that the due process limitation is elastic,rather than rigid,and depends on the circumstances nonetheless,because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass,ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.see also ibid.positing that a higher ratio might be necessary where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine.the converse is also true,however.when compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.the precise award in any case,of course,must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.state farm,supra,at page,quoting gore,supra,at.
the california supreme court in johnson,supra,cal th at page,explained,to be sure,state farm requires reasonable proportionality between punitive damages and actual or potential harm to the plaintiff.but what ratio is reasonable necessarily depends on the reprehensibility of the conduct,the most important indicium of the reasonableness of the award state farm,supra,at,which in turn is influenced by the frequency and profitability of the defendant prior or contemporaneous similar conduct.as the high court has recognized,that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in profitable but wrongful conduct tends to show that strong medicine is required to deter the conduct further repetition.citations.
the statement in state farm,supra,at page,that punitive damages may be limited to the amount of compensatory damages if the compensatory damages are substantial reflects the reality that punitive damages in the same amount as a substantial compensatory award will also be substantial and the fact that a large compensatory damages award may have a deterrent effect and reduce the need for punitive damages as a deterrent see simon,supra,cal th at mirkin wasserman cal th.we believe that whether punitive damages must be limited to the amount of compensatory damages,or any other amount,to satisfy due process depends on the reviewing court consideration of the three guideposts and the defendant financial condition,and the facts and circumstances in each case state farm,supra,at,simon,supra,cal th at.in our view,nothing in state farm suggests otherwise.specifically,nothing in state farm suggests that the high court,while declining to impose a limit in other cases,imposed the amount of compensatory damages as a limit in cases where the compensatory damages are substantial.
the california supreme court in simon,supra,cal th at page,stated that state farm,supra,established a type of presumption that ratios significantly greater than a ratio violate due process absent a special justification simon cited extreme reprehensibility as one example of a circumstance that can justify a ratio significantly greater than single digits simon,supra,at.
simon stated,we understand the court statement in state farm that few awards significantly exceeding a ratio will satisfy due process to establish a type of presumption ratios between the punitive damages award and the plaintiff actual or potential compensatory damages significantly greater than or to are suspect and,absent special justification by,for example,extreme reprehensibility or unusually small,or compensatory damages,can not survive appellate scrutiny under the due process clause.fn.omitted.simon,supra,cal th at.simon stated further,in state farm,the high court made clear that due process permits a higher ratio between punitive damages and a small compensatory award for purely economic damages containing no punitive element than between punitive damages and a substantial compensatory award for emotional distress the latter may be based in part on indignation at the defendant act and may be so large as to serve,itself,as a deterrent.state farm,supra,at.id.at.
state farm,supra,at page,stated that a ratio greater than those previously upheld by the high court may be appropriate where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.simon,supra,cal th at page,in contrast,stated in the disjunctive that extreme reprehensibility or unusually small compensatory damages may justify a ratio in excess of nine or ten to one.simon is consistent with the view that state farm,supra,at page,identified only some of the circumstances that may justify a punitive damages award significantly in excess of a ratio and did not set forth an exclusive list.see hamlin hampton lumber mills,or,seltzer morton,fn.in any event,we believe that relative to philip morris financial condition,in compensatory damages is a small amount.we therefore conclude that where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages state farm,supra,at accurately describes the situation here.
the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages here is approximately to one.the compensatory damages award includes for pain and suffering experienced by bullock for approximately two years from the time of her diagnosis with lung cancer until she succumbed to her physical injuries and died in february.unlike the situation where the plaintiff is awarded a generous amount for emotional distress arising from economic harm with no physical injury state farm,supra,at million awarded for months of emotional distress arising from purely economic harm roby mckesson,supra,cal th at million in noneconomic damages awarded for employment discrimination and harassment,neither the circumstances here nor the amount of the emotional distress damages suggests that those damages reflect either bullock outrage and humiliation or the jury indignation at philip morris conduct we therefore have no reason to believe that the compensatory damages contain any significant punitive element.
boeken philip morris,supra,th,involved the same defendant,same theories of recovery and much of the same conduct as this case.as in this case,the plaintiff in boeken began smoking in the,was diagnosed with lung cancer over years later and died after the conclusion of trial.id.at fn.the jury awarded boeken in compensatory damages and billion in punitive damages.id.at.the trial court conditionally granted philip morris new trial motion unless boeken agreed to reduce the punitive damages award to million.boeken consented to the reduction.ibid.on appeal,division four of the second district court of appeal held that the million punitive damages award was excessive.boeken concluded that no more than a multiplier was justified and reduced the award to million,a ratio of nine to one.id.at.
boeken cited the holding in diamond woodworks,argonaut ins,supra,th page,that in an unexceptional fraud case where the conduct was not exceptionally extreme,the constitutional limit was a ratio of four to one.boeken philip morris,supra,th at.boeken also cited the holding in bardis oates th,limiting the ratio to nine to one in a case where the damages suffered by the plaintiff were small compared to the seriousness of the defendant conduct but the plaintiff suffered no physical injury or death.boeken,supra,at.boeken noted that some of the facts in diamond woodworks and bardis were distinguishable from the facts in boeken,but cited both opinions with approval.ibid.the boeken court did not have the benefit of the later opinion in simon,supra,cal th at pages,in which the california supreme court disapproved the rule from diamond woodworks and stated that extreme reprehensibility is a special justification that can overcome the presumption against an award significantly exceeding a ratio.
boeken philip morris,supra,th,ordered a million punitive damages award for the same course of conduct at issue here.that award was significantly greater than the million awarded in this case.to this extent,boeken is consistent with the view that the punitive damages award in this case is reasonable.because the compensatory damages award in boeken was significantly greater than the award in this case,a lesser multiple of compensatory damages in that case was required to further the state interests in punishment and deterrence relating to the same course of conduct at issue here.for this reason,and in light of simon,supra,cal th at pages,the conclusion in boeken that a ratio of nine to one was the constitutional maximum in that case does not suggest that the same is true in this case.
philip morris cites exxon shipping baker.exxon shipping for the proposition that a ratio of one to one would be appropriate here in light of bullock substantial compensatory damages award.exxon shipping involved a massive oil spill from a tanker that ran aground off the alaskan coast.id.at.several civil actions against the shipowner and others were consolidated in a class action.id.at.some of the claims were settled,and the jury awarded compensatory damages and billion in punitive damages against the shipowner.id.at.the trial court found that the total actual harm resulting from the spill was million,including compensatory damages awarded by the jury in the class action,compensatory damages awarded in other actions arising from the spill,settlement payments and other amounts.in re exxon valdez d.the high court presumed that million was the total amount of compensatory damages for purposes of its analysis.exxon shipping,supra,at.
the united states supreme court in exxon shipping reviewed the billion punitive damages award under federal maritime common law and did not decide the maximum amount that would satisfy due process.exxon shipping,supra,at.unlike a constitutional due process inquiry where the high court has expressly declined to impose a ratio or other rigid benchmark state farm,supra,at,the high court in exxon shipping acting as a common law court of last resort imposed a fixed ratio of one to one as the upper limit for punitive damages in federal maritime cases.exxon shipping,supra,at.exxon shipping also stated and our explanation of the constitutional upper limit confirms that the ratio is not too low.in state farm,we said that a maximum is appropriate in all but the most exceptional of cases,and w hen compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.citation.id.at.exxon shipping then stated in dictum that,in light of the substantial compensatory damages of approximately million in that case,the constitutional outer limit may well be.id.at,fn.
exxon shipping,supra,did not signal any departure from the standards articulated in state farm,supra.although exxon shipping suggested that the constitutional limit in that case may well be,we believe that this merely reflected the enormity of the compensatory damages award and the high court view that million in punitive damages might be the most that would be constitutionally justified in light of the facts and circumstances of that case.we note that the defendant in exxon shipping was reckless,there was no finding of intentional misconduct exxon shipping,supra,at fn.and the high court did not characterize the conduct as highly reprehensible,let alone extremely reprehensible.the precise award in any case,of course,must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.state farm,supra,at.
citing awards in other cases in california and nationwide,philip morris argues that there is an emerging consensus that damage awards are more than substantial enough to trigger this upper limit.we can not discern any emerging consensus in this regard relevant to the extremely reprehensible conduct at issue in this case.moreover,we do not regard the amount of compensatory damages as a fixed upper limit where damages are substantial,as we have stated instead,the constitutional limit depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.state farm,supra,at.philip morris also cites opinions holding that some other ratio greater than one to one was the constitutional maximum in each case.we need not attempt to reconcile the to one ratio in this case with other opinions holding,in the particular circumstances of each case,that the punitive damages award was constitutionally excessive.absent a maximum ratio,some variation is to be expected.
civil penalties authorized in comparable cases 
simon stated that the third guidepost,civil penalties for comparable misconduct,is less useful in a case like this one,where plaintiff prevailed only on a cause of action involving common law tort duties that do not lend themselves to a comparison with statutory penalties.citation.simon,supra,cal th at.we are aware of no statutory penalty for misconduct that is comparable in a meaningful way to the misconduct at issue here.boeken philip morris,supra,th at.the third guidepost therefore plays no significant role in our analysis.simon,supra,at.
financial condition 
the defendant financial condition remains an essential consideration under california law and a permissible consideration under the due process clause in determining the amount of punitive damages necessary to further the state legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.state farm,supra,at stating that consideration of the defendant wealth as a factor is not unlawful or inappropriate simon,supra,cal th at.those interests are not served if the amount awarded is so small in relation to the defendant wealth as to constitute only a nuisance or a routine cost of doing business.simon,supra,at.an award violates due process in light of the defendant financial condition only if the award is grossly excessive in relation to these interests,quoting gore,supra,at see also state farm,supra,at t he wealth of the defendant can not justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.the defendant financial condition can not supplant the three guideposts in evaluating the amount of punitive damages under the due process clause,but the defendant financial condition can supplement the guideposts as an additional consideration.simon,supra,cal th at.the farm guideposts can not be abandoned or ignored,but in determining whether a lesser award could have satisfied the state legitimate objectives state farm,supra,at,a reviewing court may nonetheless give some consideration to the defendant financial condition.fn.omitted.id.at.simon stated that in some cases the defendant financial condition considered together with the three guideposts may justify a ratio significantly in excess of a ratio id.at,while in other cases,the state may have to partly yield its goals of punishment and deterrence to the federal requirement that an award stay within the limits of due process id.at.
california interests in punishment and deterrence are very strong in light of the extreme reprehensibility of philip morris misconduct.moreover,philip morris persistent efforts for several decades to mislead the public about the health hazards of smoking despite its understanding that smoking was hazardous show that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant disrespect for the law.gore,supra,at.although there was some evidence of philip morris profits,discussed ante,the best indication of its financial condition and ability to pay is the admission by its counsel that philip morris has billions of dollars in profits and there no debate,no dispute,that philip morris could afford to pay a billion dollars or billion in this case.philip morris considerable wealth and ability to pay many times the amount awarded suggest that the million punitive damages award is not excessive.
f.other considerations 
philip morris contends its obligations under the msa,the recently enhanced federal regulation of the tobacco industry and other circumstances reduce the need for punishment and deterrence.philip morris argues that its substantial and continuing payment obligations under the agreement and the msa prohibition of some of the same types of conduct on which its liability in this case is based serve as deterrents to future misconduct.
bullock and philip morris stipulated that the msa provides for payments to the states for reimbursement of funds spent on health care costs of individuals,among other things and that the msa does not provide any payments to individuals and does not provide any payments for punitive damages.the substantial payments under the msa reflect the substantial damages to the states allegedly caused by the cigarette manufacturers,and are by no means a measure of punishment.in any event,we need not decide whether,or the extent to which,settlement payments for compensatory damages generally may reduce the need for punishment or deterrence and limit the amount of punitive damages that otherwise would be constitutionally permissible because the evidence in this case suggests that the msa has no meaningful deterrent effect on philip morris and others and is not an effective punishment.
bullock forensic economics expert testified at trial that philip morris revenues and profits actually increased markedly revenues increased by billion in alone due to increased cigarette prices as a result of the msa.as boeken philip morris,supra,th at page,explained,philip morris may simply absorb the cost by raising prices without any competitive disadvantage because the other participants are likely to do the same,and if so,there may be no punitive or deterrent effect as a result of the payments required under the msa.commentators have stated that the msa is designed to allow the participating cigarette manufacturers to increase prices so as to pass the costs of the settlement on to consumers.debow,the state tobacco litigation and the separation of powers in state governments repairing the damage seton hall,constitutional and antitrust violations of the multistate tobacco settlement policy analysis.we conclude that philip morris payment obligation,its commitment under the terms of the msa not to engage in certain conduct and the recently enhanced federal regulation of the tobacco industry are neither punishment nor an effective deterrent to others who would engage in similar misconduct and neither reduce the need for punitive damages nor limit the amount that may be awarded.
philip morris also argues that the conduct that harmed bullock was undertaken decades ago by individuals who are no longer associated with the company and that its current employees and shareholders do not deserve to be punished.philip morris argues that it is effectively a different company from the one whose conduct was at issue in this case,and that it now is subject to regulations and other constraints that did not exist in previous years.philip morris argues further that the evidence shows that it is committed to change and that it has neither the inclination nor the capacity to repeat the misconduct that gave rise to this case.
although these arguments might have persuaded the jury to award a more moderate amount than was awarded in the original trial,they do not compel the conclusion that the million award is grossly excessive in relation to california legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.
finally,civil justice association of california as amicus curiae argues that prior awards of punitive and compensatory damages against philip morris for the same course of conduct are relevant to the amount of punitive damages necessary to deter and punish in this case.see boeken philip morris,supra,th at stevens owens corning fiberglas th.philip morris,however,presented no evidence at trial of any prior awards and does not argue this point on appeal.an amicus curiae ordinarily must limit its argument to the issues raised by the parties on appeal,and a reviewing court need not address additional arguments raised by an amicus curiae.costa workers comp.appeals bd.th.we therefore decline to address this issue.
conclusion 
we believe that the extreme reprehensibility of philip morris misconduct,including the vast scale and profitability of its course of misconduct,and its financial condition justify the million punitive damages award against philip morris.our conclusion is the same regardless of whether the ratio of to one can be said to significantly exceed a ratio,so we need not decide that question we do not mean to suggest that to one would be an appropriate ratio in another case involving extreme reprehensibility or to establish any kind of presumption,but merely conclude,based on the facts in this case,that the million punitive damages award is reasonable,not arbitrary,and does not offend due process.
the award of prejudgment interest was proper

disposition

kitching,dissenting.
in state farm mut.automobile ins.campbell state farm,the united states supreme court addressed the circumstances under which an award of punitive damages violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states.a key component of the court analysis was the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages.although the court declined to impose a rule,it stated that in practice,few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process.id.at.later,in exxon shipping company baker,the high court reiterated that the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is a central feature in its due process analysis.
the majority in this case has affirmed an award of million in punitive damages and in compensatory damages.this is a ratio of more than to.as i will explain,however,because the plaintiff was awarded substantial compensatory damages,the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages can not to a significant degree exceed a ratio.the award in this case does that.
under state farm and its progeny,the punitive damages award constitutes excessive punishment in violation of the due process clause.boeken philip morris,th boeken,which i shall discuss post,is directly on point and involved the same defendant and facts strikingly similar to this case.there,the court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover punitive damages no greater than a to ratio.id.at.i would do the same here.i therefore dissent from the portion of the majority opinion that affirms the punitive damages award 
in state farm,the supreme court applied three guideposts set forth in bmw of north america,gore,for determining whether an award of punitive damages violates the constitutional right to due process the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.state farm,supra,at.
as to the first guidepost,i agree with the majority opinion that the conduct of philip morris was highly reprehensible and more egregious than other conduct that would support an award of punitive damages.as to the third guidepost,i agree with the majority opinion that w e are aware of no statutory penalty for misconduct that is comparable in a meaningful way to the misconduct at issue here.the third guidepost,therefore,plays no role in my conclusion that the punitive damages award of million in this case violates due process.
the second state farm guidepost is the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages.as to this guidepost,the state farm court explained that courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.state farm,supra,at.the court noted that statutes dating back centuries have imposed ratios of to,to and to,and that these ratios are instructive.id.at.most importantly,as i stated earlier,the court opined that few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process.ibid.
interpreting this latter statement,the california supreme court held in simon san paolo holding,cal th simon that ratios significantly greater than or to are presumptively invalid.id.at.the court further explained multipliers less than nine or are not,however,presumptively valid under state farm.especially when the compensatory damages are substantial or already contain a punitive element,lesser ratios can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee,citing state farm,supra,at.
both state farm and simon recognized a few limited exceptions to the ratio limit.the only one potentially applicable in this case is where the compensatory damages consist of a small not substantial amount and the defendant conduct is highly or extremely reprehensible particularly egregious see state farm,supra,at simon,supra,cal th at.
in state farm,the court explained this exception as follows b ecause there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass,ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.citations.the converse is also true,however.when compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.the precise award in any case,of course,must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendants conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.state farm,supra,at.
in simon,the california supreme court also addressed this exception.the court initially touched upon the exception in passing by stating r atios between the punitive damages award and the plaintiffs actual or potential compensatory damages significantly greater than or to are suspect,and absent special justification by,for example,extreme reprehensibility or unusually small,or compensatory damages,can not survive appellate scrutiny under the due process clause.simon,supra,cal th at,italics added.by listing examples of the exceptions to the limit in the disjunctive,the court ostensibly opined that both a finding of extreme reprehensibility and an award of a small amount of compensatory damages are separate,independent exceptions.i do not believe the court so held for at least two reasons.
the first is that when simon actually discussed the exception it quoted state farm.the simon court held nor can the to ratio here be justified on the ground that a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.simon,supra,cal th at,quoting state farm,supra,at,italics omitted.this description of the exception is not in the disjunctive.
moreover,the simon court did not apply extreme reprehensibility and small amount of damages as separate exceptions.in simon,the amount of compensatory damages was simon,supra,cal th at,which the court found to be quite small.id.at.the defendants conduct,however,was not highly reprehensible when compared to conduct in other punitive damages cases.id.at p.the court thus held that t he nature and size of the compensatory award 
here militates for a maximum award at the top of,but not significantly beyond,the range.id.at.the court reversed a million punitive damages award and limited plaintiffs punitive damages to,which is a to ratio.ibid.
had the simon court held that a small amount of damages was an independent exception to the ratio limit,the case would have gone the other way.the plaintiff could have recovered punitive damages in an amount more than times the amount of the compensatory award because the compensatory damages were small.the implication of simon,therefore,is that either an award of a small amount of damages or a finding of high reprehensibility is not enough,by itself,to justify an exception to the limit.at a minimum,simon holds that the two components must be viewed together for purposes of the ratio guidepost.
this interpretation of the exception was applied in planned parent coalition,life activists cir planned parenthood.in planned parenthood,the defendants engaged in a campaign of terror and intimidation designed to prevent the plaintiffs from providing abortion services.id.at.although the court found the defendants conduct was on the high side of reprehensibility id.at,it also found that most of the compensatory awards were substantial id.at.the court thus limited the plaintiffs punitive damages to a ratio.ibid.
planned parenthood is consistent with my interpretation of state farm and simon.even when the defendants conduct is highly reprehensible,if the compensatory damages are substantial,an award exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages to a significant degree violates due process,unless another exception applies.
in this case,the jury awarded bullock in compensatory damages.this was a substantial compensatory award.although philip morriss conduct was highly reprehensible,under both state farm and simon,a punitive damages award in the amount of million does not comport with due process because it exceeds a ratio to a significant degree.
the majority opinion states relative to philip morriss financial condition,in compensatory damages is a small amount.i disagree with this analysis.the defendants financial condition is irrelevant to the issue of whether a compensatory award is small or substantial for purposes of the ratio guidepost the majority cites no authority to support its view to the contrary.
i recognize that drawing a line between small and substantial damages for purposes of determining whether an award of punitive damages can exceed the ratio limit is not an easy task.the award in this case,however,clearly falls in the substantial damages category.the state farm court held that a million compensatory award was substantial.state farm,supra,at.the compensatory award here is not materially less.
in gober ralphs grocery th,the court held that compensatory damages ranging from to could not be characterized as nominal,and thus a ratio of more than to could not be justified.id.at.likewise,numerous courts in other jurisdictions have held that awards considerably less than were substantial for purposes of determining whether an exception to the ratio limit applies.see bains llc arco products cir,bridgeport music,justin combs pub.cir,bach first union nat.bank cir,cgb occupational therapy rha health services cir,quigley winter cir,wallace dtg operations,cir.the majority opinion does not cite a single case that indicates or an award anywhere close to that amount is not substantial.
in its discussion of the ratio guidepost,the majority opinion states that w e have no reason to believe that bullock compensatory damages contain any significant punitive element.i agree.that conclusion,however,does not justify exceeding the ratio limit.
in state farm,the court noted that sometimes compensatory damages have a punitive element because they include compensation for emotional distress caused by humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendant conduct.state farm,supra,at.when that occurs punitive damages are somewhat duplicative.ibid.the state farm court held that in such situations a lower ratio can be justified.ibid.it did not hold,however,that the absence of a punitive element in the compensatory award permits an exception to the ratio limit.
it is important to keep in mind that where,as here,the compensatory award is substantial,a ratio of to can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.state farm,supra,at.the significance of the absence of a punitive element in the compensatory award is that the ratio can be higher within a constitutionally permissible range.other factors,such as the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct and the defendant wealth can also increase the ratio up to,but not exceeding to a significant degree,a ratio,unless one of the limited exceptions described in state farm applies.in this case,because there is no punitive element in the compensatory award and in light of philip morris highly reprehensible conduct and great wealth,punitive damages in the top end of that range are justified.
the present case is identical in all material respects to boeken.as the majority opinion in this case concedes,the boeken case involved the same defendant,the same causes of action,the same counsel,and virtually the same conduct.the jury in boeken awarded the plaintiff in compensatory damages and billion in punitive damages,which was reduced by the trial court to million.the court of appeal,however,held that the plaintiff was entitled to no more than a ratio of punitive damages in comparison to compensatory damages.boeken,supra,th at.the court thus reduced plaintiff punitive damages to million,which is about a to ratio.ibid.i see no reason why we should not do the same here.
the majority opinion attempts to distinguish boeken by noting that the boeken court cited diamond woodworks,argonaut ins.th diamond woodworks,which was disapproved of in simon,supra,cal th at.in simon,the california supreme court stated we do not agree with the court in diamond works,that in the usual case the high court decisions establish an outer constitutional limit of approximately four times the compensatory damages.simon,at.boeken reference to diamond works is inconsequential because the boeken court did not rely on or apply the part of diamond works disapproved of by simon,namely a to ratio limit in the usual case.
the majority opinion also states that boeken is distinguishable because the boeken court did not have the benefit of simon,which was subsequently 
finally,the majority opinion argues because the compensatory damages award in boeken was significantly greater than the award in this case,a lesser multiple of compensatory damages in that case was required to further the state interests in punishment and deterrence relating to the same course of conduct at issue here.i disagree.
for purposes of the ratio guidepost,the compensatory award in this case is not materially different from the one in boeken because both awards are substantial.the purpose of the ratio guidepost is to ensure that punitive damages are reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.state farm,supra,at.thus the only significance of the greater compensatory award in boeken is that the outer constitutional limit of the gross amount of punitive damages there million is higher than it is here.this does not mean that the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages can be higher.accordingly,a million punitive damages award in boeken is constitutionally permissible,while a million award here is not,even though philip morriss conduct was virtually the same in both cases,because punitive damages must be reasonably proportionate to compensatory damages.
under state farm,simon,and boeken,bullock was entitled to no more than a ratio of punitive to compensatory damages.however,because of philip morris highly reprehensible conduct and its great wealth,as well as the lack of a punitive element in the compensatory award,i conclude,like the boeken court,that bullock was entitled to an award of punitive damages at the highest end of the ratio range.boeken,supra,th at.
the million punitive damages award exceeded,to a significant degree,a ratio in comparison to the compensatory damages,and is in violation of due process.i therefore respectfully dissent.
