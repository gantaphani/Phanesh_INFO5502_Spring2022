the appellants ken roberts company krc,ken roberts institute,kri,united states chart company chart,and ted warren corporation warren collectively ken roberts sell instructional materials that purport to teach investors how to make money investing in the commodities and securities markets.in an effort to determine whether ken roberts had engaged in deceptive advertising or selling of goods or services in violation of sections and of the federal trade commission act,the federal trade commission ftc issued civil investigative demands cids requiring ken roberts to produce documents and to respond to interrogatories relating to the companies business practices.the appellants answered some of the interrogatories,but declined to respond to most of what had been requested.ken roberts then filed a petition to quash with the ftc.the appellants claimed that,because the regulation of their advertising practices was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commodities futures trading commission cftc or the securities and exchange commission sec,the ftc lacked authority to investigate.the ftc denied the petition and then filed its own petition in district court seeking an order to enforce the cids.on may,the district court granted the ftc petition and ordered ken roberts to comply with the cids.the appellants now seek review of that judgment.
ken roberts contends that,pursuant to the express terms of the commodity exchange act cea,the cftc has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the disputed business practices of ken roberts company and united states chart company.ken roberts claims further that,because ken roberts institute and ted warren corporation are subject to pervasive regulation by the sec under the investment advisors act iaa,the ftc authority to investigate these companies has been impliedly preempted.therefore,according to ken roberts,because the ftc is without authority to regulate the cited advertising and promotional practices of ken roberts,the cids can not be sustained.we disagree.
with rare exceptions none of which applies here,a subpoena enforcement action is not the proper forum in which to litigate disagreements over an agency authority to pursue an investigation.unless it is patently clear that an agency lacks the jurisdiction that it seeks to assert,an investigative subpoena will be enforced.whatever the ultimate merit of ken roberts preemption arguments and we believe they have little appellants can not overcome the doctrine that precludes courts from entertaining challenges to the jurisdiction of administrative agencies during subpoena enforcement proceedings.because under no reasonable reading of the cea or the iaa does either of those statutes manifestly strip the ftc of its broad power over deceptive advertising,we affirm the district court decision that appellants must comply with the ftc compulsory process.
background 
krc and chart market courses in commodities trading and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the cftc.kri and warren offer instruction in securities trading,which places them within the regulatory ambit of the sec.these companies rely heavily on internet advertising their websites feature grandiose claims about potential earnings by investors and testimonials from persons who have allegedly benefitted from ken roberts instructional materials.
since,the cftc has carefully monitored the activities of krc to determine whether the company had violated various sections of the cea,particularly the statute antifraud provisions.in at least four separate investigations,the commission sought to determine whether krc advertising claims,both in print and,more recently,can be substantiated.to this end,the cftc repeatedly used its subpoena power to compel krc to turn over business records and detailed documentation supporting the promotional claims that it has made.the company always has responded to cftc subpoenas,and never has been sanctioned or forced to admit any wrongdoing.while one investigation did lead to a consent decree,pursuant to which krc and chart registered with the cftc as commodity trading advisers ctas,see,the commission has never taken enforcement action against krc.
in,the ftc,in conjunction with the cftc and the sec,announced a coordinated investigation of deceptive day trading promotions.in early september,the ftc formally authorized the use of compulsory process to determine whether various merchants were engaged in deceptive marketing practices.with an investigative agenda aimed at investment activity and suspicious internet advertising,the commission soon focused on ken roberts.on september,the ftc issued cids requesting a wide variety of information through written interrogatories and documents relating to ken roberts business practices.the cids were designed to reveal whether the companies had mislead the public in promoting their instructional courses.to this end,the commission demanded a full accounting of the companies sales volume,as well as evidence underlying the claims made in their testimonials and other advertising materials.
appellants resisted complying fully with the cids,believing them to be duplicative of the subpoenas that had already been issued by the cftc and beyond the ftc power to issue.thus,ken roberts responded only to some of the interrogatories and produced none of the requested documents.they then filed an administrative petition with the ftc to quash the cids.in that proceeding,ken roberts argued,as they do here,that the cea and the iaa deprive the commission of its jurisdiction to regulate and therefore to investigate deceptive advertising practices of,respectively,ctas and investment advisers.the ftc rejected this petition,holding that the subpoenas were issued as part of a lawful investigation,one fully authorized by the federal trade commission act ftc act,et,and not foreclosed by any rival regulatory statute.see in re petition of the ken roberts et to quash civil investigative demands,file,reprinted in joint appendix.when ken roberts persisted in refusing to comply with the cids,the ftc petitioned the district court to compel enforcement pursuant to e.in a brief order,the district court granted the agency petition to enforce.see ftc ken roberts,order,misc.may,reprinted in.ken roberts now appeals.
ii.discussion 
appellants ask this court to hold that the provisions of the cea and the iaa preempt the former expressly,the latter implicitly the jurisdiction that the ftc would otherwise possess over appellants allegedly deceptive marketing of their courses.though the nature of our analysis obliges us to investigate these questions,we need not answer them definitively,for we have concluded that ken roberts challenge is premature.
jurisdictional challenges to agency subpoenas 
the threshold issue in this case is whether the appellants may raise their challenge to the commission jurisdiction now,or instead whether they are obliged to await an actual enforcement action.in upholding the judgment of the district court,we are governed by the doctrine that administrative agencies must be given wide latitude in asserting their power to investigate by subpoena.as the second circuit has noted 
a t the subpoena enforcement stage,courts need not determine whether the subpoenaed party is within the agency jurisdiction or covered by the statute it administers rather the coverage determination should wait until an enforcement action is brought against the subpoenaed party.

the supreme court first articulated this doctrine in endicott johnson perkins.endicott established that,as a general proposition,agencies should remain free to determine,in the first instance,the scope of their own jurisdiction when issuing investigative subpoenas.the court therefore held that the secretary of labor was entitled to enforce a subpoena for payroll records issued in an effort to determine whether endicott johnson had run afoul of the public contracts act.the district court had scheduled a trial to determine whether endicott was covered by the act,but the supreme court rejected this approach.rather,the court held that,because t he evidence sought by the subpoena was not plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the secretary in the discharge of her duties under the act it was the duty of the district court to order its production for the secretary consideration.id.at.at emphasis added.
following endicott,courts of appeals have consistently deferred to agency determinations of their own investigative authority,and have generally refused to entertain challenges to agency authority in proceedings to enforce compulsory process.see,united states sturm,ruger,cir we have repeatedly admonished that questions concerning the scope of an agency substantive authority to regulate are not to be resolved in subpoena enforcement proceedings.construction prods.research,at enforcing subpoena issued by nuclear regulatory commission over objection that the subject matter of the agency investigation was reserved by law for the department of labor eeoc peat,marwick,mitchell,cir the initial determination of the coverage question is left to the administrative agency seeking enforcement of the subpoena.donovan shaw,cir it is that a subpoena enforcement proceeding is not the proper forum in which to litigate the question of coverage under a particular federal statute.ftc ernstthal,acknowledging a concession that an individual may not normally resist an administrative subpoena on the ground that the agency lacks regulatory jurisdiction if the subpoena is issued at the investigational stage of the proceeding.
subpoena enforcement power is not limitless,however.in united states morton salt,the court emphasized that a subpoena is proper only where the inquiry is within the authority of the agency,the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant.accordingly,there is no doubt that a court asked to enforce a subpoena will refuse to do so if the subpoena exceeds an express statutory limitation on the agency investigative powers.fin.ftc,cir.thus,a court must assure itself that the subject matter of the investigation is within the statutory jurisdiction of the agency.fec machinists political league,see also ftc texaco,en banc administrative subpoenas should be enforced unless the information sought is irrelevant to a lawful purpose of the agency.these cases amply demonstrate that while the courts role in subpoena enforcement may be a strictly limited one,it is neither minor nor ministerial.see ftc anderson.
in adhering to the foregoing principles,we have held that enforcement of an agency investigatory subpoena will be denied only when there is a patent lack of jurisdiction in an agency to regulate or to investigate.see cab deutsche lufthansa aktiengesellschaft,see also gov t of territory of guam,ernstthal,at declining to relax the barrier against ruling on the agency regulatory jurisdiction in subpoena enforcement proceeding where the absence of jurisdiction is not patent,and there are no allegations of agency bad faith.as the following discussion will demonstrate,there is no patent lack of jurisdiction in this case.
preemption of the ftc power to regulate deceptive advertising 
on its own terms,the ftc act gives the ftc ample authority to investigate and,if deceptive practices are uncovered,to regulate appellants advertising practices.see a allowing the commission to prevent unfair competition and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce allowing the commission to regulate and enjoin false advertising c allowing the commission to issue cids to investigate possible violations.therefore,the ftc is entitled to have its subpoenas enforced unless some other source of law patently undermines these broad powers.appellants contend that two federal statutes have this effect.krc and chart,who sell courses in commodities investing,argue that the amendments to the commodity exchange act expressly preempted the ftc jurisdiction over their activities as registered ctas.kri and warren,who sell courses in securities investing,argue that the investment advisers act impliedly preempts the commission regulatory power over their advertisements.we consider these contentions in turn,and conclude that neither has merit.
appellants claim of express preemption pursuant to the commodity exchange act 
though congress has long sought to regulate the futures market,the commodity futures trading commission is not very old.the first federal statute dealing with commodities trading,the future trading act,was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court,see hill wallace,and quickly replaced by the grain futures act,which the court upheld,see bd.of trade of city of chicago olsen.in,this latter enactment was amended and renamed the commodity exchange act.that initial version of the cea delegated certain regulatory responsibilities to a commission composed of the attorney general,along with the secretaries of agriculture and commerce.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith curran,d,at,reprinted in.
it was not until,however,that the cftc as it exists today was born.after considerable deliberation,congress enacted the commodity future trading commission act cftca,an extensive overhaul of the cea that both expanded the statute coverage and dramatically altered its enforcement scheme.curran,at.at.most importantly,the cftca for the first time brought all commodities under federal regulation the earlier statutes had covered only enumerated agricultural goods that in no way represented the vast array of products that were actually being traded on futures markets.see,at.the commission spawned by the statute was an independent regulatory agency invested with broad powers to regulate futures trading and commodities exchanges.see,at,at cftc schor,d describing the sweeping authority entrusted to the cftc.congress authorized the cftc to bring an action for injunctive relief in federal district court against anyone violating the cea or the regulations promulgated thereunder.see commodity future trading commission act of,stat.codified as amended at.
moreover,and most important to the present case,the new agency was invested with exclusive jurisdiction over certain aspects of the futures trading market.see,stat.codified as amended at a a.the aim of this provision,according to one of its chief sponsors,was to avoid unnecessary,overlapping and duplicative regulation,especially as between the securities and exchange commission and the new cftc.cong.rec,remarks of house agriculture committee chairman poage philip johnson,the commodity futures trading commission act preemption as public policy,vand.revv.
in determining what congress intended when it passed a a,we must focus on the precise text of the enacted legislation.see carter united states,d in analyzing a statute,we begin by examining the text,not by psychoanalyzing those who enacted it.internal citations omitted.section a a reads as follows 
the commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to accounts,agreements including any transaction which is of the character of,or is commonly known to the trade as,an option,privilege,indemnity,bid,offer,put,call,advance guaranty,or decline guaranty,and transactions involving contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery,traded or executed on a contract market designated or derivatives transaction execution facility registered pursuant to section or of this title or any other board of trade,exchange,or market,and transactions subject to regulation by the commission pursuant to section of this title.except as hereinabove provided,nothing contained in this section shall i supersede or limit the jurisdiction at any time conferred on the securities and exchange commission or other regulatory authorities under the laws of the united states or of any state,or ii restrict the securities and exchange commission and such other authorities from carrying out their duties and responsibilities in accordance with such laws.nothing in this section shall supersede or limit the jurisdiction conferred on courts of the united states or any state.
