the question of the preemption of state law by federal tobacco legislation has been addressed numerous times.today,we address the preemption issue in the context of the doctrine of fraudulent joinder,which is invoked to achieve diversity jurisdiction.we hold that the district court erroneously allowed the to achieve diversity jurisdiction by its incorrect finding that the state law claims were preempted and constituted fraudulent joinder.because the district court should have remanded the action to state court,we vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to remand the action to state court.we have jurisdiction over the final judgment of the district court pursuant to.
background 
benjamin francis,an alaska resident and citizen,died at age from lung cancer.as francis survivor and on behalf of his estate,dolores hunter brought a wrongful death lawsuit in alaska state court against philip morris usa,a virginia corporation that produces,markets,and distributes cigarettes altria group,the parent company of philip morris usa and the alaska commercial company acc,an alaska corporation that sells merchandise,including cigarettes manufactured by philip morris,in stores throughout alaska all three appellees are collectively referred to as appellees.

philip morris and altria together,the altria defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the district of alaska.they argued that hunter state law claims against acc were preempted by congressional policy not to remove tobacco from the market and that acc therefore was fraudulently joined,resulting in complete diversity of citizenship.the altria defendants then filed a motion to dismiss hunter complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.hunter filed a motion to remand,asserting that her complaint adequately pleaded a strict products liability claim against acc under alaska state law.she argued that acc was not fraudulently joined and,consequently,that total diversity between plaintiff and all defendants did not exist.
the district court denied hunter motion to remand.the court agreed with the altria defendants that hunter state product liability claim against acc was preempted because it would result in an effective ban on cigarettes,in contravention of congressional policy.hunter therefore had stated no possible claim against acc.the court accordingly found that acc was fraudulently joined,resulting in diversity of citizenship.the court denied hunter motion for reconsideration.the district court then granted the b motion to dismiss,reasoning that hunter had failed to identify the specific products francis used and the alleged defects in the products,and that any product liability claims were preempted by the congressional intent not to ban the sale of cigarettes.the district court entered final judgment in favor of appellees.hunter timely appealed.
