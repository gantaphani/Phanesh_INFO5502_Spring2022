plaintiff appellant design resources,dri,appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants appellees leather industries of america lia and ashley furniture industries,ashley,on dri false advertising claim under the lanham act,a.dri alleged that an advertisement placed in a trade magazine by ashley the ashley ad,as well as two statements by nicholas cory,director of lia research laboratory,which ran in articles in the same publication,were false and misleading.the district court granted summary judgment to lia and ashley,concluding that dri had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a lanham act claim.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
appellee ashley is the fifth largest furniture manufacturer in the united states.in addition to manufacturing furniture,ashley operates and licenses retail locations that bear its name,and it sells its furniture to other retailers,such as costco and walmart.appellee lia is a leather industry trade association,which owns the leather research laboratory the laboratory nicholas cory is a leather chemist and the director of the laboratory.he and his lab provide labeling advice to companies who market leather and products,as well as testing services to determine such products leather content for purposes of federally mandated disclosure to consumers.
appellant dri develops furniture coverings and sells its products to furniture manufacturers.in late,dri developed a synthetic furniture covering product,which it initially called veneto and later renamed as nextleather.appellant br.at.nextleather is composed of polyurethane,and leather.id.i t has a polyurethane face on a fabric core and is backed with a thin layer of leather fibers adhered,bonded to its base or underside.id.the use of leather fibers as backing,as opposed to leather splits,represented an improvement in the ability of a product to mimic real leather because it made the material more pliable and allowed it to drape more fluidly over a furniture frame.appellant br.at.
in december and january,dri requested labeling advice and composition testing of its nextleather product from cory at lia laboratory.cory advised that the product could absolutely not be characterized or marketed as leather.he cited the federal trade commission guides for select leather and imitation leather products ftc guides,which specify that products containing ground or shredded leather,rather than comprising wholly the hide of an animal,should not be represented,directly or by implication,as being leather.quoting f.instead,cory suggested,dri could label nextleather as n ot leather,r econstituted leather,or b onded leather.
in early,dri began marketing nextleather as bonded leather,disclosing the product composition on a label in compliance with the ftc guides.dri viewed its product as innovative and believed that nextleather was the first and only such product marketed as bonded leather.in preparation for the spring high point market in north carolina an important,annual furniture industry event dri sold samples of nextleather to leading furniture manufacturers.those manufacturers would then debut furniture products made with nextleather at the spring high point market,from march to april.
in the weeks leading up to and following the spring high point market,ashley placed a series of ads in furniture today,a widely read trade magazine.according to dri,one of the ads which ran in the march,march,and april,issues contained false statements about dri and nextleather.in relevant part,the text of the ad read as follows is it really leather some upholstery suppliers are using leather scraps that are as leather know what you are buying.remember the overseas manufacturer has no liability in the.you do,third ellipsis in original.
on july,furniture today published an article written by joan gunin and entitled,chemist fears confusion over imitators may hurt category.this article the gunin article quoted cory as saying the following to call leather alternatives such as bonded leather leather is outright deception,outright fraud it not leather it a synthetic that has leather fibers glued to the underside.second ellipsis in original.
a week later,on july,furniture today published an article written by susan andrews and entitled,for consumers sake,let not call it bonded leather.this article the andrews article referred to n ew composite fabrics now called bonded leather,which have a surface layer of vinyl or polyurethane,a center layer of fabric,and a backing that contains some leather fibers glued onto the fabric for a look that is similar to the back of a leather hide.the article author advocated against using the term bonded leather to refer to these products by arguing that the term is bound to confuse consumers,who are likely to hear only the word leather.the article then quoted cory as saying that calling these products bonded leather is deceptive because it does not represent its true nature.it a vinyl,or a polyurethane laminate or a composite,but it not leather.if you tar and feather someone,does that make them a chicken.
in february,dri filed suit against ashley,todd wanek ashley president and ceo,lia,and cory.it asserted false advertising claims under the lanham act,a,as well as various violations of north carolina and washington law in september,the district court granted wanek and cory motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.while these two individuals are listed as appellees in this case,dri does not seek review of the district court september order.see appellant br.at.
dri made the following arguments before the district court.regarding the ashley ad statement that s ome upholstery suppliers are using leather scraps that are as leather dri asserted that a ll informed readers of the ashley ad knew that the ad was referring to dri and its nextleather bonded leather because dri was the only company selling the kind of product described.it argued that the ad was false because dri was not marketing its product as leather,but rather as bonded leather.
with respect to the gunin article,dri characterized the statement by the lia laboratory director,calling bonded leather leather is explicitly accus ing dri of selling a counterfeit product.dri maintained that there could be no doubt that cory defamatory statements were referring to dri and nextleather,and that the statement was false because dri was selling nextleather as bonded leather,rather than as leather.
dri also contended that cory statement in the andrews article that the term bonded leather is deceptive as applied to some products was false because the ftc guides allowed,and cory had advised,dri to label the product as bonded leather.
finally,dri argued that the defendants statements damaged dri actual and potential customer relationships.it pointed to a decline in sales of nextleather to furniture manufacturers following publication of the ad and articles,and it asserted that it was forced to spend substantial sums to address the resulting damage.
dri moved for partial summary judgment,and ashley and lia for summary judgment.the district court granted ashley and lia motions for summary judgment in august.relevant here,the district court determined that dri failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that the ashley ad,the gunin article,or the andrews article were false or misleading 
regarding the ashley ad,the district court held that dri failed to establish that the ad was false on either of the grounds dri presented.as an initial matter,dri failed to show that the contested statement that s ome upholstery suppliers are using leather scraps that are as leather conveyed the message that dri was selling nextleather as leather.see.the court reasoned that a reader of ashley ad would have had to make at least two sizeable inferences in order to glean this message from the ad.because the ad does not use the term bonded leather,the reader would first have to ascertain that the ad references bonded leather,as opposed to any other similarly produced products.second,the reader would have to infer that the ad was referring solely to dri nextleather.dri also failed to establish its alternative theory of liability with respect to the ad that the ad was false because it misled consumers because it did not show that a single consumer was misled by the ad.
turning to the gunin and andrews articles,the court held that neither article contained a false statement of fact.as to cory statement in the gunin referring to bonded leather as leather would be outright fraud the court pointed out that this statement was true because bonded leather contains only scraps or shavings of leather,rather than whole hide.additionally,dri offered no evidence linking the quote in the gunin article with a single customer refusal to purchase nextleather or general customer confusion about cory statements.as for the andrews article,the court held that cory in stating that using the term bonded leather is deceptive was giving his opinion on how a customer would perceive the term bonded leather because he did not claim to know the law,did not reference the law,and did not maintain that using such term would result in legal liability.dri timely appealed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.pbm products,llc mead johnson,cir.summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.i t is ultimately the nonmovant burden to persuade us that there is indeed a dispute of material fact.it must provide more than a scintilla of not merely conclusory allegations or which a jury could properly find in its favor.coretel,llc verizon va,llc,cir citation omitted.
on appeal,dri argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to ashley and lia because dri evidence with respect to the ashley ad,the gunin article,and the andrews article was sufficient to establish false advertising claims under the lanham act,a in the discussion that follows,we begin with a brief overview of the governing legal framework,and then consider each of the purportedly false statements in turn.
a plaintiff asserting a false advertising claim under the lanham act must establish that 
the defendant made a false or misleading description of fact or representation of fact in a commercial advertisement about his own or another product the misrepresentation is material,in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision the misrepresentation actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience the defendant placed the false or misleading statement in interstate commerce and the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the misrepresentation,either by direct diversion of sales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products.
pbm products,at emphasis added quoting scotts united indus,cir.because the plaintiff must establish all five elements of the claim,failure to establish any one element is fatal to the claim.the parties here focus their arguments on the first element whether the defendants made false or misleading assertions of fact.because we find that dri failed to substantiate this element with respect to any of the contested statements,we limit our analysis accordingly.
for false advertising liability to arise,the contested statement must be false,and it must be a representation of fact.regarding falsity,the statement must be either false on its face or,although literally true,likely to mislead and to confuse consumers given the merchandising context.id.quoting fleet smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,cir.thus,the plaintiff can show falsity in either of these two ways.first,a statement that is false on its face or literally false may be either explicit or conveyed by necessary implication when,considering the advertisement in its entirety,the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.id.quoting scotts,at.in analyzing whether an advertisement is literally false,courts must determine,first,the unambiguous claims made by the advertisement,and second,whether those claims are false.scotts,at quoting novartis consumer health,johnson johnson merck consumer pharm,f d,cir.
second,the plaintiff can show that,although a statement may be true on its face and not false by necessary implication it is otherwise false by implication because it would likely mislead consumers of the product the statement concerns.the plaintiff must support a theory of implied falsehood with evidence that the advertisement tend s to mislead or confuse such consumers.id.at quoting johnson johnson merck consumer pharm.smithkline beecham,cir internal quotation mark omitted.such evidence of consumer confusion must account for the allegations in the case or,show that the statement misled consumers in the way the plaintiff claims it did otherwise,it fail s to provide the required evidence of implied falsity.pbm products,at.
in addition to being false,the statement must be a representation of fact,or,a specific and measurable claim,capable of being proved false or of being reasonably interpreted as a statement of objective fact.pizza hut,papa john int l,cir quoting coastal abstract,first am.title ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.by contrast,statements of general opinion are not actionable under.id.to be a representation of fact,the statement must admit of being adjudged true or false in a way that admits of empirical verification.id.quoting presidio enters.warner.distrib,cir internal quotation mark omitted.with this framework in mind,we discuss each purportedly false advertisement in turn.
we agree with the district court that dri failed to substantiate a claim that the ashley ad is either literally false or impliedly false.beginning with literal falsity,dri argues on appeal that the ad statement that s ome upholstery suppliers are using leather scraps that are misrepresented as leather,was literally false by necessary implication.it argues that s ome upholstery suppliers refers to suppliers of bonded leather generally and to supplying nextleather specifically,and that the ad audience would have recognized these references as readily as if they had been explicitly stated.pbm products,at quoting scotts,at.in particular,dri argues that the ad reference to nextleather is unmistakable when viewed in the broader context in which consumers would have understood it.dri then contends that,having necessarily implied a reference to bonded leather and dri nextleather,the ad communicates the false messages that bonded leather was being marketed as leather and that dri was marketing nextleather as leather.
we find dri literal falsity argument confounding.at bottom,dri asserts that,even though the ad refers only to products marketed as leather,it unmistakably refers to products not marketed as leather,but as bonded leather or nextleather.in order to arrive at this conclusion,one has to follow dri winding inquiry far outside the face of the ad,which the concept of literal falsity by necessary implication does not allow us to do.and,one has to be willing to accept that the ad means the opposite of what it says,an interpretation we find insupportable.
in evaluating claims asserting literal falsity by necessary implication,courts have emphasized the limits of this theory of liability,holding that not all messages implied by an advertisement will support a finding of literal falsity.clorox.proctor gamble commercial,cir.the greater the degree to which a message relies upon the viewer or consumer to integrate its components and draw the apparent conclusion,the less likely it is that a finding of literal falsity will be supported.id.quoting united indus.clorox,cir.and c ommercial claims that are implicit,attenuated,or merely suggestive usually can not fairly be characterized as literally false.id.in other words,a false advertising claim can not rely on the consumer to draw inferences that an ad only hints at or merely suggests.
a false advertising claim can,however,depend on the consumer to draw conclusions that are logically necessary from an ad statements.in castrol pennzoil,a pennzoil
