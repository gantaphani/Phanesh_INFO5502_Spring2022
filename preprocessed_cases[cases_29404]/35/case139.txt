plaintiff james demetriades,who operates restaurants in mammoth lakes,filed a complaint seeking an injunction under the unfair competition law bus,et.ucl and false advertising law bus,et.fal to prevent defendant yelp,yelp,the operator of a popular online website that contains customer reviews of businesses,from making claims about the accuracy and efficacy of its filter of unreliable or biased customer reviews.the trial court granted yelp special motion to strike plaintiff complaint under code of civil procedure section finding that yelp statements about the filtering of reviews on a social media website were matters of public interest.the trial court further found that the public interest exemption of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b did not apply because plaintiff asserted a personal financial stake in the case,and that the commercial speech exemption to the statute set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision c did not apply because yelp statements about the filter were not statements of fact,but were puffery and opinion.
we conclude that the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c applies to yelp statements concerning the accuracy and efficacy of its review filter,and therefore find the trial court erred in granting yelp special motion to strike under section.we reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
background facts 
yelp operates a website that serves as a free social media website and search engine.yelp is available to the public at no charge and has no registration requirement.users who register may post reviews about local businesses,and can rate a business using a star rating of one to five stars,with five stars being the highest rating.yelp website draws tens of millions of people each month who search for and review the public ratings of businesses.as of september,users had posted approximately million reviews to yelp website,and according to google analytics,yelp had million monthly unique visitors during the third quarter of.yelp sells advertising on its site to generate revenue,and in the first three quarters of yelp generated million in revenue from advertising.
yelp constantly battles the problem of unreliable reviews,which generally are reviews written by friends,employees or relatives of the business being reviewed,paid reviews,and negative reviews written by business competitors.as a result,yelp developed filtering software with the aim of identifying reviews likely to be unreliable.yelp started using the filter in,and has worked on improving it since then.the yelp filter applies uniform rules to all reviews and does not favor advertisers over nonadvertisers yelp does not use filtered reviews in calculating a business rating on yelp the filtered reviews do not appear on the main page,but are viewable on a special filtered review page and business owners can freely post responses to reviews they receive on yelp and can contact reviewers privately to engage in further dialogue.to promote the filter integrity,yelp businesses can not delete,change,or reorder ratings or reviews.yelp admits that its filter is not foolproof,and yelp expressly tells users that the filter sometimes affects perfectly legitimate reviews and misses some fake ones,too.after all,legitimate reviews sometimes look questionable,and questionable reviews sometimes look legitimate.plaintiff,when purchasing advertising on yelp,acknowledged in the advertising contract that yelp filtering software sometimes made mistakes.according to yelp,in addition to relying on the filter,a site user can judge how much weight to give to any particular review by viewing the reviewer profile,reading the reviewer reviews,and assessing statistics regarding such reviews.
yelp filter is proprietary software developed by yelp that is not distributed or sold to third parties because disclosure would expose yelp to the risk of persons using the information to overcome yelp efforts to filter unreliable reviews.yelp does not provide the source code or the algorithms to business owners or the general public.
in,yelp created a cartoon video to educate and contribute to the ongoing public dialog about the integrity of online reviews.
plaintiff complaint yelp demurrer 
on may,plaintiff filed this action,alleging causes of action for unfair competition and false advertising under the ucl and fal plaintiff,through a business entity owns the mammoth lakes restaurants jimmy taverna,rafters,and red lantern.plaintiff instructed jack carter,the restaurant manager of rafters,to obtain advertising on yelp for rafters.commencing in june through january,plaintiff purchased advertising for his restaurants on yelp website.
plaintiff alleged that yelp engaged in false advertising by claiming that each user review passed through a filter that gave consumers the most trusted reviews.according to plaintiff,yelp advertised that 
yelp uses a filter to give consumers the most trusted reviews 
all reviews that live on people profile pages go through a remarkable filtering process that takes the reviews that are the most trustworthy and from the most established sources and displays them on the business page.this keeps the less trustworthy reviews out so that when it comes time to make a decision you can make that decision using information and insights that are actually helpful 
rest assured that our engineers are working to make sure that whatever is up there is the most unbiased and accurate information you will be able to find about local businesses and 
yelp is always working to do as good a job as possible on a very complicated task only showing the most trustworthy and useful content out there and 
yelp has an automated filter that suppresses a small portion of reviews it targets those suspicious ones you see on other sites.boldface omitted.
plaintiff asserted these statements were misleading and untrue.plaintiff asserted that yelp did not use the filter to give consumers the most trusted reviews and the filter did not accurately separate the most trustworthy reviews from unreliable reviews,nor did the filter only post reviews from trusted sources.instead,yelp automated filter suppressed more than only a small portion of reviews allowed posts of the most entertaining reviews to be shown on the unfiltered portion of the website,regardless of the source allowed posts of reviews to be shown on the unfiltered portion of a local business page regardless of whether the source was trustworthy or unbiased and suppressed a substantial portion of reviews that were unbiased and trustworthy.further,plaintiff asserted that yelp website contained reviews from persons who were specifically and demonstrably biased against the businesses which they review.based on plaintiff background in software,plaintiff did not believe yelp filter was capable of distinguishing between trustworthy and untrustworthy reviews.
in particular,plaintiff asserted that while rafters received reviews on yelp,of those reviews were filtered.in addition,a reviewer named travis made false statements about plaintiff restaurants,yet yelp filter did not catch those review.plaintiff reported travis reviews to yelp,but yelp did not take any action.in april,plaintiff complained to yelp about reviews of the rafters and the red lantern,demanded changes in the display,threatened litigation aimed at public disclosure of yelp software,and sought the identity of the reviewer named travis who had posted negative reviews on the other hand,according to yelp,the yelp filter caught several positive reviews of the plaintiff restaurants that yelp alleges were placed by an ip address associated with the restaurants.
plaintiff suffered injury from the acts of yelp,including spending money to purchase advertising from yelp based on yelp representations that user reviews were filtered.plaintiff sought an injunction to stop yelp from continuing to engage in untrue and misleading representations.
yelp demurred to the complaint,arguing that the proper plaintiff was memp,the entity that directly owned the restaurants.yelp also filed a motion to strike under section.on september,plaintiff,without changing his status as an individual plaintiff,filed a first amended complaint fac alleging that,among other things,plaintiff did not seek monetary damages of any kind under the ucl or fal.plaintiff sought an order enjoining yelp from making any statements concerning its filter which were untrue or misleading,filtering user reviews on the yelp website while falsely advertising that the unfiltered reviews posted were fair,trustworthy,or unbiased.
yelp motion to strike 
yelp filed a second motion to strike,arguing that plaintiff complaint targeted protected activity under section,subdivisions e and e and by his complaint,plaintiff sought to interfere with both yelp review publishing process and yelp ability to offer opinions about that process,which conduct interfered with yelp free speech rights and targeted speech that appeared in a public forum and was a matter of public interest.
further,yelp argued that plaintiff would not prevail on the merits because plaintiff had suffered no injury and thus lacked standing under both the ucl and fal even if plaintiff had suffered injury in the form of purchasing advertising,the facts showed that plaintiff did not individually purchase the advertising for rafter.further,the communications decency act cda,title united states code section precluded liability because the cda provided that n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider and n o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with the cda.finally,yelp contended its statements constituted nonactionable opinions because a reasonable person would not interpret yelp statements about its filter as a guarantee of its performance rather,the statements were general opinions about yelp evolving filtering goals.
plaintiff opposition to yelp motion to strike 
plaintiff opposition detailed that plaintiff was the manager of an entity that owned three mammoth lakes restaurants jimmy taverna,rafters,and red lantern.plaintiff instructed jack carter,the restaurant manager of rafters,to obtain advertising on yelp for rafters.in purchasing advertising,plaintiff relied on yelp statements concerning its filter in purchasing advertising,but soon realized that yelp representations concerning its filter were not accurate because of the reviews rafters received,had been filtered.further,rafters received unfiltered negative reviews from a reviewer who made false statements about the restaurant,yet yelp filter did not catch these false reviews.
addressing the merits of yelp motion to strike,plaintiff argued that the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c,applied to yelp statements plaintiff argued that his action arose out of the five direct statements of fact from yelp website concerning its review filer,which statements were made for the purpose of promoting the advertising services offered by yelp.in addition,plaintiff asserted that the fac was brought solely in the public interest to enjoin yelp false statements about its review filter and was exempt from attack by virtue of section,subdivision b 
in reply,yelp argued that neither of the exemptions of section,subdivisions b or c applied further,plaintiff could not show a probability of prevailing on the merits under section because he lacked standing yelp statements were not deceptive as a matter of law and the cda barred plaintiff claims.
trial court ruling 
on january,the trial court granted yelp special motion to strike.the trial court found that yelp met its initial burden of establishing that its statements arose from protected activity because statements regarding the filtering of reviews on a social media site such as yelp are matters of public interest and are therefore protected.further,plaintiff failed to establish the public interest exemption of section,subdivision b applied because the action was not brought solely in the public interest as plaintiff had a personal financial stake in the case based on negative reviews.the court found plaintiff also failed to show the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c applied because the statements regarding the reviews did not relate to the selling of advertising and plaintiff failed to show that the statements were statements of fact and not opinion or puffery.finally,the court found plaintiff failed to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits because plaintiff,who was not the owner of the restaurants,lacked standing and yelp alleged misrepresentations were puffery and opinion.
discussion 
plaintiff argues that under section,if an action is prosecuted solely in the public interest or against a person engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services who makes statements about those goods and services,the action is not subject to the provisions of section as a slapp suit,subds.b,c.first,plaintiff argues that this action was brought in the public interest because the fac alleges yelp engaged in the advertising alleged with intent to induce members of the public to visit its website and view advertisements and reviews and that yelp engaged in false advertising to the public,including plaintiff furthermore,the action,if successful,will enforce an important right and confer a benefit upon the public because it will put an end to yelp false advertising and unfair competition.second,plaintiff argues that yelp commercial speech is exempted from the protections of the statute because the action arises out of yelp false statements concerning the accuracy and superiority of its review filter and yelp statements were made for the purpose of promoting the advertising services yelp offered,and such statements were actionable because they were statements of fact,not opinion.
yelp counters that plaintiff has failed to show the public interest exemption of subdivision b applies because here plaintiff seeks relief different from or greater than members of the public at large rather,the fac discloses that plaintiff has a significant private interest in addition,the action will not benefit the public because the only issue at stake is plaintiff personal interest and plaintiff financial interest in rafters is substantial and thus he can meet the burdens of litigation.further,plaintiff has failed to establish that the commercial speech exemption applies because although yelp sells advertising,it is primarily engaged in providing a free public forum for members to read and write reviews about local business,services,and other entities the statements made do not concern commercial speech because they are not directed at advertising and the intended audience of the statements is not an actual or potential buyer or consumer because the intended audience is potential reviewers,not buyers of advertising the statements are not statements of fact,but are puffery because the statements make clear the filtering software is not perfect.finally,yelp asserts that plaintiff did not suffer actual economic injury and has no standing because the owner of the restaurants is memp.
we conclude that plaintiff action is squarely within the commercial speech exemption of section,subdivision c and reverse.
yelp contends that the business entity,memp,that owns the restaurants receiving reviews on its website is the proper party plaintiff in this action,because it is the party who has suffered alleged damages based on fraudulent reviews.while we agree the proper plaintiff to this action is the entity suffering damages,this defect in naming the real party in interest is not fatal to this action 
every action must be prosecuted by the real party in interest.under certain circumstances,a complaint may be amended to substitute a new plaintiff where it is determined the named plaintiff is not the proper party to maintain the alleged claims,so long as the amendment does not present an entirely new set of facts and the defendant is not prejudiced.the substitution of a new plaintiff is proper where original plaintiff was found to have no standing to prosecute action after the original complaint has been filed.jensen royal pools d.thus,where a shareholder seeks to enforce a claim belonging to the corporation,the complaint may be amended to substitute the corporation as the named plaintiff.see,klopstock superior court cal d.with respect to the amendment of business and professions code section,which limited standing in unfair competition actions under business and professions code section to persons who had suffered injury in fact and lost money or property unlike former law,under which plaintiffs could sue on behalf of the general public,amendment is proper to substitute a plaintiff who meets the modified standing requirement in place of one who does not.foundation for taxpayer consumer rights nextel communications,th.
substitution of new plaintiffs requires leave of court pursuant to section.although there is a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to pleadings,the trial court must consider various factors,including whether the substitution would prejudice the defendant,by delaying trial,or increasing discovery burden.royal thrift loan county escrow,th,jensen royal pools,supra,d at.here,the current plaintiff,though an individual and not the business entity that is the direct owner of the restaurants,does not appear to have had an inappropriate motive in naming himself as plaintiff thus,to the extent that the party suffering damages in this case is memp,as opposed to plaintiff,plaintiff should be permitted to move to amend the complaint in this action to substitute the proper party plaintiff and demonstrate a lack of prejudice to yelp from the amendment.

as the court explained in kasky nike,cal th,a false advertising case under the ucl and fal,when a court must decide whether particular speech may be subjected to laws aimed at preventing false advertising or other forms of commercial deception,categorizing a particular statement as commercial or noncommercial speech requires consideration of three elements the speaker,the intended audience,and the content of the message.in typical commercial speech cases,the speaker is likely to be someone engaged in commerce that is,generally,the production,distribution,or sale of goods or services or someone acting on behalf of a person so engaged,and the intended audience is likely to be actual or potential buyers or customers of the speaker goods or services,or persons acting for actual or potential buyers or customers,o
