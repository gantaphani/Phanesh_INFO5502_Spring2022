company hp petitions for a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate an order certifying a class in this action,which alleges that hp pavilions series notebook computers suffer from a manufacturing defect.hp contends that the trial court erred in certifying the class,because under the principles of daugherty american honda motor,th,d daugherty,this case does not meet the requirement of community of interest for class certification.
factual and procedural background 
in april,plaintiff i braun degenshein purchased a zt version model notebook computer.he experienced display screen visibility problems with the computer six months after he purchased it.he joined in this lawsuit against hp after it had been filed in the superior court of santa clara county the complaint alleged that hp had marketed and distributed pavilion series notebook computers,knowing that the computers had defective inverters that could potentially cause dim displays,but without disclosing such defects to consumers the complaint asserted causes of action for violation of the unfair competition law bus,et,violation of the consumer legal remedies act,et,breach of express warranty and unjust enrichment.
the display screen of notebook computers consists of liquid crystal display and other component parts,including an inverter located within the chassis at the bottom of the display screen assembly.the inverter has two functions in the display screen to amplify electricity received from the motherboard to illuminate the backlight and to regulate the flow of electricity to the backlight so that the screen remains illuminated.a faulty inverter can result in a dim or darkened display screen.a dim display in a notebook computer can also be caused by other factors,such as liquid spills,customer abuse,and software incompatibility.in order to determine the type of inverter installed in any given notebook computer,the display screen must be disassembled to allow inspection of the inverter.
hp zinfandel and notebook computers contain inverters from many different suppliers,including tdk and ambit,two japanese companies.the manufacturer of the inverter can not be determined by the serial number of the individual computer rather,the display must be disassembled to inspect the inverter itself.
this case involves some zinfandel and notebook computers that contain inverters manufactured by tdk and ambit that are faulty,causing dim and darkening display screens.
in august,plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a class consisting of all persons and entities who own or owned certain hp computers,listed by product number,who contacted hp about a lack of visibility of the display screen.in support of his motion,plaintiffs presented evidence of two service notes dated april,and november,that were issued by compal,the taiwan computer manufacturer that manufactured the pavilion notebook computers that were the subject of the suit.the service note dated april,referred to a specific type of inverter manufactured by tdk.the tdk inverters were used in some of the zinfandel model notebooks.this service note stated that certain pavilion notebooks returned for repair for no backlight were found to have an inverter fuse open or blown leading to no backlight of the display screen.the service note called for the service center to open the display screen to see if the computer contained the tdk inverter and to replace it with a new and different inverter,manufactured by ambit.
the november,service note referred to a specific type of inverter manufactured by ambit used in some zinfandel notebook computers.the specific inverters were found to have solder cracks,potentially leading to no backlight of the display screen,or to blinking on the display panel.the service note called for replacing the inverter with a reworked version of the same inverter.
hp opposed the motion,contending plaintiffs had not shown either that common issues of fact and law predominated or that there was an ascertainable class.specifically,hp presented evidence that of the approximately class model computers sold under the pavilion brand name,approximately were reported to need repairs due to display screen problems.
in november,the court determined that the proposed class definition was flawed,but that it would consider a subsequent motion should plaintiffs cure the defect.in response,plaintiffs filed a supplemental motion for class certification in april,revising the proposed class definition to include a ll persons or entities who own or owned one or more of the following hp pavilion notebook models model numbers and who experienced a dim,dark,or flickering display screen.
at the july hearing on the supplemental motion,the trial court expressed its view that the class definition should contain one of the inverters in question.the court stated it could give plaintiffs another opportunity to the class to include the inverter.
on august,plaintiffs again filed a supplemental memorandum in support of their motion for class certification.plaintiffs their proposed class as a ll persons or entities who own or owned one or more of the following hp pavilion notebook models model numbers a nd the computer contained or contains tdk inverter or an ambit inverter,part numbers.
at the september hearing on the supplemental motion for class certification,the court expressed concern that there was no evidence on the useful life of notebook computers,and allowed plaintiffs time to submit supplemental briefing and evidence on the issue.in response,plaintiffs submitted the declaration of an expert on the useful life of notebook computers is five years.
at the november hearing on the supplemental motion,the court asked the parties to provide briefing on the effect of daugherty,supra,th,d,a case related to product liability under express warranties that had been decided in october.
at the fifth and final hearing on the motion for class certification in january,the court granted plaintiff motion in part,certifying a class with respect to the causes of action for violation of the ucl and for breach of express warranty.the court defined the class as follows a ll persons or entities who own or owned one or more of the following hp pavilion notebook models model numbers containing a tdk inverter or an ambit inverter,part numbers who purchased the notebook from an entity located within california,and who experienced a dim,dark,or flickering display.excluded from the class are employees,directors,officers,or agents of defendant.the court also ordered that only plaintiff degenshein could represent the class,because it was limited to those who purchased in california.
in its order certifying the class,the court stated that it was not ruling on the effect of the principles set forth in the daugherty case.the trial court concluded that the issues in daugherty go to whether individual class members are entitled to recover,not whether there is a sufficient class.
following the california supreme court denial of the petition for review in daugherty,hp filed a motion for decertification on february,requesting the trial court rule on the effect that daugherty had on the class certification.at the hearing on the motion for decertification in march,the trial court stated it would deny hp motion for decertification because it was premature.
at the court request,plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed class action notice,and on april,the court entered its order approving a class notice including the following as members of the class a ll persons and entities who own one or more of the following hp pavilion notebook models model numbers and who purchased a computer from an entity in california and whose computer contains or contained a tdk inverter or an ambit inverter bearing part numbers and who experienced a dim or flickering display that made the notebook inoperable.
hp filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate,directing the trial court to vacate an order certifying a class in this action.we stayed the matter,and issued an order to show cause why the writ should not issue,and requested opposition from real parties in interest.
