robert reid appeals the district court decision dismissing his false advertising lawsuit against johnson johnson and mcneil nutritionals,llc collectively,mcneil.reid challenges a number of mcneil assertions about its product,benecol.benecol is a vegetable spread that mcneil sells as a healthy substitute for butter or margarine.among other things,on benecol label,mcneil prominently declares that the product contains no trans fat and contains plant stanol esters that lower cholesterol.benecol,however,does contain trans fat.mcneil nonetheless contends that the amount of trans fat in the product is so insignificant that it is authorized under the food and drug administration fda regulations to make the statement.it is also undisputed that benecol does not comply with the terms of the fda regulation authorizing plant stanol health claims.mcneil contends that benecol nonetheless satisfies the standards set forth in a fda letter that authorizes its plant stanol esters statements and is entitled to preemptive effect.
the district court found that reid lacked standing to challenge the statements and that reid claims for relief were preempted.however,the district court rejected mcneil arguments that reid action was barred by the primary jurisdiction and abstention doctrines.we conclude that reid has standing,that reid claims for relief are not preempted,and that reid action is not barred by the primary jurisdiction doctrine.accordingly,we reverse the district court standing and preemption decisions,affirm the district court decision not to invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine,and remand for further proceedings.
mcneil manufactures and sells benecol benecol is manufactured with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,which contains artificial trans fat.according to reid,a rtificial trans fat does not exist in nature,and the human body has not evolved to digest it.it is a toxic food additive that,in the amounts present in benecol,negatively affects blood cholesterol levels.
low density lipoprotein ldl,or bad cholesterol,carries cholesterol to arteries and tissues.high density lipoprotein hdl,or good cholesterol,takes cholesterol away from tissues to the liver,where it is removed from the body.high levels of ldl cholesterol and low levels of hdl cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.the consumption of artificial trans fat increases bad ldl cholesterol and decreases good hdl cholesterol.consequently,consuming partially hydrogenated vegetable oil causes cardiovascular disease,diabetes and cancer.
benecol also contains plant stanol esters.consuming plant stanols has been shown to reduce ldl cholesterol and thus the risk of heart disease.according to reid,the partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in benecol counteracts any positive effect associated with plant stanol esters in the product.
the outside packaging for benecol includes the following statements 
proven to reduce cholesterol 
no trans fat 
no trans fatty acids 
use at least servings of spread per day with your meals and snacks.each serving contains g of plant stanol esters g plant stanols.benecol spreads can help you meet the national cholesterol education program guidelines recommended amount of g plant per day.
plant stanol esters,the unique ingredient found only in benecol spreads,are derived from natural plant components found in vegetable oils such as soy.plant stanol esters sic proven ability to lower cholesterol is supported by over studies,including one reported in the new england journal of medicine.
products containing g or more of plant stanol esters per serving eaten twice a day with meals for a daily intake of at least g may reduce the risk of heart disease as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.a serving of benecol spread contains g of plant stanol esters.
the outer packing depicts several heart icons,and the packaging for benecol light spread also depicts vegetables.the interior packaging,which a consumer would not see unless he or she opened the package presumably,after purchasing it,further states 
the name benecol brings together bene,meaning good and col,for cholesterol.benecol offers you a great way to reduce your cholesterol with a delightfully spread.did you know that or more servings of benecol spreads each day

how can benecol spreads have grams trans fat if they contain partially hydrogenated oils 
a small amount of partially hydrogenated oils are used in benecol spreads to maintain a structure and to enhance the melting characteristics of the benecol regular spread.as a result,benecol spreads contain an extremely low level of trans fat.the fda allows foods containing less than grams of trans to be labeled grams trans fat,since this is considered an insignificant amount.
reid contends that he is a lay consumer with no background in nutrition or food science.he purchased benecol at three different stores in california over a period of more than three years prior to filing the complaint.he asserts that he did so based on mcneil representations in its advertisements and on its packaging.benecol costs more than similar products,and reid contends that he would not have been willing to pay as much as he did if anything at all for benecol had he not been misled.
reid filed his complaint on june.he alleged that mcneil plant stanol health and no trans fat claims were not authorized under the fda regulations and were false.he further asserted that the proven to reduce cholesterol and related statements were false and misleading and rendered benecol an improperly marketed drug.he also contended that mcneil created benecol name and used heart graphics and vegetable depictions to reinforce its deceptive statements and to convey misleading information about benecol health benefits.he asserted claims for relief on behalf of a putative class of benecol purchasers under california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus.false advertising law fal,cal.bus.and consumer legal remedies act clra,cal.
the district court granted mcneil motion to dismiss.initially,the district court decided that reid had sufficiently alleged an economic injury,but lacked standing because he failed to plead reasonable reliance on any misrepresentations.the district court further concluded that reid claims for relief were preempted under federal law.it held that mcneil plant stanol esters statements complied with a fda letter where the agency discussed its intentions about enforcing certain requirements for health claims about plant stanol esters,and it found that mcneil cholesterol reduction and trans fat statements complied with fda regulations.the court rejected mcneil arguments that it should stay or dismiss the case under the primary jurisdiction or abstention doctrines.it also denied reid request to take judicial notice of a number of fda warning letters.reid appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

the district court appeared to dismiss reid claims for requirements for the ucl,fal,and clra.to establish standing to bring a claim under these statutes,plaintiffs must meet an economic requirement,which demands no more than the corresponding requirement under article iii of the constitution.hinojos kohl,cir.in a false advertising case,plaintiffs meet this requirement if they show that,by relying on a misrepresentation on a product label,they paid more for a product than they otherwise would have paid,or bought it when they otherwise would not have done so.id.at,see also pom wonderful llc coca cola,a consumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a disappointing product may well have an cognizable under article iii.reid undoubtedly satisfied this individual reliance requirement,as he alleged that he would not have been willing to pay as much as he did for benecol,if anything,if he had not been misled by mcneil misrepresentations about benecol health effects.
the district court nevertheless decided reid lacked standing because he failed to set forth alleged facts showing that benecol statements may deceive a reasonable consumer.it is true that violations of the ucl,fal,and clra are evaluated from the vantage point of a reasonable consumer.williams gerber prods,cir.under that test,a plaintiff must show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.id.internal quotation marks omitted.but the reasonable consumer standard,unlike the individual reliance requirement described above,is not a standing requirement.rather,it raises questions of fact that are appropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss only in rare situation s.id.at.
even if the district court intended to dismiss reid complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,it erred.the district court found that mcneil alleged misrepresentations would not likely deceive a reasonable consumer in light of its disclosures on its ingredient list,the presence of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.however,as we have previously stated we do not think that the fda requires an ingredient list so that manufacturers can mislead consumers and then rely on the ingredient list to correct those misinterpretations and provide a shield for liability for the deception.williams,at.regardless,it is far from clear that typical consumers understand that a product containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oil necessarily has trans fat,so even if an ingredient list has a curative effect in some cases,it might not here.reid allegations of misrepresentations are plausible enough to survive a motion to dismiss.
the district court also found that reid claims for relief were preempted.the parties arguments invoke express and conflict preemption.express preemption exists when a statute explicitly addresses preemption.see chicanos por la causa,napolitano,cir.conflict preemption applies when it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law or when state laws stand as obstacles to accomplishing federal objectives.see id.as will be made clear,whether reid claims are preempted turns on our interpretation of the fda actions.the preemption analysis turns on whether the challenged statements are authorized by the fda regulations or other pronouncements of similar legal effect.see holk snapple beverage,cir.before analyzing the statements at issue,we first set forth the statutory and regulatory framework.
the nutritional labeling and education act nlea amended the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca to establish uniform food labeling requirements,including the familiar and ubiquitous nutrition facts panel found on most food packages.lily,at.the nlea also provides that no state may directly or indirectly establish any requirement for the labeling of food that is not identical to the federal requirements.id.at quoting a ellipsis omitted.the phrase not identical to means that the state requirement directly or indirectly imposes obligations or contains provisions concerning the composition or labeling of food that are not imposed by or contained in the applicable federal regulation or differ from those specifically imposed by or contained in the applicable federal regulation.id.at quoting c alteration marks omitted.the nlea also provides,however,that it does not preempt any state law unless the law is expressly preempted.holk,at.the nlea does not preempt state causes of action that are identical to the federal labeling requirements.see pom wonderful.at b y taking care to mandate express preemption of some state laws,congress if anything indicated that it did not intend the fdca to preclude requirements arising from other sources.emphasis added farm raised salmon cases,cal.
under the fda regulations,the general rule is that nutrient content claims are not permitted on food labels.nutrient content claims are statements that expressly or implicitly characterize the level of a nutrient.b.however,the regulations do authorize some nutrient content claims.these include statements about the amount or percentage of a nutrient that are consistent with the labeling regulations,less than g of fat per serving,similar statements that include a disclaimer,only mg of sodium per serving,not a low sodium food,or statements that do not characterize the level of nutrient and are not false or misleading,calories.id.i.for authorized nutrient content claims,statements may use r easonable variations in the spelling of terms and their synonyms provided that they are not misleading,hi or lo.id.b.
in addition to regulating nutrient content claims,fda regulations require labels to include the familiar nutrition facts box,dubbed the nutrition label by federal regulations.companies are required to disclose information about the presence of specified nutrients in this label.id.c.though the nutrition label clearly contains information about nutrient content,the claims made in it are not considered nutrient content claims for the purposes of fda regulations.see id.c.while a required statement inside a nutrition label escapes regulations reserved for nutrient content claims,the identical statement outside of the nutrition label is still considered a nutrient content claim and is therefore subject to section.as a result,a requirement to state certain facts in the nutrition label is not a license to make that statement elsewhere on the product.
fda regulations specifically address trans fat.they provide that trans fat should generally be disclosed in the nutrition label except that label declaration of trans fat content information is not required for products that contain less than grams of total fat in a serving if no claims are made about fat,fatty acid or cholesterol content.id.c ii.the regulation further provides 
if the serving contains less than gram,the content,when declared,shall be expressed as zero.except as provided for under the provisions allowing for simplified format labeling,if a statement of the trans fat content is not required and,as a result,not declared,the statement not a significant source of trans fat shall be placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values.
outside the nutrition label,claimants may make nutrient content claims such as fat free,no fat,zero fat,or negligible source of fat on labels where the food contains less than grams of fat per serving and certain other conditions are met.id.b.there is a parallel regulation permitting similar claims about saturated fat,see id.c,but not about trans fat.the fda considered authorizing a trans fat free claim but decided not to enact the regulation in light of insufficient scientific information.see food labeling trans fatty acids in nutrition labeling,nutrient content claims,health claims,july.
in addition to nutrient content claims,the fda has specifically authorized some health claims.see.such claims,however,must be complete,truthful,and not misleading.id.d iii.these specifically include plant stanol esters health claims.id.the applicable regulation states 
a health claim associating diets that include plant esters with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on the label or labeling of a food provided that t he claim states that diets that include plant esters may or might reduce the risk of heart disease and t he claim specifies the daily dietary intake of plant sterol or stanol esters that is necessary to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease or chd and the contribution one serving of the product makes to the specified daily dietary intake level.daily dietary intake levels of plant sterol and stanol esters that have been associated with reduced risk of chd are g or more per day of plant stanol esters the claim must also specify that the daily dietary intake of plant sterol or stanol esters should be consumed in two servings eaten at different times of the day with other foods.
id.c.the claim may also state that the relationship between intake of diets that include plant esters and reduced risk of heart disease is through the intermediate link of blood cholesterol or blood total and ldl cholesterol.id.d.the regulations further provide that the authorization only applies to foods that meet the threshold,two servings amounting to grams and contains percent or more of the reference daily intake or the daily reference value for vitamin a,vitamin c,iron,calcium,protein,or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition.id.c iii a,d,e.
in,the fda issued a letter in response to a request from cargill health food technologies that the fda state its intention not to enforce certain requirements of the plant stanol esters regulation.in the letter,the fda indicated that it will consider exercising enforcement discretion with regard to the use of a claim about reduced risk of chd in the labeling of phystosterol containing food that did not meet the requirements in the regulation.among other things,the fda also indicated that qualifying health claims had to relate to foods containing mg per serving,had to specify that the daily dietary intake of phytosterols that may reduce the risk of chd is milligrams mg or more per day,and the food had to satisfy the regulation other requirements suchas the percent nutrient requirement.see id.c iii b d.
the fda has also recognized that a heart symbol can constitute a health claim.id.a.where a health claim is authorized and where any graphic material,a heart symbol constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears on the label or labeling,the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such graphic material.id.d iv.most health claims based on the benefits of consuming the substance must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve the claimed effect,as established in the regulation authorizing the claim.id.d vii.health claims must also conform to all specific provisions in the appropriate section.id.e.
the challenged statements can be grouped into two categories trans fat nutrient content claims and plant stanol health claims 
the preemption analysis of the no trans fat claim turns on whether the statement is authorized by fda regulations.these regulations create two categories of nutrient content claims,expressed and implied,imposing a different set of requirements for each type of claim.b.the no trans fat claim is an expressed claim because it is a direct statement about the level of trans fat in the food.id.b.fda regulations authorize expressed claims that do not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the food and are not false or misleading in any respect,calories or grams of fat.see id.i.
the fda has provided guidance about whether a no trans fat nutrient content claim is permissible for products containing small amounts of trans fat.in one of its warning letters the fda indicated that no trans fat is an unauthorized nutrient content claim which has not been defined by fda.the agency noted that the letter recipient could make a truthful statement on a product label that specifies the amount of trans fat per serving.see i.in a second letter,the fda similarly indicated that trans is an unauthorized nutrient content claim.we defer to the fda interpretation of its own rules,even if the product of an informal and process unless its interpretation is clearly erroneous.see pub.lands for the people,dep t of,cir where an agency interprets its own regulation,even if through an informal process,its interpretation of an ambiguous regulation is controlling under auer robbins,unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.internal citations and alteration marks omitted,cert.denied.
a nutrient content claim fails if it is false or misleading in any respect.i emphasis added.because benecol contains some trans fat between and grams per serving,its no trans fat claim is misleading in at least one respect.the structure of fda labeling regulations bolsters this conclusion.as noted,under section b c,the fda has expressly allowed no fat and no saturated fat claims for products that contain less than grams of fat or saturated fat per serving.by contrast,the fda explicitly decided not to authorize a no trans fat claim in light of a lack of scientific information.see.if a no trans fat claim is not false or misleading under.i,a no fat or no saturated fat claim can not be treated differently.this would mean that section b c is redundant if section i authorizes no fat and no saturated fat claims for products with small amounts of fat or saturated fat,then why would the fda go to the trouble of promulgating a separate regulation expressly allowing these claims it would be incongruous to have the same rule for both no fat no saturated fat and no trans fat claims,as the former is expressly permitted while the latter is not due to a lack of scientific consensus about the dangers of trans fat.thus,the fda reading of section i that the regulation does not authorize no trans fat claims makes the most sense of the overall labeling regime,as it gives meaning to section b c.
mcneil says its no trans fat claim is the equivalent of its statement on the nutrition label that benecol contains grams of trans fat per serving,a statement it must make under section c ii.fda regulations allow a label to include synonyms of authorized nutrient content claims,id.b,which mcneil claims is exactly what its no trans fat claim is.but,as noted,claims required on a nutrition label under section c,like benecol grams trans fat per serving claim,are not nutrient content claims and thus are not covered by section b synonym rule.that mcneil must say benecol contains grams of trans fat per serving on its nutrition label makes no difference here.
the district court found that no trans fat was not misleading,as any reasonable consumer would infer that benecol contains trans fat,given that partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is disclosed as an ingredient.as noted,however,there is no reason to believe that consumers understand that partially hydrogenated vegetable oil contains trans fat.consequently,we conclude that reid claims for relief are not preempted to the extent they are predicated on mcneil trans fat statements.
as for the plant stanol esters and cholesterol reduction claims,mcneil admits that the claims fall short of c,which permits health claims related to plant stanol esters that meet certain requirements.these health claims do,however,meet the criteria described in the fda letter about its enforcement intentions.mcneil argues that,in spite of its noncompliance with section c,the letter created a federal policy preempting state law.we must decide whether this letter is entitled to preemptive effect 
the supremacy clause gives federal authorities the power to preempt state law by declaring that the constitution,and the laws of the united states are the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.the phrase laws of the united states encompasses both federal statutes themselves and federal regulations that are properly adopted in accordance with statutory authorization.city of new york fcc.thus,a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may render unenforceable state or local laws that are otherwise not inconsistent with federal law.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.because the supremacy clause privileges only l aws of the united states,an agency pronouncement must have the force and effect of federal law to have preemptive force.see fellner tri union seafoods,llc,cir wabash valley power ass n,rural electrification,cir.beyond the constitutional text,there is nothing to guide us in determining whether an agency action creates law for supremacy clause purposes.
the supreme court has created a framework for deciding whether congress contemplated that a particular agency pronouncement would have the force and effect of federal
