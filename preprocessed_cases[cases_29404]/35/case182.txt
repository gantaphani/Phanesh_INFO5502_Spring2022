plaintiff joan scott sued metabolife international,metabolife for personal injuries she alleges she suffered after taking its.metabolife appeals the denial of its special motion to strike the complaint under code of civil procedure section metabolife contends the trial court erred in concluding section did not apply.we conclude scott personal injury causes of action arise from metabolife act of manufacturing and selling of the allegedly defective product that caused scott injury,not from any act in furtherance of metabolife right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitutions.scott also included a false advertising cause of action.we conclude metabolife advertising of the safety and efficacy of its product does not concern an issue of public interest under section.we shall affirm.
factual and procedural background 
athe complaint 
boiled down to its essential relevant allegations,scott complaint claims she used metabolife and suffered a stroke as a direct result.from this kernel of relevant information,scott alleges four personal injury causes of action,and one cause of action for false advertising strict products liability breach of express and implied warranties negligence deceit and unfair competition and false advertising in violation of business and professions code sections and.
general allegations 
more generally,in the parties,jurisdiction and venue section of her complaint,scott alleges metabolife manufactures,distributes and sells dietary supplements,including metabolife,to members of the public.scott claims metabolife contains ephedrine and caffeine,which together can cause serious injuries.scott alleges at the time of its manufacture and sale to scott,metabolife was unsafe and defective to consumers using that product for its intended purposes because it contained these two compounds.scott generally alleges the manufacturer knew this when they sold the product and further knew the product presented potentially a substantial and unreasonable risk of harm to consumers,including scott.scott purchased metabolife manufactured and sold by metabolife.
in the factual background portion of her complaint,scott alleges metabolife misled users about the product and failed to adequately warn them about the potential serious dangers of the product they knew or should have known about.scott alleges metabolife markets metabolife by misrepresenting its efficacy,inducing millions of consumers to use it.further,metabolife represented metabolife increased energy,aided in diet and weight loss,and was a safe,natural metabolic enhancer that decreased fat,increased lean body mass,and increased energy during exercise.
based on these representations of safety and efficacy,scott purchased the product,read the label,and took it on a daily basis.using the product in its intended and foreseeable manner,scott then suffered a stroke as a direct result of using metabolife.scott claims she was ignorant of the stroke risk associated with metabolife.had she known of the risks inherent in the product,she would not have taken the product.
scott alleges metabolife earned profits while concealing the potential hazards of the product from the public.scott alleges metabolife knew of the various potential dangers of metabolife.
causes of action 
strict liability 
scott first cause of action is for strict liability.in the key allegation of this cause of action,scott alleges metabolife is unsafe and defective to consumers using said product for its advertised purposes and in a reasonably foreseeable manner because the product contained ephedrine and caffeine.scott asserts she sustained a stroke as a result of using this defective product.in addition to this,scott alleges metabolife knew its product was dangerous and failed to warn the public of the dangers of this product or to take steps to remedy the defects.further,scott alleges metabolife knew metabolife would be used by consumers without their investigation of its advertising claims,and in reliance on those claims,those consumers took the product.scott further alleges the failure of metabolife to warn consumers was willful and wanton and justified the award of punitive damages.
breach of warranty 
in her second cause of action for breach of express and implied warranties,scott alleges metabolife expressly and implicitly represented metabolife was safe,reasonably fit for its intended purpose and was of marketable quality,when,in fact,it was not.as a result of the breach of these warranties,scott suffered personal injuries.
negligence 
in her third cause of action for negligence,scott alleges metabolife had a duty not to unreasonably make and sell a potentially dangerous product and deliberately withhold issuing warnings about it.scott alleges metabolife breached this duty by failing to warn of the dangers of metabolife and failed to provide adequate safeguards to prevent the injuries sustained by scott.as a result of metabolife negligence,scott was injured.
in her fourth cause of action,scott alleges metabolife deceived consumers,including her,by falsely representing metabolife was safe and the product would increase energy,reduce body fat and increase muscle mass.the labeling on the bottles fails to reveal the actual contents of the product.metabolife falsely labeled the product as standardized.metabolife sales and marketing campaign for metabolife willfully deceived scott and the general public about the health risks of the product.metabolife suppressed the truth with the intent to mislead and defraud scott knowing they would not use metabolife if they knew the truth.as a result of this conduct,scott was injured.
false advertising 
finally,scott fifth cause of action alleges metabolife violated business and professions code sections and by the above actions.specifically,metabolife conduct was false advertising in violation of certain specific health and safety code provisions.scott sought injunctive,restitutionary,and other equitable relief and attorney fees on behalf of the general public against metabolife for this conduct.
as is evident from our description of scott complaint,it needlessly repeats the relevant charging allegations throughout its pages.however,it does not stop there.scott complaint also contains a number of other allegations that are simply inconsequential fluff.it is these allegations that appear to have invited the instant section motion like the wolf invited little red riding hood into grandma house.had plaintiff counsel more carefully drafted the complaint,restricting it only to the facts relevant to each cause of action,counsel might have avoided this motion entirely.
for example,in the introduction,scott alleges that in congress deregulated the dietary supplement industry.thus dietary supplements have appeared in supermarkets and grown into a billion a year industry.scott alleges manufacturers,including metabolife,market these products without scientific testing for safety or efficacy.further,scott contends the industry does not maintain a comprehensive reporting system for adverse health effects associated with their products and consumers are not provided with reliable information about the products and specifically about metabolife.
scott also alleges the food and drug administration fda has received adverse health reports from consumers of these supplements that document death and disability from serious health conditions.scott states the fda commissioned a report that found the use of dietary supplements that contain ppa alkaloids were the probable cause of health conditions that in turn cause death and disability.
motion to strike 
metabolife brought a motion to strike scott complaint under section.metabolife argued the lawsuit arose from its advertising,labeling,marketing,and promoting of its product and those advertising activities were constitutionally protected speech about an issue of public interest as defined by section.thus,it argued scott needed to establish a probability of success on the merits or her complaint should be stricken.
in support of its motion,metabolife submitted documents showing the metabolife label which states,in part,natural herbs metabolife dietary supplement,herbal formula to enhance your diet and provide energy and independently laboratory tested for safety.further,metabolife submitted documents concerning the government accounting office and the fda discussion and potential regulation of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids.metabolife also submitted materials supplied by the ephedra education council and laws from other states concerning the regulation of the dosage levels of ephedrine.
scott opposed the motion.scott argued the focus and objective of her lawsuit was metabolife conduct in manufacturing and selling scott an allegedly defective product.scott also submitted documents in an attempt to establish a probability of success on the merits of her lawsuit.
the trial court denied metabolife motion.it ruled section does not apply to the first four causes of action for strict liability,breach of warranty,negligence,and deceit since these causes of action arise out of scott ingestion of metabolife allegedly defective product,not out of metabolife constitutionally protected activities.as to the false advertising cause of action,the court ruled,applying section sic to advertising would be stretching the definition of that statute to it sic outermost boundaries,which the court is not willing to do.however,even assuming that section applies to advertising,the court finds that scott has met her burden under the section to show a reasonable probability of success on this claim.metabolife appeals.
discussion 
iapplication of section 
metabolife claims the trial court erred in denying its motion to strike because the trial court impermissibly concluded section did not apply to scott causes of action.as we shall explain,we conclude section does not apply to scott personal injury causes of action because each cause of action arises from the manufacture and sale of a defective product,not metabolife constitutional right of petition or of free speech.we conclude section does not apply to scott cause of action for false advertising because metabolife speech furthers only its own personal interest of selling its commercial product and hence does not concern an issue of public interest.
the language of section 
responding to the disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,in the california legislature enacted section,subd.a.the statute was intended to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance and to prevent the chilling of such participation through abuse of the judicial process.ibid.
subdivision b of section provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
section,subdivision e,defines the phrase act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue to include 
any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law 
any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law 
any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest 
or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
section posits a process for determining whether an action is a slapp.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.citation.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier.on appeal,we review an order denying a special motion to strike under section de novo.gallimore state farm fire casualty ins.th,d.
the arising from requirement 
metabolife argues each of scott causes of action arises from its constitutionally protected right to engage in free speech.we disagree.as it relates to her four personal injury causes of action,the fundamental issue here is do these causes of action arise from any act of metabolife in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech the answer is no.
our supreme court issued two opinions concerning section that are relevant to our discussion.city of cotati,supra,cal th,d,navellier,supra,cal th,d.
in the first of these opinions,the court explicitly addressed the concept of arising from.city of cotati,supra,cal th,d.after the city of cotati was sued in federal court concerning an ordinance it passed,it filed a lawsuit in state court addressing the same issues against the original plaintiffs in the federal action.id.at,d.the city of cotati court concluded the state court lawsuit arose out of the validity of the underlying ordinance,not from the constitutionally protected petitioning conduct of filing the prior federal action.id.at,d.thus,section did not apply.ibid.
in explaining the concept of arising from as it is used in section,the court explained,the mere fact an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean it arose from that activity.section can not be read to mean that any claim asserted in an action which arguably was filed in retaliation for the exercise of speech or petition rights falls under section,whether or not the claim is based on conduct in exercise of those rights.citations.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d.rather,the court concluded the trial court must focus on the substance of the lawsuit to determine whether it arose from the defendant protected activities.id.at,d.thus,it is the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action that determines whether the statute applies.id.at,d.the court held,in short,the statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.t he critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.id.at,d.
in navellier,the plaintiff sued the defendant alleging defendant had committed fraud in connection with a settlement agreement that settled a prior lawsuit and further alleging defendant breached the agreement.cal th at,d.the supreme court concluded the plaintiff causes of action arose from the constitutionally protected petitioning conduct of the filing of the prior lawsuit and thus section applied.navellier,supra,at,d.in addressing the plaintiffs argument that this action could not fall within section,the supreme court stated,nothing in the statute itself categorically excludes any particular type of action from its operation.navellier,supra,at,d.the court further explained,the logical flaw in plaintiffs argument is its false dichotomy between actions that target the formation or performance of contractual obligations and those that target the exercise of the right of free speech.citation.a given action,or cause of action,may indeed target both.as the facts in this lawsuit illustrate,conduct alleged to constitute breach of contract may also come within constitutionally protected speech or petitioning.section definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.navellier,supra,at,d.
where both constitutionally protected and unprotected conduct is implicated by a cause of action,a plaintiff may not immunize a cause of action challenging protected free speech or petitioning activity from a special motion under section by the artifice of including extraneous allegations concerning nonprotected activity.fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d.thus,when allegations of nonprotected activity are incidental or collateral to a plaintiff claim challenging primarily the exercise of the rights of free speech or petition,they may be disregarded in determining whether the cause of action arises from protected activity.conversely,if the allegations of protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,the mere mention of the protected activity does not subject the cause of action to an motion.see paul friedman th,d statute does not provide protection to suits arising from any act having any connection,however remote,with protected conduct.
personal injury causes of action 
with this framework in place,we analyze scott first four causes of action for personal injury.scott cause of action for false advertising is a horse of a different color and is treated separately under part d,post.
scott first cause of action is for strict liability.a manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market,knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects,proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being.anderson fiberglas cal d.the elements of this cause of action are as follows the product is placed on the market there is knowledge that it will be used without inspection for defect the product proves to be defective and the defect causes injury to a human.mccreery eli lilly d,disapproved on other grounds in sindell abbott laboratories cal d,as stated in howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th,d.
here,scott alleges metabolife manufactured metabolife,that product was defective,and caused scott personal injuries in the form of a stroke.
turning to the negligence cause of action,our supreme court has explained,the plaintiff in order to recover in strict liability in tort must prove that he was injured by a defect in the product and that the product was defective when it left the hands of the retailer or manufacturer whereas to recover in negligence the plaintiff must prove the same two elements plus an additional element,namely,that the defect in the product was due to negligence of the defendant.jiminez sears,roebuck cal d.
scott alleges metabolife had a duty not to unreasonably make and sell a potentially dangerous product and withhold warnings about the product.as a result of its negligence and breach of that duty,metabolife injured scott.
the essential elements of a warranty cause of action are.there was a sale of goods the defendant was the seller,and plaintiff a buyer.defendant expressly or impliedly warranted the goods sold.there was a breach of warranty and.the breach of warranty caused plaintiff to suffer injury,damage,loss or harm.and.the plaintiff gave defendant timely notice of the breach of warranty.baji.
here,scott alleges metabolife expressly and impliedly warranted metabolife was safe,fit for its intended purpose,and of marketable quality.as a result of metabolife failure to produce a product that met these warranties,scott was injured.
for a cause of action of deceit,the rule has been stated as follows a manufacturer or seller of an article which is not inherently dangerous,but which is rendered dangerous by a defect therein,is liable for an injury to a third person arising from the defect,where he had knowledge of the defect and of the danger,and failed to give notice or warning thereof to the purchaser,or concealed the defect,or represented the article to be safe and sound,or,in other words,was guilty of fraud or deceit.youtz thompson tire d.
scott alleges metabolife manufactured and marketed a defective product.metabolife both concealed its inherent dangers and affirmatively misrepresented the product was safe.this defective product proximately caused her injuries.
we reject metabolife characterization of this lawsuit as based upon its advertising or commercial speech.this speech is not the gravamen or principal thrust of scott complaint.as should be evident by our description of the conduct scott alleges in each of these personal injury causes of action,scott does not seek redress for that advertising.in fact,metabolife advertising itself caused scott no injury at all.that advertising is unrelated to and distinct from the conduct by metabolife upon which scott personal injury causes of action are based.rather,scott seeks redress for her own personal injuries because metabolife manufactured and sold her a defective product that injured her.for purposes of section,each of scott four causes of action is based upon metabolife act of manufacturing and selling the defective product that caused scott injury.it is this act of manufacturing and selling the defective product that underlies each one of these causes of action.
it is true metabolife commercial speech has some relevance here,especially in the breach of express warranty and fraud theories of recovery.the mere fact scott lawsuit followed the advertising and marketing of metabolife,however,does not establish that the lawsuit arose from that advertising.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d.even though these causes of action require the proof of some speech,the core of these causes of action is that the product did not conform to the warranties and statements made by metabolife.thus,the wrongful conduct on which these claims are based arises from the nature of the defective product.a manufacturer does not engage in activities protected by the first amendment when it produces a product that does not meet its warrantied or represented characteristics.we conclude metabolife advertising is merely incidental to the manufacturing and sales conduct that are the basis for these causes of action.because the speech is not the gravamen of these causes of action,we conclude the protections of section do not apply here 
moreover,in arguing scott causes of action arise out of its protected advertising activities,metabolife confuses the method of proof scott will use to demonstrate its product is defective with metabolife conduct from which these causes of action arise.
in gallimore state farm fire casualty ins,plaintiff sued defendant insurance company for unfair business practices in violation of business and professions code section based on a department of insurance investigation that examined claim files and found violations in nearly percent of them.th at,d.the appellate court concluded the plaintiff causes of action arose out of the underlying violations,not any communication between defendant and the department of insurance about the claims process.id.at,d.defendant argued its communications with the department of insurance were protected communications,and allowing the plaintiff to rely on them to prosecute the action interfered with its rights to communicate with that department.ibid.the court retorted,this contention confuses defendant allegedly wrongful acts with the evidence that plaintiff will need to prove such misconduct.plaintiff seeks no relief from defendant for its communicative acts,but rather for its alleged mistreatment of policyholders and its related violations and evasions of statutory and regulatory mandates.ibid.
similarly here,scott does not seek redress from metabolife for its communicative conduct.that is not the thrust or gravamen of these causes of action.instead,scott seeks redress for the personal injuries she suffered as a result of metabolife manufacture of what she contends is a defective product.to the extent that metabolife labels and advertising are relevant,they are merely means of demonstrating the product was defective because appropriate warnings were not issued with the product in this sense,metabolife confuses the evidence necessary to establish its product was defective from the conduct that this lawsuit arises from.
we therefore conclude scott personal injury causes of action do not arise from metabolife protected activities.section has no application here.
unfair advertising cause of action 
as should be,there is a difference between scott personal injury causes of action and her fifth cause of action for unfair business practices and false advertising.we address this cause of action separately because it squarely addresses metabolife speech,but we conclude commercial speech about the safety of a product by the manufacturer of that product for the purposes of the sale of the product does not constitute an issue of public interest for purposes of section.
combination of false advertising with allegations of unfair competition 
as an initial matter,scott argues her cause of action for unfair competition and false advertising does not arise from any constitutional right of metabolife to free speech or to petition because the cause of action arises from the manufacture of a defective product,which in and of itself constitutes unfair competition regardless of whether a portion of that cause of action is viable under the products liability theory,in that same unfair business practices cause of action scott also asserts metabolife has engaged in false advertising in violation of business and professions code section,as well as other health and safety code sections.
as we have already noted,when we are faced with a cause of action that involves both constitutionally protected and unprotected conduct,we must examine the substance of or gravamen of each cause of action to determine whether section applies in the first instance.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d.a plaintiff can not frustrate the purposes of the slapp statute through a pleading tactic of combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one cause of action.fox searchlight pictures,paladino,supra,th at,d.where the allegations of constitutionally protected activity are not merely incidental to the unprotected conduct,the protections of section are implicated.
here,the gravamen of the fifth cause of action is metabolife false advertising conduct.unlike the personal injury causes of action,which only deal with scott and her personal injuries,we may not conclude the speech activities identified in the fifth cause of action are merely incidental to this cause of action.rather,we must tackle head on whether section applies to this false advertising cause of action.
does section apply to false advertising 
scott urges us to hold section does not apply to metabolife false advertising because false advertising is not constitutionally protected.we reject this argument.
in navellier,the plaintiff argued the defendant was not entitled to the protections provided by section because its petitioning activities were not valid and hence not constitutionally protected.cal th at,d.the court responded,that the legislature expressed a concern in the statute preamble with lawsuits that chill the valid exercise of first amendment rights does not mean that a court may read a separate requirement into the operative sections of the statute.citations.rather,any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff secondary burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.citation.ibid.
as explained by another court,the same argument could be made by the plaintiff in a defamation defendant has no first amendment right to engage in libel or slander.yet,defamation suits are a prime target of slapp motions.the legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.if this were the case then the inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous.fox searchlight pictures,paladino,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
similarly here,scott can not simply allege this advertising is false and therefore exempt from the application of section.when a cause of action arises from constitutionally protected speech,section applies and the question of whether the speech is false must be examined when plaintiff demonstrates a probability of success on the merits.
a manufacturer advertising of its product does not concern an issue of public interest 
as noted above in part ia,ante,in order for section to apply,the defendant must demonstrate the conduct from which the lawsuit arises falls within one of the categories described in subdivision e of that section.for purposes of this appeal,we shall assume,for argument sake,commercial advertising is free speech protected by the first amendment and hence falls within the conduct described in section,subdivision e or e.see kasky nike,cal th,d,commercial speech is entitled to some constitutional protection.however,as we shall explain,the advertising at issue in this manufacturer advertising of a specific consumer product,on its labels,and to the public,for the purpose of selling that not an issue of public interest or a public issue as that phrase is used in section.
section,subdivision e provides in pertinent part 
e as used in this section act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.italics added.
there are three appellate cases that address whether commercial speech concerning the sale of a drug or an herbal supplement is an issue of public interest.
the first case is dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d dupont where the court found advertising to be an issue of public interest.in dupont,the plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer of the drug coumadin.id.at,d.the complaint alleged the manufacturer artificially inflated the price of the drug by disseminating false information concerning an alternative generic product both in connection with public advertising and in lobbying activities in the legislative arena dupont,at,d.the appellate court concluded section applied to the manufacturer advertising to doctors and the public because the statements were made in connection with a public issue.dupont,at,d.the court looked to the plaintiffs complaint which stated more than million americans have purchased coumadin,an medication,for the prevention and treatment of blood clots that can lead to conditions such as stroke and pulmonary embolism.based on this allegation,the court concluded,both the number of persons allegedly affected and the seriousness of the conditions treated establish the issue as one of public interest.id.at,d.
in nagel twin laboratories,th,d,the appellate court examined whether an unfair competition lawsuit brought against the manufacturer of an ephedrine containing herbal supplement fell within the parameters of section.the substance of the plaintiff lawsuit was that the label on the product falsely stated the product was standardized for ephedrine.nagel,at,d.plaintiff brought suit for unfair competition and violations of the consumer legal remedies act asserting the defendant label was false and misleading.nagel,at,d.the nagel court rejected defendant argument its labels constituted speech in connection with an issue of public interest.id.at,d.the court stated,while matters of health and weight management are undeniably of interest to the public,it does not necessarily follow that all lists of ingredients on labels of food products or on the manufacturers web sites are fully protected from legal challenges by vir
