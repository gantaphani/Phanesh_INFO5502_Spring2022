discussion 
tci contends the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.as explained below,tci is mistaken.
standards of review 
because a demurrer both tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint and involves the trial court discretion,an appellate court employs two separate standards of review on appeal.citation.appellate courts first review the complaint de novo to determine whether or not the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory,citation,or in other words,to determine whether or not the trial court erroneously sustained the demurrer as a matter of law.citation.cantu resolution trust th,fn.omitted.second,if a trial court sustains a demurrer without leave to amend,appellate courts determine whether or not the plaintiff could amend the complaint to state a cause of action.citation.id.at,fn.
under the first standard of review,we examine the complaint factual allegations to determine whether they state a cause of action on any available legal theory.citation.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts which were properly pleaded.citation.however,we will not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law citation,and we may disregard any allegations that are contrary to the law or to a fact of which judicial notice may be taken.citation.ellenberger espinosa th.moreover,because the policy and the competitors complaint constitute the foundation of tci claims and are incorporated into tci complaint,we may properly rely on these documents in assessing whether tci claims are legally tenable.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
under the second standard of review,the burden falls upon the plaintiff to show what facts he or she could plead to cure the existing defects in the complaint.cantu resolution trust,supra,th at.to meet this burden,a plaintiff must submit a proposed amended complaint or,on appeal,enumerate the facts and demonstrate how those facts establish a cause of action.ibid.
duty to defend 
the key issues presented on appeal concern an insurer duty to defend i t is firmly established that the duty to defend is broader than the obligation to indemnify.the former arises whenever an insurer ascertains facts that give rise to the possibility or the potential of liability to indemnify.unlike the duty to indemnify which arises only when the insured underlying liability is established,the duty to defend must be assessed at the very outset of a case equally established is that when a suit against an insured alleges a claim that potentially or even possibly could subject the insured to liability for covered damages,an insurer must defend unless and until the insurer can demonstrate,by reference to undisputed facts,that the claim can not be covered.pardee construction insurance of the west th,quoting borg transamerica ins.th,italics deleted.the absence of a duty to defend is established when the insurer shows that the underlying claim could not come within the policy coverage by virtue of the scope of the insuring clause or the breadth of an exclusion.montrose chemical superior court cal th.
to determine whether peerless properly declined to provide a defense to tci,we identify the facts available to it at the time of its denial.the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.horace mann ins.barbara cal th.facts extrinsic to the complaint also trigger the duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.id.at.in the context of a demurrer,the absence of a duty to defend may be established when the allegations in the third party complaint disclose no basis for policy coverage,and the insured complaint alleges no extrinsic facts that raise a possibility of coverage.michaelian state comp.ins.fund th.
facts known to peerless 
as tci complaint against peerless does not allege extrinsic facts pertinent to the duty to defend,our inquiry is confined to idt complaint,which is incorporated into tci complaint.idt filed its action in federal district court in new jersey against tci and several other phone card providers.idt complaint asserts claims for deceptive business practices and false advertising under the lanham act et and the laws of several states,including california unfair competition law bus,et and false advertising law bus,et.
idt complaint alleged that the prepaid phone card industry generates over billion in annual retail sales revenue.according to the complaint,idt constituted the leading card provider,with annual sales exceeding billion tci and the other defendants collectively made approximately billion in sales.although consumers of phone cards exhibit a high degree of brand loyalty and frequently buy the same brand of card,they are also sensitive to price rates.consumers receive information about phone cards from advertising and voice prompts,that is,an automated computer voice that tells a card user the amount of calling time remaining on the card.
