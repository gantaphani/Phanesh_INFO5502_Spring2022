ashley gasper is an adult movie actor who performs under the stage name jules jordan,and is the president and sole shareholder of jules jordan video jjv,the creator of the videos in which gasper appears.he and his company sued defendants canada,kaytel video distribution kaytel,leisure time video canada,leisure time,alain elmaleh,the principal shareholder of each of the corporate defendants collectively the kaytel defendants,jacky one stop and the other defendants named in this consolidated appeal.gasper alleged that the kaytel defendants had copied and sold thirteen copyrighted adult dvds owned by jjv or gasper and featuring gasper performances the jjv action.the complaint alleged claims for copyright infringement,contributory copyright infringement,violation of unfair business practice,unfair competition under california law,false and misleading advertising,and violation of gasper right of publicity.the claims for unfair business practices and false advertising were dismissed prior to trial,leaving only the claims for copyright infringement based on the replication and distribution of the thirteen dvds,and the claim for violation of gasper right of publicity under california law.
after a lengthy and contentious trial,the jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs on both issues after the verdict the court granted the kaytel defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol in part,concluding that neither gasper nor jjv had standing to assert the copyright claims,and denied plaintiffs motion for jmol.the court rejected the kaytel defendants claim that gasper right of publicity claim was preempted by copyright law.both parties have appealed.we disagree with the district court on both issues,concluding that gasper right of publicity claim is preempted by the copyright act,but that gasper and jjv had standing to assert the copyright claims in question.
facts and procedural history 
both gasper and stagliano are adult film performers of some stature.stagliano company,jsi,distributed the works of many producers including stagliano and gasper,under the brand names evil angel and evil empire.gasper started making adult films in.he produces,directs and performs in his films under the stage name jules jordan.he also writes the scripts and films the scenes.jjv,which he formed in,is basically a shop with gasper as the president and sole shareholder.during the period in question,he received from jjv a monthly salary and bonuses based on company income.
in gasper agreed with stagliano that jsi would distribute the jules jordan films in the united states,but gasper retained ownership of the copyright.jsi prepared gasper copyright registration paperwork.in gasper and jjv ended their relationship with jsi and began to distribute their own movies.
elmaleh is the sole or majority shareholder in all of the kaytel companies,and formed canada,as a canadian holding company that owns both kaytel video distribution and leisure time,major adult entertainment distributors in the canadian market.elmaleh also owned a number of retail adult entertainment stores in canada.he controlled all of the kaytel defendant entities,and at least some of the employees were shared among the companies.
in spring,jsi began receiving a higher than normal rate of return of jules jordan videos.upon review of the returned merchandise,gasper learned that the returns were counterfeit copies of his dvds.the counterfeit works were inferior and were replicated and compressed to fit on a smaller dvd,reducing the quality of the video.
gasper and jsi discovered that kaytel used media mastering services to produce unauthorized masters of a number of jsi titles,including the jjv titles involved in the instant case.using replication broker gerald ouzzan and his company sylnet,kaytel contracted with diadem digital to replicate thousands of copies of the counterfeit dvds.elmaleh,individually and on behalf of kaytel,signed documents representing that they owned the rights to the dvds.one of kaytel employees,jacky elkeslassy,formed a canadian company called jacky one stop,that sold the copied dvds to distributors,primarily direct distributors in new york direct.although the sales were ostensibly between direct and jacky one stop,direct dealt exclusively with elmaleh and sent payments to kaytel.direct distributed the counterfeit dvds throughout the united states.
gasper and jjv sued.on the same day that gasper filed suit,a companion case,john stagliano,alain elmaleh,et the jsi action,was filed,also alleging that the kaytel defendants had replicated and distributed a number of stagliano copyrighted dvds without license or authority.
the two cases,along with a third case brought by jjv against canadian multimedia entertainment,the cme action,were all originally assigned to judge matthew byrne,whose untimely death resulted in reassignment to judge dickran tevrizian.judge tevrizian consolidated the cases for discovery but retired from the bench prior to the trial.the cases were then reassigned to judge james otero,who consolidated the three cases for all purposes including trial.prior to the trial,the plaintiffs settled with and dismissed their claims against elmaleh,gerald ouzzan and sylnet distributors.just before trial the cme action settled,leaving only the jjv and jsi actions against the kaytel defendants to be tried.the plaintiffs in both cases settled with media mastering services,diaden,sylnet,elkeslassy and jacky and direct in exchange for monthly payments and promises to provide documentation and testimony.jsi settled with kaytel after trial.
the jjv action went to trial on the two remaining issues,copyright infringement and violation of gasper right of publicity under california law.the jury found that all three defendants infringed gasper jjv copyrights,awarding in statutory damages for each of the thirteen dvds against kaytel,for each dvd against leisure time and for each dvd against elmaleh.the jury also found that defendants violated gasper right of publicity and awarded gasper varying amounts in damages,lost profits and punitive damages against each defendant totaling just under million,including million in punitive damages.
prior to trial,the kaytel defendants had moved in limine to exclude evidence in support of gasper and jjv copyright claims,arguing that both gasper and jjv lacked standing to assert any copyright infringement claim because the complaint alleged that stagliano company,ea productions,had the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute plaintiffs copyrighted products the district court denied the motion because the evidence could have been admissible if relevant to claims brought by other plaintiffs,but dismissed sua sponte jjv and gasper copyright infringement claims.
during a recess on the first day of trial the court granted plaintiffs motion to reconsider and reinstated the copyright claims,concluding that jjv and gasper could be beneficial owners under their license agreement with jsi,and if so,would have standing under b.the court order specifically noted that defendants may revisit the issue should plaintiffs fail to perfect standing prior the close of plaintiffs cases in chief.defendants attempted to raise the issue at the close of plaintiffs case,but the court did not want to delay the trial and instructed defendants to file written motions that would be entertained at the appropriate time.when the case was first reassigned to judge otero,he informed the parties both orally and in written orders that no dispositive motions were to be filed.prior to trial defendants moved in limine to preclude plaintiffs from introducing evidence in support of their common law claims and sought dismissal of those claims as preempted by the copyright act.the court refused to exclude the evidence because that evidence may be relevant to the federal law claims which supposedly the common law claims.the court refused to consider the request to dismiss the common law claims because it had already told the parties that it will not consider any further dispositive motions.
at the close of trial both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.plaintiffs sought jmol on the state law claims and the copyright infringement claims.defendants motion,on the other hand,sought jmol on the copyright claim only,arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing.the court granted defendants motion,concluding that because gasper was employed by jjv the motion picture were works for hire under and that jjv was the author,leaving gasper without standing.the court also concluded that because the copyright registration in gasper name was invalid,jjv had no standing.
the court denied as moot plaintiffs motion for jmol in light of the subsequent jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs and the decision on defendants motions.the court noted,however,that in response to plaintiffs motion,defendants had argued that plaintiffs california state law right of publicity claim was preempted by the federal copyright claim.after indicating that defendants should have raised this issue in their own motion,the court analyzed the issue for the sake of procedural clarity,concluding that the claim was not preempted and indicating that i f defendants moved to make this argument,such a motion would be denied.
after entry of judgment,defendants moved pursuant to.for a new trial,arguing again that gasper state law claim was preempted by the federal copyright act.the court denied that motion based on its earlier ruling.
defendants appeal from the district court decision that gasper right of publicity claim under california civil code was not preempted by the copyright act.we review de novo whether a federal law preempts a state law,as well as the district court interpretation of state law.laws sony music entm t,cir.
congress enacted the copyright act,et,to define and protect the rights of copyright holders.the act provides that the owner of copyright has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize others to display,perform,reproduce or distribute copies of the work and to prepare derivative works.u.a copyright gives the owner the right to control the work.
section of the act provides for exclusive jurisdiction over rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified in the act.the intention of section is to preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or statutes of a state that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works within the scope of federal copyright law.at.in laws,we stated that 
we have adopted a test to determine whether a state law claim is preempted by the act.we must first determine whether the subject matter of the state law claim falls within the subject matter of copyright as described in and.second,assuming that it does,we must determine whether the rights asserted under state law are equivalent to the rights contained in,which articulates the exclusive rights of copyright holders.
this court held that a claim under the california right of publicity statute,cal.civil code,based on an allegedly unauthorized publication of a musical recording was preempted by the copyright act.the court noted that section of the act extends copyright protection to original works or authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be reproduced,and that a work is fixed in a tangible medium when its embodiment in a copy or phono record,by or under the authority of the author,is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.id.at quoting.
laws was a recording artist who had entered into a recording agreement with elektra records to produce master recordings of her vocal performances for elektra.the agreement gave elektra sole and exclusive right to copyright such master recordings.id.at.elektra granted sony a nonexclusive license to use a sample of one of laws recordings in a sony recording by jennifer lopez and ll cool laws sued sony claiming that the use of her voice on the sony recording was a misappropriation of her right of publicity under california civil code a.we applied the two part test and found that laws master recordings were plainly original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression capable of reproduction.thus,the master recordings were within the subject matter of copyright.id.at.
despite that obvious conclusion,laws argued that the subject matter of a copyright claim and a right of publicity claim are substantively different because the copyright claim protects ownership rights to a work of art,while a right of publicity claim concerns the right to protect one persona and likeness.thus,laws contended unsuccessfully that her right of publicity claim was based on an unauthorized duplication of her vocal performance,not the duplication of the master recording itself.id.at.
gasper makes the same contention in the instant case,arguing that the kaytel defendants misappropriated his name and persona,in addition to his dramatic performance.we reject this argument for the same reason we rejected it in laws.
although california law recognizes an ascertainable interest in the publicity associated with one voice,we think it is clear that federal copyright law preempts a claim alleging misappropriation of one voice when the entirety of the allegedly misappropriated vocal performance is contained within a copyrighted medium.
gasper claim that the kaytel defendants misappropriated his name and persona is based entirely on the misappropriation of the dvds and gasper performance therein.indeed,the complaint alleged that defendants have wilfully and systematically infringed plaintiffs copyrights and rights or publicity directly and by assignment by the repeated unauthorized reproduction,counterfeiting,and sale of such counterfeit copies of plaintiffs copyrighted works to third parties.in the amended conference order gasper again listed the evidence in support of his right of publicity claim as gasper name,likeness,photograph and voice appear in the counterfeit gasper films without his authorization.thus,throughout the litigation gasper has claimed that the factual basis of his right of publicity claim was the unauthorized reproduction of his performance on the dvds.
on appeal he now argues,apparently for the first time,that it is the use of his name and likeness on the covers of the counterfeit dvds that violated his right of publicity.but gasper face appears nowhere on any of the dvd covers,and whether his persona appears in the form of some other part of his anatomy is unknown.what is known from the exhibits introduced at trial is that the pictures on the covers of the dvds are still shots of the copyrighted video performance.thus,gasper argument that his right of publicity was violated by defendants reproduction of the covers is misguided 
in the district court,the kaytel defendants relied on fleet cbs,a case we cited with approval in laws.in fleet the court rejected claims very similar to those gasper asserts in the instant case 
in this case we are asked to decide a very narrow issue whether an actor may bring an action for misappropriation of his or her name,image,likeness or identity under section of the civil code when the only alleged exploitation occurred through the distribution of the actor performance in a motion picture.the trial court concluded that to the extent california law would permit such a claim,it was preempted by federal copyright law.we agree with the trial court and affirm.
in rejecting the kaytel defendants position,the district court relied on knb enters.matthews,which read fleet narrowly and held that the right of publicity is preempted by the copyright act only when the distribution is made by the exclusive copyright holder.the knb court stated 
accordingly,we would limit fleet broad language regarding preemption of the actors section claims to the unique facts of that case.in our view,a section claim is preempted under fleet where an actor or model with no copyright interest in the work seeks to prevent the exclusive copyright holder from displaying the copyrighted work.we do not believe a section claims is preempted under fleet where,as here,the defendant has no legal right to publish the copyrighted work.
because the kaytel defendants had no legal right to distribute the dvds the district court concluded that defendants did not have federal rights which could preempt plaintiffs state law rights.thus plaintiffs state law claims are not preempted by federal copyright law.
we do not read fleet or the copyright act so narrowly.whether a claim is preempted under section does not turn on what rights the alleged infringer possesses,but on whether the rights asserted by the plaintiff are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of the copyright.the question is whether the rights are works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of the copyright act.if a plaintiff asserts a claim that is the equivalent of a claim for infringement of a copyrightable work,that claim is preempted,regardless of what legal rights the defendant might have acquired.
in the instant case,we conclude that gasper right of publicity claim falls within the subject matter of copyright,and that the rights he asserts are equivalent to the rights within the scope of of the copyright act.the essence of gasper claim is that the kaytel defendants reproduced and distributed the dvds without authorization.his claim is under the copyright act.accordingly,we reverse the district court and vacate gasper judgment against the kaytel defendants for violation of his right of publicity under california law 
after the jury returned its verdict in favor of plaintiffs on their copyright infringement claim,the district court granted defendants motion jmol.the court held that because gasper was employed by jjv,the motion picture works were works for hire under the copyright act.therefore,jjv,not gasper,was the author of the works and gasper lacked standing.the court implicitly held that jjv lacked standing because the registration was invalid.plaintiffs have appealed that decision,arguing that it is both legally erroneous,inequitable and illogical given that only gasper or jjv could possibly own the copyrights and both were plaintiffs in the action.we agree.
a district court can set aside a jury verdict and grant jmol only if,under governing law,there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict and only if there is no legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.winarto toshiba am.elecs.components,cir citations and quotations omitted.we review de novo whether the films were works for hire.aymes bonelli,cir.
the copyright act,defines a work made for hire as 
a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment or 
a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work,as part of a motion picture or other audio visual work,as a translation,as a supplementary work,as a compilation,as an instructional text,as a test,as answer material for a test,or as an atlas,if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the works shall be considered a work made for hire.
the district court correctly concluded that the films could not be considered works for hire under because there was no written instrument.thus,if gasper creative work was performed as an independent contractor,he would be considered the author.
it was undisputed,however,that gasper was an employee of jjv,at least for some purposes,leaving the question of whether his creative work was within the scope of his employment.the district court concluded that it was rejecting as concocted at trial gasper testimony that he always intended that his creative work be kept separate from his work for jjv and that he would have ownership of the copyrights.the court made its own factual findings that jjv intended he would hold the camera,light the set,write the screenplay,produce and direct.
the problem with the district court analysis is that jjv was a shop.gasper was the sole officer,director,and shareholder of jjv,exercised complete control over it,and made all decisions concerning jjv and production of the films.it was all gasper all the time.jjv as employer and gasper as employee could certainly agree as to the scope of the employee employment,and could agree that gasper should retain all copyrights.since jjv was gasper,jjv intended whatever gasper intended,and if gasper intended that his creative work be outside the scope of his employment with jjv,there was no one to disagree.see,m a,vcx,sole shareholder,director and officer of corporation that produced film was owner of the copyright.
perhaps more importantly,even if the films were works for hire,the district court was correct that gasper simply made a mistake in listing himself as the author on the copyright registration forms.that mistake does not constitute a basis to invalidate the copyright.i nadvertent mistakes on registration certificates do not invalidate a copyright and thus do not bar infringement actions,unless the alleged infringer has relied to its detriment on the mistake,or the claimant intended to defraud the copyright office by making the misstatement.lamps plus,seattle lighting fixture,cir quoting urantia found.maaherra,cir.
defendants obviously did not rely on the mistake if there was one to their detriment.the evidence presented demonstrates that they pirated the dvds without a care to whether the dvds were copyrighted and,if so,who owned the copyright.nor did gasper or jjv ever intend to defraud the copyright office.the typical work for hire dispute involves a disagreement between the commissioning party or employer and the commissioned party or employee over who owns the copyright.see,cmty.for creative reed.in the instant case,the only two parties with any possible claim to ownership,jjv and gasper,both believed and intended that gasper own the copyright.
indeed,there was no need to defraud anyone with respect to ownership.if gasper had really believed that jjv owned the copyright,as defendants argue on appeal,he had no need to lie on the registration forms.if he knew that jjv was the owner and wanted to own them himself,he needed only to transfer them to himself from jjv.copyrights,like any other property right,can be transferred by any means of conveyance.d.a simple written note or memorandum of transfer signed by himself on behalf of jjv would have been sufficient,a,and an earlier oral assignment can be confirmed later in a writing.teeth,novelty,cir.corporations can not literally discuss anything.id.only gasper could have had discussions on behalf of jjv,and he consistently testified that he and jjv intended that he be the owner of the copyrights.if,as defendants argue,he honestly knew that he had not effectively achieved ownership,he could have at anytime simply memorialized that intent in writing.he had no reason to defraud the copyright office or concoct a story for purposes of this litigation.
thus,had gasper testimony been sufficient to support an oral agreement between jjv and himself that any copyright technically owned by jjv was to be conveyed to him,defendants would have had no standing to complain that the agreement was never put in writing.section a is designed to resolve disputes between owners and transferees and to protect copyright holders from persons mistakenly or fraudulently claiming oral licenses or copyright ownership.teeth.at.when there is no dispute between the copyright owner and transferee,it would be unusual and unwarranted to permit a infringer to invoke a to avoid suit for copyright infringement.id.quoting imperial residential designs,palms dev.group,cir.
although is not a statute of frauds section as is,the reasoning of imperial residential designs is nonetheless applicable.as noted above,is designed to establish ownership of a work as between a commissioning party or employer on the one hand and the commissioned party or employee on the other.it would be unusual and unwarranted to permit third parties such as the instant defendants to invoke to avoid a suit for infringement when there is no dispute between the two potential owners,and both are plaintiffs to the lawsuit.accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that the motion picture
