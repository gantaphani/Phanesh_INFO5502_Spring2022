introduction 
from the until,defendant and respondent the pampered chef,purchased a kitchen device known as the tartmaster from plaintiff and appellant kitchen connection.in about,pampered chef learned that the patents on the tartmaster design had expired,and it began sourcing copies of the tartmaster which it called the from defendants and respondents good things international,and ten mark corporation.kitchen connection discovered no later than that pampered chef was sourcing tartmaster copies,but it waited nearly years,until,to file the present suit for trade dress infringement,unfair competition,and false advertising.
plaintiffs trade dress claims were presented to a jury.after both sides presented their evidence,the trial court granted a directed verdict for defendants,concluding that the claims were barred by laches and the statute of limitations as a matter of law.then,sitting without a jury,the court further found for defendants on the unfair competition and false advertising claims.subsequently,it denied defendants motions for attorney fees.
plaintiffs appeal the judgment for defendants,and defendants good things and ten mark appeal the denial of their motions for attorney fees.we find no error,and we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
i.the parties 
appellant kitchen connection is an illinois corporation that manufactures and sells kitchen utensils.appellant ursula kaiser kaiser is the founder and sole shareholder of kitchen connection.appellant magic kitchen llc is a california limited liability company that kaiser formed in december,shortly before filing this action.
respondent the pampered chef is an company that sells kitchen tools through home parties.respondents goods things international and ten mark corporation are taiwanese corporations that source products for overseas companies,including pampered chef.
ii.pampered chef purchase of tartmasters from kitchen connection 
doris and jay christopher formed pampered chef in.from the until,pampered chef purchased a variety of kitchen products from kitchen connection.one such product was the tartmaster,a metal device used to cut and crimp the edges of dough and bread to make tarts and crustless sandwiches.pampered chef purchased tartmasters from kitchen connection in two sizes and.pampered chef also purchased from kitchen connection a cookbook kaiser authored called pasta,pies,and pastries tart recipes from around the world,which described recipes that could be made using the tartmaster.the cookbook back cover showed easy steps for making pasta,pies,and pastries using the tartmaster fill,cut n seal,and cook.
pampered chef sold tartmasters to consumers in plastic bags labeled the pampered chef tartmaster.kitchen connection never required pampered chef to identify the tartmaster as a kitchen connection product,and pampered chef apparently never did so.
iii.pampered chef sourcing of the from good things and ten mark 
in about,pampered chef learned that the patent for the tartmaster design had expired and the design was in the public domain.subsequently,in early,pampered chef stopped buying tartmasters from kitchen connection.at about the same time,it began sourcing and versions of the product,which it called the,from good things and ten mark in taiwan.the had the same basic design as the tartmaster,but was made of stainless steel and used a different spring.additionally,each was imprinted with the words and the pampered chef.pampered chef sold under the same product numbers it formerly had used with the and tartmasters.
in july,kaiser discovered that pampered chef was having copies of the tartmaster made in asia.on july,she sent a letter to doris christopher saying that she was surprised to see that you are carrying both the inch and the inch tartmaster,as well as shaped pancake molds that pampered chef formerly had purchased from kitchen connection.in the letter,kaiser asserted patent rights to the pancake molds and warned that pampered chef sale of those products was actionable patent infringement.however,she did not claim any intellectual property rights to the tartmaster.
between and,pampered chef made a substantial investment in the,which included traveling to asia,promoting the product,and developing recipes for its use.in the late,pampered chef developed and marketed a three and a version of the,and it subsequently stopped selling the and versions.
when the inch was introduced in,the product and its use and care instructions were marked patent pending.no patent application was ever filed,however,and the patent pending designation was removed from the in and from the use and care instructions in or.after that time,pampered chef affixed a sticker stating no patent pending are issued for this product on erroneously marked products that remained in stock.
iv.the present action 
plaintiffs filed the present action in january.the operative first amended complaint,filed may,alleged eight causes of action unfair competition in violation of business and professions code section section first cause of action false advertising in violation of business and professions code section section second cause of action trade dress infringement in violation of section of the lanham act third and fourth causes of action unfair competition and false advertising in violation of united states code section fifth cause of action conspiracy to commit fraud sixth cause of action conspiracy to interfere with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage seventh cause of action and unjust enrichment eighth cause of action.
plaintiffs primary factual allegation,on which all eight causes of action were based,was that the infringed the tartmaster trade dress.plaintiffs also alleged that defendants committed unfair trade practices and false advertising by transacting business in california without obtaining a certificate of qualification from the secretary of state and by imprinting the inch pat.pending,even though it never applied for a patent for that product.plaintiffs sought injunctive and other equitable relief,profits,damages,and costs in the amount to be proved at trial and exemplary damages.
plaintiffs dismissed the sixth and seventh causes of action without prejudice prior to trial.they dismissed the fifth cause of action immediately prior to opening statements.
v.the trials and judgment 
a.the jury trial 
the parties tried plaintiffs remaining causes of action over court days between may and august.in the first phase of the trial,the parties tried to a jury the third and fourth causes of action for trade dress infringement under the lanham act and the eighth cause of action for unjust enrichment.in the second phase of the trial,the parties tried to the court the first cause of action for violation of section and the second cause of action for violation of section.
at the close of plaintiffs case before the jury,defendants filed motions for nonsuit.good things and ten mark sought nonsuit on the third,fourth,and eighth causes of action on the grounds that they were barred by the statute of limitations and laches.pampered chef sought nonsuit on the third and fourth causes of action on the ground that plaintiffs failed to establish essential elements of trade dress infringement and lacked standing.each defendant joined,to the extent applicable,in the motions for nonsuit made by the other.
the court deferred ruling on the nonsuit motions.at the conclusion of testimony,the defendants renewed their motions for nonsuit and,in the alternative,also sought a directed verdict.the court heard argument and then granted the motions for nonsuit or,in the alternative,for directed verdict on the third,fourth,and eighth causes of action.
with regard to the statute of limitations and laches,the court concluded it was undisputed that defendants began manufacturing and distributing and in,and that ursula kaiser became aware of those activities no later than july.the court further found it undisputed that defendants began manufacturing and selling three and a in,and that the three and a was identical to the and versions except for its size.
the court found that under ninth circuit case law,a claim is presumed to be barred by laches if any part of the alleged wrongful conduct occurred outside the applicable limitations period.here,the court said,the limitations period was three years.thus,because plaintiffs waited years to file than three times the limitations failed to offer a legitimate excuse for their lengthy delay,their claims presumptively were barred by laches.
furthermore,the court said,there was undisputed evidence of prejudice.although doris christopher conceded she could not specifically quantify pampered chef development costs,she testified that there were significant costs associated with contacting and developing relationships with manufacturers,traveling to taiwan,creating molds and promotional materials,printing catalogs,and producing.moreover,there was evidence that pampered chef had purchased millions of from good things.the court stated that shows a substantial investment in time in the manufacture of the devices,the,and later inch,and a substantial investment of cost with respect to the cost of goods sold and a substantial investment in capital for producing those units as well as substantial investment in marketing and advertising.those numbers speak for themselves with regard to substantial prejudice in waiting ten years to bring the lawsuit.
finally,the court rejected plaintiffs contention that there were triable issues of fact regarding defendants alleged unclean hands.the court found that defendants had admitted copying plaintiffs product,but said that the act of copying which defendants have acknowledged is not sufficient in and of itself to show unclean hands.instead,t here has to be willfulness and the intentional infringement on the rights,and that is a knowing infringement on the rights.here,the court said,there was no evidence of knowing infringement.it explained t he evidence with regard to this is that plaintiff has not met any burden to establish a prima facie case that defendants knowingly intended to infringe on the rights of the plaintiffs.doris christopher testified that she understood that her company had the right to produce the and that she had made changes in it to make it stainless steel and that after she started manufacturing it,then she also found out that the plaintiff did have any patent rights in it in any event.however,there is no evidence to support a claim that the defendants intentionally with knowledge of the plaintiffs rights intended to infringe on the trade dress.
thus,the court concluded t he claims in the third and fourth causes of action are beyond the statute of limitations period and beyond any laches period because it has been shown that there is unreasonable delay of ten years in bringing the lawsuit,that the delay has been prejudicial to the defendants,and that the plaintiff has not demonstrated any unclean hands on the part of the defendants to negate the implications of the statute of limitations and laches.
the court also addressed the asserted untimeliness of the eighth cause of action for unjust enrichment,which was asserted against good things and ten mark only.the court explained that the eighth cause of action essentially duplicated the third and fourth causes of action and thus was also barred by laches.additionally,the court found that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate either a direct relationship between the plaintiffs and these defendants or a direct benefit conveyed by the plaintiffs to these defendants 
b.the court trial 
in the second phase of trial,the parties tried to the court the first and second causes of action for unfair competition and false advertising under sections and.after plaintiffs rested,defendants made a motion for judgment.the court deferred ruling and heard additional evidence.after defendants rested,the court entered judgment for defendants on both causes of action.we discuss the trial court analysis of these causes of action in detail in part ii,post.
entry of judgment 
the court entered judgment on september,and notice of entry of judgment was served september.the court denied plaintiffs timely motions for new trial and to vacate the judgment on november.
vi.the attorney fee motion 
defendants moved for attorney fees under the lanham act on december.plaintiffs opposed.on february,the trial court denied the motion.it explained that the lanham act permits an award of fees to the prevailing party only in exceptional cases,and that a case is exceptional for purposes of the statute when it is groundless,unreasonable,vexatious,or pursued in bad faith.in the present case,the court found,the matter was intensively,with great effort and complexity litigated and brought to trial.the court does not find that the plaintiffs claims are totally groundless or unreasonable,and the mere fact that the case had determinations based upon the statute of limitations does not mean that the case is groundless or unreasonable for the purpose of awarding attorneys fees under section sic section a,and for that reason,the court is going to deny the motions for attorneys fees.
plaintiffs timely appealed from the judgment,and good things and ten mark filed a timely from the denial of their motion for attorney fees.
discussion 
i.the trial court properly directed a verdict for defendants on the third,fourth,and eighth causes of actiona.standard of review 
a directed verdict may be granted only when,disregarding conflicting evidence,giving the evidence of the party against whom the motion is directed all the value to which it is legally entitled,and indulging every legitimate inference from such evidence in favor of that party,the court nonetheless determines there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support the claim or defense of the party opposing the motion,or a verdict in favor of that party.citations.howard owens corning th,d newing cheatham cal d.this court decides de novo whether sufficient evidence was presented to withstand a directed verdict.brassinga city of mountain view th,d.gelfo lockheed martin th,d.
third and fourth causes of action federal lanham act claims for trade dress infringement 
plaintiffs third and fourth causes of action allege trade dress infringement under section of the lanham act in connection with the and third cause of action and the three and a fourth cause of action.t rade dress refers to the total image of a product and may include features such as size,shape,color,color combinations,texture or graphics.international jensen,metrosound,cir vision sports,melville,cir.continental laboratory products,medax,d,roulo russ berrie,cir,roulo.the design of a product,as well as its packaging,both are part of its trade dress.fuji kogyo,pacific bay,cir.a seller adoption of a trade dress confusingly similar to a competitor constitutes unfair competition that is actionable under section a of the lanham act.vision sports melville,supra,at,citing blau plumbing,cir.
the purpose of trademark and trade dress protection is to enable a business to identify itself efficiently as the source of a given product through the adoption of a mark which may be in the form of a slogan,symbol,ornamental design or other visual insignia.roulo,supra,at.however,trade dress protection is not intended to create rights in innovative aspects of product design.citation.thus,trade dress protection,unlike patent law,does not foster innovation by preventing reverse engineering or copying of innovative product design features.citation.trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.citation.therefore,trade dress protection extends only to incidental,arbitrary or ornamental product features which identify the product source.citation.shire barr laboratories,cir.a mark or trade dress that is fanciful,arbitrary,or otherwise distinctive is given protection more readily than a generic or descriptive trademark or trade dress that is functional since appropriation of generic words,marks,or dress would prevent producers from accurately describing or denoting the quality or content of their goods.roulo,supra,at.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting defendants motions for directed verdict because there are triable issues of fact as to whether plaintiffs trade dress claims were timely.defendants disagree they also contend in the alternative that plaintiffs trade dress claims fail on the merits.
as a preliminary matter,we must determine whether the timeliness of plaintiffs claims should be measured by the legal defense of the statute of limitations or the equitable defense of laches.plaintiffs contend that under the law of many circuits,only laches applies to lanham act claims defendants urge that both laches and statute of limitations apply.
as applied to lanham act claims,t he proper interplay between laches and the statute of limitations is somewhat elusive.jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir,jarrow formulas,citing rest d unfair competition,com.a discussing the uncertain role of the statute of limitations for lanham act claims.although the lanham act contains no explicit statute of limitations,some federal cases hold that lanham act claims are governed by the statute of limitations applicable to analogous state law claims,karl storz endoscopy america,surgical technologies,cir,storz lanham act claims are subject to a statute of limitations which began to run upon storz actual or constructive knowledge of the wrong.other cases disagree,suggesting that since s ection a monetary relief is subject to the principles of equity,a and injunctive relief is similarly available according to the principles of equity,id.a,congress might have intended that laches be the sole timeliness bar to suit.jarrow formulas,supra,at.
federal appellate authority thus is split as to whether a statute of limitations applies to lanham act claims or whether,instead,laches is the only applicable timeliness defense.however,we need not resolve the issue.because we conclude that plaintiffs claims are barred by the equitable defense of laches,we need not decide whether they also are barred by the statute of limitations.
laches is an equitable time limitation on a party right to bring suit,resting on the maxim that equity aids the vigilant,not those who sleep on their rights.lyons partnership,morris costumes,cir,lyons see also jarrow formulas,supra,at one who seeks the help of a court of equity must not sleep on his rights.it is well established that laches is a valid defense to lanham act claims.jarrow formulas,supra,at,walt disney cir,kason industries,component hardware group,cir.
a defendant must demonstrate three elements to successfully assert a laches defense delay in asserting a right or a claim the delay was not reasonable or excusable and prejudice to the party against whom laches is asserted.miller glenn miller productions,cir,jarrow formulas,supra,at,kason industries,component hardware group,supra,at.we consider each of these three elements below.
the first element of laches is delay,as measured by the period from when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the allegedly infringing conduct,until the initiation of the lawsuit in which the defendant seeks to counterpose the laches defense.danjaq llc sony cir,danjaq llc.if a lanham act claim is filed within the analogous state limitations,no more than four years the strong presumption is that laches is inapplicable.if the claim is filed after the analogous limitations period has expired,the presumption is that laches bars the suit.see also miller glenn miller productions,supra,at lyons,supra,at hot wax turtle wax,cir,hot wax.
and.it is undisputed that plaintiffs learned that pampered chef was selling and no later than july,when ursula kaiser saw a catalog and saw that the pampered chef copied my tartmaster.because plaintiffs did not file the present action for nearly after either a or statute of limitations would have presumptively is untimely.
plaintiffs contend that although the alleged trade dress infringement began in,their claims nonetheless are timely because where a civil conspiracy is properly alleged and proved,the statute of limitations does not begin to run on any part of plaintiff s claims until the last overt act pursuant to the conspiracy has been completed.whatever the merits of this contention generally,it has no application here.plaintiffs initially pled two causes of action for commit fraud sixth cause of action and to interfere with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage seventh cause of action but dismissed them prior to trial.moreover,plaintiffs appellate briefs do not cite any evidence of a conspiracy.thus,plaintiffs can not pursue this issue on appeal.levin ligon th,d it is not the duty of a reviewing court to search the record for evidence on a point raised by a party whose brief makes no reference to the specific pages where the evidence can be found.
plaintiffs also contend that even if some of their infringement claims are untimely,they nonetheless are entitled to damages sustained within the applicable limitations period.we do not agree.under federal law,when evaluating whether laches bars a damages claim,a continuing tort is considered a single act rather than a series of separate acts.in aukerman chaides const,for example,the court rejected plaintiff contention that some of defendant alleged acts of patent infringement were not barred by laches because they occurred within the applicable limitations period.the court explained plaintiff asserts that it is improper to utilize laches as a defense to completely bar recovery of prefiling damages flowing from a continuing tort,such as patent infringement.we understand plaintiff to be arguing that,because each act of infringement is deemed a separate claim,the laches defense,like a statute of limitations,must be established separately with respect to each such act.citation.plaintiff theory conflicts with the precedent of the supreme court in which laches has been applied against continuing torts in those cases,as well as in our precedent and that of other circuits,laches has been viewed as a single defense to a continuing tort up to the time of suit,not a series of individual defenses which must be proved as to each act of infringement,at least with respect to infringing acts of the same nature.citation.to that extent,continuing tortious acts may be deemed to constitute a unitary claim.id.at.
many other federal courts have concluded similarly,jarrow formulas,supra,at,quoting danjaq llc,supra,at the presumption of laches is triggered if any part of the claimed wrongful conduct occurred beyond the limitations period.to hold otherwise would effectively swallow the rule of laches,and render it a spineless defense.research,automobile club,the automobile club also argues that laches can not apply to its a claim because bridgestone trademark use of lemans is a continuing wrong for which every use is a new injury.however,when the obligation arises to assert an objection to a trademark registration,that obligation is not postponed by continued use of the trademark.hot wax,supra,at without the availability of the application of laches to a claim arising from a continuing wrong,a party could,theoretically,delay filing suit indefinitely.it would certainly be inequitable to reward this type of dilatory conduct and such conduct would necessarily warrant application of laches in appropriate circumstances.thus,if defendants alleged trade dress infringement began outside the limitations period,plaintiffs may not recover damages allegedly suffered within that period.
plaintiffs also claim that even if their lanham act claims are otherwise barred by laches,laches can not bar their claim for prospective injunctive relief.plaintiffs are correct that lyons,supra,at page,supports this proposition,but we think the better rule is articulated in other federal appellate decisions that hold that the presumption of laches is triggered if any part of the claimed wrongful conduct occurred beyond the limitations period,jarrow formulas,supra,at rejecting plaintiff contention that even if laches were otherwise applicable,it should not bar claim for prospective injunctive relief danjaq llc,supra,at district court properly applied laches to bar claim for prospective injunctive relief where the feared future infringements are identical to the alleged past infringements,monitek,cir,laches can bar recovery in trademark or tradename actions where injunctive relief is sought.thus,plaintiffs request for prospective injunctive relief does not alter our conclusion that their claims regarding the and presumptively are untimely.
three and a half inch.plaintiffs contend that even if their infringement claims are untimely as to the and versions of the,they are timely as to the three and a version because pampered chef did not introduce it until april,less than three years before this suit was filed.we do not agree.
as we have concluded,the relevant delay for laches purposes is the period from when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the allegedly infringing conduct.tillamook country smoker,tillamook county creamery d,tillamook,quoting danjaq llc,supra,at,emphasis omitted.thus,where a family of products is alleged to infringe on a competitor trademark or trade dress,courts have held that delay is measured from the time the plaintiff became aware of the conduct which it claims is infringement,not the introduction of each individual product.ibid.
in tillamook,supra,d,the defendant began using its allegedly infringing trade name more than years before plaintiff filed suit.defendant claimed that plaintiff suit was barred by laches plaintiff contended that the delay period for laches purposes began just five years before suit was filed,when defendant began using its trade name in connection with a particular package design.id.at.the court rejected plaintiff analysis and held the suit barred by laches.it explained that when evaluating the timeliness of an infringement claim,the relevant delay is the period during which the plaintiff knew about the conduct that forms the crux of its infringement claim.id.at.because the crux of plaintiff infringement claim was defendant use of the trade name tillamook country smoker,not its use of a particular package design,its claim effectively is the same trademark infringement case it had well over ten years ago and,hence,was barred by laches.id.at see also deere mtd holdings wl.
in the present case,the crux of plaintiffs infringement claim is the design of the plaintiffs contend slavishly copied the tartmaster the product size.it was undisputed at trial that the design of the three and a was the same as its and predecessors.indeed,kaiser herself conceded that the three and a had the same design as the and versions and that there is no difference between the and three and a.accordingly,since the size is irrelevant to plaintiffs trade dress claim,the claim as to the three and a effectively is the same infringement case it had years ago.tillamook,supra,d at.thus,it too presumptively is barred by laches.
reasonableness of the delay 
the next element of laches is the reasonableness of the delay.delay has been held permissible,among other reasons,when it is necessitated by the exhaustion of remedies through the administrative process,citation when it is used to evaluate and prepare a complicated claim,citation and when its purpose is to determine whether the scope of proposed infringement will justify the cost of litigation,citation.by contrast,delay is impermissible when its purpose is to capitalize on the value of the alleged infringer labor,by determining whether the infringing conduct will be profitable.danjaq llc,supra,at.
here,plaintiffs have presented no legally sufficient justification for their delay.their only claims in this regard are that pampered chef was put on notice as early as july,that kitchen connection considered the knockoff product to be violative of its rights and that pampered chef and kitchen connection had already been litigating claims against each other for at least six years.plaintiffs suggest no reason why litigating other matters or putting pampered chef on notice that they considered its conduct improper should justify delay in litigating this matter,nor do they cite any authority for the proposition that other litigation between the parties is relevant to the reasonableness of delay.accordingly,we find that the trial court properly concluded that plaintiffs delay was unreasonable as a matter of law.
prejudice to defendants 
the final element of laches is prejudice.a defendant has been prejudiced by a delay when the assertion of a claim available some time ago would be inequitable in light of the delay in bringing that claim and ensues when a defendant has changed his position in a way that would not have occurred if the plaintiff had not delayed.hot wax,supra,at see also danjaq llc,supra,at a defendant may demonstrate prejudice by showing that it took actions or suffered consequences that it would not have,had the plaintiff brought suit promptly.
plaintiffs opening brief asserts in an argument heading that defendants were not prejudiced by the nearly delay in bringing the present suit,but it neither makes an argument nor cites any authority in support.the contention therefore is waived,moulton niguel water dist.colombo th,d moulton contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority badie bank of america th,d badie when an appellant fails to raise a point,or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority,we treat the point as waived.the waiver is not cured by argument and citations in plaintiffs reply brief it is elementary that points raised for the first time in a reply brief are not considered by the court.levin ligon,supra,th at,d see also campos anderson th,fn,d same.
even if we did not deem plaintiffs no prejudice argument waived,we nonetheless would reject it.courts have found prejudice sufficient to support a finding of laches where,as a result of a plaintiff delay in bringing suit,a defendant has invested resources in developing and marketing a product.in hot wax,supra,the plaintiff,a car wax manufacturer,sued a competitor for misrepresenting the qualities of its competing car wax product.the district court entered summary judgment for the defendant,concluding that laches barred plaintiff claim.id.at.the appellate court affirmed,finding clear prejudice to defendant.it explained hot wax permitted turtle wax advertising and the development of its products to go unchecked for well over a ten to period.during this time,hot wax sat idly by and chose not to challenge turtle wax use of the term wax with respect to its products,and turtle wax invested significant amounts of time and money in product development and advertising had hot wax successfully pressed its claims in a timely manner,turtle wax certainly could have invested its time and money in other areas or simply renamed its products.accordingly,in light of the extreme length of the unreasonable delay by hot wax,we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that turtle wax was prejudiced by this delay.id.at,fn.omitted.
the court reached a similar conclusion in jarrow formulas,supra.there,a supplier of nutritional supplements waited seven years to sue a competitor for allegedly making false claims about its product.id.at.the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment,concluding that the plaintiff claims were barred by laches as a matter of law.id.at.the ninth circuit affirmed.it concluded that the defendants had demonstrated prejudice as a matter of law nutrition now has invested enormous resources in tying identity to the challenged claims.after waiting for several years,jarrow now seeks to compel nutrition now to abandon its presentation of,forcing it to adopt a materially different characterization of its product.if jarrow had filed suit sooner,nutrition now could have invested its resources in shaping an alternative identity for in the minds of the public.citations.id.at see also conopco,campbell soup cir,finding prejudice because defendant could have chosen an alternative marketing position if the plaintiff had filed suit earlier.
in the present case,the trial court found the evidence undisputed that defendants were prejudiced by plaintiffs delay in bringing suit.we agree.the undisputed evidence establishes
