we granted review to decide whether the court of appeal properly dismissed as untimely an appeal from an order denying class certification.in dismissing,the court of appeal concluded the notice of appeal was untimely because certain documents the superior court had mailed to the parties to inform them of its order satisfied rule a of the california rules of court and,thus,commenced the period specified in the rule for filing a notice of appeal.we hold,to the contrary,that the documents in question did not satisfy the rule and that the notice was timely filed.
background 
plaintiff and appellant keith alan filed this action against defendant and respondent american honda motor,honda.alan alleged that honda,beginning in the,sold vehicles with timing belts that required costly,periodic replacement to prevent catastrophic engine,power steering and power brake failure,but prevented buyers from learning about the required maintenance through various misrepresentations and omissions.alan purported to sue on behalf of all past and present owners of vehicles manufactured by honda with timing belts,including certain acura vehicles.he attempted to state claims under the unfair competition and false advertising laws bus,et,et as well as the consumers legal remedies act,et.
during pretrial discovery,the superior court concluded the proposed class was unmanageably large and invited the parties to limit the case to specific vehicle models and model years.the court invitation led to a stipulated order that,while the case was pending,the statute of limitations would be tolled for all claims concerning vehicles other than acura integras manufactured from to.alan subsequently moved to certify a nationwide class consisting of all individuals who now own,or have ever owned,any one or more of the subject vehicles a term defined in the operative complaint as all vehicles made by honda with timing belts.the superior court denied the motion,reasoning that common issues did not predominate because each purported class member would need to offer individual proof of detrimental reliance on the alleged misrepresentations and omissions in order to obtain damages.
the ultimate question before us is whether alan timely filed his notice of appeal from the superior court order denying class certification.the matter is governed by rule a,which provides as follows unless a statute or rule provides otherwise,a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of days after the superior court clerk mails the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled notice of entry of judgment or a copy of the judgment,showing the date either was mailed days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled notice of entry of judgment or a copy of the judgment,accompanied by proof of service or days after entry of judgment.the term judgment,for purposes of rule a,includes an appealable order.rule f.
timeliness is at issue in this case because of the idiosyncratic manner in which the superior court informed the parties of its order denying class certification.on january,the superior court clerk mailed to the parties in a single envelope two documents,neither of which unambiguously satisfied rule a.the first document mailed by the clerk is entitled statement of decision re alan motion for class certification,and sets out the court reasons for denying the motion.the statement of decision bears the superior court file stamp and concludes with the sentence,alan motion for class certification is denied.the second document mailed by the clerk,a minute order,is entitled ruling on submitted for class certification.the order states,the court,having heard argument in this motion,and read and considered the papers,now issues its statement of decision re alan motion for class certification this date.copies of this minute order and the statement of decision are sent via mail on january,to counsel of record in envelopes addressed as follows.the names and addresses of counsel of record follow.in the margin at the bottom of the page is the notation,page of.the minute order bears the typed or printed notation,minutes entered county clerk,but is not.the parties disagree on whether these documents satisfied rule a.honda contends they did.alan maintains they did not.
on january,days after the superior court clerk mailed the documents just described,honda filed and served on alan a document entitled notice of entry of order and statement of decision denying class certification,attaching copies of the january minute order and statement of decision.the parties agree that honda notice of entry satisfied rule a.
alan filed his notice of appeal on march,days after the superior court mailed to the parties copies of its statement of decision and minute order,and days after honda mailed its own notice of entry of the court ruling.accordingly,if the documents mailed by the superior court clerk satisfied rule a,then alan notice of appeal was late.alternatively,if those documents did not satisfy that rule,then rule a governs and alan notice was timely.
honda moved to dismiss alan appeal on the ground that rule a governed and that his notice of appeal was therefore untimely.the court of appeal granted the motion and thus did not reach the merits of the appeal.in its opinion explaining the dismissal,the court addressed two issues.first,the court held the superior court order denying the motion for class certification was immediately appealable under the death knell doctrine because it had the effect of dismissing the action as to all members of the purported class other than the plaintiff.richmond dart industries,cal d,daar yellow cab cal d,stephen enterprise d,d.the court rejected alan arguments to the contrary.second,the court concluded alan notice of appeal was indeed untimely.on this point,alan argued that neither of the alternative documents required by rule a neither a document entitled notice of entry ibid.nor a copy of the judgment existed.rejecting alan argument,the court reasoned that the minute order could be read together with the statement of decision to satisfy the rule.in the court words,t he january,order showed the date it was mailed,and included a copy of a statement of decision signed by the trial court.the court also rejected alan further argument that rule a,both in its plain language and as explained by the advisory committee,requires a single document that satisfies all of the rule conditions without reference to other documents.
in his petition for review,alan raised both of the points the court of appeal addressed in its opinion.in granting review,however,we limited t he issue to be briefed and argued to whether the statement of decision and minute order dated january,trigger the period within which to notice an appeal under california rules of court,rule a.we thus do not review the court of appeal conclusion that the order denying class certification was immediately appealable.
ii.discussion 
rule a,which prescribes how a superior court clerk properly gives notice of a judgment or appealable order,has a limited function in california appellate procedure.in most cases,the rule does not apply because the code of civil procedure requires not the clerk but the party submitting an order or judgment for entry to mail notice of entry.code civ,subd.a,italics added.parties give notice not under rule a,but under rule a,as did honda in the case before us.the clerk is required to give notice only in designated family law matters code civ,subd.a rule,in cases in which a prevailing party is not represented by counsel code civ,subd.b,and upon specific order of the court,subd.d.the clerk was required to give notice in this case only because the court had so ordered in taking the motion for class certification under submission.in those family law proceedings in which the clerk must always give notice,rule requires the clerk to use a judicial council form specifically drafted to ensure compliance with rule a.obviously,problems are more likely to occur when no approved form of notice is available.
this case,in which no approved form of notice was ava
