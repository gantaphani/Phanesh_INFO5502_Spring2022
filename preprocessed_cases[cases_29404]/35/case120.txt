ii.background 
nam designs and manufacturers physiotherapeutic spinal devices,commonly known as traction devices,which are used,for example,to treat lower back pain.adagen is an authorized distributor of nam devices.axiom,a competitor of nam,manufacturers a physiotherapeutic device known generally as the drx.gibson and exharhos are,respectively,the president and vice president of axiom.in the present lawsuit,nam and adagen allege that axiom engaged in unfair competition by infringing nam trademarks and by issuing false advertising regarding the drx.
the trademark infringement claims stem from axiom use of two of nam registered trademarks the terms and idd therapy.axiom included these terms on its website within meta tags although axiom website never displayed nam trademarked terms to visitors and never mentioned nam or nam products,axiom nonetheless included the terms within its meta tags to influence internet search engines.for instance,evidence in this case indicated that,before axiom removed these meta tags from its website,if a computer user entered the trademarked terms into google internet search engine,google listed axiom website as the second most relevant search result.in addition,google provided the searcher with a brief description of axiom website,and the description included these terms and highlighted them 
the false advertising claims stem from certain statements that axiom made about its product,the drx.in particular,two representations by axiom are relevant to this appeal first,axiom represented in various ways that an affiliation exists between nasa and axiom or between nasa and the drx.second,axiom asserted in advertisements that the drx is fda approved.
the district court issued a preliminary injunction in favor of nam and adagen,prohibiting axiom from using nam trademarks within meta tags and prohibiting axiom from making the challenged statements about the drx.among other things,the district court specifically found that axiom use of nam trademarks created a likelihood of confusion,and the court also found that axiom advertising statements are literally false and material to consumers purchasing decisions.
iii.discussion 
at the outset,we note that a district court may grant a preliminary injunction only if the movant establishes the following a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying case,the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,the harm suffered by the movant in the absence of an injunction would exceed the harm suffered by the opposing party if the injunction issued,and an injunction would not disserve the public interest.johnson johnson,at.axiom challenges the district court order on multiple grounds.first,axiom argues that nam and adagen failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their trademark infringement claims.specifically,axiom urges that its use of nam trademarks in invisible meta tags is not a use in commerce and does not create a likelihood of confusion.second,axiom argues that nam and adagen also failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their false advertising claims.specifically,axiom asserts that its advertising statements are not literally false and are not material to consumers purchasing decisions.third and finally,axiom argues that,even assuming nam and adagen are likely to succeed on the merits of these unfair competition claims,the district court erred by categorically presuming that any plaintiff with a viable unfair competition claim will always suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.we address each point in turn.
likelihood of success on the merits of the trademark infringement claims 
because axiom use of nam trademarks constitutes a use in commerce in connection with the advertisement of goods,and because the district court did not clearly err in its factual finding that a likelihood of confusion exists,nam and adagen demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their trademark infringement claims.regarding trademark infringement,the lanham act provides,in relevant part,as follows 
any person who shall,without the consent of the registrant 
a use in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive 
shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided.
a.to prevail on a claim of trademark infringement in this case,plaintiffs must establish that they possess a valid mark,that the defendants used the mark,that the defendants use of the mark occurred in commerce,that the defendants used the mark in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods,and that the defendants used the mark in a manner likely to confuse consumers.see contacts,cir people for ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir.
axiom does not challenge the validity of nam marks,nor does axiom dispute that its use of nam trademarks affects interstate commerce thus,although axiom purports to challenge whether its placing of nam trademarks in its meta tags is a use in commerce and whether such use is likely to confuse consumers,axiom arguments actually focus only on the second,fourth,and fifth elements.moreover,because axiom separates its use challenge from its likelihood of confusion challenge,we first address the second and fourth elements together,whether there was a use in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods,and we then address the fifth element,whether such use was in a manner likely to confuse consumers.
use in commerce in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods 
axiom briefly argues that placing a competitor trademarks within meta tags,which consumers never view,does not constitute a use as required to find trademark infringement under the lanham act.however,we readily conclude that the facts of the instant case do involve a use as contemplated in the lanham is,a use in connection with the sale or advertisement of goods.in deciding whether axiom has made an infringing use,we focus on the plain language of a,which,as noted above,requires a use in commerce of a registered mark in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods.a.the facts of the instant case are absolutely clear that axiom used nam two trademarks as meta tags as part of its effort to promote and advertise its products on the internet.under the plain meaning of the language of the statute,such use constitutes a use in commerce in connection with the advertising of any goods.accordingly,we readily conclude that plaintiffs in this case have satisfied that they possessed a valid mark,that the defendant used the mark,that the defendant use of the mark occurred in commerce,and that the defendant used the mark in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods.
in an effort to avoid the foregoing plain meaning of the statutory language,axiom places its sole reliance on the second circuit contacts case.in that case,whenever a consumer who had installed the defendant computer program clicked on or searched for the plaintiff website address,the program generated on the consumer screen not only the website sought,plaintiff,but also a second window displaying ads for the defendant alternative,competing products.at.the second circuit ultimately held,as a matter of law,that such use of the web address is not a use in commerce.id.at.
in so holding,the second circuit emphasized that the defendant did not use plaintiff trademark,but rather used its website address,which differed slightly from the mark.id.at.indeed,the court explicitly declined to express an opinion on the appropriate result if defendant had in fact used plaintiff trademark.id.at.even more crucial to the second circuit holding,the court emphasized repeatedly the fact that the defendant never caused plaintiff trademarks to be displayed to a consumer.id.at.the court explained that the defendant used plaintiff web address merely in the internal directory of its proprietary software,which was inaccessible to both the and the general public.id.at.explaining the significance of the fact that the defendant never caused plaintiff trademark to be displayed to the consumer,the court stated that defendant use of plaintiff website address in the directory does not create a possibility of visual confusion with mark.id.
in rejecting axiom invitation to rely on contacts,we initially note that the above two key facts are not present in the case before us.first,unlike the defendant in contacts,axiom in the instant case did use nam two trademarks in its meta tags it did not merely use nam unprotected website address.second,and again unlike in contacts,the in this case did cause plaintiff trademark to be displayed to the consumer in the search results description of defendant site thus,the facts of the instant case stand in stark contrast to those in contacts,and axiom reliance on the second circuit opinion is therefore misplaced.
furthermore,to the extent the contacts court based its use analysis on the fact that the defendant did not display the plaintiff trademark,we think the second circuit analysis is questionable.although we believe that the absence of such a display is relevant in deciding whether there is a likelihood of confusion,we believe that,when the analysis separates the element of likelihood of confusion from the other elements,this fact is not relevant in deciding whether there is a use in commerce in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods.because the second circuit did separate its analysis in this manner,and did purport not to address the likelihood of confusion issue,see id.at,its reliance on the fact that there was no display of the plaintiff trademark and thus no possibility of confusion undermines the persuasiveness of its analysis of the separate elements of use in commerce in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods.
in sum,we conclude that axiom reliance on the second circuit decision in contacts is misplaced we conclude that the plain meaning of the statutory language clearly indicates that axiom use of nam trademarks as meta tags constitutes a use in commerce in connection with the sale or advertising of any goods under the facts of this case.thus,we turn to the fifth,and final,element that plaintiffs must such use was likely to cause confusion.
likelihood of confusion 
the district court finding that a likelihood of confusion exists is not clearly erroneous.seven factors are relevant when determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists 
the strength of the plaintiff mark the similarity between the plaintiff mark and the allegedly infringing mark the similarity between the products and services offered by the plaintiff and defendant the similarity of the sales methods the similarity of advertising methods the defendant intent,does the defendant hope to gain competitive advantage by associating his product with the plaintiff established mark and actual confusion.
alliance metals,of atlanta hinely,cir.the findings as to each factor,and as to the ultimate conclusion regarding whether or not a likelihood of confusion existed,are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.frehling,int l select group,cir.
the district court expressly acknowledged the foregoing factors,but it made an explicit finding only with respect to the ultimate conclusion that there was a likelihood of confusion.regarding that issue,axiom brief on appeal did not challenge the district court implied findings with respect to any of the subsidiary factors,the foregoing seven factors.rather,axiom challenged only the district court implied finding that axiom use of nam two trademarks as meta tags caused the internet search results at issue and the district court reliance on brookfield communications,west coast entertainment,cir,and promatek industries,equitrac,cir,with respect to the nature of meta tags and search engines.axiom argues that those opinions erroneously misled the district court to find a likelihood of confusion axiom contends that its use of the meta tags was instead analogous to a store placing its own generic brand next to a brand name product on the store shelf.because axiom has not challenged the district court implied findings with respect to the subsidiary factors,any such challenge is deemed abandoned.indeed,it is apparent that the marks are not only similar,but identical axiom meta tags precisely mimic nam idd therapy and trademarks.axiom concedes that it is a direct competitor of nam.it is also apparent that axiom intended to gain a competitive advantage by associating its product with nam trademark.finally,the litigation on appeal has proceeded on the assumption that there would be a likelihood of confusion,unless axiom arguments about the nature of meta tags and search engines,axiom challenge to brookfield and promatek prevailed.
therefore,we address axiom challenge to brookfield and promatek.in the leading case on this issue,the ninth circuit concluded that the lanham act bars a defendant from including in its meta tags a competitor trademark or confusingly similar terms.brookfield,at.accordingly,the brookfield court enjoined one online video store,west coast,from using in its meta tags the trademark and similarly confusing terms of a competing online video store,movie buff.id.at.despite its ultimate conclusion,the brookfield court conceded that even when a consumer who enters a company trademark into a search engine sees a list displaying a competitor website in addition to the trademark holder website,the consumer will often be able to find the particular website he is seeking by simply scanning the list of results.id.at.the court also acknowledged that even if the web user chooses the competitor website from the list,assuming the allegedly infringed trademark is not actually displayed by the competitor,it is difficult to say that a consumer is likely to be confused about whose site he has reached or to think that the plaintiff somehow sponsors the competitor web site.id.nevertheless,the brookfield court concluded that the competitor use of the trademark in metatags will still result in what is known as initial interest confusion.id.that is,a lthough there is no source confusion in the sense that consumers know they are patronizing the competitor rather than the plaintiff,there is nevertheless initial interest confusion in the sense that,by using the trademark to divert people looking for the plaintiff web site,the competitor improperly benefits from the good will that the plaintiff has developed in its mark.id.
in the other case relied upon by the district court,the seventh circuit faced facts similar to those in brookfield and agreed with the brookfield court analysis.promatek,at.other courts,however,have criticized various aspects of the brookfield opinion.see,contacts,at playboy,netscape commc ns,cir berzon,concurring wentworth.settlement funding llc,wl,at,see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed discussing meta tags,initial interest confusion,and criticisms of the brookfield court approach.
like the brookfield and promatek courts,we ultimately conclude that a company use in meta tags of its competitor trademarks may result in a likelihood of confusion.however,because nam and adagen have demonstrated a likelihood of actual source confusion we need not decide,as those courts did,whether initial interest confusion alone may provide a viable method of establishing a likelihood of confusion.unlike those courts,we are not faced with a situation where the trademarks are used without being displayed to consumers.
in brookfield and promatek,consumers who entered the plaintiff trademarks into a search engine saw a list displaying the competitor website in addition to the trademark holder website without any other indication from the search results that the competitor website is sponsored by the plaintiff or related to the plaintiff trademarks.in contrast,in the instant case,when consumers entered nam trademarks into a search engine,the search results not only displayed axiom competing website,but they also included a brief description of axiom website,which description included and highlighted nam trademarked terms.that is,the evidence in the instant case specifically shows that if consumers searched with google for the terms idd therapy and,the first listed result was a legitimate website sponsored by nam,the owner of these trademarks,and the second entry in the search results was axiom competing website.furthermore,and in contrast to brookfield and promatek,as noted above,the search results not only listed the competitor,axiom web address,but they also included a brief description of the axiom site,and this description included and highlighted both of nam trademarked terms,idd therapy and,in addition to axiom competing products.consumers viewing these search results would be led to believe that axiom products have the same source as the products of the owner of the idd therapy and trademarks,or at least that axiom distributed or sold all of the products to which the brief description referred,or that axiom was otherwise related to nam.this,of course,is misleading to the consumer because axiom is not related in any way to nam,nor does axiom distribute or sell the products of nam.moreover,there was nothing in axiom website itself to disabuse consumers of the notion suggested by the google search that there is some relationship between axiom and nam.in other words,if consumers accessed axiom website after viewing the google search results,they would be told all about axiom products but would be met with utter silence with respect to nam products.for example,there was no comparative advertising in axiom website which would have made clear to consumers that nam and axiom products are competing items.thus,the factual situation in the instant case is that axiom use of the meta tags caused a likelihood of actual consumer confusion as to source.
the instant case is more like playboy enterprises,netscape communications,cir,than brookfield or promatek.in playboy,the defendant,netscape,sold advertisements to competitors of playboy and then caused its search engine to pop up banner ads of its advertisers.playboy,at.the ads appeared when the typed in the search terms playboy playmate,which are trademark terms owned by playboy.id.the search engine operated in this manner by using keying words in its software.id.at.a competitor ad could be keyed to pop up in a banner ad along the margin of the search result when the searcher entered playboy playmate.id.at.thus,the keying words operated in hidden fashion,much like the meta tags in this case.because the banner ads appeared immediately after the searcher typed in the playboy trademarks,and invited the user to click here,id.at,and especially because the banner ads did not clearly identify a source,the sponsor of the ad,id.at,the user was likely to be confused regarding the sponsorship of the unlabeled advertisements.thus,the playboy case involved some actual confusion as to source,unlike the situation in brookfield where there was never any confusion as to source or affiliation.the instant case is more like playboy than brookfield.we note,however,that the source confusion in the instant case is considerably more pronounced than in playboy.in playboy,there was no explicit representation of a relationship between the source of the ad and playboy,while there is an explicit representation in this case of some relationship between axiom and nam.
judge berzon wrote a concurring opinion in playboy in which he highlighted this distinction from brookfield.id.at berzon,concurring.judge berzon criticized brookfield,arguing that it involved merely a distraction of a potential customer with another choice in a situation in which the customer was never confused as to source.id.rather,the potential customer merely was provided an opportunity for another choice,which clearly was not the sponsor of the original search.id.such distraction,judge berzon pointed out,was very much like the product placement in a department store.id.at.when a customer walks in,asks for the calvin klein section,and is directed to the second floor,no one thinks that there is a trademark infringement because the store has placed its own or another competitor clothing line in a more prominent place as a distraction.id.
because axiom use of nam trademarks as meta tags caused the google search to suggest that axiom products and nam products had the same source,or that axiom sold both lines,or that there was some other relationship between axiom and nam,axiom use of the meta tags caused a likelihood of actual source confusion.thus,the instant case is very different from the product placement in a department store.this case is also very different from brookfield where there was never source confusion.finally,the instant case is not subject to the criticism leveled by judge berzon.
for the foregoing reasons,and under the particular factual circumstances of this case,we can not conclude that the district court finding of a likelihood of confusion is clearly erroneous because the district court in this case was not clearly erroneous in finding that plaintiffs possessed valid trademarks that defendants used those marks,in commerce,in connection with the advertisement of defendant goods and that such use caused a likelihood of confusion to consumers,we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success with respect to the trademark infringement claim.
likelihood of success on the merits of the false advertising claims 
the district court did not clearly err in its factual findings that axiom representations are literally false and material to consumers purchasing decisions,and thus nam and adagen demonstrated a likelihood on success on the merits of their false advertising claims.regarding false advertising,section a of the lanham act provides,in relevant part,as follows 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
b in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
a.to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of a false advertising claim under this section,the movant must demonstrate the following the ads of the opposing party were false or misleading,the ads deceived,or had the capacity to deceive,consumers,the deception had a material effect on purchasing decisions,the misrepresented product or service affects interstate commerce,and the movant has is likely to as a result of the false advertising.johnson johnson,at.axiom only challenges the district court conclusions regarding the first and third is,whether axiom statements are literally false and whether the statements have a material effect on purchasing decisions.
literal falsity 
the district court did not clearly err when it concluded that axiom made literally false statements in its advertising first,the district court did not clearly err when it ruled that axiom claims about an affiliation with nasa are literally false.although one engineer with nasa training or experience participated in axiom development of the drx,this does not constitute a joint collaboration between nasa and axiom,nor does it support the claim that nasa engineers developed the drx or discovered part of the drx.similarly,although the drx used some components that nasa also uses,that does not mean the drx contains or embodies nasa technology.perhaps these statements could properly be characterized as misleading rather than literally false,but it is a fine line,and we will only reverse the district court if its findings are clearly erroneous.based on the entire evidence,we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court clearly erred 
second,the district court likewise did not clearly err when it ruled that axiom claims about the drx being fda approved are literally false.the drx is a class ii medical device,which is only eligible for fda clearance rather than fda approval fda approval is a separate process that applies only to class iii devices see.compare a,with c.as such,axiom statements that the drx is fda approved are literally false.in fact,fda regulations state that it is misleading and constitutes misbranding to claim fda approval when a device is merely fda cleared.see.although these regulations use the term misleading,they also describe such a misrepresentation as misbranding,and again,it is often a matter of degree whether a statement is literally false or merely misleading.based on the entire evidence,we are convinced that the district court did not clearly err in judging axiom statements literally false 
materiality to consumers purchasing decisions 
the evidence amply supports the district court conclusion that axiom statements are material to consumers purchasing decisions.even when a court finds that a defendant ads are literally false,the plaintiff,to succeed on a claim of false advertising,must still establish that the defendant deception is likely to influence the purchasing decision.johnson johnson,at quoting cashmere camel hair mfrs.inst.saks fifth,cir.the materiality requirement is based on the premise that not all deceptions affect consumer decisions.id.
the types of false claims that the district court nasa affiliation and fda would influence a doctor decision to purchase the drx over a competing machine without those qualities.these statements not only represent the quality of the device,but they provide marketing opportunities to the purchasing doctor when he or she in turn is advertising to prospective patients.in fact,after the onset of litigation against axiom,several doctors who had purchased drx sent letters to axiom expressing their dissatisfaction with the possibility that they might not be able to use axiom claims,if the claims proved untrue,to attract patients.these letters provide clear evidence that axiom representations would affect doctors decisions whether to purchase a drx.based on this and all other evidence currently in the record,the district court did not err in its conclusion that these false statements are material to consumers purchasing decisions.
presumptions of irreparable harm 
even though we hold that nam and adagen have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their trademark infringement and false advertising claims,we must still evaluate whether nam and adagen have demonstrated,with respect to each claim,that they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.in reaching its conclusion that nam and adagen satisfied this element of the preliminary injunction test,the district court relied on two presumptions,one regarding the infringement claims and one regarding the false advertising claims.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the preliminary injunction with respect to both the trademark claims and the false advertising claims.
irreparable harm in false advertising cases 
the district court erred when it presumed that nam and adagen would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction merely because axiom advertisements are literally false.the district court cited a case out of the northern district of georgia,energy four,dornier medical systems,for the following proposition in false advertising cases,p roof of falsity is sufficient to sustain a finding of irreparable injury for purposes of a preliminary injunction.this quote,however,is an incomplete statement of the law.proof of falsity is generally only sufficient to sustain a finding of irreparable injury when the false statement is made in the context of comparative advertising between the plaintiff and defendant products.see mccarthy,supra,where the challenged advertising makes a misleading comparison to a competitor product,irreparable harm is presumed.but if the false advertising is and makes no direct reference to a competitor product,irreparable harm is not presumed.internal footnotes omitted.although some cases,such as the one cited by the district court,employ language that may suggest a more expansive presumption,such quotes take the original principle out of context without explanation.
once this presumption is properly stated,it becomes evident that nam and adagen are not entitled to the presumption benefits because axiom statements,although false,do not mention nam products by name or in any way compare axiom products with nam products this is not to say that nam and adagen could not demonstrate,absent the presumption,that they will suffer irreparable harm from axiom false advertising,but the district court abused its discretion by relying solely on the presumption to find irreparable harm.accordingly,we vacate the preliminary injunction to the extent it proscribes axiom false advertising,and we remand to the district court to determine whether nam and adagen will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.
irreparable harm in trademark infringement cases 
regardless of whether nam deserves a presumption of irreparable harm on its false advertising claims,our prior cases do extend a presumption of irreparable harm once a plaintiff establishes a likelihood of success on the merits of a trademark infringement claim.our circuit has acknowledged as much on several occasions.see,coast cmty.coll,cir it is generally recognized in trademark infringement cases that there is not an adequate remedy at law to redress infringement and infringement by its nature causes irreparable harm.quoting processed plastic warner commc ns,cir mcdonald robertson,cir.
nonetheless,although established law entitles nam and adagen to this presumption in the trademark infringement context,a recent supreme court case calls into question whether courts may presume irreparable harm merely because a plaintiff in an intellectual property case has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.see generally ebay mercexchange,d.in ebay,after a jury had found patent infringement by the defendant,the district court denied the plaintiff motion for permanent injunctive relief.id.at.at.in so doing,the district court appeared to adopt certain expansive principles suggesting that injunctive relief could not issue in a broad swath of cases.id.at.at.on appeal,the federal circuit reversed the denial of injunctive relief,articulating a categorical rule that permanent injunctions shall issue once infringement is established.id.at.at.the supreme court reversed the federal circuit and admonished both the district and appellate courts for applying categorical rules to the grant or denial of injunctive relief.id.at.at.the court stressed that the patent act indicates that injunctive relief may issue only in accordance with the principles of equity.id.at.at.because the court concluded that neither court below correctly a
