appellant arizona cartridge remanufacturers association acra,an association of wholesalers that sell remanufactured printer cartridges,appeals the grant of summary judgment to lexmark on claims that lexmark engaged in deceptive and unfair business practices in violation of california law.the dispute arises from lexmark advertising of its prebate program,under which it gives purchasers an upfront discount in exchange for their agreement to return the empty cartridge to lexmark for form of restriction on reuse.acra claims that lexmark advertising and promotional materials mislead customers into thinking the restriction is enforceable and that they actually receive a discounted price for the special cartridges.we agree with the district court that acra has not offered evidence that lexmark advertisements constitute deceptive or unfair business practices and affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of lexmark.
lexmark,spun off from ibm in,makes and sells laser printers and toner printer cartridges.acra represents wholesalers that remanufacture emptied lexmark printer cartridges for reuse.before,lexmark did not compete against acra members because it sold only new replacement printer cartridges.in,however,lexmark began to remanufacture its own cartridges and launched an aggressive new strategy to improve its position in the market for remanufacturing the used cartridges.most notably,the company introduced its prebate play on the word rebate which gives consumers an upfront discount on printer cartridges.the prebate cartridges cost consumers on average dollars or percent less than a regular cartridge.in return,lexmark requires the consumer to return the depleted cartridge to lexmark or its agent.

acra filed this diversity action against lexmark in federal district court,alleging that several of the company statements regarding the terms and benefits associated with purchasing a prebate cartridge are false and violate california unfair competition laws.most important for purposes of this appeal,acra argued that lexmark deceptively suggests that the conditions placed on the outside of the prebate package create an enforceable agreement with consumers to return used cartridges.acra also contended that lexmark misleads consumers by falsely promising that they will save money when purchasing prebate cartridges,when in fact lexmark can not control the price charged by retailers.finally,acra complaint challenged lexmark use of a chip as an unfair business practice

although this case involves our consideration of important questions of patent and contract law,at its core the dispute between lexmark and acra reduces to state claims of unfair competition and misleading business practices related to lexmark advertising.the key issue here is whether lexmark misleads consumers and engages in unfair competition when it advertises cartridges for sale at a reduced price but with restrictions on their use.acra sues under two california laws that provide broad consumer protection for misleading and unfair practices by businesses.california business and professions code makes it unlawful for a business to disseminate any statement which is untrue or misleading,and which is known,or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known,to be untrue or misleading in turn,california business and professions code,et,prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by to state a cause of action under for injunctive relief requires a showing that members of the public are likely to be deceived,but does not call for a showing of a ctual deception or confusion caused by misleading statements.day v.at t,th,d.the law encompasses not just false statements but those statements which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under these sections.id.at.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the challenged advertising is false or misleading to a reasonable consumer.council against health fraud,king bio,th,d.
