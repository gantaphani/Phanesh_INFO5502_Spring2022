appellants sprint spectrum,and wirelessco,hereafter sprint,are defendants in the present class action relating to sprint practice of locking its cell phone handsets,which prevents the use of the phones on other service providers networks.sprint appeals from the trial court judgment dismissing the action pursuant to the parties settlement and awarding attorney fees to counsel for,named class plaintiffs katherine zill,william mackenzie,and linda mackenzie hereafter plaintiffs.sprint contends the trial court erred in refusing to enforce a provision in the settlement whereby the parties agreed the amount of the attorney fee award would be determined by an arbitrator,who would select an amount within a specified range.this case presents an issue of first impression did the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing to approve the fee arbitration provision,where it had already determined that the range of possible fee awards was reasonable and that there was no evidence of collusion by the parties to the settlement we conclude the court did abuse its discretion,because its ruling accorded too large a role to objecting class members in the fee setting process.however,we also conclude that sprint has failed to show actual prejudice resulted from determination of the amount of the attorney fee award by the court rather than by the arbitrator selected by the parties.we reject the by plaintiffs,as well as a separate appeal by an objector to the settlement,appellant sulekha anand anand.we affirm the judgment.
background 
in january,plaintiffs filed a sixth amended consolidated complaint in this class action against sprint.plaintiffs alleged that cell phone handsets sold by sprint secretly had been locked with programming locks to make it impossible or impracticable for customers to switch cell phone service providers without purchasing a new handset.the complaint alleged causes of action for fraudulent,unlawful,and unfair business practices,and violation of the consumer legal remedies act clra,et.plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief,as well as restitution disgorgement of all amounts wrongfully charged to the class members.
after discovery,the case was assigned to judge steven brick for trial.sprint filed motions in limine,and,in june,judge brick tentatively granted of the motions in limine,including those seeking to exclude plaintiffs two experts on damages.
before judge brick completed a hearing on the motions and issued final rulings,the parties reached a settlement.under the settlement,a national class would be certified,and that class would release all claims concerning sprint handset locking practices.although plaintiffs had claimed nearly million in damages for a class,sprint did not agree to pay any money in the settlement.instead,sprint,among other things,agreed to inform its customers that its handsets contain software programming locks and to unlock handsets for customers who have satisfied their contractual obligations to sprint.
the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the amount of an attorney fee award for plaintiffs.although plaintiffs preferred that the trial court make the determination,sprint insisted that the amount of the award be determined in arbitration.ultimately,the parties agreed the amount of an award for attorney fees and expenses would be determined through arbitration with a cap on the award of,which is a little under the hourly fees and expenses class counsel claimed to have incurred.plaintiffs were guaranteed an award of at least,which is approximately the amount of expenses claimed by class counsel the parties agreed that any trial court rulings regarding attorney fees would not affect the settlement on the merits of plaintiffs claims.
judge brick referred the matter to judge bonnie sabraw,the judge presiding over the coordination proceeding that included the present case,for approval of the settlement.judge sabraw preliminarily approved the settlement and notice was given to the class.only two class members objected to the settlement.the objectors contended the settlement was inadequate because,among other things,it did not provide compensation for any damages.judge sabraw rejected that objection,finding the settlement was fair to the class given the strength of the claims and defenses in the case.the objectors also complained the fees claimed by class counsel were excessive in light of the limited benefits of the settlement.the court found reasonable the range of fees authorized by the fee provision,based on argument and documentation provided by plaintiffs.
ultimately,however,the trial court refused to approve the fee arbitration provision.one of the objectors,tom gray,complained the provision did not permit him to participate in the arbitration.the only interest identified by objector gray was an interest in ensuring the reasonableness of the fee award.sprint was willing to allow the objectors to participate,but plaintiffs argued the agreement did not permit the objectors to do so.class counsel informed the trial court that plaintiffs strongly prefer to have the trial court determine the amount of a reasonable fee,that plaintiffs accepted a fee arbitration with the range limitations reluctantly,only as a concession to sprint,and that plaintiffs certainly would not have agreed to allow objector participation in the arbitration.after taking additional evidence on collusion,the court found the fee provision was negotiated separately from the settlement on the merits and counsel had not agreed to a larger fee in exchange for a less favorable settlement.nevertheless,the court concluded the fee arbitration provision was void in its entirety because it improperly excluded the members of the class from the fee application process.
the trial court conducted proceedings to determine a reasonable attorney fee award.the court determined plaintiffs were entitled to a fee award under civil code sections and,subdivision d,and,based on the hours worked by class counsel and reasonable hourly rates,the lodestar amount was nearly million.the court found that class counsel had achieved only limited success,but still awarded fees in the lodestar amount after applying positive and negative multipliers that offset each other.the court also awarded approximately in costs for a total award of almost million.a judgment of dismissal was entered on june.
sprint filed a timely appeal,challenging the trial court refusal to approve the fee arbitration provision.plaintiffs filed a timely,challenging the court failure to include in the award approximately in expenses.anand also appealed,challenging the reasonableness of the fee award we jointly consider all the appeals and issue a single opinion.consumer privacy cases th,fn,d.

the trial court lacked a legal basis to refuse to approve the fee provision 
in reviewing an attorney fee provision in a class action settlement agreement,the trial court has an independent duty to determine the reasonableness of the award.garabedian los angeles cellular telephone th,d dunk,supra,th at,d.the court should also consider whether there is any evidence of fraud or collusion in the fashioning of any agreement as to attorney fees.dunk,at,d.as the dunk court explained,a defendant is interested only in disposing of the total claim asserted against it the allocation between the class payment and the attorneys fees is of little or no interest to the defense.citations.t he divergence in financial incentives between the class and counsel creates the danger that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a basis in exchange for treatment for fees.citations.citation.dunk,supra,th at,d.
the trial court in this case expressly found that the fee range provided for in the fee arbitration provision was reasonable.from the class members perspective,review of the reasonableness of the fee award is a safeguard against the possibility of collusion.if fees are unreasonably high,the likelihood is that the defendant obtained an economically beneficial concession with regard to the merits provisions,in the form of lower monetary payments to class members or less injunctive relief for the class than the defendant could otherwise have obtained.staton boeing cir.at the time the trial court determined the fee range was reasonable,the court had before it extensive documentation and argument from plaintiffs.this included plaintiffs oral and written argument justifying a fee award at the maximum end of the range in light of the benefits of the settlement and the difficulty and risk of the litigation,as well as six declarations from class counsel documenting the hours expended on the litigation and the reasonableness of the hourly rates.in its order,the court stated based on the c ourt knowledge of the case and the representations at the hearing,the c ourt is comfortable that the range is reasonable and that the arbitrator could award fees and costs anywhere in the range without abusing his or her discretion.because the trial court found that a fee award at even the top of the range would not be excessive,the purposes of review of the award for reasonableness were satisfied from the perspective of the class 
not only did the trial court find the fee range reasonable,but it also found there was no evidence of collusion.the court made that finding based on briefs on the collusion issue from the parties and an objector,and declarations from counsel regarding the settlement negotiation process.the court found the parties reached agreement on the material terms of the settlement before negotiating a fee for class counsel,class counsel did not seek a larger fee award in exchange for a smaller class recovery,and the substantive settlement was not linked to the fee award in a way that might have prejudiced the members of the class.the fact that class counsel did not receive treatment on fees dunk,supra,th at,d also justified diminished concern about collusion.class action settlements frequently contain a clear sailing agreement,whereby the defendant agrees not to object to an attorney fee award up to a certain amount.see consumer privacy cases,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs in this case obtained no such agreement instead they secured only an agreement to a range with a floor equal to their expenses and a ceiling slightly lower than class counsel lodestar plus expenses with no multiplier.at the fee determination stage,sprint vigorously opposed plaintiffs request for fees at the top of the range and argued plaintiffs should receive an award at the bottom of the range.finally,the parties agreement that the substantive terms would stand even if the court refused to approve the fee arbitration provision significantly reduced the possibility of any conflict of interest affecting the substantive terms of the settlement.see robbins alibrandi th,d robbins.
although the trial court found reasonable the range of fees in the fee arbitration provision and found the provision was not the product of collusion,the court declared the provision void in its entirety because it did not provide for the participation of objecting class members in the arbitration.notably,the notice to the class of preliminary approval of the settlement described the range of permissible fee awards in the arbitration.the objectors had an opportunity to present their objections to the settlement fee provision in light of the documentation provided by plaintiffs counsel objector gray did in fact present his objections to the fee provision in writing and at the hearing on approval of the settlement and the documentation provided by plaintiffs at the approval stage alone would have been sufficient to support a fee award determination.see wershba apple computer,th,d wershba.nevertheless,the court asserted,t he settlement agreement and the included fee and cost arbitration provision is between the class and sprint,so the members of the class should have the opportunity to make filings and presentations at the fee arbitration the court also asserted that it has the obligation to ensure both that a class settlement is substantively fair and that the settlement process is transparent and permits class members to participate.
the trial court statements reflect a misapprehension of the limited role of unnamed class members in class actions,including in settlements.a class action is a representative action in which the class representatives assume a fiduciary responsibility to prosecute the action on behalf of the absent parties.citation.the representative parties not only make the decision to bring the case in the first place,but even after class certification and notice,they are the ones responsible for trying the case,appearing in court,and working with class counsel on behalf of absent members.the structure of the class action does not allow absent class members to become active parties,since to the extent the absent class members are compelled to participate in the trial of the lawsuit,the effectiveness of the class action device is destroyed.citation.the very purpose of the class action is to relieve the absent members of the burden of participating in the action.citation.earley superior court th,d,fn.omitted.the court responsibility to scrutinize the fairness of settlements rests,in part,on the fact that unnamed class members are not direct participants in settlement negotiations.see mark spencer th,d.
in this case,there was particularly little justification for the participation of unnamed class members in the fee arbitration because,although the amount of the fee arbitration award was of great concern to sprint,the award would have had no direct impact on the class members,who would have received the same relief regardless of the results of the arbitration.robbins,supra,th at,d size of attorney fee award in shareholders derivative suit will have direct pecuniary impact on the shareholders,or the corporation,or both,as the negotiated fee can or might reduce the amount of any common fund recovered by the stockholders as a result of the litigation,be paid out of the corporation assets,or where covered by insurance,result in increased premiums or difficulty in obtaining insurance in the future.in other words,the class members had no clear interest in determining the amount class counsel received within the range specified in the settlement agreement 
a similar point was made by the court in state of new york philip morris,which involved the settlement of a class action against the tobacco company defendants.the trial court approved a settlement agreement under which the amount of fees would be determined by a panel of arbitrators if the defendants and the plaintiffs counsel were unable to agree on a fee.id.at.the state of new york was not separately represented at the arbitration,because any fee award would come solely out of the defendant tobacco companies pockets and would not affect the s tate recovery in any fashion.id.at.the court pointed out that t he whole concept of collusion makes no sense in the context of this litigation.if the tobacco defendants had wanted to collude in paying too high a legal fee,they could have reached an agreement with o utside c ounsel without going through the time,expense and uncertainty of arbitration.ibid.that reasoning applies equally in this case.
moreover,the decision making process in class actions is not,generally speaking,transparent to the unnamed class members,whether the decisions relate to litigation strategy or the settlement process.this lack of transparency is reflected in the limited ability of objectors to obtain discovery regarding settlement negotiations.it is well established that objectors are not entitled to discovery concerning settlement negotiations between the parties without evidence indicating that there was collusion between plaintiffs and defendants in the negotiating process.citations.cho seagate technology holdings,th,d.ultimately,the key consideration for the trial court is the substantive fairness of the settlement terms,as well as the reasonableness of the fee award and any evidence of collusion,rather than the transparency of the process by which the terms of the settlement were accomplished.as the court stated in in re corrugated container antitrust litigation cir,t he district court most important function in reviewing compromises of class actions is its consideration of the settlement terms.citation.it is,ultimately,in the settlement terms that the class representatives judgment and the adequacy of their representation is either vindicated or found wanting.
the fee arbitration contemplated in this case effectively would have been an extension of the settlement negotiations it was the process settled upon by the parties for determining a fee award amount within the range presented to the trial court for approval.if the parties had been able to agree upon a single figure to present to the trial court,the objectors would have had no opportunity to participate in the determination of that figure.moreover,under the fee arbitration provision,the unnamed class members would not have been denied adequate opportunity to address the issue of attorney fees.after tentative approval of the settlement,the unnamed class members had an opportunity to present any evidence of collusion and to object to the reasonableness of the fee range provided for in the agreement,in light of plaintiffs extensive documentation.the objectors would have had no greater opportunity to object had the agreement been for a specific amount of fees.
it is instructive to compare this case to wershba,supra,th,d.there,the parties reached a settlement on the merits of a class action but were unable to reach a settlement on fees.id.at,d.the issue was submitted to mediation before a retired judge and concluded with a last offer or baseball arbitration based upon briefing and argument by the parties.id.at,d.the mediator selected the figure proposed by the defendant and the entire settlement was preliminarily approved by the trial court and fully approved after a hearing in which objectors participated.id.at,d.on appeal,an objector contended the award of fees was improper because it was not based on either the lodestar method or the percentage of recovery method,but rather was the result of an arbitrary procedure whereby the mediator was instructed to choose between the defendant last offer and the plaintiffs attorneys last demand.id.at,d.the court of appeal rejected that argument because the trial court made clear that it did not use this method for calculating attorney fees,but that it was making an independent assessment of the appropriate amount of a fee award and on that basis found that the fees requested were reasonable.ibid.the difference between the present case and wershba is that the trial court here made the determination of reasonableness as to the range of fee awards before the fee arbitration took place.it appears the trial court in wershba had no more information before it regarding the hours spent by class counsel on the class action than the trial court in this case did at the time it refused to approve the fee arbitration provision.id.at,d.thus,the objectors in wershba had no greater opportunity to participate in the determination of the amount of fees obtained by class counsel than the objectors would have had in this case under the settlement agreement what is unexplained in the trial court ruling in this case is why the objectors must be permitted to participate in the arbitration to determine the ultimate figure simply because the parties were able to agree only on a fee range or because they did not conduct the arbitration before presenting the settlement agreement to the court 
it is true that,had the settlement agreement provided for the trial court to determine the amount of fees,objectors would have had an opportunity to participate in that process.in fact,counsel for objectors in the present case did participate in the court fee determination proceedings.however,the fact that objectors might have that opportunity where a court is determining the amount of fees does not mean the trial court in this case had a legal basis to require the participation of objectors in the arbitration.as noted previously,the purpose of requiring court approval of class action se
