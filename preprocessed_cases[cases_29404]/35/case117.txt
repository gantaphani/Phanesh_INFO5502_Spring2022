background 
both and are in the contact lens business.manufactures lenses,including those under the acuvue brand sells lenses,including acuvue,over the phone and the internet.argues that three of advertisements make statements about or about acuvue that are literally false.the first advertisement at issue is a letter sent by to its customers recommending ciba vision focus dailies,a lens,over acuvue,a lens.in this letter the focus dailies letter,cites a study published by a trade journal named contact lens spectrum cls study which identified a five to one consumer preference for focus dailies over acuvue.the second advertisement,also a letter,was sent by to customers who requested lenses that were not in stock at the time of the customer order.this letter the exclusive deal letter explains that inability to process the customer order was due to policy of distributing contacts exclusively to eye doctors,rather than to retailers like.the third advertisement is a pamphlet about focus dailies the focus dailies pamphlet that was sent out with the exclusive deal letter.the pamphlet cites the five to one preference for focus dailies and compares the qualities of the lens against those of competing lenses,ex.g at.

ii.discussion 
only if the district court abused its discretion will we reverse the grant of a preliminary injunction.am.bd.of psychiatry neurology,cir.we review the district court findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.id.at.the facts found by a district court are clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.of georgia athletic ass laite,cir internal quotations omitted.the clearly erroneous standard is appropriate in cases,such as this one,in which the evidence is primarily documentary the fact that the district court decision was not a function of credibility determinations does not affect the standard of review.anderson city of bessemer city,d.lastly,our review of the district court application of law is de novo,premised on the understanding that a pplication of an improper legal standard is never within a district court discretion,at.
for a district court to grant a preliminary injunction,the movant must establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying case,the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,the harm suffered by the movant in the absence of an injunction would exceed the harm suffered by the opposing party if the injunction issued,and an injunction would not disserve the public interest.carillon,frank pesce int l group,cir per curiam.to establish the likelihood of success on the merits of a false advertising claim under a of the lanham act,a,the movant must establish the ads of the opposing party were false or misleading,the ads deceived,or had the capacity to deceive,consumers,the deception had a material effect on purchasing decisions,the misrepresented product or service affects interstate commerce,and the movant has is likely to as a result of the false advertising.alpo petfoods,ralston purina.if the movant is unable to establish a likelihood of success on the merits,a court need not consider the remaining conditions prerequisite to injunctive relief.pittman cole,cir.
our analysis begins and ends with the five elements needed to establish the likelihood of success.first,needed to prove that ads were false or misleading.this element is satisfied if the challenged advertisement is literally false,or if the challenged advertisement is literally true,but misleading.johnson johnson merck consumer pharms.smithkline beecham,cir.it is clear that the district court found each of the three advertisements to be either false or misleading,but it is unclear into which category the court placed the ads 
the category is relevant once a court deems an advertisement to be literally false,the movant need not present evidence of consumer deception.am.council of certified podiatric physicians and surgeons am.bd.of podiatric surgery,cir.if the court deems an ad to be true but misleading,the at the preliminary injunction present evidence of deception while consumer surveys or market research are not an absolute prerequisite,the moving party must provide expert testimony or other evidence.united indus,at.the district court did not require to provide evidence that advertisements deceived or tended to deceive consumers.as such,we conclude that the district court found the advertisements to be literally false.
there is one additional point to consider before we begin our analysis the district court did not assess each advertisement independently,but instead evaluated the three in concert.the court reasoned that i f the ad campaign as a whole would be misleading to the reasonable consumer,then the defendant should be enjoined from using that ad campaign.id.it is true that a court must analyze the message conveyed in full context,castrol pennzoil,cir,and that the court must view the face of the statement in its entirety,rather than examining the eyes,nose,and mouth separately and in isolation from each other.id.citation omitted.while the court should consider context,it may not assume context.the problem with the district court approach is the assumption that consumers will be exposed to every advertisement in a campaign accordingly,we have organized our opinion to reflect the fact that sent the exclusive deal letter and the focus dailies pamphlet together,and sent the focus dailies letter without any accompanying advertisement.
a.the focus dailies letter 
the focus dailies letter states that focus dailies are preferred to over acuvues,ex.a emphasis omitted.the letter elaborates that of participants in a recent study preferred focus dailies,finding them to be more comfortable,more convenient,and easier to handle than acuvue lenses.id.the district court found that the focus dailies letter misrepresented to consumers the superiority of focus dailies by failing to make it clear to the consumer that the study was comparing modalities length of time wearing the lens,one day wear versus two week wear and not the quality of lenses with the same modality.
as the common law of false advertising has developed,several circuits have determined that the nature of a plaintiff burden in proving an advertisement to be literally false should depend on whether the defendant advertisement cites consumer testing.see,fleet smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,cir rorer pharms.marion merrell dow,cir castrol,quaker state,cir.if an advertisement cites such testing,the advertisement is labeled as an establishment claim.basf,old world trading,cir.to prove an establishment claim literally false,the movant must prove that these tests did not establish the proposition for which they were cited.quaker state,at.we find this method of evaluating such advertisements to be analytically sound,and adopt the reasoning for use in the eleventh circuit.
in this case,the goal of the cls study was to evaluate the overall patient preference of focus dailies one day contact lenses as compared to replacement acuvue lenses,ex.b at.the cls study concluded that a significant majority of the test participants preferred focus dailies.id.at.in its focus dailies letter,leads with a quotation from the cls study patients concluded that the focus dailie
