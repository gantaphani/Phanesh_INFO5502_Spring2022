background facts and procedural history 
on july,serena kwan,an individual,on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated kwan,filed a class action against,sanmedica international,llc sanmedica,a utah limited liability company,and sierra research group,llc sierra,a utah limited liability company,alleging violations of california unfair competition law ucl and california consumers legal remedies act clra.kwan filed a first amended complaint on august.the amended complaint was based on an allegation that the defendants falsely represented that their product,serovital,provides a mean increase in human growth hormone hgh levels,that it was clinically tested,and that peak growth hormone levels are associated with youthful skin integrity,lean musculature,elevated energy production,and adipose tissue distribution.
on october,sierra filed a motion under rule b to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.on october,kwan filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of sierra pursuant to rule a a i,fed.civ.
the court granted sanmedica motion to dismiss with leave to amend.the court reasoned that the first amended complaint was based entirely on allegations related to whether sanmedica claims regarding its product,serovital,were properly substantiated.citing cal.bus.code,the court stated individuals may not bring suit under the ucl or the clra alleging only that advertising claims lack substantiation because that right is reserved to the director of consumer affairs,the attorney general,any city attorney,or any district attorney the court instructed that if kwan chose to amend her complaint,she must allege facts from which the c ourt can conclude that defendant advertising representations were false.the court continued,it is not enough for plaintiff to attack the methodology of defendant study instead,she must allege facts affirmatively disproving defendant claims.the court advised 
for example,plaintiff could allege that one or more of the authorities alluded to actually studied or tested the formula serovital contains and found that it does not produce a mean increase in hgh levels,or that plaintiff herself did not experience such an increase when using the product,or that a study exists somewhere demonstrating that a increase is categorically impossible to achieve in an pill.of course,plaintiff should only allege these facts if she can do so in good faith.
kwan filed a second amended complaint against sanmedica international,llc,on december.in the second amended complaint,kwan continues to maintain the two counts.count one alleges violations of the california unlawful business and practices act.count two alleges violations of the california consumers legal remedies act.among several paragraphs containing conclusions of law and sweeping arguments,the second amended complaint contains the following material factual allegations 
sanmedica manufactures and sells serovital,an amino acid supplement represented as an hgh secretagogue,meaning it is supposed to prompt the body to secrete hgh.
sanmedica represents in its marketing campaign and on each label of serovital that 
it is clear that growth hormone has been associated with wrinkle reduction,decreased body fat,increased lean muscle mass,stronger bones,improved mood,heightened sex drive,and making users look and feel decades not years,but decades younger peak growth hormone levels are associated with youthful skin integrity,lean musculature,elevated energy production,and adipose tissue distribution and that serovital is clinically tested to boost human growth hormone hgh by a mean of hereafter the hgh increase representation.
these representations are false.
after being exposed to the representation,in may,kwan purchased one box of serovital online from sanmedica.
a count bottle of serovital sells for approximately.
if she had known the truth about the product,or that it was being sold illegally,kwan would not have purchased the product.
there is no credible scientific evidence to support defendant hgh increase representation,hgh fountain of youth benefit representations,and serovital fountain of youth and body composition representations.
the only study identified by defendant website is not an example of scientific evidence recognized by experts,was never,and was never published in a journal.
the study is arguably incredible.
serovital is a dietary supplement that is sold illegally because sanmedica marketing claims are not properly substantiated as required by federal and state law regulating the sale of dietary supplements.
kwan and other class members have been damaged in their purchases of the product.
although the second amended complaint alleges that kwan purchased serovital,it does not allege that she,or any of the purported class members,ever actually used the product.
sanmedica filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint under rule b,fed.civ,for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.because the second amended complaint failed to specifically allege facts to support a finding that sanmedica claims regarding serovital were actually false,the court concluded that kwan was again merely alleging lack of substantiation.because kwan had been provided the opportunity to amend her complaint,and she has once again failed to allege facts from which the c ourt could conclude that defendant advertising representations were false,the court dismissed the matter with prejudice.kwan timely appealed.

further,as this court has previously explained 
on appeal,we are limited in our review of the district court interpretation of the law of the state in which it sits.we do not overrule a district judge on the question of state law unless the judge findings are clearly wrong.while this circuit does not regard the district judge presumed expertise in the law of his or her own state to be infallible,we nonetheless regard the standard of review on this issue as one which does restrict our scrutiny of the district judge determination.

discussion 
whether the california law regulating advertising provides a cause of action for private citizens alleging that marketing claims lack proper scientific substantiation.
the ucl provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person doing business in california and advertising to consumers in california to make any false or misleading advertising claims that purport to be based on factual,objective,or clinical evidence,compare the product effectiveness or safety to that of other brands or products,or purport to be based on any fact.
cal.bus.code.the ucl does not provide a private cause of action unless a person suffers an injury in fact as a result of unfair competition 
actions for relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction by the attorney general or a district attorney or by a county counsel authorized by agreement with the district attorney in actions involving violation of a county ordinance,or by a city attorney of a city having a population in excess of,or by a city attorney in a city or county or,with the consent of the district attorney,by a city prosecutor in a city having a city prosecutor in the name of the people of the state of california upon their own complaint or upon the complaint of a board,officer,person,corporation,or association,or by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.
cal.bus.code.
the clra shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes,which are to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.cal.civ.code.the clra proscribes certain unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer cal.civ.code a.specific to the case at hand,the clra prohibits representing that goods have approval,ingredients,uses,or benefits which they do not have or representing that goods are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,or that goods are of a particular style or model,if they are of another.cal.civ.code a and.the clra provides any consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment of a method,act,or practice declared unlawful by section may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain relief including actual damages,enjoining of methods,acts,or practices,restitution,punitive damages,or any other relief that the court deems proper.cal.civ.code a.
the california supreme court recognizes that both the ucl and the clra,with the purposes of promoting fair competition and consumer protection,contain broad,sweeping language to describe their substantive provisions.loeffler target,cal.quoting kwikset superior court,cal.however,california highest state court also recognizes that these statutes do not give the courts the authority to simply impose their own notions of fairness and the legislature may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.id.at quoting communications,los angeles cellular,cal.for example,if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.id.internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the california supreme court has explained,in some instances,an action may not lie under the ucl because another statutory scheme provides the exclusive means for resolving disputes.id.
in national council against health fraud,king bio pharmaceuticals,king bio,the california court of appeal,second district,after careful analysis of the statutory provisions addressing who may bring a legal action under the ucl,stated 
in sum,both private persons and prosecuting authorities may sue to enjoin false advertising and obtain restitution.when they bring such actions,both private persons and prosecuting authorities bear the burden of proving the advertising claims to be false or misleading.prosecuting authorities,but not private plaintiffs,have the administrative power to request advertisers to substantiate advertising claims before bringing actions for false advertisement,but the prosecuting authorities retain the burden of proof in the false advertising actions.
th,cal.app.
in the fourteen years since king bio was decided,courts,including several federal district courts,have cited it to require that private citizens bringing suit under the ucl or the clra properly allege proof that plaintiffs sustained injury from relying on marketing statements that were actually false these courts have precluded private citizens from bringing actions that allege that the challenged advertising language lacked proper scientific substantiation.the california state legislature has not amended the statutory language on which the king bio holding relied.the california supreme court has not addressed king bio holding directly.however,the california supreme court recognizes that the overriding purpose of proposition,which amended the ucl and the clra in,was to impose limits on private enforcement actions.in re tobacco ii cases,cal.tobacco ii concluded that the amending language imposes an actual reliance requirement on plaintiffs prosecuting a private enforcement action under the ucl fraud prong.id.reliance,according to the california supreme court,is proved by showing that defendant misrepresentation is an immediate cause of the plaintiff conduct by showing that in its absence the plaintiff in all reasonable probability would not have engaged in the conduct.id.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.the california supreme court references to reliance on a misrepresentation is consistent with king bio requirement that private plaintiffs,unlike prosecuting authorities,do not have the power to require defendants to substantiate their advertising claims,and that private plaintiffs,like prosecuting authorities,have the burden of proving that the marketing claims are false or misleading.
under the circumstances,it is readily apparent that king bio holding is firmly established law in california.as this court has not been presented with any convincing evidence to decide differently,we are obligated to follow the holding in king bio.accord lewis telephone employees credit union,at.the district court did not err in concluding that neither the ucl nor the clra provides kwan with a private cause of action to enforce the substantiation provisions of calfornia unfair competition or consumer protection laws.
