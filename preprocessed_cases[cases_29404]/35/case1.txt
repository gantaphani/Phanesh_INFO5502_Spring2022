petitioner lexmark sells the only style of toner cartridges that work with the company laser printers,but remanufacturers acquire and refurbish used lexmark cartridges to sell in competition with lexmark own new and refurbished ones.lexmark prebate program gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to return empty cartridges to the company.each prebate cartridge has a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless lexmark replaces the chip.respondent static control,a maker and seller of components for the remanufacture of lexmark cartridges,developed a microchip that mimicked lexmark.lexmark sued for copyright infringement,but static control counterclaimed,alleging that lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of a of the lanham act,a,and that its misrepresentations had caused static control lost sales and damage to its business reputation.the district court held that static control lacked prudential standing to bring the lanham act claim,applying a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to associated contractors of,carpenters.in reversing,the sixth circuit relied on the second circuit reasonable interest test.
held static control has adequately pleaded the elements of a lanham act cause of action for false advertising.
a the question here is whether static control falls within the class of plaintiffs that congress authorized to sue under a.to decide that question,this court must determine the provision meaning,using traditional principles of statutory interpretation.it is misleading to label this a prudential standing question.lexmark bases its prudential standing arguments on associated general contractors,but that case rested on statutory considerations the court sought to ascertain,as a matter,the scope of the private remedy created by congress in of the clayton act,and the class of persons who could maintain a private damages action under that legislatively conferred cause of action,at.and while this court may have placed the zone of interests test that static control relies on under the prudential rubric in the past,see,elk grove unified school dist.newdow,it does not belong there any more than associated general contractors does.rather,whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests requires the court to determine,using traditional tools,whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff claim.see,steel citizens for better environment,and.
b the a cause of action extends to plaintiffs who fall within the zone of interests protected by that statute and whose injury was proximately caused by a violation of that statute.
a statutory cause of action is presumed to extend only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.allen wright.t he breadth of that zone varies according to the provisions of law at issue.bennett spear.the lanham act includes a detailed statement of its purposes,including,as relevant here,protect ing persons engaged in commerce within the control of congress against unfair competition,and unfair competition was understood at common law to be concerned with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.thus,to come within the zone of interests in a a suit,a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.
a statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.see,holmes securities investor protection corporation.this requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is too remote from the defendant unlawful conduct,such as when the harm is purely derivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts.at.in a sense,all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising.but since the lanham act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries,the intervening step is not fatal to the showing the statute requires.bridge phoenix bond indemnity.thus,a plaintiff suing under a ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant advertising and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.
direct application of the test and the requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under a.these principles provide better guidance than the multifactor balancing test urged by lexmark,the test,or the test applied by the sixth circuit.
c under these principles,static control comes within the class of plaintiffs authorized to sue under a.its alleged injuries lost sales and damage to its business reputation fall within the zone of interests protected by the act,and static control sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by lexmark misrepresentations.

background 
lexmark manufactures and sells laser printers.it also sells toner cartridges for those printers toner being the powdery ink that laser printers use to create images on paper.lexmark designs its printers to work only with its own style of cartridges,and it therefore dominates the market for cartridges compatible with its printers.that market,however,is not devoid of competitors.other businesses,called remanufacturers,acquire used lexmark toner cartridges,refurbish them,and sell them in competition with new and refurbished cartridges sold by lexmark.
lexmark would prefer that its customers return their empty cartridges to it for refurbishment and resale,rather than sell those cartridges to a remanufacturer.so lexmark introduced what it called a prebate program,which enabled customers to purchase new toner cartridges at a discount if they would agree to return the cartridge to lexmark once it was empty.those terms were communicated to consumers through notices printed on the boxes,which advised the consumer that opening the box would indicate assent to the terms a practice commonly known as shrinkwrap licensing,see,procd,zeidenberg.to enforce the prebate terms,lexmark included a microchip in each prebate cartridge that would disable the cartridge after it ran out of toner for the cartridge to be used again,the microchip would have to be replaced by lexmark.
static control is not itself a manufacturer or remanufacturer of toner cartridges.it is,rather,the market leader in making and selling the components necessary to remanufacture lexmark cartridges.case below.in addition to supplying remanufacturers with toner and various replacement parts,static control developed a microchip that could mimic the microchip in lexmark prebate cartridges.by purchasing static control microchips and using them to replace the lexmark microchip,remanufacturers were able to refurbish and resell used prebate cartridges.
lexmark did not take kindly to that development.in,it sued static control,alleging that static control microchips violated both the copyright act of,et,and the digital millennium copyright act,et.static control counterclaimed,alleging,among other things,violations of a of the lanham act,stat,codified at a.section a provides 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person,or 
b in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
section a thus creates two distinct bases of liability false association,a a,and false advertising,a b.see waits.static control alleged only false advertising.
as relevant to its lanham act claim,static control alleged two types of false or misleading conduct by lexmark.first,it alleged that through its prebate program lexmark purposefully misleads to believe that they are legally bound by the prebate terms and are thus required to return the cartridge to lexmark after a single use.app.second,it alleged that upon introducing the prebate program,lexmark sent letters to most of the companies in the toner cartridge remanufacturing business falsely advising those companies that it was illegal to sell refurbished prebate cartridges and,in particular,that it was illegal to use static control products to refurbish those cartridges,at.static control asserted that by those statements,lexmark had materially misrepresented the nature,characteristics,and qualities of both its own products and static control products,at.it further maintained that lexmark misrepresentations had proximately caused and we re likely to cause injury to static control by diverting sales from static control to lexmark,and had substantially injured its business reputation by leading consumers and others in the trade to believe that static control is engaged in illegal conduct.at.static control sought treble damages,attorney fees and costs,and injunctive relief 
the district court granted lexmark motion to dismiss static control lanham act claim.it held that static control lacked prudential standing to bring that claim,app.to pet.for cert,relying on a multifactor balancing test it attributed to associated contractors of,carpenters.the court emphasized that there were more direct plaintiffs in the form of remanufacturers of lexmark cartridges that static control injury was remot e because it was a mere byproduct of the supposed manipulation of consumers relationships with remanufacturers and that lexmark alleged intent was to dry up spent cartridge supplies at the remanufacturing level,rather than at static control supply level,making remanufacturers lexmark alleged intended target.app.to pet.for cert.
the sixth circuit reversed the dismissal of static control lanham act claim,at.taking the lay of the land,it identified three competing approaches to determining whether a plaintiff has standing to sue under the lanham act.it observed that the third,fifth,eighth,and eleventh circuits all refer to antitrust standing or the associated general contractors factors in deciding lanham act standing,as the district court had done,at citing conte.automotive,quaker,procter gamble amway,carrie,phoenix of broward,mcdonald.by contrast,t he seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits use a categorical test,permitting lanham act suits only by an actual competitor.at citing heath son,information systems,waits,supra,at stanfield osborne industries.and the second circuit applies a reasonable interest approach,under which a lanham act plaintiff has standing if the claimant can demonstrate a reasonable interest to be protected against the alleged false advertising and a reasonable basis for believing that the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged false advertising.at quoting famous horse,avenue photo.the sixth circuit applied the second circuit test and concluded that static control had standing because it alleged a cognizable interest in its business reputation and sales to remanufacturers and sufficiently alleged that th o se interests were harmed by lexmark statements to the remanufacturers that static control was engaging in illegal conduct.at.
we granted certiorari to decide the appropriate analytical framework for determining a party standing to maintain an action for false advertising under the lanham act.pet.for cert.i 
ii.prudential standing 
the parties briefs treat the question on which we granted certiorari as one of prudential standing.because we think that label misleading,we begin by clarifying the nature of the question at issue in this case.
from article iii limitation of the judicial power to resolving cases and controversies,and the principles underlying that limitation,we have deduced a set of requirements that together make up the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.lujan defenders of wildlife.the plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.ibid.lexmark does not deny that static control allegations of lost sales and damage to its business reputation give it standing under article iii to press its claim,and we are satisfied that they do.
although static control claim thus presents a case or controversy that is properly within federal courts article iii jurisdiction,lexmark urges that we should decline to adjudicate static control claim on grounds that are prudential,rather than constitutional.that request is in some tension with our recent reaffirmation of the principle that a federal court obligation to hear and decide cases within its jurisdiction is virtually unflagging.sprint communications,jacobs,slip,at quoting colorado river water dist.united states.in recent decades,however,we have adverted to a prudential branch of standing,a doctrine not derived from article iii and not exhaustively defined but encompassing we have said at least three broad principles the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights,the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,and the requirement that a plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.elk grove unified school dist.newdow,quoting allen wright.
lexmark bases its prudential standing arguments chiefly on associated general contractors,but we did not describe our analysis in that case in those terms.rather,we sought to ascertain,as a matter of statutory interpretation,the scope of the private remedy created by congress in of the clayton act,and the class of persons who could maintain a private damages action under that legislatively conferred cause of action,at.we held that the statute limited the class to plaintiffs whose injuries were proximately caused by a defendant antitrust violations,at.later decisions confirm that associated general contractors rested on statutory,not prudential,considerations.see,holmes securities investor protection corporation,relying on associated general contractors in finding a requirement in the cause of action created by the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c anza ideal steel supply,affirming that holmes relied on a careful interpretation of c lexmark arguments thus do not deserve the prudential label.
static control,on the other hand,argues that we should measure its prudential standing by using the test.although we admittedly have placed that test under the prudential rubric in the past,see,elk grove,supra,at,it does not belong there any more than associated general contractors does.whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests is an issue that requires us to determine,using traditional tools of statutory interpretation,whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff claim.see steel citizens for better environment,and clarke securities industry,holmes,supra,at scalia,concurring in judgment.as judge silberman of the circuit recently observed,prudential standing is a misnomer as applied to the analysis,which asks whether this particular class of persons ha s a right to sue under this substantive statute.association of battery recyclers,epa,concurring opinion 
in sum,the question this case presents is whether static control falls within the class of plaintiffs whom congress has authorized to sue under a.in other words,we ask whether static control has a cause of action under the statute that question requires us to determine the meaning of the congressionally enacted provision creating a cause of action.in doing so,we apply traditional principles of statutory interpretation.we do not ask whether in our judgment congress should have authorized static control suit,but whether congress in fact did so.just as a court can not apply its independent policy judgment to recognize a cause of action that congress has denied,see alexander sandoval,it can not limit a cause of action that congress has created merely because prudence dictates.
iii.static control right to sue under a 
thus,this case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation does the cause of action in a extend to plaintiffs like static control the statute authorizes suit by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by a defendant false advertising.a.read literally,that broad language might suggest that an action is available to anyone who can satisfy the minimum requirements of article iii.no party makes that argument,however,and the unlikelihood that congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover persuades us that a should not get such an expansive reading.holmes,at footnote omitted.we reach that conclusion in light of two relevant background principles already mentioned zone of interests and proximate causality.
zone of interests 
first,we presume that a statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.allen,at.the modern zone of interests formulation originated in association of data processing service organizations,camp,as a limitation on the cause of action for judicial review conferred by the administrative procedure act apa.we have since made clear,however,that it applies to all statutorily created causes of action that it is a requirement of general application and that congress is presumed to legislat e against the background of the limitation,which applies unless it is expressly negated.bennett spear,see also holmes,supra,at scalia,concurring in judgment.it is perhaps more accurat e,though not very different as a practical matter,to say that the limitation always applies and is never negated,but that our analysis of certain statutes will show that they protect a expan sive range of interests.bennett,supra,at.the test is therefore an appropriate tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action in a 
we have said,in the apa context,that the test is not especially demanding,band of pottawatomi indians patchak,slip,at.in that context we have often conspicuously included the word arguably in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff,and have said that the test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress authorized that plaintiff to sue,at slip,at.that lenient approach is an appropriate means of preserving the flexibility of the apa omnibus provision,which permits suit for violations of numerous statutes of varying character that do not themselves include causes of action for judicial review.we have made clear,however,that the breadth of the zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue,so that what comes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative action under the generous review provisions of the apa may not do so for other purposes.bennett,supra,at quoting clarke,at,in turn quoting data processing,supra,at.
identifying the interests protected by the lanham act,however,requires no guesswork,since the act includes an unusual,and extraordinarily helpful,detailed statement of the statute purposes.halicki productions united artists communications.section of the act,codified at,provides 
the intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce within the control of congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by state,or territorial legislation to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition to prevent fraud and deception in such commerce by the use of reproductions,copies,counterfeits,or colorable imitations of registered marks and to provide rights and remedies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting trademarks,trade names,and unfair competition entered into between the united states and foreign nations.
most of the enumerated purposes are relevant to cases a typical case will implicate only the act goal of protect ing persons engaged in commerce within the control of congress against unfair competition.although unfair competition was a plastic concept at common law,safe mosler safe,hand,it was understood to be concerned with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.see rogers,book review,yale,see generally restatement of torts,ch,introductory note.
we thus hold that to come within the zone of interests in a suit for false advertising under a,a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.a consumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a disappointing product may well have an cognizable under article iii,but he can not invoke the protection of the lanham act a conclusion reached by every circuit to consider the question.see colligan activities club of,serbin ziebart int l,made in the usa foundation phillips foods,procter gamble,at barrus sylvania,phoenix of broward,at.even a business misled by a supplier into purchasing an inferior product is,like consumers generally,not under the act aegis.
proximate cause 
second,we generally presume that a statutory cause of action is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.for centuries,it has been a well established principle of the common law,that in all cases of loss,we are to attribute it to the proximate cause,and not to any remote cause.waters merchants louisville ins,pet,see holmes,at scalia,concurring in judgment.that venerable principle reflects the reality that the judicial remedy can not encompass every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.associ ated contractors,at.congress,we assume,is familiar with the rule and does not mean to displace it sub silentio.we have thus construed federal causes of action in a variety of contexts to incorporate a requirement of proximate causation.see,dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,securities fraud holmes,supra,at rico associated contractors,supra,at clayton act.no party disputes that it is proper to read a as containing such a requirement,its broad language notwithstanding.
the inquiry is not easy to define,and over the years it has taken various forms but courts have a great deal of experience applying it,and there is a wealth of precedent for them to draw upon in doing so.see exxon,sofec,pacific operators offshore,llp valladolid,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment slip,at.analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory cause of action.the question it presents is whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.
put differently,the requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is too remote from the defendant unlawful conduct.that is ordinarily the case if the harm is purely derivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts.holmes,supra,at see,hemi group,llc city of new york.in a sense,of course,all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers who are deceived by the advertising but since the lanham act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries,the intervening step of consumer deception is not fatal to the showing of proximate causation required by the statute.see harold huggins realty,fnc.that is consistent with our recognition that under principles,a plaintiff can be directly injured by a misrepresentation even where a third party,and not the plaintiff,relied on it.bridge phoenix bond indemnity.
we thus hold that a plaintiff suing under a ordinarily must show economic or reputational injury flowing directly from the deception wrought by the defendant advertising and that that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.that showing is generally not made when the deception produces injuries to a fellow commercial actor that in turn affect the plaintiff.for example,while a competitor who is forced out of business by a defendant false advertising generally will be able to sue for its losses,the same is not true of the competitor landlord,its electric company,and other commercial parties who suffer merely as a result of the competitor inability to meet its financial obligations.anza,at 
proposed tests 
at oral argument,lexmark agreed that the zone of interests and proximate causation supply the relevant background limitations on suit under a.see tr.of oral arg.but it urges us to adopt,as the optimal formulation of those principles,a multifactor balancing test derived from associated general.in the alternative,it asks that we adopt a categorical test permitting only direct competitors to sue for false advertising.and although neither party urges adoption of the reasonable interest test applied below,several amici do so.while none of those tests is wholly without merit,we decline to adopt any of them.we hold instead that a direct application of the test and the requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue.
the balancing test lexmark advocates was first articulated by the third circuit in conte and later adopted by several other circuits.conte identified five relevant considerations 
the nature of the plaintiff alleged injury is the injury of a type that congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the lanham act 
the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury.
the proximity or remoteness of the party to the alleged injurious conduct.
the speculativeness of the damages claim.
the risk of duplicative damages or complexity in apportioning damages.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this approach reflects a commendable effort to give content to an otherwise nebulous inquiry,but we think it slightly off the mark.the first factor can be read as requiring that the plaintiff injury be within the relevant zone of interests and the second and third as requiring somewhat redundantly proximate causation but it is not correct to treat those requirements,which must be met in every case,as mere factors to be weighed in a balance.and the fourth and fifth factors are themselves problematic.t he difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action is a motivating principle behind the requirement,anza,supra,at but potential difficulty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not,as conte might suggest,an independent basis for denying standing where it is adequately alleged that a defendant conduct has proximately injured an interest of the plaintiff that the statute protects.even when a plaintiff can not quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to recover damages,it may still be entitled to injunctive relief under a assuming it can prove a likelihood of future injury or disgorgement of the defendant profits under a.see,edriver,johnson johnson.finally,experience has shown that the conte approach,like other balancing tests,can yield unpredictable and at times arbitrary results.see,tushnet,running the gamut from a to b federal trademark and false advertising law.
in contrast to the multifactor balancing approach,the test provides a rule but it does so at the expense of distorting the statutory language.to be sure,a plaintiff who does not compete with the defendant will often have a harder time establishing proximate causation.but a rule categorically prohibiting all suits by noncompetitors would read too much into the act reference to unfair competition in.by the time the lanham act was adopted,the tort of unfair competition was understood not to be limited to actions between competitors.one leading authority in the field wrote that there need be no competition in unfair competition,just as t here is no soda in soda water,no grapes in grape fruit,no bread in bread fruit,and a clothes horse is not a horse but is good enough to hang things on.rogers,yale,at accord,vogue,nims,the law of unfair competition and,vi ed,at.it is thus a mistake to infer that because the lanham act treats false advertising as a form of unfair competition,it can protect only the direct competitors.
finally,there is the reasonable interest test applied by the sixth circuit in this case.as typically formulated,it requires a commercial plaintiff to demonstrate a reasonable interest to be protected against the alleged false advertising and a reasonable basis for believing that the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged false advertising.at quoting famous horse,at.a purely practical objection to the test is that it lends itself to widely divergent application.indeed,its vague language can be understood as requiring only the bare minimum of article iii standing.the popularity of the multifactor balancing test reflects its appeal to courts tired of grappl ing with defining the reasonable interest test with greater precision.conte,at.the theoretical difficulties with the test are even more substantial the relevant question is not whether the plaintiff interest is reasonable,but whether it is one the lanham act protects and not whether there is a reasonable basis for the plaintiff claim of harm,but whether the harm alleged is proximately tied to the defendant conduct.in short,we think the principles set forth above will provide clearer and more accurate guidance than the reasonable interest test.
iv.application 
applying those principles to static control claim,we conclude that static control comes within the class of plaintiffs whom congress authorized to sue under a.
to begin,static control alleged injuries lost sales and damage to its business reputation are injuries to precisely the sorts of commercial interests the act protects.static control is suing not as a deceived consumer,but as a perso n engaged in commerce within the control of congress whose position in the marketplace has been damaged by lexmark false advertising.there is no doubt that it is within the zone of interests protected by the statute.
static control also sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by lexmark misrepresentations.this case,it is true,does not present the classic lanham act claim in which one competito r directly injur es another by making false statements about his own goods or the competitor goods and thus inducing customers to switch.harold huggins realty,at.but although diversion of sales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct injury from false advertising,it is not the only type of injury cognizable under a.for at least two reasons,static control allegations satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.
first,static control alleged that lexmark disparaged its business and products by asserting that static control business was illegal.see,at,noting allegation that lexmark directly target ed static control when it falsely advertised that static control infringed lexmark patents when a defendant harms a plaintiff reputation by casting aspersions on its business,the plaintiff injury flows directly from the audience belief in the disparaging statements.courts have therefore afforded relief under a not only where a defendant denigrates a plaintiff product by na
