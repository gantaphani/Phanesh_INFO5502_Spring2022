the parties are rival manufacturers of tizanidine,a drug for treating spasticity.plaintiffs apotex incorporated and apotex corporation collectively apotex allege that defendant acorda therapeutics,acorda i filed a sham citizen petition with the food and drug administration fda to hinder approval of apotex competing formulation in violation of section two of the sherman act,and ii violated the lanham act proscription on false advertising.as relevant here,the competition between the manufacturers focused on the relative efficacy of tablets or capsules in controlling somnolence,one of the side effects of tizanidine.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,ruled that the simultaneous approval by the fda of apotex drug application and its denial of acorda citizen petition raising concerns about the application was by itself insufficient to support a sherman act claim.after discovery,the district court torres,granted summary judgment and dismissed all of apotex false advertising claims on the grounds that with the exception of one graph no representation was literally false or likely to mislead consumers and that,as to that one graph,apotex failed to show that the false depiction would meaningfully impact consumers purchasing decisions.
apotex appeals both rulings,arguing that precedent from this court allows its antitrust claim to survive dismissal and that material issues of fact pertinent to acorda representations remain for a jury to decide.we affirm these rulings.
although precedent supports an inference that a citizen petition is an anticompetitive weapon if it attacks a rival drug application and is denied the same day that the application is approved,that inference has been undercut by recent fda guidance.as to false advertising,we agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could have found that acorda made literally false or misleading representations in its advertisements,with the exception of a single representation that apotex has failed to show affected decisions to purchase.
background 
tizanidine tablets are used to treat spasticity,a symptom of multiple sclerosis and parkinson disease.one of the tablets most common side effects is somnolence sleepiness or drowsiness.tizanidine tablets were first marketed in the united states by elan pharmaceuticals,elan,under the trade name zanaflex.elan later sold its rights to acorda.
zanaflex tablets were initially approved for sale by the fda on november.in october,elan submitted a new drug application nda to the fda seeking approval to market tizanidine in capsule form.during its review,the fda concluded that the absorption of the drug was delayed when tizanidine capsules were taken with food rather than without,and that the delay was associated with a mean percent decrease in cmax,the peak amount of the drug in a subject bloodstream.more importantly,the fda found that w hen bioequivalence of the capsule relative to the tablet is examined under fed conditions,with food,there is a delay in absorption and the mean cmax for the capsule is approximately of the mean cmax for the tablet figure.joint appendix at emphasis added.the fda subsequently approved elan nda on august.
the significance of this phenomenon,in plain terms,is that the faster the drug is absorbed,the more drowsy the patient may become,whereas the side effect may be reduced if absorption is slowed.
while the nda was pending,elan filed a patent application for methods of administering tizanidine capsules to reduce somnolence and cmax.less than a month after the fda approved the nda,elan patent issued as united states patent the patent.elan then received permission to market its newly approved tizanidine capsules under the trade name zanaflex capsules.in july,acorda acquired the rights to zanaflex tablets and zanaflex capsules in april,it launched the sale of zanaflex capsules.apotex had begun selling its generic tizanidine tablet product in,and was one of about ten companies to do so.at the time acorda began selling zanaflex capsules,apotex tizanidine tablet product had a five percent market share.
zanaflex capsules on the open market carried an fda label pertaining both to the capsules and the tablets.the preamble to this label invites doctors to distinguish between tablets and capsules,and between the drug when taken with food and without 
pharmacokinetic differences between zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets zanaflex capsules are not bioequivalent to zanaflex tablets in the fed state.the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the complex effects of food on tizanidine pharmacokinetics see pharmacokinetics and dosage and administration.
joint appendix at.the pharmacokinetics section of the label,under the subheading pharmacokinetic differences between zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets,advises consistent with the fda review of the zanaflex capsules nda that there is a percent increase in cmax when the tablets are administered with food,but that when the capsules are administered with food,cmax decreases by percent.consequently,the mean cmax for the c apsule when administered with food is approximately the cmax for the tablet when administered with food.id.
the label contains a graph that figures in a number of the false advertising claims.referred to as figure,the graph is titled mean tizanidine concentration time profiles for zanaflex tablets and capsules x mg under fasted and fed conditions.it displays the mean plasma tizanidine concentration at various hours from dosing.the peak for the curve representing tizanidine capsules taken with food is lower,and occurs later than the peak for the curve charting concentration over time for tizanidine tablets taken with food.
the label then explains,in the dosage and administration section,that pharmacokinetic differences between the fed and fasted state may affect the frequency and onset of certain adverse events.the text is in the margin somnolence is explicitly identified as one of these adverse events 
in,apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application anda a filing that seeks generic drug approval for an existing licensed medication or approved drug in order to sell generic tizanidine capsules which would provide competition to acorda zanaflex capsules.in the anda,apotex certified that it was not encroaching on any validly claimed intellectual property rights because the patent was invalid.in predictable response,acorda filed a suit in.after a bench trial,the united states district court for the district of new jersey brown,ruled in september that the patent was invalid.see acorda therapeutics apotex,geb mca,wl,at.
soon after that ruling,acorda filed a citizen petition with the fda raising problems with apotex anda.the citizen petition is a means afforded by the fda for raising concerns about products the fda reviews any individual may file such a petition concerning scientific or legal issues before or while the product is on the market.see.conceptually,citizen petitions provide an avenue for public input into the drug approval process but the process has been abused by pharmaceutical companies that file meritless petitions intended to delay approvals sought by their competitors and inhibit competition.acorda citizen petition objected to apotex statement that its product was bioequivalent to reference listed drugs rlds in the fed state and allegedly misleading or untrue statements in the proposed label for the apotex anda.
the fda denied acorda citizen petition on february.that same day,the fda approved apotex anda.the sherman act claim relies principally on the fda simultaneous dispositions.
with the green light from the fda,apotex launched its product.acorda countered with its own authorized generic version of zanaflex capsules.apotex contends that in the course of acorda marketing its representatives misrepresented to doctors that zanaflex capsules reduced cmax in comparison with the tablets and then improperly used reduction in cmax as a proxy for a corresponding decrease in somnolence and acorda distributed written promotional materials to the same effect.in total,acorda advertising efforts contributed to sales of more than million attributable to its version of zanaflex capsules.
apotex commenced this lawsuit in december,amending its complaint in february to include the fda denial of acorda citizen petition.acorda countered with a motion to dismiss,which the district court swain,granted with respect to the sherman act claim and denied with respect to the lanham act claims.the district court observed that apotex sherman act claim relied purely on temporal proximity the denial of acorda citizen petition on the same day the apotex anda was approved and concluded that was insufficient to state a claim in view of recent legislation making the requirements for delaying an anda application more stringent congress s explicit directive that anda processing should not ordinarily be delayed by a citizen petition,coupled with its narrowing for the grounds for any such delay and the statutory notice requirement,strongly undermines any inference that mere simultaneity of anda and citizen petition decisions is indicative of the delay of one by reason of pendency of the other.apotex et,acorda therapeutics,cv,doc.at swain,apotex i.apotex moved for leave to amend,but the motion was denied in the interest of judicial economy.
after the case was reassigned to judge torres,acorda successfully moved for summary judgment on the lanham act claims.judge torres began the analysis with the principle that i n the context of pharmaceutical drugs,courts have generally rejected lanham act claims based on advertisements that merely repeat labeling information that has been approved by the fda.apotex acorda therapeutics,cv at,wl,at,torres,apotex ii quoting mylan,proctor gamble,d.the court held that because many of the allegedly false representations were consistent with the product label,apotex failed to identify a genuine issue of material fact with respect to falsity of any of acorda representations,except one.id.at.the remaining representation was acorda placement of cmax data on figure,as to which the district court found that a reasonable juror could determine that the juxtaposition of this text and image communicates a literally false message.id.at.nevertheless,the claim did not survive because apotex failed to identify a material issue of fact as to the representation bearing on decisions to purchase.see id.at.
apotex appeals both decisions.
discussion 
apotex sherman act claim was dispatched at the stage,while its lanham act claims succumbed on summary judgment.on a motion to dismiss,all factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true and all inferences are drawn in the plaintiff favor.littlejohn city of,cir.we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b.id.and we review a district court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.presbyterian church of sudan talisman energy,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate when,having resolved all ambiguities and permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought,there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.baez jetblue airways,cir.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.savino city of,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.the grant of summary judgment in favor of acorda is likewise subject to de novo review.see baez,at.
the claim that acorda filing of a sham citizen petition constitutes illegal monopolization arises under section two of the sherman act,which imposes liability on e very person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several s tates.a complaint alleging that a competitor filed a sham citizen petition with the fda states a claim under that section.see in re ddavp direct purchaser antitrust,cir.for these purposes,a single sham petition may be analogized to a single sham litigation.a single lawsuit can violate antitrust law as long as it is both an objective and subjective sham.id.at.first,the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits s econd,the court should focus on whether the baseless lawsuit conceals an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.prof l real estate inv rs,columbia pictures,d emphasis in original quoting presidents conference noerr motor freight,d.because we conclude that apotex has failed to show that acorda citizen petition was objectively baseless,we affirm on the first ground and do not reach the second.
as relevant here,the factual basis for the claim in ddavp was that the sham petition caused a delay in generic competition,a possibility reinforced by the fact that the fda approved the generic drug on the same day that it rejected the petition.at.given the simultaneous grant of the anda and denial of the citizen petition,apotex argues that a straightforward application of ddavp justifies reversal the possibility that the petition was a sham,and that it impacted the fda decision,is sufficiently plausible to defeat the motion to dismiss.id.at.
however,the fda issued a new guidance for industry guidance explaining how the fda determines if a petition implicates an issue of public health,and how the fda process is affected by the simultaneous pendency of an anda application and a citizen petition dealing with the same drug.although this case partially arises on a motion to dismiss,we may properly take judicial notice of this document without converting acorda motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment because the guidance is publicly available and its accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.see.b staehr hartford fin.servs,cir although the general rule is that a district court may not look outside the complaint and the documents attached thereto in ruling on a rule b motion to dismiss,we have acknowledged that the court may also consider matters of which judicial notice may be taken.quoting kramer time warner,cir 
the guidance explains if a petition requests that the agency take an action related to a specific aspect of a pending application,we will consider the review status of the affected application s in determining whether it would be appropriate for the agency to respond to the request to take the action requested in the petition within the day timeframe.joint appendix at emphasis added.such consideration is necessary because of the differing procedural rights of an anda applicant and the writer of a citizen petition.t he agency must give the anda applicant notice of an opportunity for a hearing on whether the application is approvable,with a specific timeframe and process should the applicant request such a hearing.id.at.fda decisions adjudicating citizen petitions,on the other hand,are subject to immediate review by the courts.they therefore carry with them none of the procedural rights for the affected applicants that attach to a decision to deny approval of an application.id.to bring these procedural arrangements into sync,the fda states that it is preferable not to issue a decision on a citizen petition until it issues a decision on the corresponding anda application.see id.if we were to respond substantively to a petitioner request regarding the approvability of the application as a whole,such a response could interfere with the statutory and regulatory scheme governing the review of applications and related procedural rights of applicants.
although it remains conceivable,notwithstanding the guidance,that a citizen petition might cause anticompetitive delay,the guidance tends to undermine the inference drawn in ddavp and advocated now by apotex that when a citizen petition is denied simultaneously with the grant of an anda petition,the citizen petition was a sham and an anticompetitive weapon.the guidance favors contemporaneous adjudications to safeguard the procedural rights of anda applicants such as apotex 
apotex has pled no other facts from which it can plausibly be inferred that acorda petition was a sham.apotex alleges that,in the patent trial,acorda falsely mischaracterized testimony and scientific evidence relating to the bioequivalence of apotex product.but that allegation shows that apotex disagreed with the arguments acorda advanced in its citizen petition which is hardly surprising,not that the acorda citizen petition was a sham 
the fda letter rejecting acorda citizen petition reinforces this conclusion although acorda objections to apotex anda based on bioequivalence left the fda unpersuaded,the grounds for rejection were acorda use of arithmetic mean values for cmax instead of geometric mean values and acorda reliance on a comparison.nowhere does the fda find that acorda misrepresented testimony in the apotex acorda patent litigation.see joint appendix at the agency is not a party to that proceeding,and statements made in private litigation are not directly relevant to fda statutory obligation to determine the approvability of apotex anda.
similarly,with respect to acorda labeling argument,the fda disagree d with acorda that the cmax of apotex product in the fed state was increased compared to the rlds.id.at.apotex elides the distinction between arguments that fail to move the fda and arguments that are false and objectively baseless.as the supreme court has cautioned,courts need to resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that an ultimately unsuccessful action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.real estate inv rs,at quoting christiansburg garment equal emp t opportunity comm n,d.accordingly,the objective component of apotex claim is lacking so there is no need to evaluate acorda subjective motivations in filing the petition.
apotex relies on in re suboxone antitrust,d,which is inapposite.the district court in suboxone held that a section two claim based on the filing of a sham citizen petition survived dismissal because of the many indicia that the petition was objectively baseless.among the indicia the fda acknowledged in its ruling that it had no authority to grant much of the requested relief,id.at and the competitor that filed the citizen petition requested that the fda investigate why suboxone tablets had been withdrawn from the market even though the competitor was continuing to sell the product at that time.id.at.it was therefore plausibly pled that the petition was objectively baseless in that no reasonable litigant could have realistically expected success on the merits.id.here,however,the only fact apotex has pled other than the timing of the fda decision on acorda citizen petition is that acorda citizen petition was ultimately fruitless 
in the alternative,apotex argues that the district court denial of leave to amend the antitrust claim was based on a misapplication of the rules set forth in the southern district pilot project regarding case management techniques for complex civil cases pilot rules.however,the district court denied the motion to amend in the interests of judicial economy,not because of apotex noncompliance with the pilot rules.apotex sought to amend in order to cite the fda fourth annual report to congress,issued in december,detailing the ineffectiveness of the fdaaa.the district court found that this report was available to apotex before its decision issued dismissing apotex claims in february,that acorda expressly relied on the fdaaa in its initial motion to dismiss apotex sherman act claim,and that apotex brought the fda annual report to the district court attention only after acorda motion to dismiss was adjudicated.because apotex delayed seeking leave to include the fda fourth annual report until march,and because the general findings of the report were largely immaterial to apotex specific claim,the district court concluded that the interests of judicial economy warranted denial of apotex motion.we have consistently afforded district courts latitude to deny leave to amend on this basis.see ruffolo oppenheimer,cir where it appears that granting leave to amend is unlikely to be productive,however,it is not an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend.
in sum,apotex has not stated a claim under section two of the sherman act,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying apotex leave to amend.the district court decision dismissing apotex antitrust claim is affirmed.
the lanham act prohibition on false advertising states 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services uses in commerce any false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by such act.
a.false advertising claims based on this proviso contain two components.
first and obviously,a plaintiff bringing a false advertising claim must show falsity.there are two ways to do that.first,a plaintiff can demonstrate that the challenged advertisement is literally false,false on its face.time warner cable,directv,cir.c onsumer deception is presumed,and the court may grant relief without reference to the advertisement actual impact on the buying public.id.quoting coca cola tropicana,cir.this inquiry requires evaluating the message conveyed in full context.id.at quoting castrol pennzoil,cir.if the words or images,considered in context,necessarily imply a false message,the advertisement is literally false and no extrinsic evidence of consumer confusion is required.id.importantly,however,only an unambiguous message can be literally false,if the language or graphic is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,the advertisement can not be literally false.id.quoting novartis consumer health,johnson johnson merck pharms,cir.one kind of literally false claim is a claim of superiority.the premise is that the defendant ad vertisement explicitly or implicitly represents that tests or studies prove its product superior and plaintiff satisfies its burden by showing that the tests did not establish the proposition for which they were cited.castrol,quaker state,cir.
alternatively,a plaintiff can show that the advertisement,while not literally false,is nevertheless likely to mislead or confuse consumers.time warner,at.such an implicit falsity claim requires a comparison of the impression left by the statement,rather than the statement itself,with the truth.id.quoting schering pfizer,cir.w hereas plaintiffs seeking to establish a literal falsehood must generally show the substance of what is conveyed,a district court must rely on extrinsic evidence of consumer deception or confusion to support a finding of an implicitly false message.id.second alteration in original quoting schering,at.
falsity alone does not make a false advertising claim viable u nder either theory,the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the false or misleading representation involved an inherent or material quality of the product.id.such a requirement is essentially one of materiality,a term explicitly used in other circuits.johnson son,clorox,cir quoting basketball ass motorola,cir.this court has defined materiality as likely to influence purchasing decisions,a definition in harmony with other circuits use of the term.basketball ass n,at quoting am.winback conserve program,cir 
a majority of apotex claims attack acorda representations as inconsistent with the label for zanaflex capsules.a prior question is whether representations that are wholly consistent with an fda label are subject to lanham act liability.this court has yet to so hold,although a number of district courts in this circuit have sensibly adhered to this principle we agree with these courts and now hold that representations commensurate with information in an fda label generally can not form the basis for lanham act liability 
such a rule reflects proper deference to the expertise of the fda as the regulatory agency responsible for issuing the label by respecting the exhaustive process preceding the issuance of a label.am.home prods.johnson johnson,conner,see also smithkline beecham,wl,at.this principle rightfully insulates pharmaceutical companies from liability when they engage in first amendment speech that is consistent with the directive of the regulatory body having oversight of product labels.
we have been careful not to permit overextension of the lanham act to intrude on first amendment values.groden random house,cir.accordingly,in order to avoid chilling speech that ought to be protected,acorda advertisements can not form the basis for apotex claims to the extent they were in line with the label.
apotex,however,goes further and contends that acorda advertisements exceeded the boundaries imposed by the fda label.each of apotex specific lanham act challenges is now considered.
statements by acorda sales representatives 
apotex challenges statements,attributable to acorda sales representatives,that patients taking zanaflex capsules with food enjoy the benefits of reduced cmax,including dosing flexibility and diminished somnolence.representative samples of these sales pitches include the following 
upon learning of the ability to decrease somnolence by using zanaflex capsules,the doctors agreed to give it a try.
joint appendix at 
i explained to the doctor that the c apsule is really unique in that it counteracts a lot of the drowsiness when you dose it with food.he said he would give that a try and see how well it works for his patients.
joint appendix at.
when acorda learned that its representatives may have made unauthorized promotional claims for zanaflex capsules,acorda head of sales sent a memorandum to the sales team explicitly forbidding promotions that zanaflex capsules had fewer side effects and less sedation than the tablets.
apotex specifically objects to representations that zanaflex capsules provide more flexibility than the capsules counterpart the tablets a point on which the fda label is silent.however,statements that zanaflex capsules reduce cmax when taken with food are fully consistent with the fda label,as the district court correctly found,and lanham act liability therefore can not attach to these statements.see apotex ii,wl,at.to the extent apotex challenges statements about dosing flexibility,it misconstrues its burden.it is not enough to show that acorda made representations absent from the fda label instead,apotex must show that these comments were inconsistent with the fda label in a manner sufficient to support a false advertising claim.see procter gamble chesebrough pond,cir e ach plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the challenged advertisement is false and misleading,not merely that it is unsubstantiated by acceptable tests or other proof.internal citations omitted.apotex has adduced no evidence that acorda promotion of dosing flexibility was either literally false or likely to cause consumer confusion.
apotex next argues that acorda sales representatives used cmax as a proxy for somnolence and improperly claimed that zanaflex capsules reduce it.critically,apotex relies on a superiority argument that the representations relied on tests or studies allegedly proving the superiority of zanaflex capsules.the district court,however,properly rejected liability under the superiority theory.
the theory comes into play only when the defendant ad vertisement explicitly or implicitly represents that tests or studies prove its product superior castrol,at emphasis added.apotex proffers no evidence that sales representatives referred to tests or studies when they discussed the potential of zanaflex capsules to reduce somnolence.at most,acorda representatives used figure or a similar graph of pharmacokinetic results as a tool to aid their reduced somnolence pitch.there is no record evidence that acorda representatives used graphs of pharmacokinetic results to represent that zanaflex capsules reduced somnolence.consider one of the statements at issue 
talked to corondan for the first time.i asked him about the most common complaint with zanaflex tablets and he said the drowsiness and then we went to the graph and i discussed the c apsules which is how i love a call to work out.
joint appendix at.at no point in this passage is it explicitly stated or implied that figure necessarily shows that zanaflex capsules reduce somnolence instead,the graph was used as a tool for further discussion.the district court reasoning on this issue was sound a t most,the statements suggest that,due to pharmacokinetic differences between the products,zanaflex c apsules cause less somnolence than zanaflex tablets when taken with food.the statements do not,by contrast,explicitly or implicitly represent that tests or studies prove that there is less somnolence with zanaflex c apsules.apotex ii,wl,at third alteration in original quoting castrol,at.unable to identify a misrepresentation based on superiority,apotex is left to find a genuine issue of material fact on falsity on some other theory something it has failed to do.it is immaterial that no study has shown a reduction in somnolence associated with zanaflex capsules chesebrough makes clear that apotex must show falsity,not merely uncertainty.moreover,acorda somnolence representations find a harbor in the fda label,which states that increased adverse events,such as somnolence,may occur when switching between the tablets and capsules in the fed state.reinforcing this conclusion,the fda medical review concluded that the most problematic situation in terms of exacerbating somnolence was switching from the capsules to the tablets in the fed state.in other words,the fda has given some support to acorda representations more importantly,however,there is no evidence that the representations are false.there is no basis to disturb the grant of summary judgment relating to acorda sales representatives statements.
acorda promotional materials 
supplementing representations by acorda sales team were written promotional materials heralding the benefits of zanaflex capsules in a manner apotex believes was false and misleading.apotex specifically attacks acorda gatefold brochure,a piece of advertising that acorda disseminated in the thousands.the front cover announces flexible control in a capsule directly above two images of the sun and the moon with the words day and night printed underneath.the bottom of the front cover urges for treatment of spasticity when relief is most important.the second page contains figure juxtaposed with relevant cmax data,along with additional text at the bottom of the graph.the text reads 
effects and adverse events are dose related to plasma levels of tizanidine.
significant pharmacokinetic changes including plasma level differences occur when administering zanaflex capsules or tablets with food.
these pharmacokinetic differences can result in clinically important differences in effectiveness and adverse events.
joint appendix at.see appendix 
apotex asserts that the brochure is misleading as a whole because the sun and moon imagery,with the text underneath the graph on page of the brochure,delivers the message that zanaflex capsules undoubtedly reduce cmax and somnolence.
although acorda argues that it merely reprinted the graph from the fda label in its advertisements including the gatefold brochure apotex accuses acorda of manipulation because the following text is superimposed on the graph increase for tablets decrease for capsules.joint appendix at.apotex argues that the graphic,as a whole,conveys a false message because figure depicts mean tizanidine concentration,which is the average drug concentration at different points in time,while the text relates to cmax data,which is the maximum drug concentration at different time points and,by definition,different from the mean drug concentration.see appendix 
with the exception of the version of figure with superimposed text,apotex fails to create a triable issue of fact as to the falsity of the brochure.literal falsity can not be shown because no unambiguous message is conveyed by the remainder of the brochure apotex argues that the presence of the sun and the moon implies that the drug is equally effective during the day and at night and thereby implies efficacy in c
