defendants own and manage,a website with a mission to save you time,money and even a trip to the dmv,home page,last visited.consumers visit for help renewing driver licenses,buying car insurance,viewing driving records,beating traffic tickets,registering vehicles,even finding attorneys.the more eyeballs attracts,the more money defendants earn from selling sponsored links and collecting fees for referring site visitors to vendors of traffic school courses,driver ed lessons and other services.this seems like a legitimate and useful business,except that some visitors mistakenly believe the site is run by their state department of motor vehicles dmv.
plaintiffs,and drivers ed direct,llc market and sell traffic school and driver ed courses directly to consumers.they also compete with for referral revenue.plaintiffs claim that defendants violated federal and state unfair competition and false advertising laws by actively fostering the belief that is an official state dmv website,or is affiliated or endorsed by a state dmv.
after a trial,the district court held that defendants violated section a of the lanham act,a,but rejected plaintiffs claim under california unfair competition statute,cal.bus.the court issued an injunction ordering to present every site visitor with a splash screen bearing a disclaimer.unhappily for plaintiffs,the court denied monetary relief and declined to award attorney fees.both sides appeal.
the district court found that plaintiffs failed to prove that they have suffered an injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of defendants actions,and that they provided no evidence showing a causal connection between defendants actions and any harm plaintiffs incurred.defendants argue that this finding divested the district court of jurisdiction,and also that plaintiffs lacked standing under the lanham act.the latter contention is wrong because a false advertising plaintiff need only believe that he is likely to be injured in order to bring a lanham act claim.a.moreover,the district court made its findings of no injury when it analyzed plaintiffs unfair competition claim.these findings conclusively establish that plaintiffs did have standing to bring their claim but,because california unfair competition law defines injury in fact more narrowly than does article iii,the findings do necessarily preclude article iii standing.see cal.bus.
the district court,however,failed to analyze article iii standing,which is required to establish a justiciable case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.gerlinger,cir.we have held that the absence of standing under the antitrust laws affects a plaintiff ability to recover,but does not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court,as the absence of article iii standing would.id.this is equally true for false advertising claims,so the district court should have undertaken an independent analysis of article iii standing before determining standing under the lanham act.see ford nylcare health plans of gulf coast,cir.
constitutional standing calls for the familiar trio of injury in fact,causation and redressability.see allen wright,levine vilsack,cir.defendants contend that plaintiffs lack all three,but their arguments regarding causation and redressability are derivative of the district court finding.we therefore construe defendants challenge to be limited to the requirement.
in a false advertising suit,a plaintiff establishes article iii injury if some consumers who bought the defendant product under a mistaken belief fostered by the defendant would have otherwise bought the plaintiff product.joint stock soc y udv,cir.the plaintiff can prove his injury using actual market experience and probable market behavior.adams watson,cir.this makes sense,because proving a counterfactual is never easy,and is especially difficult when the injury consists of lost sales that are predicated on the independent decisions of third parties,customers.am.soc y of travel agents,blumenthal.cir bazelon,dissenting.a plaintiff who ca produce lost sales data may therefore establish an injury by creating a chain of inferences showing how defendant false advertising could harm plaintiff business.
plaintiffs introduced ample evidence that they compete with defendants for referral revenue sometimes partnering with the same traffic school or driver ed course providers.sales gained by one are thus likely to come at the other expense.evidence of direct competition is strong proof that plaintiffs have a stake in the outcome of the suit,so their injury is conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife.plaintiffs also presented testimonial and survey evidence that a recommended by dmv endorsement is an important factor in consumers choice of traffic schools and driver ed classes.it stands to reason that defendants will capture a larger share of the referral market to plaintiffs detriment if they mislead consumers into believing that referrals are recommended by their state dmv.plaintiffs have therefore established sufficient injury for article iii standing.
b.we set out the test for lanham act standing in jack russell terrier network of northern california american kennel club,cir,where we held that a plaintiff must show a commercial injury based upon a misrepresentation about a product and that the injury is competitive,or harmful to the plaintiff ability to compete with the defendant.defendants first argue that plaintiffs fail the competitive prong of jack russell because is the internet incarnation of the basic publishing business that has existed for decades if not centuries,while plaintiffs websites are tools.but plaintiffs introduced evidence that they compete with in the traffic school and driver ed referral markets in a number of states.based on this evidence,the district court found that plaintiffs and defendants are competitors,with at least a portion of plaintiffs business.this finding is clearly erroneous.see polykoff collins,f d,cir.
defendants also argue that plaintiffs fail the jack russell test because the only injury the district court identified was to the public.we agree that plaintiffs have not proven an identifiable injury to themselves,but proof of such injury is the same as proof of commercial injury,which is what jack russell requires.at.defendants confusion is understandable,however,because jack russell never explained how a plaintiff should go about proving commercial injury,nor did barrus sylvania,cir,the case jack russell cited in support of the commercial injury test.
the lanham act permits any person to sue if he believes that he is likely to be damaged.a emphasis added.because a likely injury is far less certain than an actual injury,plaintiffs need not prove the latter to establish the commercial injury necessary for lanham act standing.see johnson johnson carter wallace,cir see also harper house,thomas nelson,cir holding that a competitor need not prove past injury when suing to enjoin conduct that violates section a,in part because the competitor may suffer future injury.
we have generally presumed commercial injury when defendant and plaintiff are direct competitors and defendant misrepresentation has a tendency to mislead consumers.in waits frito lay,cir,we held that a plaintiff bringing a false advertising suit had to show a discernibly competitive injury,and gave the following example 
if a film distributor wrongfully indicates that a film is pg rated when in reality it should be r rated,a competitor with a film would have standing the misrated film theoretically draws young audiences away from the competitor film because of the misrepresentation concerning the suitability of its content.
id.at.thus,when plaintiff competes directly with defendant,a misrepresentation will give rise to a presumed commercial injury that is sufficient to establish standing.
there are good reasons to presume that a competitor bringing a false advertising claim has suffered a commercial injury.competitors vie for the same dollars from the same consumer group,and a misleading ad can upset their relative competitive positions.kournikova media commc ns,d.moreover,the lanham act is at heart a consumer protection statute.u haul int l,jartran,inc,cir u haul i see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy see also alex kozinski,trademarks unplugged,the great evil the lanham act seeks to prevent is that of consumers being duped into buying a watch they later discover was made by someone other than rolex.footnote omitted.requiring proof that defendant ads caused plaintiff to lose sales as a prerequisite to bringing suit would frustrate its ability to act as the fabled vicarious avenger of the consuming public.mccarthy see johnson johnson,at.but see sanfield,finlay fine jewelry,cir competitor is not a public prosecutor and must therefore prove past or potential injury.
we need not decide today whether our presumption of commercial injury is conclusive or rebuttable because defendants did point to any evidence such as an increase in plaintiffs sales that might tend to rebut the presumption.see sanfield,at finding no past or future injury in part because plaintiff sales rose during the months covered by its claims.we therefore presume that plaintiffs suffered a commercial injury.
plaintiffs lanham act standing thus turns on the second half of jack russell commercial injury prong whether ads are misleading.see jack russell,at.after extensively reviewing the evidence,the district court found that entire site had a tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience.see southland sod farms stover seed,cir.
the court discussed several facets of the website that were likely to mislead consumers into thinking was affiliated with a government agency.at the time plaintiffs filed their suit,anyone in california who googled dmv or drivers ed would see sponsored listings for or,respectively clicking those listings would take the googler to.while there nothing inherently misleading about sponsored search results,they can mislead if they are named so as to give a false impression as to the likely sponsorship of the website to which they refer.see toyota motor sales,tabari,cir.defendants use of the ca.and california.prefixes obviously was designed to suggest an affiliation with the state of california.site design also mimicked an actual dmv site by copying slogans and state symbols,and by linking to web pages elsewhere on the site that helped consumers complete transactions like applying for a license,registering a car and signing up for traffic school.dmv.org did disclaim connection with state dmvs,but this disclaimer was easy to miss because it was displayed in small font at the bottom of each page,where many consumers would never scroll.
plaintiffs also introduced evidence of actual consumer confusion.they provided two declarations from individuals who confused with an official dmv site and hundreds of emails sent by consumers who contacted thinking it was their state dmv.some of these emails contained sensitive personal information that the typical consumer would share with a commercial website.here an example,with redactions 
my boyfriend george redacted got a ticket in south carolina in redacted driver license number is redacted.his date of birth is redacted.i have his social security number if needed,but i do want to put all of his personal information on this if possible i was told by central court for lexington county in south carolina that if we contacted the arkansas dmv that all would be able to tell us what court this is in and where to pay the ticket.
other emails were sent by law enforcement officials and state dmv employees who were similarly confused by.for example,a washington state trooper emailed asking 
dear oregon dmv,i am currently involved in a dui case in which a driver used his friends sic id but i remember it having his picture.it is an oregon id in the name of redacted.i would like to see if i can get a copy of the to me for identification purposes.the dui arrest occurred on september,in snohomish county,wa.
plaintiffs also produced evidence that two california cities,a private law firm in texas and a number of newspapers mistakenly linked their websites to instead of a state dmv website.
in addition to this anecdotal evidence,the district court examined internet surveys submitted by the parties.plaintiffs survey showed that a majority of california residents searching online for traffic schools believed that website was actually the california dmv and a search engine listing for was endorsed or sponsored by the california dmv.the court pointed out significant flaws in the survey including plaintiffs failure to use a control but found it more credible than defendants survey and gave it some weight.we share the district court concerns with plaintiffs survey,but ca find that the court erred by considering it along with the other evidence.
plaintiffs introduced volumes of evidence showing that they compete with defendants and that probably misleads consumers.because we presume commercial injury in this case,plaintiffs have met both prongs of jack russell test for lanham act standing.
false advertising 
to succeed on an internet false advertising claim,a plaintiff must show that a statement made in a commercial advertisement or promotion is false or misleading,that it actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience,that it likely to influence purchasing decisions and that the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured by the false advertisement.see southland sod farms,at as we explained,see supra,the district court made extensive findings in support of its conclusion that the url,defendants search engine marketing strategy and the design of were likely to,and did,confuse consumers.none of these findings was clearly erroneous,and they establish that the site deceives a substantial segment of its audience.plaintiffs evidence also shows that a recommended by dmv endorsement will affect purchase decisions,and that plaintiffs are likely to suffer injury when consumers visit instead of their competing sites.the district court committed no error in holding that defendants violated the lanham act.
by way of a remedy,the district court ordered to present every site visitor with a splash screen stating,you are about to enter a privately owned website that is not owned or operated by any state government agency.visitors ca access content without clicking a continue button on the splash screen defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by fashioning a blanket injunction that overbroad,restrains conduct not at issue in plaintiffs complaint and violates the first amendment.
overbreadth.the district court reasoned that the splash screen was necessary to remedy any confusion that consumers have already developed before visiting for the first time,remedy the public interest concerns associated with confused visitors transfer of sensitive information to defendants,and prevent confusion among consumers.defendants argue that the splash screen does effectuate these stated goals.but their only evidence is a declaration from ceo stating that defendants tested several alternative disclaimers and found them to be more effective than the splash screen in preventing consumers from emailing with sensitive personal information.to the extent we credit a declaration,see sec phan,cir,defendants evidence does prove that the splash screen is ineffective in this respect,and says nothing about whether the alternative disclaimers serve the other two interests identified by the district court.defendants have carried their heavy burden of showing that their alternative disclaimers reduce likelihood of confusing consumers.austl.gold,hatfield,cir citing home box office,movie channel,cir.the scope of an injunction is within the broad discretion of the district court,interstellar starship,epix,cir,and the district court here did abuse that discretion when it concluded that the splash screen was the optimal means of correcting defendants false advertising.
first amendment.courts routinely grant permanent injunctions prohibiting deceptive advertising.see charles mckenney george long iii,federal unfair competition lanham act a ed.because false or misleading commercial statements are constitutionally protected,see cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,seuss,penguin books usa,inc,cir,such injunctions rarely raise first amendment concerns.
the permanent injunction here does raise such concerns because it erects a barrier to all content on the website,not merely that which is deceptive.some of the website content is informational and thus fully protected,such as guides to applying for a driver license,buying insurance and beating traffic tickets.see mattel,mca records,cir.the informational content is commingled with truthful commercial speech,which is entitled to significant first amendment protection.see cent.hudson,at.the district court was required to tailor the injunction so as to burden no more protected speech than necessary.madsen women health,nissan motor nissan computer,cir.
the district court does not appear to have considered that its injunction would permanently and unnecessarily burden access to first content.the splash screen forces potential visitors to take an additional navigational step,deterring some consumers from entering the website altogether it also precludes defendants from tailoring landing page to make it welcoming to visitors,and interferes with the operation of search engines,making it more difficult for consumers to find the website and its protected content all of these burdens on protected speech are,under the current injunction,permanent.
the district court premised its injunction on its findings that defendants search engine marketing and natural listings,including the domain name,caused consumers to be confused even before they viewed content.the court also identified specific misleading statements on the website.the splash screen is justified to remedy the harm caused by such practices so long as they continue.but website content and advertising practices can and do change over time.indeed,the court found that defendants had already made some changes to and how they marketed it.
the splash screen is also justified so long as it helps to remedy lingering confusion caused by defendants past deception.but the splash screen will continue to burden protected content,even if all remaining harm has dissipated.at that point,the injunction will burden protected speech without justification,thus burdening more speech than necessary.see madsen,at nissan motor,at see also gallo winery gallo cattle,cir permanent injunction ca burden future business practices u haul int l,jartran,cir u haul ii permanent injunction ca burden future truthful advertising.
on remand,the district court shall reconsider the duration of the splash screen in light of any intervening changes in the website content and marketing practices,as well as the dissipation of the deception resulting from past practices.if the district court continues to require the splash screen,it shall explain the continuing justification for burdening the website protected content and what conditions defendants must satisfy in order to remove the splash screen in the future.in the alternative,or in addition,the court may permanently enjoin defendants from engaging in deceptive marketing or placing misleading statements on.see u haul ii,at modifying injunction to prohibit only false or misleading advertising.
c.the district court denied plaintiffs request for an award of profits because they provided no evidence of causation or evidence quantifying the extent of any harm they suffered as a result of actions.nothing in the lanham act conditions an award of profits on plaintiff proof of harm,and we held that profits may be awarded in the absence of such proof.see southland sod farms,at u haul ii,f d at.but an award of profits with no proof of harm is an uncommon remedy in a false advertising suit.it appropriate in false comparative advertising cases,where it reasonable to presume that every dollar defendant makes has come directly out of plaintiff pocket.see,u haul ii,at u haul i,at newspaper ad falsely stated that defendant rental trucks were bigger,newer and more than trucks in plaintiff fleet.it also appropriate where ordinary damages wo deter unlawful conduct for example,when defendant associates its product with plaintiff noncompetitive product to appropriate good will or brand value.see,maier brewing fleischmann distilling,cir brewer of black white beer forced to pay profits to distiller of black white scotch.the reason there is that plaintiff is unlikely to have lost any sales or sale contracts to defendant,and the damages must be measured by defendant gains from the illicit use.
but neither the comparative advertising nor good will cases are relevant here,where plaintiffs claim that defendant s advertised a different and allegedly better product than they delivered.harper house,at.the lanham act allows an award of profits only to the extent the award shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.a.but when advertising does not directly compare defendant and plaintiff products,the injury to plaintiff may be a small fraction of the defendant sales,profits,or advertising expenses.harper house,at.plaintiffs did produce any proof of past injury or causation,so the district court had no way to determine with any degree of certainty what award would be compensatory.see alpo petfoods,ralston purina,t he court must ensure that the record adequately supports all items of damages lest the award become speculative or violate the lanham act prohibition against punishment.see also mccarthy explaining that some quantum of lost sales must be proven.the district court did err in denying damages.
attorney fees 
section of the lanham act permits an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party in exceptional cases.a.the district court denied plaintiffs attorney fees and gave the following justification 
while plaintiffs have obtained injunctive relief,they have been awarded no damages.accordingly,and in light of plaintiffs unclean hands,the court does not find that this case is exceptional and declines to award attorney fees for the lanham act claim.
we review the denial of attorney fees for abuse of discretion,see polo fashions,dick bruhn,cir,and must affirm unless the district court applied the wrong legal standard or its findings were illogical,implausible or without support in the record,see united states hinkson,cir en banc 
lanham act cases generally consider whether defendants conduct was fraudulent,deliberate,or willful.horphag research garcia,cir see earthquake sound bumper,cir summarizing case law on exceptionality see also lindy pen bic pen,cir g enerally a trademark case is exceptional for purposes of an award of attorneys fees when the infringement is malicious,fraudulent,deliberate or willful.by examining only the relief awarded to plaintiffs,and failing to consider defendants conduct,the district court applied the wrong legal standard.see lahoti vericheck,cir.
no doubt,the court may take plaintiffs failure to recover damages into account when exercising its discretion to award fees,but it must also consider that plaintiffs obtained a judgment and an injunction that ameliorate a serious public harm.in addition,the court must weigh the unlawfulness of defendants conduct.it would be inequitable to force plaintiffs to bear the entire cost of enjoining defendants willful deception when the injunction confers substantial benefits on the public.see comm.for idaho high desert,yost,cir plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees when district court awarded injunction but not damages audi ag,cir same.plaintiffs put an end to the confusion created by and stopped consumers from mistakenly transferring sensitive personal information to a commercial website.this conferred significant benefits on third parties and also vindicated plaintiffs right to a market free of false advertising.johnson johnson,at.the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider these substantial benefits or defendants bad acts in determining whether to award attorney fees.
defendants challenge the district court finding that their deception was willful and thus exceptional under horphag and lindy pen.but the district court willfulness find
