while redressing injuries caused by the cigarette industry is one of the most troubling problems facing our nation today,fda brown williamson tobacco,d,not every wrong can have a legal remedy,pearl city of long beach,cir,at least not without causing collateral damage to the fabric of our laws.plaintiffs putative class action suffers from an insurmountable deficit of collective legal or factual questions.their claims are brought as based in fraud under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,but under rico,each plaintiff must prove reliance,injury,and damages.moreover,some undetermined number of plaintiffs claims are.rule is not a ratchet,empowering a judge to conform the law to the proof.we therefore reverse the order of the district court and decertify the class.
plaintiffs,a group of smokers allegedly defendants marketing and believing that light cigarettes lights were healthier than cigarettes,sought and were granted class certification.schwab philip morris usa,d jack weinstein,judge.plaintiffs suit is brought under rico,with mail and wire fraud as the necessary predicate acts.see c forbidding any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity see also id.providing that mail and wire fraud constitute racketeering activity id.mail fraud statute id.wire fraud statute.the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is that defendants implicit representation that lights were healthier led them to buy lights in greater quantity than they otherwise would have and at an artificially high price,resulting in plaintiffs overpayment for cigarettes.plaintiffs allege claims arising from their purchase of lights from,when defendants first introduced lights,until the date on which trial commences 
we pause in our narrative briefly to explain the history of lights,as that history bears on plaintiffs claims.in,the federal trade commission ftc adopted the cigarette advertising guides,which proscribed any implicit or explicit health claims in cigarette advertising except claims that a cigarette was low in nicotine or tars provided it ha d been established by competent scientific proof that the claim wa s true,and if true,that such difference or differences we re significant.united states philip morris usa,d.
several years later,in,the ftc introduced the cambridge filter method for calculating tar and nicotine yield.the cambridge filter method,however,which relies upon a machine to test the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes,is quite unreliable.most smokers who smoke lights obtain just as much tar and nicotine as they would if they smoked cigarettes,principally by compensating that is,either by inhaling more smoke per cigarette,by covering ventilation holes,drawing more deeply with each puff,or by buying more cigarettes,schwab,d at,neither of which a machine is capable of doing.cigarette manufacturers have apparently been aware of this phenomenon for some time.see philip morris,d at aspinall philip morris.but some smokers continued at least until to believe that lights were healthier than cigarettes.as the district court noted,citing a brown williamson internal marketing study,a lmost all smokers agree that the primary reason for the increasing acceptance of lights is based on the health reassurance they seem to offer.schwab,d at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in,however,the national cancer institute published a report,monograph,that review ed evidence on the ftc method for measuring tar and nicotine yields and the disease risks of cigarettes.at.the stated objective of the report was to determine whether the evidence taken as a whole shows that the cumulative effect of engineering changes in cigarette design over the last years has reduced disease risks in smokers.id.monograph discussed the introduction and marketing of cigarettes,the growing use of these cigarettes,and the practice of compensatory smoking.ultimately,it concluded that there was no convincing evidence that changes in cigarette design between and the mid have resulted in an important decrease in the disease burden caused by cigarette use either for smokers as a group or for the whole population.id.at.the publication of monograph sparked both this suit,filed in may,and a parallel civil rico action brought by the federal government 
plaintiffs seek billion in economic damages trebled stemming from their purchases of lights.on september,the district court certified their proposed class of lights smokers.on november,this court stayed the proceedings below and granted defendants leave to take an interlocutory appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f.we now reverse the district court class certification order and decertify the class.
discussion 
we review the district court certification order for abuse of discretion.see moore painewebber,cir.we will exercise even greater deference when the district court has certified a class than when it has declined to do so.marisol by forbes giuliani,cir.however,as we recently made clear,a district judge may not certify a class without making a ruling that each rule requirement is met and all evidence must be assessed as with any other threshold issue,whether or not any such assessment also bears on the merits of the case.miles merrill lynch in re initial pub.offerings sec.litig,cir hereinafter in re ipo emphasis added.
rule a requires that a class action possess four familiar features numerosity commonality typicality and adequacy of representation.if those criteria are met,the district court must next determine whether the class can be maintained under any one of the three subdivisions of rule b.with respect to class actions for money damages sought under rule b,the district court must also find that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that the class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b the primary issue in this case,to which we now turn,is whether the requirement that common questions predominate has been met.because we answer this question in the negative,we need not address whether a class action is a superior method of adjudicating plaintiffs claims.
elements of a civil rico claim and the predominance requirement 
section c of title civil rico gives private citizens a cause of action under rico by providing that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of rico substantive provisions may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.c.to fulfill the requirement that the injury occur by reason of a defendant action,a plaintiff must show that the defendant violation not only was a but for cause of his injury,but was the proximate cause as well.holmes sec.investor prot,d see also commercial cleaning,colin serv,cir rico use of the clause by reason of has been held to limit standing to those plaintiffs who allege that the asserted rico violation was the legal,or proximate,cause of their injury,as well as a logical,or but for,cause.but for causation is also known as transaction causation,or reliance,while proximate causation is often referred to as loss causation.see,moore painewebber,cir powers british vita,cir see also dura,broudo,d noting that reliance is often referred to as transaction causation.thus,a plaintiff asserting a civil rico claim must be able to support allegations of a rico violation,injury,and transaction and loss causation.first nationwide bank gelt funding,cir.in this case,to prevail in their argument for class certification,plaintiffs must establish that the issues of injury and causation do not defeat the predominance requirement of rule b.for the reasons that follow,we find that plaintiffs have failed to meet this burden.
in cases such as this one when mail or wire fraud is the predicate act for a civil rico claim,the transaction or but for causation element requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he relied on the defendant misrepresentation.see caviness derand res,cir a claim under rico requires both reliance and damage proximately caused by the violation.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir noting,in the securities fraud context,that a plaintiff is required to prove both transaction causation also known as reliance and loss causation.transaction causation only requires allegations that but for the claimed misrepresentations or omissions,the plaintiff would not have entered into the detrimental securities transaction.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in this case,the plaintiffs argue,and the district court agreed,that they can prove reliance on a basis,using generalized proof,because defendants conducted a national marketing campaign for lights and therefore represented that lights were healthier than cigarettes in a consistent,singular,uniform fashion.appellees br.at.in other words,plaintiffs underscore that defendants fraud resulted from a common course of conduct and therefore argue that common issues predominate.to support their argument,plaintiffs invoke our discussion in moore,in which we stated that f raud actions must be separated into two categories fraud claims based on uniform misrepresentations made to all members of the class and fraud claims based on individualized misrepresentations.the former are appropriate subjects for class certification because the standardized misrepresentations may be established by generalized proof.at.
but proof of widespread and uniform satisfies half of the equation the other half,reliance on the misrepresentation,can not be the subject of general proof.individualized proof is needed to overcome the possibility that a member of the purported class purchased lights for some reason other than the belief that lights were a healthier example,if a lights smoker was unaware of that representation,preferred the taste of lights,or chose lights as an expression of personal style.see id.at in order to establish defendant liability,each plaintiff must prove that he or she personally received a material misrepresentation,and that his or her reliance on this misrepresentation was the proximate cause of his or her loss.gunnells healthplan,cir t he reliance element of fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims is not readily susceptible to proof rather,proof of reasonable reliance depends upon a inquiry into what information each plaintiff actually had.omissions in original alterations,internal quotation marks,and citation omitted simon merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir noting that if written misrepresentations do not actually reach members of the purported class,they are no more valid a basis for a class action than dissimilar oral representations,which can not sustain a class action.we took account of this idea in moore,when we recognized that,o n the other hand,although having some common core,a fraud case may be unsuited for treatment as a class action if there was material variation in the kinds or degrees of reliance by the persons to whom they were addressed.at quoting.b advisory committee notes.
plaintiffs and the district court suggest that defendants distorted the body of public information and that,in purchasing lights,plaintiffs relied upon the public general sense that lights were healthier than cigarettes,whether or not individual plaintiffs were actually aware of defendants alleged misrepresentation.falise am.tobacco,d,where the fraudulent scheme is targeted broadly at a large proportion of the american public,the requisite showing of reliance is less demanding.such sophisticated,fraudulent schemes by their very nature are likely to be designed to distort the entire body of public knowledge.their argument invokes the presumption set forth in basic levinson,d,which concerned fraud claims in the securities context the market doctrine creates a rebuttable presumption that misrepresentations by an issuer affect the price of securities traded in the open market,and investors rely on the market price of securities as an accurate measure of their intrinsic value.hevesi citigroup,cir.thus,a plaintiff alleging securities fraud may establish reliance simply by virtue of the defendant public dissemination of misleading information.see basic,at.noting that because the price of stock in an efficient market reflects all publicly available information,m isleading statements will defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.
we do not think that the basic presumption,or the district court variation of it,applies in this case we can not assume that,regardless of whether individual smokers were aware of defendants misrepresentation,the market at large internalized the misrepresentation to such an extent that all plaintiffs can be said to have relied on it.basic involved an efficient market in securities traded on the new york stock of rapidly assimilating public information into stock prices,see id.at.describing the securities market as impersonal,and the market for consumer goods,however,is anything but efficient,sikes teleline,cir e ach individual plaintiff is the only person with information about the content of the advertisement upon which he relied.indeed,the fact that the publication of monograph produced no change in either the sales or the price of lights shows just how unresponsive the consumer market in light cigarettes is to the advent of new information.see in re ipo,at plaintiffs own allegations as to how slow the market was to correct the alleged price inflation despite what they also allege was widespread knowledge of the scheme indicate the very antithesis of an efficient market.as we stated in in re ipo,w ithout the basic presumption,individual questions of reliance would predominate over common questions.see also gunnells,at noting that basic presumption of actual reliance was based on the efficiency of capital markets,which did not apply to plaintiffs purchase of health care plans,and that therefore actual reliance could not be presumed and individualized inquiry was required.
we need not go so far as to adopt the fifth circuit blanket rule that a fraud class action can not be certified when individual reliance will be an issue,castano am.tobacco,cir,as some fraud actions do appear within the contemplation of rule drafters,see.b advisory committee notes a fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action,and it may remain so despite the need,if liability is found,for separate determination of the damages suffered by individuals within the class.but in this case,reliance is too individualized to admit of common proof 
plaintiffs suggest that regardless of whether reliance is susceptible to aggregate proof under moore,they should be entitled to a presumption of reliance in light of the market shift in brand preferences from nonfiltered to filtered to low tar cigarettes that resulted from defendants marketing of lights.see appellees br.at.while proof of reliance by circumstantial evidence may be sufficient under certain conditions sikes,at,it is insufficient here.just as the ninth circuit explained in poulos caesars world,that people choose to gamble for any number of reasons,each plaintiff in this case could have elected to purchase light cigarettes for any number of reasons,including a preference for the taste and a feeling that smoking lights was cool.see,cir g ambling is not a context in which we can assume that potential class members are always similarly situated.gamblers do not share a common universe of knowledge and motivation does not fit all.thus,to prove proximate causation in this case,an individualized showing of reliance is required.davies philip morris,sea,wl,at.may,denying plaintiffs motion for class certification because i nescapably individual differences can not be concealed in a throng was the consumer motivated by reasons,or by taste,peer influence,price,habit,or simply personal preference t here are numerous reasons that people buy light cigarettes.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.indeed,the fact that the market did not shift away from light cigarettes after the publication of monograph is compelling evidence that plaintiffs had other,reasons for purchasing lights.three of the six named plaintiffs even continued to purchase lights after filing the complaint in this case,suggesting the influence of some other motivation.
moreover,we are not blind to the indeterminate likelihood that,even before the publication of monograph,some members of plaintiffs desired class were aware that lights are not,in fact,healthier than cigarettes,and they therefore could not have relied on defendants marketing in deciding to purchase lights.sandwich chef of,reliance indem.ins,cir knowledge that invoices charged unlawful rates,but did so according to a prior agreement between the insurer and the policyholder,would eliminate reliance and break the chain of causation.moore am.fed of television radio artists,cir some found no error in the statements and accepted them at face value some relied on their agents to monitor the statements,and they likewise found no error others spotted what they perceived to be errors and complained to aftra.thus,differences in plaintiffs knowledge and levels of awareness also defeat the presumption of reliance.
loss causation 
a plaintiff alleging a violation of civil rico must also establish loss causation,meaning that the defendant misrepresentations caused the plaintiff to suffer economic loss.moore,at see also anza ideal steel supply,d when a court evaluates a rico claim for proximate causation,the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff injuries.furthermore,when factors other than the defendant fraud are an intervening direct cause of a plaintiff injury,that same injury can not be said to have occurred by reason of the defendant actions.first nationwide bank,at.in this case,plaintiffs theory is that they suffered an economic loss because they were overcharged for lights.plaintiffs argue that defendants misrepresentation that lights were healthier led to an increased market demand for light cigarettes,which drove up the price of lights.thus,plaintiffs contend that they paid more for lights than they otherwise would have had the truth been known.as with reliance,plaintiffs claim that they can establish loss causation on a basis.
this argument fails because the issue of loss causation,much like the issue of reliance,can not be resolved by way of generalized proof.as we noted above,individuals may have relied on defendants misrepresentation to varying degrees in deciding to purchase lights some may have relied completely,some in part,and some not at all.thus,establishing the first link in the causal defendants misrepresentation caused an increase in market require individualized proof,as any number of other factors could have led to this increase.if smokers purchased more light cigarettes and drove up demand for reasons unrelated to defendants misrepresentation,plaintiffs could not show that their economic injury was directly caused by defendants fraud.anza.at there is a second discontinuity between the rico violation and the asserted injury.plaintiff lost sales could have resulted from factors other than defendant alleged acts of fraud.businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons,and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of plaintiff lost sales were the product of defendant decreased prices.
given the lack of an appreciable drop in the demand or price of light cigarettes after the truth about lights was revealed in monograph,plaintiffs argument that defendants misrepresentation caused the market to shift and the price of lights to be inflated fails as a matter of law.we have stated that t he key reasons for requiring direct causation include avoiding unworkable difficulties in ascertaining what amount of the plaintiff injury was caused by the defendant wrongful action as opposed to other external factors.first nationwide bank,at.here,because factors other than defendants misrepresentation may have intervened and affected the demand and price of lights,and because determining the portion of plaintiffs injury attributable to defendants wrongdoing would require an individualized inquiry,plaintiffs can not establish loss causation on a basis.
plaintiffs also argue that the requisite injury to business or property is susceptible to proof.see c sedima,imrex,d stating that a rico plaintiff only has standing if,and can only recover to the extent that,he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.in this case,proof of injury,or whether plaintiffs have been harmed,is bound up in proof of damages,or by how much plaintiffs have been harmed.only by showing that plaintiffs paid more for light cigarettes than they would have but for defendants misrepresentation can plaintiffs establish the requisite injury under civil rico.cordes.fin,edwards sons,cir if the fee paid were higher than the fee,then the plaintiff suffered an.in this case,the extent of the difference between the fee and the actual fee paid is relevant to the question of damages,but it is from a comparison between the two that the court would be asked to decide the question of.plaintiffs have advanced two theories to support their claim of injury and how the but for price of lights and thus the resulting damages might be calculated the loss of value theory and the price impact model.however,because neither of these theories is plausible as a matter of law,because both would lead to an impermissible fluid recovery,and because the acceptable measure of require individualized proof,issues can not be said to predominate.
a plaintiff asserting a claim under c must allege actual,quantifiable injury.in first nationwide bank,a civil rico case that,like the instant case,centered on the issues of causation and injury,we held that the assumption of additional risk of loss due to undersecured loans was insufficient to support an allegation of injury under rico.see at.we further stated that t he general rule of fraud damages is that the defrauded plaintiff may recover losses caused by the fraud.id.at see also commercial union assurance milken,cir d amages as compensation under rico c for injury to property must,under the familiar rule of law,place plaintiffs in the same position they would have been in but for the illegal conduct.
in this case,losses can not be shown by common evidence because they constitute an inherently individual inquiry individual smokers would have incurred different losses depending on what they would have opted to do,but for defendants misrepresentation.for example,smokers who would have purchased cigarettes instead of lights had they known that lights were not healthier would have suffered no injury because lights have always been priced the same as cigarettes.by contrast,those who would have quit smoking altogether could recover their expenses in purchasing lights.and those who would have continued to smoke,but in greater moderation,could recover something in between.thus,on the issue of loss,individual questions predominate plaintiffs can not meet their burden of showing that injury is amenable to common proof.
plaintiffs,no doubt recognizing the above difficulties with certifying a class claiming losses,offer two other theories of recovery,but neither is cognizable under rico.in re ipo makes clear that courts may resolve contested factual issues where necessary to decide on class certification,and when a claim can not succeed as a matter of law,the court should not certify a class on that issue.velez novartis pharms.thus,plaintiffs alternative theories can not support their argument for class certification.
loss of value 
the loss of value model purports to measure the difference between the price plaintiffs paid for light cigarettes as represented by defendants and the presumably lower price they would have paid but for defendants misrepresentation had they known the lights are not healthier than cigarettes.schwab,d at.plaintiffs expert estimated a loss in value of percent if the light cigarettes sold by defendants were as harmful as regular cigarettes.id.at.
but the loss of value model is designed to award plaintiffs damages based on the benefit of their bargain.such damages are generally unavailable in rico suits.see commercial union,at mclaughlin on class actions,at ed.update.this is a sensible rule,and not derived from our loss causation cases,as the district court suggested.schwab,d at.rather,the rule of general unavailability follows from the text of rico,which compensates only for injury to business or property.c.
indeed,plaintiffs have not explained how a party expectation can constitute business or property.see heinhold perlstein,holding that a plaintiff does not have standing to sue under rico when the only property to which a plaintiff alleges injury is an expectation interest that would not have existed but for the alleged rico violation oscar.students coop.ass n,cir en banc a showing of injury requires proof of concrete financial loss,and not mere injury to a valuable intangible property interest.emphasis added citation omitted.while we need not and do not decide whether expectancy damages are ever available under rico,fleischhauer feltner,cir,in cases that sound in fraud in the inducement,they plainly are not here,the cigarette packs that plaintiffs purchased all bore the surgeon general warning that cigarettes may cause cancer and other diseases.defendants misrepresentation could in no way have reduced the value of the cigarettes that plaintiffs actually purchased they simply could have induced plaintiffs to buy lights instead of cigarettes.see appellants reply br.at p laintiffs alleged lost expectation of a safer cigarette arose only because of the alleged fraud.
moreover,even if benefit of the bargain damages could be awarded,there is no reasonable means of calculating them in this case.fleischhauer,at t here was no realistic evidence presented as to a reasonable value or estimate of lost profits or of the bargain based on analogy,experience,or practice.we are asked to conceptualize the healthy then to imagine what a consumer might have paid for such a thing.indeed,jeffrey harris,proponent of the loss of value theory,asked survey respondents to make binary comparisons between a genuine light cigarette that reduced risk and a misrepresented light cigarette that was no less harmful than conventional cigarettes.schwab,d at.he concluded that virtually all respondents reported a loss in value.id.while the district court is quite correct that damages need not usually be demonstrated with precision,id.at,plaintiffs theory is pure speculation,as the survey response to harris exemplifies.
thus,plaintiffs legal theory fails at its inception and,even if it did not,plaintiffs have not made the requisite showing under in re ipo that they could,at trial,marshal facts sufficient to permit them to rely upon it.see in re ipo,at asserting that,in determining whether the rule requirements for class certification have been met,it is appropriate for the judge to resolve underlying factual disputes,and that as to these disputes,the judge must be persuaded that the fact at issue has been established id.at noting that even when there is overlap between a rule requirement and a merits issue,the district judge must receive enough evidence,by affidavits,documents,or testimony,to be satisfied that each rule requirement has been met.
price impact 
plaintiffs also assert a damages theory based on an estimate of the price impact that a disclosure that lights were not safer than cigarettes would have had on the market.using multiple regression analysis,plaintiffs seek to show the amount by which defendants would have had to reduce their prices to account for the concomitant reduced demand.even if that amount could be proven by common evidence,as with the loss of value model,plaintiffs have failed as a matter of law to adduce sufficient facts to show that the price impact model is a tenable measure of harm.supra part discussing in re ipo.
indeed,plaintiffs have not come forward with any meaningful means of estimating how the market has changed or might change in the future in response to fluctuations in the demand for light cigarettes.for instance,as we have already noted,lights have always been priced the same as cigarettes.furthermore,if plaintiffs theory of a preference for lights were correct,one would have expected demand to drop following the publication of monograph as people returned to smoking regular cigarettes or quit smoking altogether and,correspondingly,prices to fall.but nothing of the sort happened the market did not shift appreciably following the publication of monograph.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir alito,b ecause the july disclosure had no effect on bcf price,it follows that the information disclosed on september was immaterial as a matter of law.
the price impact model exemplifies the kind of vague inquiry into damages that the supreme court forbade in anza.in that case,the plaintiff a steel products vendor sued a competitor,alleging that the competitor practice of tax evasion had permitted it to charge lower prices than the plaintiff.the supreme court concluded that the plaintiff had failed adequately to plead a rico violation because the injury it had suffered to its business was too remote from the predicate racketeering acts.see anza.at.specifically,the court stated that t he cause of plaintiff asserted harms is a set of actions offering lower prices entirely distinct from the alleged rico violation defrauding the state,and noted that the attenuation was clear.id.importantly,the court discussed 
the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if plaintiff were permitted to maintain its claim.a court considering the claim would need to begin by calculating the portion of defendant price drop attributable to the alleged pattern of racketeering activity.it next would have to calculate the portion of plaintiff lost sales attributable to the relevant part of the price drop.
id.at.similarly,in this case,a court considering plaintiffs price impact model would have to engage in a series of speculative calculations to ascertain whether,and in what amount,plaintiffs suffered a loss.
plaintiffs in this case argue that u nlike in anza the class members here are the immediate victims of the rico violation,and the causal chain is no more attenuated than in any case in which an economist calculates an overcharge resulting from a defendant unlawful activities.appellees br.at.but anza spoke not only to the remoteness of the action that had allegedly caused the plaintiff harm,but also to the possibility that damages could have resulted from factors unrelated to the defendant alleged acts of fraud.see.at businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons,and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of plaintiff lost sales were the product of defendant decreased prices.and indeed,here,as plaintiffs expert concedes,a number of exogenous variables bear on cigarette price,including rates of cigarette consumption,income levels of smokers,population,taxes,advertising expenditures,production costs,and plaintiffs knowledge of health risks.schwab,d at.
thus,plaintiffs can not show injury due to overall price impact on a basis and thereby satisfy rule predominance requirement because their price impact theory,like their loss of value theory,fails as a matter of law.under in re ipo,plaintiffs must produce persuasive facts at trial that will enable them to prove injury to business or property under rico.they have failed to persuade us that they can do so.
ii.calculation of damages 
the district court concluded that plaintiffs could prove collective damages on a basis,and individual plaintiffs would then claim shares of this fund 
first,defendant aggregate liability is determined in a single,adjudication and paid into a class fund.second,individual class members are afforded an opportunity to collect their individual shares,usually through a simplified proof of claim procedure third,any residue remaining after individual claims have been paid is dist
