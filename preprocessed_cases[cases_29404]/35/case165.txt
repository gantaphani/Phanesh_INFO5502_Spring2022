the abstention doctrine 
introduction 
plaintiff seeks relief under the ucl.in california,the remedies available for alleged violations of the ucl include injunctions and restitution.because these remedies are equitable in nature,under the doctrine of judicial abstention,courts have the discretion to abstain from employing them.desert healthcare,supra,th at,d.
there are various theories underlying the application of judicial abstention in ucl lawsuits.courts may abstain when the lawsuit involves determining complex economic policy,which is best handled by the legislature or an administrative agency.california grocers bank of america th,d california grocers.judicial abstention is appropriate in cases where granting injunctive relief would be unnecessarily burdensome for the trial court to monitor and enforce given the availability of more effective means of redress.diaz ranch d.diaz.courts may also abstain when federal enforcement of the subject law would be more orderly,more effectual,less burdensome to the affected interests.people ex rel.of transportation naegele outdoor advertising cal d,quoting diaz,supra,d.
application of the abstention doctrine in ucl cases 
i certain complex economic policies and issues should be handled by the legislature or administrative agencies 
judicial intervention in areas of complex economic policy is inappropriate.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,fn.the courts of appeal have neither the power nor the duty to determine the wisdom of any economic policy that function rests solely with the legislature.max factor kunsman cal d.
judicial abstention is appropriate when granting the requested relief would require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency,or to interfere with the functions of an administrative agency.shamsian,supra,th at,d samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,d samura.
in samura,the plaintiff sued kaiser and others for injunctive relief pursuant to the ucl.samura,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff alleged that kaiser third party liability provisions in service agreements violated the ucl.these provisions provided,inter alia,that if a member received medical services under the service agreement for injuries caused by a third party,and the member recovered a settlement or judgment as compensation,the member would pay for the medical services from the settlement or judgment.id.at,d.following a trial,the trial court granted the plaintiff injunctive relief,requiring kaiser,among other things,to and clarify in plain english the third party liability provisions.id.at,d.
the samura court of appeal reversed,concluding that the trial court erred when it tried to enforce compliance with the regulatory guidelines and requirements of the act.samura,supra,th at,d.the court stated as follows it is immaterial whether or not the challenged contract provisions and business practices comply with these portions of the act because the statutes do not define unlawful acts that may be enjoined under business and professions code section.in basing its order on these provisions,the trial court assumed a regulatory power over health plan that the legislature has entrusted exclusively to the department of corporations.samura unquestionably has certain remedies if the department of corporations fails to discharge its responsibilities under the act citation,but the courts can not assume general regulatory powers over health maintenance organizations through the guise of enforcing business and professions code section.citation.to the extent that the order on appeal is based on portions of the act having a purely regulatory import,it improperly invades the powers that the legislature entrusted to the department of corporations.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
in california grocers,the california grocers association filed suit against bank of america to challenge a banking fee for a check processing service as a violation of the ucl.california grocers,supra,th at,d.the trial court found that the fee was unconscionably high,a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and thus an unfair business practice under the ucl.the court granted injunctive relief,limiting the fee to,which represented the bank cost plus a percent markup for profit.california grocers,supra,th at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.the court concluded that the fee was not unconscionable.california grocers,supra,th at,d.alternatively,as a separate ground for reversing the judgment,the court of appeal concluded that injunctive relief was an inappropriate exercise of judicial authority.id.at,d.the court explained that the case involved a question of economic policy,that is,whether service fees charged by banks were too high and should be regulated.the court stated that determining economic policy was primarily a legislative and not a judicial function.id.at,d 
in lazzareschi inv.san francisco fed.sav.loan d,the court addressed the legality of a mortgage loan prepayment charge.that court stated,t he control of charges,if it be desirable,is better accomplished by statute or by regulation authorized by statute than by ad hoc decisions of the courts.legislative committees and an administrative officer charged with regulating an industry have better sources of gathering information and assessing its value than do courts in isolated cases.id.at.
in wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d wolfe,the court explained that following the northridge earthquake,a number of residential real property insurers stopped or reduced the sales of homeowner policies because the insurers were required to provide earthquake insurance in those policies.the insurers were concerned about the risk they would be assuming and their ability to pay all claims in case of another earthquake id.at,d.
acting as a private attorney general,the plaintiff in wolfe sued residential real property insurers for injunctive relief to require the insurers to sell new policies.the plaintiff alleged that the failure to sell new policies constituted an unfair business practice under the ucl.wolfe,supra,th at,d.the trial court sustained the insurers demurrers without leave to amend on the basis that the issues in that case were best addressed by the legislature.id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed.the court explained that even if the plaintiff could state a cause of action for unfair trade practices based on proposition,that by itself did not permit unwarranted judicial intervention in an area of complex economic policy.wolfe,supra,th at,d.the wolfe court explained that judicial resolution of the complaint would involve the courts in microeconomic managing of the insurance industry.the court stated that to grant the requested injunctive relief would necessarily involve the court in evaluating the potential risk being undertaken by each individual insurer and analyzing their respective financial conditions to determine whether they would remain sufficiently solvent to undertake those risks.id.at,d.
in desert healthcare,supra,th,d,a hospital filed an action against a health service plan pacificare to recover medical expenses for services provided to members of the health service plan.dpa,the entity responsible on behalf of pacificare for reimbursing the hospital,had filed for bankruptcy.id.at,d.the hospital sued for violations of the health care service plan act of,for negligence and for violations of the ucl.the court of appeal affirmed the order sustaining pacificare demurrer without leave to amend with regard to the and negligence causes of action.id.at,d.
the desert healthcare court also found that the hospital had not stated a valid ucl claim,and even if it had,the court would not approve of judicial intervention under the guise of the ucl desert healthcare,supra,th at,d.the court explained where a ucl action would drag a court of equity into an area of complex economic policy,equitable abstention is appropriate.in such cases,it is primarily a legislative and not a judicial function to determine the best economic policy.id.at,d the court explained that i n order to fashion an appropriate remedy for such a claim,be it injunctive or restitutionary,the trial court would have to determine the appropriate levels of capitation and oversight.such an inquiry would pull the court deep into the thicket of the health care finance industry,an economic arena that courts are to meddle in.as such,there is no proper role for the court of equity to play in the instant dispute.id.at,d.
in the recent case of shamsian,supra,th,d,the court of appeal affirmed an order dismissing the case on the basis of equitable abstention.there,the plaintiff filed a class action lawsuit against the department of conservation for allegedly failing to provide convenient,economical and efficient beverage container redemption opportunities as required by section,subdivision g,of the public resources code and for unfair competition under the ucl.shamsian,supra,th at,d.
the shamsian court held that public resources code section,subdivision g,did not impose a mandatory duty on the department of conservation,and thus did not create a private cause of action.alternatively,the court concluded that equitable abstention barred the plaintiff ucl claims.shamsian,supra,th at,d.
as to the doctrine of equitable abstention,the shamsian court explained t he complex statutory arrangement of requirements and incentives involving participants in the beverage container recycling scheme is to be administered and enforced by the department consistent with the legislature goals.for the court at this point to issue restitution and disgorgement orders against the corporate defendants would interfere with the department administration of the act and regulation of beverage container recycling and potentially risk throwing the entire complex economic arrangement out of balance.the public need for opportunities to recover its cash redemption value funds and to conveniently recycle its beverage containers is not so great as to warrant judicial interference in the administrative scheme designed to address those needs at this point.shamsian,supra,th at,d.
ii granting injunctions in cases involving complex economic issues when other remedies are available can place an unnecessary burden on the courts 
courts may abstain from adjudicating a lawsuit and issuing injunctive relief when the injunctive relief would place an unnecessary burden on the court because of the existence of other,more effective remedies.
in diaz,supra,d,plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prohibit ranchers from employing as farm workers illegal immigrant into the united states.in that case,the court concluded that the trial court should not become involved in issuing and enforcing injunctive relief when there was a more effective federal remedy.the court explained that a single trial court may have to issue dozens of injunctions,creating a network of injunctions to cover growers in rural counties.the trial courts would then have to enforce the injunctions through contempt hearings.id.at.the court stated thus,whatever the legal theory underlying the injunction,the court must compare the effects of granting and withholding it and,in that connection,consider the comparative availability and advisability of other forms of amelioration.id.at.
with this understanding of the doctrine of equitable abstention,we turn to the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion in the context of this case.
adopted in,section provides in pertinent part a the department shall adopt regulations setting forth the minimum number of equivalent nursing hours per patient required in skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities,subject to the specific requirements of section o
