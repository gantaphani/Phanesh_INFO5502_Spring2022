in this case we consider the scope of the commercial speech exemption to the statute.see code civ,subd.c.
in february,plaintiff simpson company,simpson filed this action for defamation and related claims against defendants pierce gore and the gore law firm arising from a newspaper advertisement placed by gore a few weeks earlier.the advertisement,which was directed to owners of wood decks constructed after january,advised readers that you may have certain legal rights and be entitled to monetary compensation,and repair or replacement of your deck if the deck was built with galvanized screws manufactured by simpson or other specified entities,and invited those persons to contact gore if you would like an attorney to investigate whether you have a potential claim.
gore moved successfully in the superior court to have the entire complaint stricken under section,the statute,and the court of appeal affirmed.we granted review to consider the limited issue whether simpson complaint was exempt from the statute because of section,subdivision c section c,which excludes causes of action arising from representations of fact about the speaker or a competitor business operations,goods,or services made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services or made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.having found that the complaint is not exempt from dismissal under the statute,we affirm.
background 
plaintiff simpson is a california corporation in the business of designing,manufacturing,and marketing building products,including metal connectors and other hardware for use in wood frame construction.according to simpson,it is well known in the wood frame construction industry that wood,which is commonly used in outdoor decks to protect against termites and fungal decay,can have a corrosive effect on steel products,including galvanized screws.corrosion potentially shortens the service life of these fasteners and connectors and compromises their ability to support their recommended loads or endure seismic and environmental stresses.
in early,at the recommendation of the united states environmental protection agency,the construction industry stopped selling lumber treated with chromium copper arsenate,due to health hazards posed by its arsenic content.alternative lumber products,such as wood treated with alkaline copper quaternary and copper azole,were substituted,but,as simpson explains,these chemicals are more corrosive to galvanized steel products.simpson states that it communicated this potential problem to the building industry and to the public generally through its web site,annual catalog,articles in engineering and building magazines,bulletins issued to the building industry,information,and annual report.
gore,a california attorney,learned from television reports about the potential for corrosion of galvanized deck fasteners and connectors when used on wood with alkaline copper quaternary or copper azole and contacted ted todd,a senior inspector with the contra costa county district attorney office who was featured in the television reports.at that time,the district attorney office was conducting an investigation into the risk posed by galvanized fasteners and connectors when used with these types of wood.the office ultimately issued a consumer alert warning of the corrosive effect of the new wood products on the metal connector brackets typically used in construction.the alert noted that advisories had been posted in some retail stores about the potential incompatibility of the two products but cautioned that the advisories tend to be in very small print or somewhat inconspicuously posted.
gore also visited the company web site,where simpson had advised in bold type that m any of the new pressure treated woods use chemicals that are corrosive to steel.by selecting connectors that offer greater corrosion resistance you can extend the service life of your connectors.however,corrosion will still occur.you should perform periodic inspection of your connectors and fasteners to insure their strength is not being adversely affected by corrosion.in some cases,it may be necessary to have a local professional perform the inspections.because of the many variables involved,simpson can not provide estimates on service life of connectors,anchors or fasteners.
in addition,gore discovered that a class action complaint had been filed in massachusetts against one of simpson competitors,phillips fastener products,which sought relief on behalf of consumers allegedly damaged by defective galvanized fasteners and connectors used with lumber,and that gore former law firm,lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein,llp,was investigating claims that some of the newly designed fasteners were failing,in spite of the manufacturers representations that the special coatings were intended to resist corrosion.
based on this information,gore arranged for an advertisement to be placed in the san jose mercury news in order to locate individuals who had purchased galvanized fasteners and connectors manufactured by simpson and two other companies,which together were responsible for most of the metal fasteners sold to consumers in california.the advertisement,which commenced christmas day and ran four more times over a period in the mercury news and once in the los gatos,read as follows

gore has asserted that the wording of the advertisement was modeled after notices he or his cocounsel had used in this state and in others during the preceding three years in connection with potential class actions based on consumer fraud or product defects.
in a letter dated january,counsel for simpson advised gore that the advertisement falsely implied that simpson galvanized screws fail to meet appropriate industry standards and that a valid claim may exist against simpson based upon negligence or product liability.the letter demanded that gore cease publication of any further defamatory advertisements directed at simpson and reserved simpson right to recover against gore for any costs or damages that may have already resulted from this or any similar publication.gore did not respond to the letter.in a letter dated january,counsel for simpson declared that gore failure to respond suggests that your claims are without merit,and that your newspaper advertisement is false,misleading,and defames simpson unless you can present specific evidence to support your charges,simpson intends to pursue its defamation claim against your firm and vindicate its rights.again,gore did not respond.
prior to filing this action,simpson retained an opinion survey firm to confirm that the advertisement had caused injury to simpson reputation.the survey firm intercepted randomly selected shoppers at nine different home improvement stores in january and february and obtained their responses to a set of questions with and without exposure to the gore advertisement.the survey revealed that the shoppers,after reading the advertisement,were significantly more likely to believe that simpson galvanized screws were defective or of low quality and were significantly less likely to purchase galvanized screws manufactured by simpson.
two days after the survey was completed,simpson filed this action for defamation,trade libel,false advertising,and unfair business practices.the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief.
when gore moved to strike the complaint under section,simpson invoked the exemption to the law for commercial speech under section c.the trial court granted the special motion to strike and entered a judgment of dismissal,finding gore had made a threshold showing that the statements were made in furtherance of his right of petition or free speech on an issue of public interest,subd.e,that simpson had failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits,subd.b,and that the commercial speech exemption did not apply because the advertisement made no statement about a business competitor products or services.
the court of appeal affirmed in a published opinion.the court first considered who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to the applicability of the section c party invoking the law,the defendant,or the party invoking the exemption the plaintiff in assigning the burden to the plaintiff,the court of appeal disagreed with brill media,llc tcw group,th brill,which had assigned the burden to the defendant to establish that the cause of action is not exempt.the court next determined that while the advertisement was made for the purpose of promoting gore services c,simpson causes of action did not aris e from any representation of fact about gore or a competitor services or business operations.
in construing the exemption in section c for causes of action arising from statements or conduct made in the course of delivering the person goods or services,the court of appeal once again disagreed with brill,which had found this prong was satisfied where the statements were made and conduct engaged in as part of the type of business transaction engaged in by defendants.brill,supra,th at.the court of appeal reasoned that the legislature had enacted instead a much narrower exemption,predicated by its plain terms on conduct in the course of delivering the goods or services the defendant is in the business of selling or leasing.the court then found that the advertisement here was seeking business from prospective clients,not delivering services to them.concluding that the statute applied and that simpson had failed to establish a probability of prevailing on any of its claims,the court of appeal affirmed the order granting the special motion to strike and the judgment of dismissal.
we granted review to address the conflict in the case law concerning the construction of the commercial speech exemption to the statute.

a slapp is a civil lawsuit that is aimed at preventing citizens from exercising their political rights or punishing those who have done so.while slapp suits masquerade as ordinary lawsuits such as defamation and interference with prospective economic advantage,they are generally meritless suits brought primarily to chill the exercise of free speech or petition rights by the threat of severe economic sanctions against the defendant,and not to vindicate a legally cognizable right.castillo pacheco th,quoting com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.

which party bears the burden to establish the applicability of the commercial speech exemption under section c 
the court of appeal determined that simpson,as the plaintiff,bore the burden of establishing that gore advertisement fell within the commercial speech exemption to the law,relying on the general rule that o ne claiming an exemption from a general statute has the burden of proving that he comes within the exemption.simpson argues that the burden should have been placed on gore,as the defendant,to establish that the exemption does not apply.he relies in particular on our summary in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,equilon,of the process for analyzing motions first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.italics added.we agree with the court of appeal construction.
it is a familiar and longstanding legal principle that w hen a proviso carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract those who set up such exception must prove it.meacham knolls atomic power laboratory,see also trade comm morton salt,the burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits accord,d evidence.likewise,in california,it has been declared that where the statute has exemptions,exceptions or matters which will avoid the statute the burden is on the claimant to show that he falls within that category.colonial ins.acc.com.cal d,see also briggs mccullough cal,in re lorenzo th,one who claims an exemption from a general statute has the burden of proving that he or she comes within the exemption.
simpson does not dispute that section sets forth a general statute or that section creates specified exemptions to it.simpson contends,though,that the familiar and rule of statutory construction governing exemptions to a general statute was abrogated by the enactment in of evidence code section,which provides except as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.
although it is true that evidence code section superseded former section,which had provided that the burden of proof was on the party holding the affirmative of the issue,the change in wording did not upset the traditional rule of statutory construction.as the law revision commission comments to evidence code section explain,the phrase the affirmative of the issue in former section had been criticized as establishing a meaningless standard,inasmuch as practically any proposition may be stated in either affirmative or negative form.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll.evidence code section was intended to make the allocation of the burden of proof easier to ascertain than the classic formulation,but not to signal a sea change in the law.conservatorship of hume th,fn.see also los angeles unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.d,citing the two formulations together.tellingly,simpson cites nothing to support its novel claim that evidence code section abrogated the ordinary rule of statutory construction.d evidence,what facts are essential to a particular party claim for relief or defense is generally a matter to be determined by the substantive law,not the law of evidence,does not purport to determine which facts are essential to the plaintiff claim for relief and which facts are essential to a claimed defense,but rather leaves those substantive determinations to be resolved in light of the particular cause of action or defense at issue.indeed,the law revision commission comments note that evidence code section follows th e basic rule,that whatever facts a party must affirmatively plead he also has the burden of proving and is even broader,in that it appl ies to issues not necessarily raised in the pleadings.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann,supra,foll.inasmuch as simpson concedes that t he initial burden should be on the plaintiff to invoke the exemption in opposition to the motion,it follows that the plaintiff also has the burden of proving the applicability of the exemption.
furthermore,the general principle of evidence code section is that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.because establishing the commercial speech exemption is essential to simpson defense to the special motion to strike,evidence code section places the burden of proof on simpson.see generally city of lafayette east bay mun.utility dist.th,one seeking to be excluded from the sweep of the general statute must establish that the exception applies.
nothing in equilon or its discussion of the process alters the analysis.equilon,supra,cal th at.in equilon,we explained that the defendant has the burden to show that the cause of action being challenged under the statute is one arising from protected activity.equilon,supra,at.in discussing the defendant burden at the first stage,equilon construed only section,and did not purport to identify the party with the burden to establish the existence or nonexistence of the public interest exemption in section,subdivision b,or the commercial speech exemption in section c,inasmuch as equilon predated the enactment of section.it is worth noting,though,that nothing in equilon purported to abrogate the rule of construction that the party seeking to benefit from an exception to a general statute bears the burden to establish the exception 
simpson argues,correctly,that the ordinary rules governing allocation of the burden of proof may be disregarded for policy reasons in exceptional circumstances.adams murakami cal d,cassady morgan,lewis bockius llp th,cassady.yet such exceptions are few,and narrow sargent fletcher,able th,and the reasons justifying a shift in the normal allocation of the burden of proof must be compelling.aydin first state ins.cal th,accord,meacham knolls atomic power,supra,at.at.simpson fails to identify any compelling justification.
simpson does assert that the facts underlying the commercial speech exemption are peculiarly within the speaker knowledge.but simpson does not explain how a plaintiff would be significantly disadvantaged in demonstrating that the statement or conduct underlying its cause of action consists of representations of fact about the defendant or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services that the defendant statement or conduct was made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services or in the course of delivering the persons goods or services or that the intended audience was an actual or potential buyer or customer,or a person likely to repeat the statement to,or otherwise influence,an actual or potential buyer or customer.c,see generally schaffer weast,very often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof.in sum,simpson does not persuade us that section c presents one of those rare occasions justifying a deviation from the normal allocation of the burden of proof.cassady,supra,th at.
the burden of proof as to the applicability of the commercial speech exemption,therefore,falls on the party seeking the benefit of,the plaintiff.
were simpson causes of action exempted from the statute by section c 
as noted,section c provides,in pertinent part section does not apply to any cause of action brought against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services arising from any statement or conduct by that person if both of the following conditions exist the statement or conduct consists of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services,that is made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services,or the statement or conduct was made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.the intended audience is an actual buyer or potential buyer or customer,or a person likely to repeat the statement to,or otherwise influence,an actual buyer or customer 
there are no disputed issues of fact here.we review the applicability of the commercial speech exemption independently.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn.
the court of appeal held,and the parties initial briefing assumed,that section c prescribes a content exemption and a delivery exemption and that these exemptions have distinctly different elements.the content exemption shields a cause of action from the statute if the cause of action arises from a statement or conduct that consists of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services,that is made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services,subd.c.the delivery exemption provides a similar shield for any statement or conduct made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.ibid.in other words,this approach divided the first words of subdivision c from the last to create two independent and parallel theories of exemption from the law.
although section c is grammatically susceptible to such a construction,that construction was not necessarily the only plausible one.gore had observed,in a footnote in its initial briefing,that the statute might also be read to exempt a cause of action arising from a statement or conduct that consists of representations of fact about that person or a competitor business operations,goods,or services that was made either for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services or in the course of delivering the person goods or services.c.we granted the parties the opportunity to file supplemental briefing as to which construction was the correct one and,as will appear,agree with gore construction.
as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.people lewis cal th.we begin with the text of the statute as the best indicator of legislative intent tonya superior court cal th,but we may reject a literal construction that is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute or that would lead to absurd results.ornelas randolph cal th.
simpson argument,at least at the outset,relies on the plain language of section c and the canon of construction of avoiding surplusage.according to simpson,section c creates two independent commercial speech exemptions,each introduced by the phrase the statement or conduct,and to hold otherwise would render the second iteration of the statement or conduct in the subdivision redundant.in simpson view,therefore,the delivery exemption encompasses a cause of action arising from any statement or conduct made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.gore argues that such a construction would contravene the legislative intent and lead to absurd results.
the legislature findings supporting the enactment of section are set forth in subdivision a,which states that there has been a disturbing abuse of section,the california law,which has undermined the exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,contrary to the purpose and intent of section.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process or section.
the construction favored by simpson does not effectively fulfill the statute purposes.under that construction,the legislature can be seen to have carefully devised specific requirements in order to exempt a cause of action under the content,the statement or conduct underlying the cause of action must consist of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services,and have been made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing transactions in the person goods or services.yet,under simpson construction of the delivery prong,the legislature apparently imposed no particular,a cause of action arising from any statement or conduct on any subject for any purpose is exempted from the statute,as long as it was made in the course of delivering goods or services.simpson has not offered any rationale for why the stage of the transaction should play such a critical factor in determining whether to exempt a cause of action from the reach of the law.
moreover,under simpson approach,a business that was sued because of political or religious statements made by an employee in the course of delivering the product or service to a customer would be deprived of the protection of the law,but that same business would be able to invoke the law if the same statements were made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing transactions in its products.neither the legislature findings nor common sense endorses or justifies such a result.
simpson effectively concedes that such a result would be problematic,but argues that the statements in these hypotheticals are not a part of the delivery of goods or services and thus fall outside the delivery exemption as simpson would interpret it.but,as we recently observed,d uring means at some point in the course of.people lewis,supra,cal th at.statements or conduct made during the delivery of goods or services thus would qualify as statements or conduct made in the course of delivering the goods or services.c.
simpson attempts to narrow the definition of the delivery exemption by combining language that appears in two different sentences in brill,supra,th at page,to argue that the exemption extends only to statements made and conduct engaged in as part of the type of business transaction engaged in by defendants.but this formulation does not appear anywhere in the text of section c.if,as simpson effectively concedes,the delivery prong requires an interpretive gloss to avoid absurd results,it seems more consonant with legislative intent to adopt the restriction the legislature articulated earlier in the sentence setting forth the exemption rather than to rummage about elsewhere for new limitations arising out of whole cloth.
moreover,simpson construction of the delivery prong would render the first part of section c the content and purpose.statements or conduct that are part of the type of business transaction engaged in by defendants would necessarily encompass representations of fact about that person business operations,goods,or services,that are made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services c inasmuch as every business engages in efforts to obtain approval for,promote,or secure sales or transactions in its goods or services.indeed,simpson concedes that a grocer advertisement in advance of intended sales falls within its broad definition of the delivery prong to the extent the advertising informs the public about the availability of the product for delivery or to the extent the advertising keeps the product in the public eye and bolsters its prestige.with such a broad definition of the delivery prong,there would be no need for the content and purpose prong.
the legislative history further undermines simpson interpretation of the statute.summaries of the bill prepared for various legislative committees consistently stated that section c would prohibit the motion from being used in specified causes of action against businesses sued for statements or conduct consisting of representations of fact about their goods,services or business operations,or those of a competitor,when those statements or conduct were for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of the person goods or services,or in the course of delivering the person goods or services,if the intended audience is an actual or potential buyer or customer,or a person likely to repeat the statement to,or otherwise influence,an actual or potential buyer or customer,legis.analyst,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,italics added assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added assem.republican caucus,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added see also sheila kuehl,letter to governor gray davis.in addition,an analysis prepared for the senate committee on the judiciary noted that senate bill was consistent with the recommendation of the senate judiciary committee analysis last year on senate bill,which urged the sponsors to look at the content and context of the statement or conduct when crafting an exemption,rather than enacting a wholesale exclusion of a class of defendants,which had been proposed in senate bill.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics added.simpson offers no explanation why the legislature would have been so concerned about the content of the statement or conduct in the first part of section c but would have abandoned any such concern in the remainder of the sentence.
for these reasons,we interpret section c to exempt from the law a cause of action arising from commercial speech when the cause of action is against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services the cause of action arises from a statement or conduct by that person consisting of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services the statement or conduct was made either for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services or in the course of delivering the person goods or services and the intended audience for the statement or conduct meets the definition set forth in section c.
gore does not dispute that he is in the business of selling legal services,that simpson causes of action arise from gore advertisement,that the purpose of the advertisement was to promote gore legal services,or that the advertisement was addressed to a qualifying audience under section,subdivision c.the point of contention concerns whether the causes of action aris e from representations of fact about gore business operations,goods,or services.c.we find t
