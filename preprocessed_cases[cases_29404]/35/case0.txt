justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
section of the federal arbitration act faa makes agreements to arbitrate valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.we consider whether the faa prohibits states from conditioning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on the availability of classwide arbitration procedures.
in february,vincent and liza concepcion entered into an agreement for the sale and servicing of cellular telephones with mobility lcc the contract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the parties,but required that claims be brought in the parties individual capacity,and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.app.to pet.for cert the agreement authorized to make unilateral amendments,which it did to the arbitration provision on several occasions.the version at issue in this case reflects revisions made in december,which the parties agree are controlling.
the revised agreement provides that customers may initiate dispute proceedings by completing a of dispute form available on web site.may then offer to settle the claim if it does not,or if the dispute is not resolved within days,the customer may invoke arbitration by filing a separate demand for arbitration,also available on web site.in the event the parties proceed to arbitration,the agreement specifies that must pay all costs for nonfrivolous claims that arbitration must take place in the county in which the customer is billed that,for claims of or less,the customer may choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person,by telephone,or based only on submissions that either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu of arbitration and that the arbitrator may award any form of individual relief,including injunctions and presumably punitive damages.the agreement,moreover,denies any ability to seek reimbursement of its attorney fees,and,in the event that a customer receives an arbitration award greater than last written settlement offer,requires to pay a minimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant attorney fees 
the concepcions purchased service,which was advertised as including the provision of free phones they were not charged for the phones,but they were charged in sales tax based on the phones retail value.in march,the concepcions filed a complaint against in the united states district court for the southern district of california.the complaint was later consolidated with a putative class action alleging,among other things,that had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.
in march,moved to compel arbitration under the terms of its contract with the concepcions.the concepcions opposed the motion,contending that the agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully exculpatory under california law because it disallowed classwide procedures.the district court denied motion.it described arbitration agreement favorably,noting,for example,that the informal process was quick,easy to use and likely to promp t full or even excess payment to the customer without the need to arbitrate or litigate that the premium functioned as a substantial inducement for the consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration if a dispute was not resolved informally and that consumers who were members of a class would likely be worse off.laster usa,wl,sd.nevertheless,relying on the california supreme court decision in discover bank superior court,cal,the court found that the arbitration provision was unconscionable because had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class actions.laster,wl.
the ninth circuit affirmed,also finding the provision unconscionable under california law as announced in discover bank.laster mobility llc.it also held that the discover bank rule was not preempted by the faa because that rule was simply a refinement of the unconscionability analysis applicable to contracts generally in california.at.in response to argument that the interpretation of california law discriminated against arbitration,the ninth circuit rejected the contention that class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and expeditiousness of arbitration and noted that discover bank placed arbitration agreements with class action waivers on the exact same footing as contracts that bar class action litigation outside the context of arbitration.at quoting shroyer new cingular wireless services.
we granted certiorari.
the faa was enacted in in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.see hall street associates,mattel.section,the primary substantive provision of the act,moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr,provides,in relevant part,as follows 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
we have described this provision as reflecting both a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,moses cone,supra,at,and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,west,jackson,slip,at.in line with these principles,courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,buckeye check cashing,cardegna,and enforce them according to their terms,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.
the final phrase of,however,permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.doctor associates,casarotto,see also perry thomas.the question in this case is whether preempts california rule classifying most waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable.we refer to this rule as the discover bank rule.
under california law,courts may refuse to enforce any contract found to have been unconscionable at the time it was made,or may limit the application of any unconscionable clause.cal.civ.code ann.a west.a finding of unconscionability requires a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.armendariz foundation health pyschcare,cal,accord,discover bank,cal,at,at.
in discover bank,the california supreme court applied this framework to waivers in arbitration agreements and held as follows 
w hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.at,at quoting cal.civ.code ann.
california courts have frequently applied this rule to find arbitration agreements unconscionable.see,cohen directv,cal.app,cal.rptr,klussman cross country bank,cal.app,cal rptr,aral earthlink,cal.app,cal.rptr.
the concepcions argue that the discover bank rule,given its origins in california unconscionability doctrine and california policy against exculpation,is a ground that exist s at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract under faa.moreover,they argue that even if we construe the discover bank rule as a prohibition on waivers rather than simply an application of unconscionability,the rule would still be applicable to all contracts,since california prohibits waivers of class litigation as well.see america online,superior,cal.app,cal.rptr.
when state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,the analysis is straightforward the conflicting rule is displaced by the faa.preston ferrer.but the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable,such as duress or,as relevant here,unconscionability,is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.in perry thomas,for example,we noted that the faa preemptive effect might extend even to grounds traditionally thought to exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.at,emphasis deleted.we said that a court may not rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a holding that enforcement would be unconscionable,for this would enable the court to effect what the state legislature can not.at.
an obvious illustration of this point would be a case finding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public policy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to provide for judicially monitored discovery.the rationalizations for such a holding are neither difficult to imagine nor different in kind from those articulated in discover bank.a court might reason that no consumer would knowingly waive his right to full discovery,as this would enable companies to hide their wrongdoing.or the court might simply say that such agreements are exculpatory discovery would be of greater benefit to the company than the consumer,since the former is more likely to be sued than to sue.see discover bank,supra,at,at arguing that class waivers are similarly.and,the reasoning would continue,because such a rule applies the general principle of unconscionability or disapproval of exculpatory agreements,it is applicable to any contract and thus preserved by of the faa.in practice,of course,the rule would have a disproportionate impact on arbitration agreements but it would presumably apply to contracts purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.
other examples are easy to imagine.the same argument might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the federal rules of evidence,or that disallow an ultimate disposition by a jury perhaps termed a panel of twelve lay arbitrators to help avoid preemption.such examples are not fanciful,since the judicial hostility towards arbitration that prompted the faa had manifested itself in a great variety of devices and formulas declaring arbitration against public policy.robert lawrence devonshire fabrics.and although these statistics are not definitive,it is worth noting that california courts have been more likely to hold contracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts.broome,an unconscionable applicable of the unconscionability doctrine how the california courts are circumventing the federal arbitration act,hastings bus,randall,judicial attitudes toward arbitration and the resurgence of unconscionability,buffalo.
the concepcions suggest that all this is just a parade of horribles,and no genuine worry.rules aimed at destroying arbitration or demanding procedures incompatible with arbitration,they concede,would be preempted by the faa because they can not sensibly be reconciled with section.brief for respondents.the grounds available under saving clause,they admit,should not be construed to include a state mere preference for procedures that are incompatible with arbitration and would wholly eviscerate arbitration agreements.at quoting carter ssc odin operating,llc,
we largely agree.although saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses,nothing in it suggests an intent to preserve rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the faa objectives.geier american honda motor,crosby national foreign trade council.as we have said,a federal statute saving clause can not in reason be construed as allowing a common law right,the continued existence of which would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the act.in other words,the act can not be held to destroy itself.american telephone telegraph central office telephone,quoting texas pacific abilene cotton oil.
we differ with the concepcions only in the application of this analysis to the matter before us.we do not agree that rules requiring judicially monitored discovery or adherence to the federal rules of evidence are a far cry from this case.brief for respondents.the overarching purpose of the faa,evident in the text of,and,is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings.requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the faa.
the principal purpose of the faa is to ensur e that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.volt,at see also animalfeeds int l,slip,at.this purpose is readily apparent from the faa text.section makes arbitration agreements valid,irrevocable,and enforceable as written subject,of course,to the saving clause requires courts to stay litigation of arbitral claims pending arbitration of those claims in accordance with the terms of the agreement and requires courts to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement upon the motion of either party to the agreement assuming that the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure to perform the same is not at issue.in light of these provisions,we have held that parties may agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration,mitsubishi motors soler,to arbitrate according to specific rules,volt,supra,at,and to limit with whom a party will arbitrate its disputes,supra,at slip,at.
the point of affording parties discretion in designing arbitration processes is to allow for efficient,streamlined procedures tailored to the type of dispute.it can be specified,for example,that the decisionmaker be a specialist in the relevant field,or that proceedings be kept confidential to protect trade secrets.and the informality of arbitral proceedings is itself desirable,reducing the cost and increasing the speed of dispute resolution.penn plaza llc pyett,slip,at mitsubishi motors,supra,at.
the dissent quotes dean witter reynolds byrd,as reject ing the suggestion that the overriding goal of the arbitration act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims.post,at opinion of breyer.that is greatly misleading.after saying accurately enough that the overriding goal of the arbitration act was not to promote the expeditious resolution of claims,but to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate,at,dean witter went on to explain this is not to say that congress was blind to the potential benefit of the legislation for expedited resolution of disputes.far from it.at.it then quotes a house report saying that the costliness and delays of litigation can be largely eliminated by agreements for arbitration.ibid.quoting.the concluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins as follows 
we therefore are not persuaded by the argument that the conflict between two goals of the arbitration act enforcement of private agreements and encouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to realize the intent of the drafters.at.
in the present case,of course,those two goals do not conflict and it is the dissent view that would frustrate both of them.
contrary to the dissent view,our cases place it beyond dispute that the faa was designed to promote arbitration.they have repeatedly described the act as embod ying a national policy favoring arbitration,buckeye check cashing,at,and a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary,moses cone,at see also hall street,at.thus,in preston ferrer,holding preempted a rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before arbitration,we said a prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,which objective would be frustrated by requiring a dispute to be heard by an agency first,at.that rule,we said,would at the least,hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.at 
california discover bank rule similarly interferes with arbitration.although the rule does not require classwide arbitration,it allows any party to a consumer contract to demand it ex post.the rule is limited to adhesion contracts,discover bank,cal,at,at,but the times in which consumer contracts were anything other than adhesive are long past carbajal block tax,see also hill gateway.the rule also requires that damages be predictably small,and that the consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers.discover bank,supra,at,at.the former requirement,however,is toothless and malleable the ninth circuit has held that damages of are sufficiently small,see oestreicher alienware,fed.appx,unpublished,and the latter has no limiting effect,as all that is required is an allegation.consumers remain free to bring and resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under discover bank,and some may well do so but there is little incentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals when they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in the process.and faced with inevitable class arbitration,companies would have less incentive to continue resolving potentially duplicative claims on an individual basis.
although we have had little occasion to examine classwide arbitration,our decision in is instructive.in that case we held that an arbitration panel exceeded its power under a of the faa by imposing class procedures based on policy judgments rather than the arbitration agreement itself or some background principle of contract law that would affect its interpretation,at slip,at.we then held that the agreement at issue,which was silent on the question of class procedures,could not be interpreted to allow them because the changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to arbitration are fundamental.at slip,at.this is obvious as a structural matter classwide arbitration includes absent parties,necessitating additional and different procedures and involving higher stakes.confidentiality becomes more difficult.and while it is theoretically possible to select an arbitrator with some expertise relevant to the question,arbitrators are not generally knowledgeable in the procedural aspects of certification,such as the protection of absent parties.the conclusion follows that class arbitration,to the extent it is manufactured by discover bank rather than consensual,is inconsistent with the faa.
first,the switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration its informality and makes the process slower,more costly,and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.in bilateral arbitration,parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution lower costs,greater efficiency and speed,and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.at slip,at.but before an arbitrator may decide the merits of a claim in classwide procedures,he must first decide,for example,whether the class itself may be certified,whether the named parties are sufficiently representative and typical,and how discovery for the class should be conducted.a cursory comparison of bilateral and class arbitration illustrates the difference.according to the american arbitration association aaa,the average consumer arbitration between january and august resulted in a disposition on the merits in six months,four months if the arbitration was conducted by documents only.aaa,analysis of the aaa arbitration caseload,online at all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file.as of september,the aaa had opened class arbitrations.of those,remained active,and had been settled,withdrawn,or dismissed.not a single one,however,had resulted in a final award on the merits.brief for aaa as amicus curiae in.for those cases that were no longer active,the median time from filing to settlement,withdrawal,or dismissal not judgment on the merits was days,and the mean was days,at 
second,class arbitration requires procedural formality.the aaa rules governing class arbitrations mimic the federal rules of civil procedure for class litigation.compare aaa,supplementary rules for class arbitrations effective,online at,with fed.rule civ.proc.and while parties can alter those procedures by contract,an alternative is not obvious.if procedures are too informal,absent class members would not be bound by the arbitration.for a money judgment to bind absentees in litigation,class representatives must at all times adequately represent absent class members,and absent members must be afforded notice,an opportunity to be heard,and a right to opt out of the class.phillips petroleum shutts.at least this amount of process would presumably be required for absent parties to be bound by the results of arbitration.
we find it unlikely that in passing the faa congress meant to leave the disposition of these procedural requirements to an arbitrator.indeed,class arbitration was not even envisioned by congress when it passed the faa in as the california supreme court admitted in discover bank,class arbitration is a relatively recent development.cal,at,at.and it is at the very least odd to think that an arbitrator would be entrusted with ensuring that third parties due process rights are satisfied.
third,class arbitration greatly increases risks to defendants.informal procedures do of course have a cost the absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected.defendants are willing to accept the costs of these errors in arbitration,since their impact is limited to the size of individual disputes,and presumably outweighed by savings from avoiding the courts.but when damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at once,the risk of an error will often become unacceptable.faced with even a small chance of a devastating loss,defendants will be pressured into settling questionable claims.other courts have noted the risk of in terrorem settlements that class actions entail,see,kohen pacific inv.management.llc,and class arbitration would be no different.
arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class litigation.in litigation,a defendant may appeal a certification decision on an interlocutory basis and,if unsuccessful,may appeal from a final judgment as well.questions of law are reviewed de novo and questions of fact for clear error.in contrast,allows a court to vacate an arbitral award only where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy,or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or if the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award was not made.the aaa rules do authorize judicial review of certification decisions,but this review is unlikely to have much effect given these limitations review under focuses on misconduct rather than mistake.and parties may not contractually expand the grounds or nature of judicial review.hall street,at.we find it hard to believe that defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review,and even harder to believe that congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision 
the concepcions contend that because parties may and sometimes do agree to aggregation,class procedures are not necessarily incompatible with arbitration.but the same could be said about procedures that the concepcions admit states may not superimpose on arbitration parties could agree to arbitrate pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure,or pursuant to a discovery process rivaling that in litigation.arbitration is a matter of contract,and the faa requires courts to honor parties expectations,west,at slip,at.but what the parties in the aforementioned examples would have agreed to is not arbitration as envisioned by the faa,lacks its benefits,and therefore may not be required by state law.
the dissent claims that class proceedings are necessary to prosecute claims that might otherwise slip through the legal system.see post,at.but states can not require a procedure that is inconsistent with the faa,even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons.moreover,the claim here was most unlikely to go unresolved.as noted earlier,the arbitration agreement provides that will pay claimants a minimum of and twice their attorney fees if they obtain an arbitration award greater than last settlement offer.the district court found this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the individual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not immediately settled,and the ninth circuit admitted that aggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially guarantee d to be made whole,at.indeed,the district court concluded that the concepcions were better off under their arbitration agreement with than they would have been as participants in a class action,which could take months,if not years,and which may merely yield an opportunity to submit a claim for recovery of a small percentage of a few dollars.laster,wl,at.
because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,hines davidowitz,california discover bank rule is preempted by the faa.the judgment of the ninth circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice thomas,concurring.
section of the federal arbitration act faa provides that an arbitration provision shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the question here is whether california discover bank rule,see discover bank superior,cal,is a groun d for the revocation of any contract.
it would be absurd to suggest that requires only that a defense apply to any contract.if means anything,it is that courts can not refuse to enforce arbitration agreements because of a state public policy against arbitration,even if the policy nominally applies to any contract.there must be some additional limit on the contract defenses permitted by.ante,at opinion of the court state law may not require procedures that are not arbitration as envisioned by the faa and lac k its benefits post,at breyer,dissenting state law may require only procedures that are consistent with the use of arbitration 
i write separately to explain how i would find that limit in the faa text.as i would read it,the faa requires that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party successfully challenges the formation of the arbitration agreement,such as by proving fraud or duress.under this reading,i would reverse the court of appeals because a district court can not follow both the faa and the discover bank rule,which does not relate to defects in the making of an agreement.
this reading of the text,however,has not been fully developed by any party,brief for petitioner,and could benefit from briefing and argument in an appropriate case.moreover,i think that the court test will often lead to the same outcome as my textual interpretation and that,when possible,it is important in interpreting statutes to give lower courts guidance from a majority of the court.see us airways,barnett,concurring.therefore,although i adhere to my views on,see wyeth levine,opinion concurring in judgment,i reluctantly join the court opinion.
the faa generally requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements as written.section provides that a written provision in a contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.significantly,the statute does not parallel the words valid,irrevocable,and enforceable by referencing the grounds as exist for the invalidation,revocation,or nonenforcement of any contract.nor does the statute use a different word or phrase entirely that might arguably encompass validity,revocability,and.the use of only revocation and the conspicuous omission of invalidation and nonenforcement suggest that the exception does not include all defenses applicable to any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.see duncan walker,it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute internal quotation marks omitted.
concededly,the difference between revocability,on the one hand,and validity and enforceability,on the other,is not obvious.the statute does not define the terms,and their ordinary meanings arguably overlap.indeed,this court and others have referred to the concepts of revocability,validity,and enforceability interchangeably.but this ambiguity alone can not justify ignoring congress clear decision in to repeat only one of the three concepts.
to clarify the meaning of,it would be natural to look to other portions of the faa.statutory interpretation focuses on the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.united sav.of timbers of inwood forest associates.
examining the broader statutory scheme,can be read to clarify the scope of exception to the enforcement of arbitration agreements.when a party seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement in federal court,requires that upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,the court must order arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
reading and harmoniously,the grounds for the revocation preserved in would mean grounds related to the making of the agreement.this would require enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party successfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of the agreement to arbitrate,such as fraud,duress,or mutual mistake.see prima paint flood conklin,interpreting to permit federal courts to adjudicate claims of fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself because such claims g o to the making of the agreement to arbitrate contract defenses unrelated to the making of the agreement such as public policy could not be the basis for declining to enforce an arbitration clause.
under this reading,the question here would be whether california discover bank rule relates to the making of an agreement.i think it does not.
in discover bank,cal,the california supreme court held that class action waivers are,under certain circumstances,unconscionable as exculpatory.at,at see also,at,at c lass action waivers may be substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses that are contrary to public policy the court concluded that where a waiver is found in an arbitration agreement in certain consumer contracts of adhesion,such waivers should not be enforced.at,at.in practice,the court explained,such agreements operate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise would be imposed under california law.at,at.the court did not conclude that a customer would sign such an agreement only if under the influence of fraud,duress,or delusion.
the court analysis and conclusion that the arbitration agreement was exculpatory reveals that the discover bank rule does not concern the making of the arbitration agreement.exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic of contracts that will not be enforced because of public policy.giesel,corbin on contracts,ed.indeed,the court explained that it would not enforce the agreements because they are against the policy of the law.cal,at,at quoting cal.civ.code ann.see also cal,at,at agreements to arbitrate may not be used to harbor terms,conditions and practices that undermine public policy internal quotation marks omitted.refusal to enforce a contract for reasons does not concern whether the contract was properly made.
accordingly,the discover bank rule is not a groun d for the revocation of any contract as i would read of the faa in light of.under this reading,the faa dictates that the arbitration agreement here be enforced and the discover bank rule is.

the federal arbitration act says that an arbitration agreement shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.emphasis added.california law sets forth certain circumstances in which class action waivers in any contract are unenforceable.in my view,this rule of state law is consistent with the federal act language and primary objective.it does not stan d as an obstacle to the act accomplishment and execution.hines davidowitz.and the court is wrong to hold that the federal act the rule of state law.
the california law in question consists of an authoritative interpretation of two provisions of the california civil code.the first provision makes unlawful all contracts which have for their object,directly or,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own violation of law.cal.civ.code ann.west.the second provision authorizes courts to limit the application of any unconscionable clause in a contract so as to avoid any unconscionable result.a.
the specific rule of state law in question consists of the california supreme court application of these principles to hold that some but not all class action waivers in consumer contracts are exculpatory and unconscionable under california law.discover bank superior,cal.in particular,in discover bank the california supreme court stated that,when a waiver 
is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.at,at.

the discover bank rule does not create a blanket policy in california against class action waivers in the consumer context.provencher dell,supp,cd cal.instead,it represents the of a more general unconscionability principle.gentry superior,cal.courts applying california law have enforced waivers where they satisfy general unconscionability standards.see,walnut producers of cal.diamond foods,cal.app,cal.rptr,superior,cal.app,cal.rptr,smith americredit financial,wl sd,provencher,supra,at considering discover bank in inquiry.and even when they fail,the parties remain free to devise other dispute mechanisms,including informal mechanisms,that,in,will not prove unconscionable.see volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.

the discover bank rule is also consistent with the basic purpose behind the act.dean witter reynolds byrd.we have described that purpose as one of ensur ing judicial enforcement of arbitration agreements.see also marine transit dreyfus,the purpose of this bill is to make valid and enforcible agreements for arbitration quoting,emphasis added cong.rec.it creates no new legislation,grants no new rights,except a remedy to enforce an agreement in commercial contracts and in admiralty contracts as is well known,prior to the federal act,many courts expressed hostility to arbitration,for example by refusing to order specific performance of agreements to arbitrate.see.the act sought to eliminate that hostility by placing agreements to arbitrate upon the same footing as other contracts.scherk,quoting,at emphasis added.
congress was fully aware that arbitration could provide procedural and cost advantages.the house report emphasized the appropriate ness of making arbitration agreements enforceable at this time when there is so much agitation against the costliness and delays of litigation.at.and this court has acknowledged that parties may enter into arbitration agreements in order to expedite the resolution of disputes.see preston ferrer,discussing prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate see also mitsubishi motors soler.
but we have also cautioned against thinking that congress primary objective was to guarantee these particular procedural advantages.rather,that primary objective was to secure the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate.dean witter,at.see also,at we reject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the arbitration act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims at,t he intent of congress requires us to apply the terms of the act without regard to whether the result would be possibly inefficient at acknowledging that expedited resolution of disputes might lead parties to prefer arbitration.the relevant senate report points to the act basic purpose when it says that t he purpose of the act is clearly set forth in section,at emphasis added,namely,the section that says that an arbitration agreement shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,
thus,insofar as we seek to implement congress intent,we should think more than twice before invalidating a state law that does just what requires,namely,puts agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate upon the same footing.
the majority contrary view that discover bank stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal law objective,ante,at rests primarily upon its claims that the discover bank rule increases the complexity of arbitration procedures,thereby discouraging parties from entering into arbitration agreements,and to that extent discriminating in practice against arbitration.these claims are not well founded.
for one thing,a state rule of law that would sometimes set aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids class arbitration is not as the majority claims like a rule that would require ultimate disposition by a jury or judicially monitored discovery or use of the federal rules of evidence.ante,at.unlike the majority examples,class arbitration is consistent with the use of arbitration.it is a form of arbitration that is well known in california and followed elsewhere.see,keating superior,cal.rptr,app.officially depublished american arbitration association aaa,supplementary rules for class arbitrations,as visited,and available in clerk of court case file jams,the resolution experts,class action procedures.indeed,the aaa has told us that it has found class to be a fair,balanced,and efficient means of resolving class disputes.brief for aaa as amicus curiae in animalfeeds int l,hereinafter aaa amicus brief.and unlike the majority examples,the discover bank rule imposes equivalent limitations on litigation hence it can not fairly be characterized as a targeted attack on arbitration.
where does the majority get its contrary idea that individual,rather than class,arbitration is a fundamental attribut e of arbitration ante,at.the majority does not explain.and it is unlikely to be able to trace its present view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.
when congress enacted the act,arbitration procedures had not yet been fully developed.insofar as congress considered detailed forms of arbitration at all,it may well have thought that arbitration would be used primarily where merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact,not law,under the customs of their industries,where the parties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power.see mitsubishi motors,supra,at stevens,dissenting joint hearings on and before the subcommittees of the committees on the judiciary,hearing on and before a subcommittee of the senate committee on the judiciary,of commerce,secretary hoover favors arbitration press release,herbert hoover papers articles,addresses,and public statements file,herbert hoover presidential library cohen dayton,the new federal arbitration law,aaa,year book on commercial arbitration in the united states.this last mentioned feature of the history roughly equivalent bargaining power suggests,if anything,that california statute is consistent with,and indeed may help to further,the objectives that congress had in mind.
regardless,if neither the history nor present practice suggests that class arbitration is fundamentally incompatible with arbitration itself,then on what basis can the majority hold california law 
for another thing,the majority argument that the discover bank rule will discourage arbitration rests critically upon the wrong comparison.the majority compares the complexity of class arbitration with that of bilateral arbitration.see ante,at.and it finds the former more complex.see ibid.but,if incentives are at issue,the relevant comparison is not arbitration with arbitration but a comparison between class arbitration and judicial class actions.after all,in respect to the relevant set of contracts,the discover bank rule similarly and equally sets aside clauses that forbid class procedures whether arbitration procedures or ordinary judicial procedures are at issue.
why would a typical defendant say,a business prefer a judicial class action to class arbitration aaa statistics suggest that class arbitration proceedings take more time than the average commercial arbitration,but may take less time than the average class action in court.aaa amicus brief emphasis added.data from california courts confirm that class arbitrations can take considerably less time than proceedings in which class certification is sought.compare ante,at providing statistics for class arbitration,with judicial council of california,administrative office of the courts,class certification in california second interim report from the study of california class action litigation providing statistics for litigation in california courts.and a single class proceeding is surely more efficient than thousands of separate proceedings for identical claims.thus,if speedy resolution of disputes were all that mattered,then the discover bank rule would reinforce,not obstruct,that objective of the act.
the majority related claim that the discover bank rule will discourage the use of arbitration because a rbitration is poorly suited to higher stakes lacks empirical support.ante,at.indeed,the majority provides no convincing reason to believe that parties are unwilling to submit disputes to arbitration.and there are numerous counterexamples.loftus,rivals resolve dispute over drug,wall street journal,discussing million settlement in dispute submitted to arbitration ziobro,kraft seeks arbitration in fight w
