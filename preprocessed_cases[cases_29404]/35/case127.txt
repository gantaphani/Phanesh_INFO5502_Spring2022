in this patent infringement case,defendants advanced cardiac solutions and charles wall collectively acs appeal from several summary judgment orders issued by the united states district court for the northern district of alabama.the district court found acs liable to plaintiffs central admixture pharmacy services caps and gerald buckberg for willful infringement of patent the patent,and dismissed acs counterclaims of false marking and false advertisement.because the certificate of correction caps obtained from the patent and trademark office pto to alter the asserted claims of the patent is invalid,we vacate the finding of infringement and remand for a redetermination of infringement under the patent original,uncorrected claims.we affirm the district court summary judgment findings that the patent is not invalid and that caps did not commit false marking or false advertisement,as well as the court procedural rulings with respect to acs defenses of inequitable conduct and patent misuse.
background 
a.the technology and patent 
the patent at issue claims a chemical solution used during heart surgery.if blood supply to the heart is interrupted during surgery,lack of fresh blood ischemia will,untreated,cause cardiac tissue to die.patent.the patented solution contains glucose and amino acids to nourish the heart tissue even without a continuous supply of blood,allowing surgeons to operate on the heart for longer periods of time.
the patent has claims directed to the solution and to methods of treatment using the solution.for the purposes of the issues we reach on this appeal,claim is representative.that claim initially read 
in an amino acid enriched cardioplegic solution for use in treating human hearts to prevent or reverse heart muscle damage due to ischemia,said cardioplegic solution having a calcium ion concentration,a metabolizable substrate concentration and an osmolarity,wherein the improvement comprises 
maintaining said calcium ion concentration of said cardioplegic solution at a lowered level of between about umol 
maintaining said concentration of metabolizable substrate in said cardioplegic solution between about mg wherein said metabolizable substrate is selected from the group consisting of glucose,fructose,a salt of malic acid,a salt of succinic acid and a salt of pyruvic acid and 
maintaining said osmolarity of said cardioplegic solution at an increased level of between about mosmol.
patent to emphasis added.
b.the certificate of correction 
on december,caps applied,pursuant to,for a certificate of correction to replace all instances of the word osmolarity in the patent with the word osmolality.
section provides 
whenever a mistake of a clerical or typographical nature,or of minor character,which was not the fault of the patent and trademark office,appears in a patent and a showing has been made that such mistake occurred in good faith,the director may,upon payment of the required fee,issue a certificate of correction,if the correction does not involve such changes in the patent as would constitute new matter or would require reexamination.such patent,together with the certificate,shall have the same effect and operation in law on the trial of actions for causes thereafter arising as if the same had been originally issued in such corrected form.
on january,after the complaint in this lawsuit was filed,the pto issued the requested certificate.the two terms,which each describe the concentration of a chemical solution contributing to that solution osmotic pressure,are related but subtly different in meaning.osmolarity refers to the amount of solute dissolved chemical per liter of total solution.at the concentrations involved in this case,osmolarity is measured in milliosmoles per liter.in contrast,osmolality refers to the amount of solute per kilogram of solvent.it is measured in milliosmoles per kilogram.osmolality can be directly measured and calculated using a device called an osmometer,which computes osmolality from the depression of the solution freezing point.osmolarity is derived from the osmolality figure.
as highlighted above,the asserted patent claims initially required the solution to have an osmolarity of between about mosmol,but after the certificate issued,the claims required an osmolality of between about mosmol.emphasis added.for the solutions at issue here,the numerical figure for osmolarity will be less than the figure for osmolality by about one or two percent the result of this change is to cause the claimed concentration range to shift slightly downwards,covering solutions near the low end of the claimed range and ceasing to cover solutions near the high end.all of the allegedly infringing solutions have concentrations near the low end of the claimed range.because of the change in the range,it is more likely that the accused solutions infringe the corrected claims,while they may not have infringed the original claims.
buckberg dealings with uc and nih 
the research that led to the patent was conducted under a grant awarded by the national institutes of health nih to buckberg employer,the university of california uc.patent.the government therefore has certain rights with respect to the patent under the act,including the right to be notified of the invention,id.c,to obtain patents in foreign countries where the inventor does not pursue patent applications,id.c,a nonexclusive license,id.c,and the ability under certain circumstances to and compel the patentee to grant a license to a third party,id.
during patent prosecution,buckberg designated uc as his assignee.on february,uc communicated to nih its intent to abandon its interest in the pending application.one month later,buckberg wrote to nih to request that it waive patent rights in the application so that he could pursue the application in his personal capacity.see d allowing agencies to grant such requests.nih granted that waiver on september,on the condition that the inventor shall grant to the government of the united states a nonexclusive,irrevocable,license to use the invention for governmental purposes this determination will become effective upon receipt of the executed copy of the license.buckberg made an admission under.that he never executed the requested license the patent issued on january.on june,uc assigned its interest in the patent to buckberg.the same day,buckberg exclusively licensed the patent to caps.
litigation history 
on august,caps filed this infringement suit.buckberg later joined as a plaintiff.in an order dated january,the district court disposed of most of the issues in the case.it found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring this suit,granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs that the patent was not invalid and that the plaintiffs had not committed false marking or false advertising,and dismissed the defendants inequitable conduct defense on the pleadings.it also granted to the plaintiffs conditional summary judgment of infringement and willfulness for actions occurring after the issuance of the certificate of correction,contingent upon the certificate being found valid.the district court later determined that the certificate was valid as a matter of law.the plaintiffs then withdrew their claims of infringement for acts prior to the issuance of the certificate,making the district court infringement and willfulness judgments final as to all acts of infringement still alleged by the plaintiffs.acs timely appealed to this court.
ii.discussion 
acs argues that caps lacks standing to bring this action because,as a result of buckberg failure to execute the license required by nih,neither caps nor buckberg have rights to the patent.if acs is correct,this action must be dismissed since only the patent owner or the holder of all substantial rights under the patent may sue for infringement.see propat int l rpost,fieldturf,sw.recreational,speedplay,bebop,kelley,en banc.
as an initial matter,buckberg admitted pursuant to.that he did not execute the license to nih.he later sought to retract that admission,but the district court refused to allow him to do so.that refusal was not an abuse of discretion,so the fact that buckberg did not execute the license is for the purposes of this case conclusively established.b.
we discussed the consequences of a patentee failure to comply with the requirements of the act in campbell plastics engineering manufacturing,brownlee.in that case,an army contractor working under a contract developed an invention during the course of its work.id.at.the contract incorporated by reference regulation which requires that a contractor disclose to the government inventions made pursuant to the contract.id.the contractor in campbell plastics did not disclose that it had developed patentable subject matter,id.at,but obtained a patent on the invention,id.at.an administrative contract officer with the army demanded title to the invention,and the armed services board of contract appeals asbca affirmed.id.at.we affirmed the asbca,finding that the contractor failure to disclose the invention as provided in the contract afforded the government the opportunity to take title to its patent.id.at.the government chose to exercise its right pursuant to the regulations,and as a result,title to the patent was forfeited to the government.id.at.
critically,campbell plastics holds that a violation grants the government discretionary authority to take title.id.at regulation vests discretion in the government in determining whether to invoke forfeiture when an invention has not been correctly disclosed to it.emphasis added.when a violation occurs,the government can choose to take action thus,title to the patent may be voidable.however,it is not void title remains with the named inventors or their assignees.nothing in the statute,regulations,or our caselaw indicates that title is automatically forfeited.the government must take an affirmative action to establish its title and invoke forfeiture.the defendants here have no basis to challenge the government discretion in not invoking forfeiture.
it may be that buckberg failure to execute the required license enables nih to exercise its discretion to void his title in the question we assuredly do not decide today.however,nih has shown no interest in pursuing the matter.absent any action by nih,buckberg retains title to the patent and his exclusive license to caps is valid.the two plaintiffs together own all present rights in the patent,providing them standing to bring the action.since the district court infringement judgment is final as to all issues except for a determination of damages,we have jurisdiction under c.see mendenhall.
b.the certificate of correction 
a patentee who has made a mistake of a clerical or typographical nature,or of minor character may apply to the pto for a certificate of correction,if the correction does not involve such changes in the patent as would constitute new matter or would require.we have previously interpreted this statutory provision in superior fireplace majestic products.superior fireplace held that if a certificate of correction broadens a claim,it is only valid if it corrects a clerical or typographical error that would have been clearly evident to one of skill in the art reading the intrinsic evidence.id.at w e interpret to require that a broadening correction of a clerical or typographical error be allowed only where it is clearly evident from the specification,drawings,and prosecution history how the error should appropriately be corrected.id.at a mistake that,if corrected,would broaden the scope of a claim can not be a mistake of minor character.since the result is to invalidate a certificate of correction which is part of a duly issued patent,the party seeking invalidation must meet the clear and convincing standard of persuasion.id.at.
invalidating a certificate of correction for impermissible broadening therefore requires proof of two elements the corrected claims are broader than the original claims and the presence of the clerical or typographical error,or how to correct that error,is not clearly evident to one of skill in the art.the first element poses a question of law,since the correct scope and meaning of a claim is an issue for the court to decide.see markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d see also cybor fas,en banc.to answer the question of whether a claim has been broadened through correction requires interpreting the old and new versions of that claim,and then determining whether the new version covers territory the old one did not.this same inquiry has been treated as a question of law in reissue cases,and should be treated as such in the context as well.see mbo,becton,dickinson,in re clement,deciding as a matter of law whether and in what aspect the reissue claims are broader than the patent claims.we find that these claims were broadened by the certificate of correction,since the claims as corrected cover solutions which would not be covered under the original claims.
the second element,whether the error and its correction would both be clearly evident to one of skill in the art,has been treated as a factual question.see arthrocare smith nephew,reviewing jury verdict for substantial evidence superior fireplace,at reviewing district court summary judgment for a genuine issue.acs moved for judgment that the certificate of correction was invalid,but the district court ruled as a matter of law that the certificate was valid.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
superior fireplace posits three categories into which an error might fall.the first category involves mistakes that are immediately apparent and leave no doubt as to what the mistake is.id.at.this category includes misspellings that leave no doubt as to the word which was intended frane instead of frame,for example.id.this category also extends to clerical errors in which the patentee attempts to change every instance of a particular claim term in prosecution but misses one,leaving a claim that,on its face,is nonsensical in light of the specification.in such cases,one of skill in the art would know from the prosecution history that the patentee had missed one term and would know that the proper correction would be to change that term as well.arthrocare,at.
since an error of the first category makes its own correction known to one of skill in the art,those errors do not raise serious public notice problems and can properly be corrected via a certificate.
in contrast,a second category includes those typographical mistakes not apparent to the reader at all for example,a mistake resulting in another word that is spelled correctly and that reads logically in the context of the sentence.a third category of mistakes includes those where it is apparent that a mistake has been made,but it is unclear what the mistake is.
superior fireplace,at.it is not evident to the reader of the public record how to appropriately correct mistakes of the second and third categories,so those categories of error can not be repaired via a certificate of correction if the effect would be to broaden the claim.
the undisputed facts demonstrate that the error here is one of the second category.the word osmolarity is indeed spelled correctly and reads logically in the context of the sentence.id.all solutions of the type described have a calculable osmolarity,and to one of skill in the art,a concentration of about is not a manifestly erroneous one the patentee specified a particular unit of measure for his claim.that unit measures the appropriate property chemical concentration and the claimed range is,as demonstrated by the written description,generally effective for the stated purpose.the fact that the unit of measure that the patentee indicated is not the most conventional or convenient is of limited significance claims mean precisely what they say.phillips awh,en banc w e look to the words of the claims themselves to define the scope of the patented invention.emphasis added quoting vitronics conceptronic.
since the error corrected here was not clearly evident to one of skill in the art and the result o
