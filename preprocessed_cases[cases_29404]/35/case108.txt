appellant arrow financial services arrow appeals the district court decision,on summary judgment,that letters sent by arrow to nearly california residents constituted false,deceptive,or misleading representation s in connection with the collection of any debt in violation of the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.it also appeals a jury award,after trial,of statutory damages under both the fdcpa and california rosenthal fair debt collection practices act rosenthal act,california civil code et.arrow contends that the rosenthal act does not permit class actions,and that permitting class plaintiffs to recover statutory damages under both the fdcpa and rosenthal act violates the fdcpa.we have jurisdiction under.we disagree with arrow contentions and affirm the district court.

important notice required by law this agency is engaged in the collection of debts.this communication is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.
finally,in bold letters,the letter instructed gonzales to please see reverse side for important information.the important information was the following notice to california residents as required by law,you are hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations.id.at.all in all,the letter refers to credit bureaus three times.it twice states that if arrow is reporting the debt,it will notify credit bureaus once the settlement funds clear,and also provides a notice that if a consumer fails to fulfill his credit obligations,negative information may be submitted to a credit reporting agency.
on receipt of the letter,gonzales conducted an independent investigation and determined that arrow could not legally report the debt to any credit bureau.on january,gonzales filed suit on behalf of himself and a putative class,claiming violations of the fdcpa and the rosenthal act,because the letter would likely cause recipients to believe that their failure to pay the debts would result in negative credit reports.the district court certified a class to include similarly situated californians,and designated gonzales as the class representative.on june,the district court granted summary judgment to gonzales on the issue of liability under the fdcpa and the rosenthal act.
the district court then held a jury trial to determine the amount of damages.the court instructed the jury that class members could receive separate statutory damages pursuant to the fdcpa and the rosenthal act claims.the jury awarded gonzales on the fdcpa claim and an additional on the rosenthal act claim.it awarded the class members on the fdcpa claim and on the rosenthal act claim.the total damages awarded were.

the fdcpa was enacted as a broad remedial statute designed to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.the fdcpa comprehensively regulates the conduct of debt collectors,imposing affirmative obligations and broadly prohibiting abusive practices.see,governing the acquisition of location information,prohibiting misleading or deceptive practices.the fdcpa does not ordinarily require proof of intentional violation,and is a strict liability statute.see mccollough johnson,rodenburg lauinger,llc,cir.though the federal trade commission ftc is empowered to enforce the fdcpa,congress encouraged private enforcement by permitting aggrieved individuals to bring suit as private attorneys general.camacho bridgeport,cir.prevailing plaintiffs,including class members,are entitled to actual damages,statutory damages,and attorney fees and costs.a.
as relevant here,section of the fdcpa broadly prohibits the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.the act includes a list of examples of proscribed conduct,including 
the threat to take any action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.
the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.
whether conduct violates requires an objective analysis that takes into account whether the least sophisticated debtor would likely be misled by a communication.donohue,at quoting guerrero rjm acquisitions llc,cir see also swanson or.credit,cir in this circuit,a debt collector liability under of the fdcpa is an issue of law terran kaplan,cir.

we reject arrow arguments that its letters do not violate the and hold that,under the least sophisticated debtor standard,the letters are misleading and impliedly threaten to take action that can not be legally taken.
section,which prohibits t he use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect any debt,has been referred to as a catchall provision,and can be violated in any number of novel ways.rosenau,at.nevertheless,it is well established that a debt collection letter is deceptive where it can be reasonably read to have two or more different meanings,one of which is inaccurate.brown card serv,cir internal quotation omitted accord kistner law offices of michael margelefsy,llc,cir russell equifax,cir.
arrow wisely concedes that it had no intention of reporting the health club debts to a credit bureau and was legally prohibited from so doing.it argues,though,that because the letters employ conditional language if we are reporting the account,it is wholly unreasonable to infer that arrow could or would report the account.we disagree.at the outset,we emphasize that a literally true statement can still be misleading.see,brown,at avila rubin,cir.arrow is also correct that faced with ambiguous language,an unusually savvy consumer such as gonzales would seek clarification of whether his debt could be reported.we are not,however,to read the language from the perspective of a savvy consumer,and consumers are under no obligation to seek explanation of confusing or misleading language in debt collection letters.fields wilbur law firm,cir.
to the least sophisticated debtor,the phrase if we are reporting the account,the appropriate credit bureaus will be notified that this account has been settled suggests two possibilities.it suggests the possibility that arrow was not reporting the debt to a credit reporting agency,and would accordingly make no further report in the event of settlement.but the phrase also suggests that,under some set of circumstances applicable to the recipient,arrow could and would report the account absent any possibility that arrow could report the accounts,there would be no reason for arrow to assert its intention to make a positive report in the event of payment.only the first reading is actually correct,but the second reading is far from bizarre or idiosyncratic it is eminently reasonable.as there is no circumstance under which arrow could legally report an obsolete debt to a credit bureau,the implication that arrow could make a positive report in the event of payment is misleading.
the misleading nature of the if we are reporting the debt clause is compounded by the fact that arrow did nothing to clarify when it could report a debt.where the law places affirmative limits on a debt collector actions,the debt collector that goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct takes the risk that it will be liable under the fdcpa for misleading consumers.swanson,at.when language in a debt collection letter can reasonably be interpreted to imply that the debt collector will take action it has no intention or ability to undertake,the debt collector that fails to clarify that ambiguity does so at its peril.see evory,at noting that debt collectors could protect the unsophisticated consumer against falsely believing a is and by including clarifying language to the effect of we are not obligated to renew this offer.greco trauner,cohen thomas,cir reiterating that a letter sent on law firm letterhead,standing alone represents that an attorney has been meaningfully involved in the collection process,but holding that impression was cured by a clear disclaimer explaining the limited extent of the attorneys involvement in the collection of the recipient debt.
conditional language,particularly in the absence of any language clarifying or explaining the conditions,does not insulate a debt collector from liability.leblanc,at rejecting a debt collector reliance on the use of conditional language in an effort to safeguard the letter from being construed as threatening.we decline to adopt arrow approach,which would permit it to undermine the consumer protection goals of the statute through a flimsy disguise of conditional language.nat l fin,at.the phrase if we are reporting the account,the appropriate credit bureaus will be notified that this account has been settled is misleading,and violates.brown,at.
we turn next to the question of whether the letters also violate section e section prohibits a debt collector from making a threat to take any action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.whether arrow letters could be construed by the least sophisticated debtor as threatening to report obsolete debt when arrow had no ability or intention to do so presents a closer question.the letters are not overtly threatening.nevertheless,a threat need not be express it can be implied.
we are persuaded that arrow letters,read as a whole,would be interpreted by the least sophisticated debtor as threatening to report or continue to report obsolete debts.arrow argues that the letters promise only to make a positive report indicating full payment of the debt once payment cleared,and thus could not reasonably be read to imply a threat to make a negative report in the event of nonpayment.this argument fails.setting aside the fact that arrow could not legally make any report on these obsolete debts arrow could only make a positive report if it had already placed,or would shortly place,a report of the obsolete debt in the debtor file.such a report would be negative it would show that the debt was delinquent and unpaid.indeed,
arrow specifically informed consumers in one of its letters that a negative credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations.
logically,if arrow failed to make a positive report indicating that the debt was satisfied,the negative report would remain on the debtor record.in other words,the failure to make a positive report on an existing debt is the functional equivalent of a negative report.the least sophisticated debtor could conclude that,unless he paid the settlement amount or the full amount of the debt,arrow would place a negative record in his credit report,or would decline to remove the negative record already in place.this reading is not bizarre or idiosyncratic.accordingly,we hold that arrow violated.we affirm the district court grant of partial summary judgment for gonzales on the fdcpa claim.
arrow also contends that the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could make separate awards of statutory damages under both the fdcpa and rosenthal act.it argues that the rosenthal act does not permit class actions.it also contends,in the alternative,that permitting class recovery under the fdcpa and the rosenthal act contradicts the spirit of the fdcpa.arrow is wrong on both counts.
class actions under the rosenthal act 
as originally enacted,the rosenthal act did not permit class actions.rather,it provided that any debt collector who willfully and knowingly violates this title with respect to any debtor shall be liable to the debtor only in an individual action for a penalty not less than one hundred dollars nor greater than one thousand dollars.cal.civ.code b.in,however,the california legislature amended the rosenthal act to permit class actions.
the amendment states 
notwithstanding any other provision of this title,every debt collector collecting or attempting to collect a consumer debt shall comply with the provisions of sections to,inclusive,of,and shall be subject to the remedies in section of,title of the united states code.
cal.civ.code emphasis added.section of the fdcpa provides for class recovery of actual damages up to and statutory damages not to exceed the lesser of or per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.a.
by use of the phrase notwithstanding any other provision,the amendment unambiguously supercedes any provision of the rosenthal act inconsistent with the referenced provisions of the fdcpa,including those subjecting debt collectors to class actions.the amendment did not delete the individual action provision,but by permitting class actions,it nullified the provision effect.further,the legislative history contains ample evidence that the amendment was intended to permit class actions.the bill analysis prepared by the california senate judiciary committee stated that existing law does not provide for class actions and that absent the threat of a class action,there is no incentive to abort an illegal continuing course of conduct.judiciary,report on at,cal it explained that the amendments would provide that violators shall be subject to the remedies in the fdcpa,including a ll actual damages and an amount not to exceed the lesser of up to or percent of the net worth penalty together with costs of suit and attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff s for class actions.id.at emphasis added.similarly,the bill analysis prepared by the assembly committee on banking and finance notes that the bill subjects debt collectors to the remedies of actual damages and up to for an individual for violation affecting a class composed of numerous debtors.ass.comm.on banking and finance,report on,at cal emphasis added 
every court to have considered the issue has held that class actions may proceed under the amendment to the rosenthal act,notwithstanding the contradictory individual action language in.see palmer stassinos,abels jbc legal grp,cal edstrom all servs.processing,no.bz,wl,at,mcdonald bonded collectors,llc.in addition,although not expressly considering the issue,this court and at least two california courts have entertained class actions brought under the rosenthal act.see irwin mascott,cir fireside bank,cal asset acceptance,llc hansen,civ.no,wl.in light of the clear statutory language,unequivocal legislative history,and the unanimous agreement of the courts,we hold that the rosenthal act permits class actions.
cumulative recovery under the fdcpa and the rosenthal act 
arrow argues,in the alternative,that plaintiffs are precluded from recovering statutory damages under both the fdcpa and the rosenthal act.its argument contravenes the plain language of both acts,and ignores the many courts that have permitted simultaneous recovery under both acts 
federal law preempts state law in three circumstances 
congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively finally,state law is preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.
english,citations omitted.the fdcpa states explicitly 
this subchapter does not annul,alter,or affect,or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with the laws of any state with respect to debt collection practices,except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter,and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.for purposes of this section,a state law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection provided by this subchapter.
this language,coupled with the fdcpa express purpose to promote consistent state action,e,establishes that congress did not intend the fdcpa to preempt consistent state consumer protection laws medtronic,lohr,the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted.statutory damages under the fdcpa are intended to deter violations by imposing a cost on the defendant even if his misconduct imposed no cost on the plaintiff.crabill trans union,cir.state laws permitting plaintiffs to recover additional statutory damages increase deterrence,thus affording greater protections to consumers and operating consistently with the fdcpa.see.accordingly,we presume that the fdcpa permits plaintiffs to recover additional damages under state law.
similarly,the rosenthal act does not limit recovery simply because it is also available under federal law.the rosenthal act specifically provides that its remedies are intended to be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies under any other provision of law.cal.civ.code in an analogous case,the eleventh circuit held that a florida consumer protection statute,which stated that its remedies were cumulative,contemplated dual enforcement that an out of state debt collector could quite possibly be subject to the sanctions and enforcement provisions of both of the various states or the fdcpa.leblanc,at internal quotation marks omitted.
arrow argues that,notwithstanding the language of the fdcpa and the rosenthal act,permitting plaintiffs to recover under both statutes would run afoul of the general proposition that a plaintiff may not receive multiple awards for the same item of damage and contravene the fdcpa implied limit on double recovery.
we readily dispense of the first argument,because the authority cited by arrow for the proposition that as a general rule,a plaintiff may not receive multiple awards for the same item of damage is distinguishable.the general rule is that plaintiffs may not recover for the same loss in both contract and in tort.see,ambassador hotel wei chuan,cir.these common law principles are wholly inapplicable to the statutory damage provisions of the fdcpa and rosenthal act.statutory damages under both provisions are not tied in any way to actual losses suffered by the plaintiff.see u.b cal.civ.code.moreover,we can not reject the statutory text in order to imply common law limitations,particularly where,as here,the statute language is plain,and the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir rejecting the district court attempt to graft principles of common law witness immunity onto attorney communications under the fdcpa quoting united states ron pair.
we also reject arrow argument that recovery under state and federal law contravenes the fdcpa implied ban on cumulative recovery.simply put,there is nothing in the fdcpa from which to imply a per se prohibition on class recovery under both state and federal law.the only limit on class recovery under the fdcpa is that statutory damages for the class can not exceed the lesser of or per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.this limit is intended to ensure that punishment is meted out according to a business ability to absorb the penalty.sanders jackson,cir those concerns are not at issue in this case.here,the total damages awarded were significantly less than the statutory limit.in this case,permitting recovery under the rosenthal act and the fdcpa is not inconsistent with section of the fdcpa 
in adopting the fdcpa,congress emphasized that m eans other than misrepresentation and other abusive debt collection practices are available for the effective collection of debts.b.we hold that letters,which misleadingly implied that arrow had the ability to report obsolete debts to credit bureaus,and impliedly threatened to make such reports,violated sections and e of the fdcpa.we recognize that the fdcpa does not consistent state action,including cumulative recovery of statutory damages under state law.the rosenthal act remedies are cumulative,and available even when the fdcpa affords relief.in light of these holdings,we affirm the district court.
i must dissent from the majority opinion,because plaintiffs can not obtain a double statutory damages recovery under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.the plaintiffs in this case can not receive duplicative statutory damages awards under california law,because the california legislature adopted identical provisions of the fdcpa when it amended california rosenthal fair debt collection practices act rosenthal act,cal.et.additionally,construing adopted fdcpa remedy provisions to provide duplicative awards must invite preemption,because such awards will undermine the statute protective cap on statutory damages.
the california legislature replaced substantial portions of the rosenthal act with the fdcpa to harmonize california and federal debt collection practices law.see california bill analysis,senate judiciary committee,regular session,july,available at ftp pub ab last visited.california civil code,which amended the rosenthal act,provides
