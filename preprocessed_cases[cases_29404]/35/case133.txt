this case arises at the intersection of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et and the unfair insurance practices act uipa,et.the question is whether insurance practices that violate the uipa can support a ucl action.in moradi shalal fireman fund ins.companies cal d,moradi shalal we held that when the legislature enacted the uipa,it did not intend to create a private cause of action for commission of the various unfair practices listed in insurance code section,subdivision h in the wake of moradi shalal,a split has developed in the courts of appeal regarding the viability of ucl claims based on insurer conduct covered by section.
we hold that moradi shalal does not preclude first party ucl actions based on grounds independent from section,even when the insurer conduct also violates section we have made it clear that while a plaintiff may not use the ucl to plead around an absolute bar to relief,the uipa does not immunize insurers from ucl liability for conduct that violates other laws in addition to the uipa.manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,manufacturers life see also cel tech communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,cel tech quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,quelimane stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,stop youth addiction.
here,plaintiff alleges causes of action for false advertising and insurance bad faith,both of which provide grounds for a ucl claim independent from the uipa.allowing her also to sue under the ucl does no harm to the rule established in moradi shalal.the moradi shalal court made it plain that while violations of section h are themselves not actionable,insureds retain other causes of action against insurers,including common law bad faith claims.furthermore,ucl actions by private parties are equitable proceedings,with limited remedies.they are thus quite distinct from the claims for damages with which moradi shalal was concerned.
background 
plaintiff yanting zhang bought a comprehensive general liability policy from california capital insurance company california capital.she sued california capital in a dispute over coverage for fire damage to her commercial property.the complaint included causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and violation of the ucl.in her ucl claim,zhang alleged that california capital had engaged in unfair,deceptive,untrue,misleading advertising by promising to provide timely coverage in the event of a compensable loss,when it had no intention of paying the true value of its insureds covered claims.
california capital demurred to the ucl claim,contending it was an impermissible attempt to plead around moradi shalal bar against private actions for unfair insurance practices under section the trial court agreed,and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court of appeal reversed,holding that zhang false advertising claim was a viable basis for her ucl cause of action.california capital sought review.
ii.discussion 
the rules by which the sufficiency of a complaint is tested against a general demurrer are well settled.we not only treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but also give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context citation.if the complaint states a cause of action under any theory,regardless of the title under which the factual basis for relief is stated,that aspect of the complaint is good against a demurrer.w e are not limited to plaintiffs theory of recovery in testing the sufficiency of their complaint against a demurrer,but instead must determine if the factual allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory citations.quelimane,supra,cal th at.
overview of the ucl 
the ucl defines unfair competition as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.bus.by proscribing any unlawful business act or practice ibid,the ucl borrows rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those rules independently actionable.cel tech,supra,cal th at.however,a practice may violate the ucl even if it is not prohibited by another statute.unfair and fraudulent practices are alternate grounds for relief.ibid.false advertising is included in the fraudulent category of prohibited practices.in re tobacco ii cases cal th,kasky nike,cal th.
we have made it clear that an action under the ucl is not an substitute for a tort or contract action.citation.instead,the act provides an equitable means through which both public prosecutors and private individuals can bring suit to prevent unfair business practices and restore money or property to victims of these practices.as we have said,the overarching legislative concern was to provide a streamlined procedure for the prevention of ongoing or threatened acts of unfair competition.citation.because of this objective,the remedies provided are limited.korea supply lockheed martin cal th.accordingly,while ucl remedies are cumulative to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state bus,they are narrow in scope.
prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.citations.plaintiffs may not receive damages or attorney fees.cel tech,supra,cal th at.restitution under business and professions code section is confined to restoration of any interest in money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.italics added.a restitution order against a defendant thus requires both that money or property have been lost by a plaintiff,on the one hand,and that it have been acquired by a defendant,on the other.kwikset superior court cal th.c ompensatory damages are not recoverable as restitution.pineda bank of america,cal th,fn.
we have also emphasized that the equitable remedies of the ucl are subject to the broad discretion of the trial court.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th.the ucl does not require restitutionary or injunctive relief when an unfair business practice has been shown.rather,it provides that the court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment of any practice which constitutes unfair competition or as may be necessary to restore money or property.cortez,at,quoting bus.i n addition to those defenses which might be asserted to a charge of violation of the statute that underlies a ucl action,a ucl defendant may assert equitable considerations.in deciding whether to grant the remedy or remedies sought by a ucl plaintiff consideration of the equities between the parties is necessary to ensure an equitable result.cortez,at.

moradi shalal 
the question before us is the extent to which relief under the ucl is limited by the holding in moradi shalal,supra,cal d.there,we reconsidered and abolished a uipa cause of action that had been approved by royal globe ins.superior court cal d royal globe.the royal globe plaintiff was a third party claimant who sued the insurer of property where she was injured.royal globe,at.she contended the insurer had violated section h by failing to settle her claim promptly and fairly,and section h by advising her not to obtain the services of an attorney.royal globe,at.the royal globe court decided that section h,enacted in as part of a comprehensive regulation of the insurance business,permitted third party plaintiffs to sue insurers for unfair acts or practices proscribed by the statute.royal globe,at.
we overruled royal globe in moradi shalal,supra,cal d at page.the moradi shalal court noted that royal globe was decided by a bare majority.moradi shalal,at.its decision to permit third party statutory bad faith actions had not been followed by other state courts.id.at.it had been criticized by legal commentators,and was inconsistent with the drafting history of the model unfair claims practices act,from which section h was drawn.moradi shalal,at.moreover,parts of the legislative history of section itself,unmentioned in royal globe,indicated that only administrative enforcement by the insurance commissioner had been contemplated.moradi shalal,at.moradi shalal also noted that royal globe had spawned proliferating litigation,escalating insurance costs,conflicts of interest,complex practical problems,and various analytical difficulties.id.at.
significant for our purposes is moradi shalal observation that the abrogation of royal globe left intact not only administrative remedies,but also traditional common law theories of private recovery against insurers.these include fraud,infliction of emotional distress,and as to the insured either breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.moradi shalal,cal d at.thus,first party bad faith actions were unaffected by moradi shalal.
in zephyr park superior court,supra,d,the court held that moradi shalal bar against actions under section h applied to insureds as well as third party claimants.but it noted that insureds retain the common law cause of action for bad faith settlement practices.zephyr park,at.there is simply no need,therefore,to perpetuate the availability of section h as the basis for first party causes of action.zephyr park,at accord,tricor california,superior court d.we cited zephyr park with approval in waller truck ins.exchange,cal th.
opinions construing moradi shalal and the ucl 
after moradi shalal,the law regarding ucl claims against insurers went through a rather complicated evolution,in a variety of contexts.first,a series of court of appeal decisions rejected attempts to state ucl causes of action against insurers in bad faith cases.industrial indemnity superior court d,industrial indemnity moradi shalal barred third party claim for damages under ucl safeco ins.superior court d,safeco third party action ucl provides no toehold for scaling the barrier of moradi shalal maler superior court d,maler first party action plaintiffs can not circumvent moradi shalal ban by bootstrapping an alleged violation of section onto business and professions code section so as to state a cause of action under section.
in rubin green cal th rubin,we relied by way of analogy on these court of appeal opinions.at issue in rubin was whether injunctive relief was available under the ucl for conduct protected by the litigation privilege,subd.b.rubin,at.we decided it was not,given the absolute nature of that privilege.we referred to industrial indemnity,safeco,and maler as cases where implied private rights of action alleging bad faith claims against insurers,barred by our opinion in moradi shalal,were not resurrected by casting the action as one for relief under the unfair competition statute.rubin,at.
however,in the seminal case of manufacturers life,we distinguished rubin and made it plain that the uipa does not generally exempt insurers from ucl liability.rather,we held,the remedies provided in the ucl are cumulative to those available to the insurance commissioner under the uipa.manufacturers life,supra,cal th at.the manufacturers life plaintiff was an insurance agency.it alleged a conspiracy by other elements of the insurance industry to retaliate against it for its practice of disclosing to attorneys the actual costs of settlement annuities.the complaint asserted violations of the uipa and the cartwright act,california antitrust statute bus,et.the plaintiff also sought ucl remedies based on the uipa and cartwright act violations.manufacturers life,at.
the manufacturers life defendants argued that permitting a ucl action for an unfair insurance practice prohibited by the uipa would seriously compromise moradi shalal bar against private causes of action for violations of section,even if the practice also violated the cartwright act manufacturers life,supra,cal th at.we were not persuaded.we noted that the court of appeal,relying on rubin,had held the plaintiff could not plead around moradi shalal by basing a ucl cause of action on conduct violating only the uipa,but that a ucl claim was supported when the insurer conduct independently violated the cartwright act.manufacturers life,at.
we explained that rubin had analogized an attempt to plead around the litigation privilege to the attempts to avoid the bar to implied private causes of action under section,which several courts of appeal had held could not be avoided by characterizing the claim as one under the ucl.citations.manufacturers life,supra,cal th at.h owever,a cause of action for unfair competition based on conduct made unlawful by the cartwright act is not an implied cause of action which moradi shalal held could not be found in the uipa.there is no attempt to use the ucl to confer private standing to enforce a provision of the uipa.nor is the cause of action based on conduct which is absolutely privileged or immunized by another statute,such as the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b.manufacturers life,at.
this conclusion does not compromise the rule of moradi shalal in any way.the court concluded there that the legislature did not intend to create new causes of action when it described unlawful insurance business practices in section,and therefore that section did not create a private cause of action under the uipa.the court did not hold that by identifying practices that are unlawful in the insurance industry the legislature intended to bar cartwright act causes of action based on those practices.nothing in the uipa would support such a conclusion.the uipa nowhere reflects legislative intent to repeal the cartwright act insofar as it applies to the insurance industry,and the legislature has clearly stated its intent that the remedies and penalties under the ucl are cumulative to other remedies and penalties.manufacturers life,supra,cal th at.
manufacturers life had an impact in state farm fire casualty superior court th state farm,a first party bad faith action.insured homeowners sought damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith,breach of contract,professional negligence,and fraud,based on state farm alleged surreptitious alteration of their earthquake insurance coverage.they also pursued ucl remedies.state farm,at.state farm demurrer was overruled and it sought writ relief,contending the ucl claim was an improper attempt to plead around moradi shalal bar against private actions under section.state farm,at.
the state farm court denied the writ.relying on manufacturers life,it acknowledged that the insureds could not borrow the provisions of section to establish an unlawful business practice.state farm,supra,th at.however,it held that the ucl cause of action was supported by the insureds allegations of fraud and common law bad faith,which included examples of all three varieties of prohibited business practices unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent.state farm,at.in particular,the state farm court found that the fraud and bad faith claims were independent bases for plaintiffs ucl cause of action that are not distinguishable from the independent cartwright act violation which the supreme court recently held was sufficient to support a claim for relief under the ucl,notwithstanding that the acts complained of also violated section.state farm,at,citing manufacturers life,supra,cal th at.
the state farm court noted that unlike the plaintiffs in industrial indemnity,safeco,and maler,these insureds had pleaded a proper ucl cause of action seeking only injunctive and restitutive relief.state farm,supra,th at.nothing in moradi shalal suggests that it was addressing anything other than the viability of an implied right of action for damages.id.at.
state farm argued that recognizing a right of action under the ucl for conduct proscribed by section would revive what the supreme court called the undesirable social and economic effects of the royal globe decision,multiple litigation,unwarranted bad faith claims,coercive settlements,excessive jury awards,and escalating insurance,legal and other transaction costs.moradi shalal,supra,cal d at.state farm,supra,th at.the court disagreed w e believe that this concern is overblown.the injunctive and restitutive remedies authorized under the ucl are of very limited utility.they are designed to prevent unfair business practices and to require disgorgement of money or property obtained by means of such practices.damages are not available under business and professions code section.citation.that means that no claim for compensatory or punitive damages can be recovered in a ucl action.it is therefore not at all clear to us how our application of the very clear language of the ucl will necessarily resurrect any of the perceived evils of royal globe.state farm,at.
in stop youth addiction,supra,cal th,this court discussed the holdings in rubin,manufacturers life,and the safeco line of cases,without mentioning state farm.the defendant in stop youth addiction argued that,because penal code section provides no private cause of action for violations of its prohibition against selling cigarettes to minors,ucl remedies for that conduct were unavailable.stop youth addiction,at.the defendant claimed rubin had endorsed the safeco court view that a ucl claim can not be based on a statute that does not authorize an independent cause of action.safeco,supra,d at see stop youth addiction,at.we disagreed,noting that manufacturers life had limited rubin holding to the absolute bar to relief created by the litigation privilege.stop youth addiction,at.
we added neither from our discussion nor from the authorities we cited in manufacturers life does it follow that a private plaintiff lacks ucl standing whenever the conduct alleged to constitute unfair competition violates a statute for the direct enforcement of which there is no private right of action.to the contrary,in manufacturers life we permitted a ucl claim based on the cartwright act to go forward,even while recognizing that the conduct alleged as unfair competition also violated the uipa,for the direct enforcement of which,following moradi shalal,there is no private right of action in manufacturers life,moreover,we explained that moradi shalal was not meant to impose sweeping limitations on private antitrust or unfair competition actions.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at.as relevant here,safeco and similar cases on which the defendant relies,such as maler,supra,d,and rubin,supra,cal th,stand at most for the proposition the ucl can not be used to state a cause of action the gist of which is absolutely barred under some other principle of law.stop youth addiction,at.
we again reaffirmed manufacturers life in quelimane,supra,cal th,where the plaintiff claimed that title companies had conspired to withhold title insurance for property purchased at tax sales.we noted that manufacturers life had established the viability of cartwright act violations as the predicate for a ucl action.quelimane,at.we further held that the plaintiffs had stated a ucl claim based on the defendants allegedly false advertising,which consisted of promising to issue title insurance for any property with good title.id.at.
in cel tech,supra,cal th,we revisited the rule of manufacturers life,as follows if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.cel tech,at.rubin,supra,cal th,illustrates this principle.in that case,the plaintiff relied on the unfair competition law to pursue an action that the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b,otherwise prohibited.we rejected the claim that a plaintiff may,in effect,plead around absolute barriers to relief by relabeling the nature of the action as one brought under the unfair competition statute.rubin,supra,cal th at.cel tech,at.
a plaintiff may thus not plead around an absolute bar to relief simply by recasting the cause of action as one for unfair competition.manufacturers life,supra,cal th.the rule does not,however,prohibit an action under the ucl merely because some other statute on the subject does not,itself,provide for the action or prohibit the challenged conduct.to forestall an action under the ucl,another provision must actually bar the action or clearly permit the conduct.cel tech,supra,cal th at.
after cel tech,a split in court of appeal opinion was created by textron financial national union fire ins.th textron,which disagreed with state farm,supra,th.textron held a security interest in a bus insured by the defendant.it submitted a claim after the bus was damaged in an accident.the claim was denied,and textron sued the insurer for breach of contract,fraud,and bad faith.it also included a ucl claim for injunctive relief and restitution.the trial court sustained a demurrer to the ucl claim.textron prevailed on its other claims at trial,but filed an appeal challenging the demurrer ruling.textron,at.the court of appeal affirmed,reasoning that the unfair practices alleged in the complaint were the type of activities covered by the uipa,and that merely alleging these purported acts constitute unfair business practices under the unfair competition law is insufficient to overcome moradi shalal.id.at.
while insurance companies are subject to california laws generally applicable to other businesses,including laws governing unfair business practices,subd.a,parties can not plead around moradi shalal holding by merely relabeling their cause of action as one for unfair competition.textron,supra,th at,citing manufacturers life,supra,cal th at,maler,supra,d at,and safeco,supra,d at page.the persuasiveness of state farm has been undercut by the supreme court subsequent disapproval of its definition of unfair business practices.textron,at see cel tech,supra,cal th at disapproving definition of unfair business acts or practices quoted in state farm.the textron court concluded g iven the supreme court disapproval of state farm amorphous definition of unfair practices and its focus on legislatively declared public policy,reliance on general common law principles to support a cause of action for unfair competition is unavailing.textron,at.
in the case at bench,the court of appeal disagreed with textron,believing it focused too narrowly on the unfair prong of potential liability under the ucl.the court endorsed the proposition,which it drew from state farm,that an insurer is not protected from ucl liability simply because its claims handling practices may be prohibited by section.it decided that zhang false advertising claim supported her ucl cause of action,a result it deemed consistent with moradi shalal and manufacturers life.for reasons set forth below,we conclude the court of appeal correctly followed state farm instead of textron.
d.the viability of zhang ucl claim 
as noted,zhang ucl claim is premised on allegations of false advertising.she contends california capital misleadingly advertised that it would timely pay the true value of covered claims.she asserts that its treatment of her claim demonstrated it had no intention of honoring that promise.california capital demurrer was based on textron rule that a ucl claim may not be brought for settlement practices prohibited by the uipa.textron,supra,th at.california capital argued that the crux of the ucl claim was improper claims handling,and the allegations of unfair competition and false advertising were nothing more than an attempt to plead around the bar of moradi shalal.
in this court,california capital maintains its insistence that zhang ucl claim is actually directed at its claims handling,not its advertising.it argues that any bad faith claim might be turned into a false advertising suit,because all insurers at least impliedly promise to pay what they owe under their policies.california capital urges us to follow textron and the safeco line of cases,and to disapprove state farm however,we hold state farm consistent,and textron inconsistent,with our decisions on the scope of ucl liability.
in manufacturers life,we held that the uipa does not exempt insurers from liability for anticompetitive conduct,and therefore acts violating both the uipa and the cartwright act could give rise to a ucl claim.manufacturers life,supra,cal th at.the state farm court correctly recognized that this reasoning supports claims for ucl relief based on conduct proscribed by the uipa,if it is independently actionable under the common law of insurance bad faith.state farm,supra,th at.in stop youth addiction and cel tech,we explained that to bar a ucl action,another statute must absolutely preclude private causes of action or clearly permit the defendant conduct.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at cel tech,supra,cal th at.moradi shalal itself established that while violations of section are themselves not actionable,there is no bar to common law fraud and bad faith actions.moradi shalal,supra,cal d at.thus,our cases do not support the textron court view that ucl actions may not be brought for the type of activities covered by the uipa.textron,supra,th at.
as noted in state farm,bad faith insurance practices may qualify as any of the three statutory forms of unfair competition.state farm,supra,th at.they are unlawful the insurer obligation to act fairly and in good faith to meet its contractual responsibilities is imposed by the common law,as well as by statute.gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,benavides state farm general ins.th.they are unfair to the insured unfairness lies at the heart of a bad faith cause of action gruenberg,at state farm,supra,th at.they may also qualify as fraudulent business practices.under the ucl,it is necessary only to show that the plaintiff was likely to be deceived,and suffered economic injury as a result of the deception.kwikset superior court,supra,cal th at in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at.
textron criticisms of state farm do not withstand examination.the textron court reasoned that state farm had been undermined by cel tech disapproval of the unfairness standard applied in state farm.textron,supra,th at.however,our disapproval of that standard was expressly limited to actions between business competitors alleging anticompetitive practices.we declared nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as fraudulent or unlawful business practices or unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.cel tech,supra,cal th at,fn.therefore,for purposes of consumer actions,cel tech did not disapprove the unfairness test set out in state farm.furthermore,any implied disapproval on that point would have had no effect on the state farm court ruling that common law bad faith claims provide a viable basis for a ucl action.
the textron court relied on safeco,supra,d at page,for the proposition that the ucl provides no toehold for scaling the barrier of moradi shalal.textron,supra,th at and see id.safeco,however,was a third party action in which the plaintiff had no common law claim against the insurer.moreover,in stop youth addiction we noted that the safeco line of cases stand s at most for the proposition the ucl can not be used to state a cause of action the gist of which is absolutely barred under some other principle of law.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at.because moradi shalal barred only claims brought under section,and expressly allowed first party bad faith actions,it preserved the gist of first party ucl claims based on allegations of bad faith.moradi shalal imposed a formidable barrier,but not an insurmountable one.
textron distinguished manufacturers life and quelimane on the ground that those ucl claims rested on cartwright act violations.textron,supra,th at.however,nothing in manufacturers life or quelimane suggests the cartwright act is the only avenue for asserting a ucl claim against an insurer.in manufacturers life we explained that moradi shalal was not meant to impose sweeping limitations on private unfair competition actions.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at.manufacturers life stands for the proposition that a cause of action neither barred by moradi shalal nor absolutely precluded by other law may serve as the basis for a ucl claim.manufacturers life,supra,cal th at see also cel tech,supra,cal th at.textron holding that moradi shalal precludes ucl causes of action based on allegations of bad faith claims handling practices is contrary to the reasoning of manufacturers life,stop youth addiction,and cel tech.
as the state farm court observed,moradi shalal was concerned with the adverse effects of recognizing an implied right of action for damages under section,whereas ucl remedies are limited in scope,generally extending only to injunctive relief and restitution state farm,supra,th at.a ucl claim does not duplicate the contract and tort causes of action involved in bad faith litigation,where damages are central.see korea supply lockheed martin,supra,cal th at.
indeed,since state farm was decided the scope of the ucl has been further restricted by the passage of proposition in.private plaintiffs must demonstrate economic injury caused by the alleged unfair competition,and may not represent the interests of others without meeting the requirements for a class action.kwikset superior court,supra,cal th at arias superior court,supra,cal th at.thus,there is additional support for state farm conclusion that allowing ucl claims in common law bad faith cases is unlikely to resurrect the problems caused by royal globe.state farm,supra,th at.we note as well that those problems stemmed from the recognition of third party claims under section,not from claims by insureds against their insurers.
for all the above reasons,we disapprove textron financial national union fire ins,supra,th,to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.our ruling does not affect the opinions in third party cases such as industrial indemnity,supra,d,and safeco,supra,d.in moradi shalal,we identified numerous adverse consequences of third party bad faith claims,including proliferating litigation,unwarranted settlement demands,escalating insurance costs,conflicts of interest,practical difficulties with the scope and nature of the third party cause of action,and potential constitutional issues.moradi shalal,supra,cal d at.whether similar concerns weigh against recognizing a right of third parties to pursue ucl claims is a matter beyond the scope of this case.
our resolution of the conflict between state farm and textron disposes of the bulk of california capital arguments.with regard to zhang particular claim,california capital asserts that no statutory or decisional law other than the uipa imposes liability on insurers for the conduct alleged in zhang ucl cause of action,which california capital characterizes as a general practice of underpaying fire claims.reasonably interpreted in the context of the complaint as a whole,however quelimane,supra,cal th at,the ucl cause of action seeks to recover for california capital allegedly false advertising as it affected zhang.california capital acknowledges that in quelimane,at pages,we upheld a ucl cause of action based on a claim of false advertising.it attempts to distinguish quelimane on the basis that the false claim there involved a promise to issue insurance,not the underpayment of a claim.this distinction is insignificant,given our conclusion that ucl claims may be based on claims handling practices,as long as they do not rest exclusively on uipa violations.
california capital contends the litigation of zhang ucl cause of action will be unmanageable,requiring the examination of its claims handling practices in thousands of cases.however,a ucl claim may be based on a single instance of unfair business practice.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at united farm workers of america dutra farms th.were zhang to attempt to recover on behalf of other insureds,she would be required to certify a class action.arias superior court,supra,cal th at.furthermore,we are not concerned at the pleading stage with how zhang might go about proving her claim.as we have noted in other ucl cases,the possible difficulty of proving the plaintiff allegations is not a relevant consideration on review of a demurrer ruling.quelimane,supra,cal th at committee on children television,general foods cal d.
finally,on demurrer review we may consider the sufficiency of the plaintiff allegations to state a cause of action under any legal theory.quelimane,supra,cal th at.in light of our approval of the state farm analysis,we observe that a ucl cause of action is supported by zhang bad faith claims,as well as her false advertising claim.she alleges a litany of bad faith practices by california capital,including unreasonable delays causing deterioration of her property withholding of policy benefits refusal to consider cost estimates misinforming her as to the right to an appraisal and falsely telling her mortgage holder that she did not intend to repair the property,resulting in foreclosure proceedings.these allegations are sufficient to support a claim of unlawful business practices.see gruenberg aetna ins,supra,cal d,benavides state farm general ins,supra,th.
when the legislature enacted the uipa,it contemplated only administrative enforcement by the insurance commissioner.moradi shalal,supra,cal d at.private uipa actions are absolutely barred a litigant may not rely on the proscriptions of section as the basis for a ucl claim.cel tech,supra,cal th at manufacturers life,supra,cal th at moradi shalal,at.however,when insurers engage in conduct that violates both the uipa and obligations imposed by other statutes or the common law,a ucl action may lie.the legislature did not intend the uipa to operate as a shield against any civil liability.moradi shalal,at.
iii.disposition 
we affirm the court of appeal judgment.
yanting zhang has pleaded conduct by california capital insurance company that contravenes common law prohibitions against bad faith insurance practices and false advertising.under settled precedent,such common law breaches may provide the predicate for claims under the unfair competition law ucl.bus,et committee on children television,general foods cal d,state farm fire casualty superior court th.that such conduct may also be statutorily proscribed by the unfair insurance practices act act,et does not foreclose zhang ucl claim the legislature,in enacting protections for insureds,did not thereby intend to make it more difficult for those same insureds to obtain relief.i thus concur fully in the majority opinion conclusion that the court of appeal was right to allow this case to proceed and the trial court wrong to sustain a demurrer.
i write separately,however,because the majority goes further and asserts no ucl claim can ever be based on violations of the act,ante,at,fn.given zhang conscious decision not to predicate a ucl claim directly on such transgressions,this assertion is unnecessary dictum.moreover,it is wrong it misreads our own precedent and imposes on the ucl limits never contemplated by the legislature.
our understanding of this point must begin with royal globe ins.superior court cal d royal globe.in royal globe,a plaintiff sued both a supermarket and the supermarket insurer.her claim against the insurer alleged it had breached its statutory duty under a provision of the act by failing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt,fair,and equitable settlement of a claim where liability ha d become reasonably clear,subd.h.interpreting the text of the act,a to majority rejected the insurer argument that only the insurance commissioner could enforce its provisions and concluded instead that the a ct affords a private party,including a third party claimant,a right to sue an insurer for violating subdivision h.royal globe,at.
nine years later,moradi shalal fireman fund ins.cal d moradi shalal overruled royal globe.the moradi shalal majority embraced as irrefutable the position of the royal globe dissent neither section nor section was intended to create a private civil cause of action against an insurer that commits one of the various acts listed in section,subdivision h.moradi shalal,at.but moradi shalal did no more than that.to forestall any implication of an invitation to the insurance industry to commit the unfair practices proscribed by the insurance code ibid,the majority stressed the continuing availability of both insurance commissioner sanctions for violations of the act and suits for fraud,bad faith,and the like as checks on insurers id.at whether private suits indirectly predicated on the requirements of the act might also be available to deter misconduct was not addressed moradi shalal confined itself to succinctly repudiating royal globe discernment of a private right of action in the four corners of the act itself.moradi shalal,at.
in the wake of moradi shalal,numerous plaintiffs sought to recoup the same compensatory and punitive damages previously afforded under a royal globe claim by suing under the ucl.the courts of appeal uniformly rejected these suits,typically without detailing their reasoning.see,maler superior court d,safeco ins.superior court d,industrial indemnity superior court d.in retrospect,it is apparent these decisions were entirely correct,albeit not because moradi shalal necessarily foreclosed suits under the ucl.rather,in we made clear what previously had been uncertain,that damages are unavailable under the ucl.bank of the west superior court cal th.thus,the ucl could not,and can not,serve as a substitute for a royal globe private action seeking damages for violations of the act.
