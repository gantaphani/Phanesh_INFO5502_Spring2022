at issue in this trademark infringement case is whether smithkline beecham corporation,smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,and glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare collectively gsk infringed the trademark rights of natural answers,and its chief executive officer brian feinstein collectively natural answers in their unregistered mark herbaquit lozenges,and whether gsk falsely advertised their product,commit lozenges,which was billed as the first and only stop smoking lozenge.after thorough review,we affirm the district court entry of final summary judgment for gsk.
the facts essential to this appeal are straightforward.natural answers develops,manufactures,and markets a variety of herbal supplements,and from until it sold herbaquit lozenges,which were designed to help satisfy cravings related to the smoking habit,particularly the psychological and habitual aspects of smoking.although natural answers filed a federal trademark application for herbaquit with the united states patent and trademark office on april,and also filed an application for herbaquit lozenges on may,neither application was approved,and the mark herbaquit lozenges has never been registered as a trademark.nonetheless,herbaquit lozenges entered the market in january and were sold by natural answers in drugstores,supermarkets,convenience stores,and over the internet.herbaquit lozenges were an herbal product containing no nicotine,but were designed and marketed to help reduce and control tobacco cravings or to help quit smoking entirely.in march,natural answers contacted gsk to solicit interest in forming a joint venture to promote herbaquit lozenges.although gsk expressed some initial interest in learning about natural answers product,gsk ultimately declined that offer in april.notably,the sale of herbaquit lozenges was discontinued in march,after selling approximately packages.indeed,by november,the website affiliated with herbaquit lozenges was no longer operational,and neither the product nor its promotional materials have returned to the public market since that time.
natural answers has conceded that it does not have the ability or resources to market herbaquit lozenges.however,brian feinstein,the ceo of natural answers,testified that he sent a letter to philip morris in december to solicit a joint venture to promote herbaquit lozenges.he said that philip morris responded to his solicitation by requesting further information.a deal was never struck between natural answers and philip morris,and natural answers presented no other evidence,documentary or otherwise,about their negotiations.
on november,more than seven months after the sale of herbaquit lozenges was discontinued,gsk launched the commit lozenges product,advertising it as the first and only stop smoking lozenge.commit lozenges are an aid in the form of a nicotine lozenge to relieve the withdrawal symptoms that may accompany smoking cessation.gsk began developing commit lozenges in january,applied for fda approval on the product in late,and received fda approval following clinical tests in october.gsk has advertised commit lozenges in the national print media,on television,and over the internet.they are sold primarily in pharmacies,supermarkets,and via the internet.commit is a registered federal trademark held by gsk since may.
on october,natural answers filed this complaint against gsk in the united states district court for the southern district of florida claiming federal trademark infringement under a federal trademark infringement based on reverse confusion under a federal unfair competition under a false advertising under a civil theft of trade secrets under.stat,and common law trademark disparagement attempted and actual monopolization under the sherman act,common law unfair competition common law trademark infringement and violation of florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act fdutpa.stat.natural answers simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.gsk,in turn,moved to dismiss the complaint on november,and,on february,the district court dismissed the claims for civil theft of trade secrets and attempted and actual monopolization pursuant to.b.
on december,and january,evidentiary hearings relating to the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction were conducted by a magistrate judge,who recommended denying the preliminary injunction.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety.
thereafter,natural answers moved for partial summary judgment on its false advertising claim.not surprisingly,gsk moved for summary judgment on all of natural answers remaining claims.soon thereafter,the district court granted gsk motion for summary judgment in its entirety and denied natural answers motion for partial summary judgment.first,the district court granted summary judgment against natural answers false advertising claim,reasoning that natural answers had not been and was not likely to be injured as a result of gsk advertisement of commit lozenges as the first and only stop smoking lozenge,because herbaquit lozenges and commit lozenges were never marketed or sold contemporaneously.the district court also granted summary judgment against natural answers on the false advertising and trademark disparagement claims concluding that gsk advertisements were not false,because,under applicable federal statutes and regulations,natural answers was prohibited from marketing herbaquit lozenges as a smoking cessation product.second,the district court granted summary judgment against natural answers federal and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition claims on the ground that no reasonable juror could conclude on this record that a likelihood of confusion exists between the marks herbaquit lozenges and commit as used by the parties.finally,the district court granted gsk summary judgment on natural answers fdutpa claim,because it was premised solely on meritless claims of trademark infringement and false advertising.
this timely appeal ensued.
the claims brought by natural answers are comprised of either violations of the lanham act or violations of florida common law and statutes that are,in turn,based on actual violations of the lanham act.as a result,if natural answers can not succeed on its lanham act claims,all of its claims necessarily fail.our analysis,therefore,begins,and ultimately ends,with a determination that natural answers asserted lanham act claims,seeking relief from unfair competition based upon theories of trademark taking the form of direct trademark infringement,reverse confusion trademark infringement,and false designation of origin,and false advertising fail.
