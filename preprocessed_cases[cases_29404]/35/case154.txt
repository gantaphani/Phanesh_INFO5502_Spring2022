this appeal involves a consumer class action alleged against defendant at t wireless services,at t based upon at t marketing and sale of premium cell phones that operated on a wireless network that at t allegedly modified in a manner that rendered those premium cell phones essentially useless.what started as a original complaint alleging causes of action under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,the false advertising law fal bus,et,the consumers legal remedies act clra,et,and for fraud and declaratory relief,morphed into third amended complaint alleging the same causes of action,after the trial court sustained at t successive demurrers on the ground that the complaint lacked the requisite specificity.finding the plaintiffs theory of recovery obscured by extraneous allegations in the third amended complaint,and concluding that plaintiffs still failed to identify with particularity any actionable misrepresentations made by at t,the trial court sustained at t demurrer to the third amended complaint without leave to amend.
plaintiffs joshua morgan and george shannon appeal,arguing that the complaint alleges cognizable claims and that they pleaded their claims with as much specificity as is required under the circumstances of this case.while we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs claims are somewhat obscured by extraneous allegations,we hold that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state causes of action against at t under the ucl and the clra,and for fraud.we also hold,however,that plaintiffs have failed to allege facts to establish they have standing to bring their fal cause of action under the theory they allege,and that they failed to raise any issue on appeal as to their claim for declaratory relief.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of the fal and declaratory relief causes of action and reverse the judgment of dismissal as to the remaining causes of action.
background 
original and first amended complaints 
the original complaint in this class action lawsuit was filed by lindsey bayman who is not a party to this appeal in july.although somewhat short of specifics,bayman complaint provided the general framework for her claims.she alleged that,at some unspecified time,at t advertised and sold the sony ericsson the,a premium cell phone that sold for to dollars,and justified its high price by the fact that the could make and receive calls around the world and had other advanced technologies.she alleged that,at the time at t advertised and sold the,it had no intention to continue to support and service the,and had decided to modify its system in a manner that would substantially degrade service to users of the,which rendered the phones worthless.finally,she alleged that,in an attempt to surreptitiously phase out these worthless premium phones without paying any compensation to the purchasers,or providing them with a new phone of equal capabilities and compatible with the changes made to their system,at t sent users a free replacement cell phone,which at t said was an upgrade in fact,it was a phone that could not operate around the world and did not have many of the advanced technologies that the had.
based upon these factual allegations,bayman asserted causes of action for violations of the ucl,fal,and clra,and for fraud and declaratory relief,and sought injunctive and declaratory relief,restitution,damages,and punitive damages for herself and the putative class.the complaint made clear,however,that no damages were sought under the clra.instead,the clra cause of action included the following language in bold notice pursuant to civil code plaintiff hereby demands that within days from service of this complaint,defendants correct,repair,replace or otherwise rectify the deceptive practices complained of herein for the entire class pursuant to california civil code section.failure to do so will result in plaintiff amending this complaint to seek damages for such deceptive practices pursuant to california civil code section.
at t removed the action to federal court on diversity grounds,and on the ground that bayman claims were governed by the federal communications act et.in its notice of removal,at t succinctly summarized bayman claims bayman claims that at t upgraded its wireless communications services network the wcsn without compensating customers who had purchased certain telephones that were allegedly incompatible with the wcsn.the federal district court granted bayman motion to remand the case back to state court.
following remand,a first amended complaint was filed that was virtually identical to the original complaint,except that it added as additional named plaintiffs morgan and shannon the appellants here.the trial court subsequently granted bayman request to be dismissed as a named plaintiff.at t then moved to compel arbitration.the motion was denied,and at t appealed from the denial.six months later,at t voluntarily dismissed its appeal and filed a demurrer to the first amended year after the original complaint was filed.
at t demurrer challenged all of the claims on the ground that they were not pled with specificity at t also argued that the clra provided the exclusive remedy for the conduct alleged,and therefore all of the other claims must be dismissed.at the hearing on the demurrer,the trial court announced its tentative decision to sustain the demurrer with leave to amend,on the ground that the complaint lacked specificity.the court explained that the complaint needed to allege what misrepresentations were made,when they were made,and who made them what features the replacement cell phone lacked and what features on the original premium phones no longer worked to the extent plaintiffs were relying upon suppression of facts,what facts established that at t had a duty to disclose and to the extent at t made an implied promise to support the for a reasonable time,how that implied promise was breached.
second amended complaint 
in september,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that elaborated on the facts alleged in the earlier complaints.the complaint alleged the following facts applicable to all causes of action 
at t advertised the as its premium phone and sold it in a box bearing the at t logo.the box described some of the features of the,including that it operated on frequencies used in north america and internationally and that it had bluetooth technology.the box also stated that the phone could only operate with wireless services provided by at t.in addition,at t stated on the box that t oday and tomorrow,our commitment is to deliver new technologies plus innovative products and services for all your wireless communications needs.
consumers who bought the were required to purchase a wireless services plan from at t for a minimum of one year,but at t encouraged consumers to commit to more than one year by reducing the price for a purchased with a service plan.morgan committed to a service plan in order to reduce the price of the,and shannon committed to a service plan.
a short time after plaintiffs bought their phones,at t sent them a free cell phone,which at t stated was an upgrade from the.the booklet that accompanied the gave instructions for transferring data from the to the,and instructed the recipients to send their phones to sony ericsson,the manufacturer of both the and the.
the lacked certain identified features that the had,including bluetooth capability and the capability to send and receive calls internationally,and had a retail value of approximately.
at the time at t advertised and sold the,which operated on at t mhz network system,at t did not intend to support that network system and instead intended to develop,expand,and support its mhz network system.as a result of at t withdrawal of support,the mhz network system became more and more degraded,and owners experienced increased dropped calls,decreased service areas,and increased areas of no service,rendering the essentially unusable.
consumers who accepted the upgrade to the and returned their were harmed because they were left with an inferior phone that did not have the features that justified the high price of the,and consumers who kept their were harmed because they were left with a phone that was rendered obsolete due to the degraded mhz network system.
in setting out their cause of action under the ucl,plaintiffs incorporated by reference the preceding allegations,and specifically alleged that at t statements that it was committed to providing for all of its customers wireless needs today and tomorrow and the fact that it held itself out as the world leading provider of wireless communications services,combined with its sale of expensive phones that required service contracts for one,two,or more years,would lead the average consumer to believe that at t was committed to providing for at least two years or for the life of the support and development of the mhz network system so that the could be operated in north america.plaintiffs also alleged that at t deceived customers by sending them an inferior phone while calling it an upgrade in order to surreptitiously recall the by inducing owners to mail back their expensive phones.
the causes of action under the fal and the clra and for declaratory relief did not add any additional factual allegations,although plaintiffs alleged in the clra cause of action that they gave notice of the alleged violation in the original and first amended complaints in accordance with civil code section,and therefore they now sought damages under civil code section 
the fraud cause of action alleged both a failure to disclose and an affirmative misrepresentation.in asserting failure to disclose,plaintiffs alleged that at t represented that consumers could purchase a world phone with advanced features for exclusive use on at t mhz network if they agreed to commit to pay for at t wireless services for at least one or two years at t concealed that it did not intend to service,maintain,develop,and expand the mhz network at t had a duty to disclose this fact because the undisclosed fact was material to the transaction and because would mislead the consumer to believe that,by purchasing the and committing to pay for wireless services for a period of years,the consumer would be able to use the for a period of years at t concealed the fact in order to defraud plaintiffs and the class and had plaintiffs and the class known that the mhz network would be degraded,they would not have purchased the from at t.in asserting affirmative misrepresentation,plaintiffs alleged that at t falsely represented that it was committed to providing services for all of the wireless communications needs of purchasers,and that p laintiffs members of the class relied upon those representations in purchasing the and at t falsely represented that the was an upgrade of the in order to induce owners to mail back their phones,and that p laintiffs members of the c lass relied upon that representation in sending back their phones.
although the second amended complaint provided many of the details that the trial court noted were missing from the first amended complaint,it did not allege when the alleged representations about the or at t commitment to provide service were made,when plaintiffs bought their phones and at t service plans,when the replacement phones were sent,or when the phones became unusable.
at t once again demurred to the complaint on the ground that it failed to plead any of the claims with specificity.in addition,at t argued that the ucl and fal claims were deficient because plaintiffs could not meet the standing requirements under proposition which amended the ucl and fal standing requirements in november,after the original complaint was filed in this action,and that all but the clra claim failed to state a claim because the clra provides the exclusive remedy for the conduct alleged.concurrently with its demurrer,at t filed a motion to strike the claim for damages in the clra cause of action,on the ground that plaintiffs failed to comply with the notice requirement of civil code section.
in january,the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to plead critical dates,such as when they purchased their phones,when they could no longer use the phones,and when they received the replacement phones plaintiffs failed to show they had standing under proposition the fraud claim required more particularity and plaintiffs needed to comply with the clra notice requirement.
third amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint at issue in this may.although this complaint alleged the same causes of action and the same theories of liability as the previous complaints,it included considerably more detail.
general facts 
in amending the complaint,plaintiffs added allegations of both general background facts and specific representations allegedly made by at t and its representatives.some of those more detailed allegations include 
information about wireless networks and the development of at t networks 
excerpts from press releases at t issued from january through may,as well as advertisements that appeared on the at t website in august through december,in which at t touted its new and expanding network and the capabilities of the phones it sold to operate on that network,including the 
an excerpt from a document at t filed with the securities and exchange commission in which at t explained that its gsm network had been transmitting at mhz on towers that were spaced for tdma systems at mhz,which caused a decreased level of network quality.to improve quality,at t reported that it was upgrading its cell sites with new mhz gsm equipment,and had completed percent of its planned mhz upgrade by the end of.plaintiffs asserted that the became essentially unusable because it could not operate on an mhz network.
excerpts from a post card at t sent owners announcing that at t was sending them free phones,which at t represented was an upgrade,and excerpts from the booklet that accompanied the phones,which at t started sending to owners in february.
allegations regarding plaintiffs 
in addition to these facts,the complaint also included more detailed information about the named plaintiffs experiences with the and at 
for example,the complaint alleged that,before september,morgan conducted internet research on websites that regularly published at t press releases and internet advertisements,and had discussions with other consumers who received information about the from at through his research and discussions,he learned of the capabilities of the including that it had bluetooth capability and would operate around the world,and of at t network.based on his research and discussions,he decided to purchase a from at t.he understood from at t representations that the would be supported by at t network and that at t would continue to maintain and improve the network.
morgan went to an at t store in september,where he was subjected to further representations regarding the capabilities of the and at t network.he decided to buy a from at t as a result of at t representations that the phone would be supported by the at t network and that the network would be maintained and improved.he also agreed to a service plan that allowed him to use the on at t network for a minimum of two years,with an automatic renewal thereafter,which would allow him access to the network for the life of the phone.
as a result of at t representations,morgan understood that at t network would support the for the life of the phone.by january,however,reception to the was rapidly degrading,and he regularly was unable to make or receive calls due to poor reception by february the was essentially useless.after morgan received his free from at t,he went back to the at t store and offered to give back both the and the which did not have the features the had if at t would give him a phone comparable to the that was compatible with at t network.at t refused.
with regard to shannon,the complaint alleged that he wanted to buy a cell phone that could be used internationally because he frequently travelled overseas as an officer in the united states navy reserves.he researched the gsm network and phones that worked on the gsm network,and,as a result of that research and his exposure to statements made by at t in its advertisements and press releases,he decided to buy the from at 
on february,he went into an at t store to buy two phones,one for himself and one for his wife.although he knew that the gsm network was new and that coverage was spotty at that time,he was told that the network was expanding and would improve.in addition to buying two phones,he also agreed to a service plan with an automatic renewal for each of the phones,which would allow him access to the network for the life of the phones.within a week after buying the phones,however,he returned to the at t store to complain about the poor reception.although he considered returning the phones at that time,which was within the return period,he decided to keep them after the at t representative told him that at t was still expanding the network,and that coverage and service would improve in the future.
he received a free replacement phone from at t in march,but because it did not have the features or capabilities of the,he signed a petition asking at t for an appropriate replacement phone.at t did not respond to the petition.since then,he has tried intermittently to use the,but it does not have any signal at his place of work and only a weak signal in other places.
extraneous allegations 
in addition to the above allegations,the amended complaint also added more than pages of allegations related to at t purported suppression spoliation of evidence,and asserted that certain adverse inferences may be made against at t under evidence code section.these allegations add nothing to the causes of action alleged.
causes of action 
in stating their ucl cause of action,plaintiffs alleged that at t inundated the internet and other media with representations about the features of the and at t network some of which are quoted in the complaint in order to induce plaintiffs and members of the class to purchase phones from at t that operated exclusively on the at t network.plaintiffs alleged that the effect of at t press releases and advertising was to cause the average consumer to understand that a phone purchased from at t would be supported by the at t network for the life of the phone.
the complaint alleged that at t conduct violated the ucl because it was unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent.plaintiffs alleged it was unlawful because it violated the clra.they alleged it was unfair for two reasons.first,it was unfair because at t representations and sale of the caused consumers,including plaintiffs,to form legitimate expectations that at t would maintain the network in a manner that would continue to support or improve the operation of the throughout the life of the phone,but instead at t chose to expand the network in a manner that rendered the essentially inoperable on the network.it also was unfair because,although at t recognized its obligation to provide owners with replacement phones so they could continue to utilize their service plans with at t,at t tried to pass off the as an upgrade when it was not,and refused to provide owners with replacement phones that had features similar to the.finally,plaintiffs alleged that at t conduct was fraudulent within the meaning of the ucl because members of the public were likely to be deceived plaintiffs and members of the class had an expectation that at t would provide reliable service on the network for the life of the phone if they bought a from at t plaintiffs and members of the class had an expectation that the reception would improve,not degrade,as at t expanded and enhanced its network at t made specific representations about the features of the but failed to inform purchasers that the phone would become obsolete and unusable in the united states and at t sent purchasers a replacement phone and misrepresented it as an upgrade to induce some purchasers to return their phones.
in addition,the complaint alleged that at t conduct constituted unfair advertising within the meaning of the ucl in that at t engaged in widespread promotional activity directed at the public at large that was likely to deceive,and did deceive,members of the public at large 
finally,the complaint alleged that plaintiffs suffered injury in fact and had lost money or property as a result of at t conduct because they each paid money to purchase the from at t,and they each lost possession or use of their because at t conduct rendered their phones useless and obsolete.
the fal cause of action alleged that at t february offer to owners of a free upgrade phone was untrue or misleading,and at t knew or should have known it was untrue or misleading,because the did not have international capabilities or other advanced features.plaintiffs alleged that members of the class were induced to return their phones as a result of at t offer,and that at t should be enjoined from attempting to induce consumers to exchange their phones for phones of lesser cost or quality.
the clra cause of action alleged that at t conduct violated several provisions of civil code section,subdivision a,and that plaintiffs gave notice of these alleged violations to at t on january,more than days before filing the third amended complaint in accordance with civil code section plaintiffs sought damages and punitive damages on behalf of the class,as well as injunctive relief.
in the fraud cause of action,plaintiffs alleged that at t inundated the internet and other media with specific statements about its network and the features and characteristics of the phone.plaintiffs quoted several of those specific such statements as at t wireless will provide its customers with the benefits of seamless gsm coverage at t would continue to extend and enhance the network over the coming year the phone feature s a color screen and bluetooth wireless technology and the phone will allow customers to use their wireless phone domestically or when traveling abroad and listed some of the people who made the statements.
plaintiffs alleged that,based on at t statements and advertisements,a reasonable customer who purchased a phone from at t for use on its network would understand that he would have a phone with the features and capabilities that would be supported by at t network for the life of the phone.they alleged that at t failed to disclose that it was going to develop and expand its network in a manner that degraded service to the,rendering the so unusable that it would have to be replaced.they asserted that at t had a duty to disclose this information because,without the information,at t advertisements and statements were likely to mislead and did mislead the public,and that at t intentionally concealed or suppressed the information with the intent to defraud.finally,plaintiffs alleged that had they and the class not been deceived by at t assertions and suppression of facts,they would not have purchased the from at 
in addition to these allegations of failure to disclose,plaintiffs alleged that at t statements constituted promises,which at t did not intend to perform and that at t assertion that the was an upgrade was untrue,that at t had no reasonable basis to believe it was true,that at t made the assertion with the intent to induce plaintiffs and class members to alter their position to their detriment by returning their phones,and that some class members relied upon the assertion in returning their phones.
declaratory relief 
in their declaratory relief claim,plaintiffs merely alleged that an actual controversy existed between plaintiffs and the putative class on the one hand,and at t on the other hand,concerning their respective rights and duties.plaintiffs asked for a court determination of the rights of plaintiffs and the class and the corresponding rights of at 
demurrer and motion to strike 
at t filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint,along with a motion to strike portions of the complaint,including the clra damages claim.in its demurrer,at t challenged plaintiffs fraud claim on the grounds that at t statement that the was an upgrade was not actionable because it was puffery or a statement of opinion the statements about the network were not actionable because they were not false when they were made and they were representations of future events and the representations about the network were not alleged with specificity,nor did plaintiffs allege how they justifiably relied on them.at t challenged the ucl and fal claims on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to establish proposition standing plaintiffs failed to allege any unfair,unlawful,or fraudulent conduct and the clra provides the exclusive remedy for the conduct alleged.finally,at t challenged the declaratory relief claim on the ground that it was derivative of plaintiffs other claims.we note that,although at t included a general demurrer and a special demurrer on the ground of uncertainty to the clra claim,it did not address the merits of the clra claim in the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the demurrer.instead,in a separate motion at t moved to strike the clra claim for damages on the ground that plaintiffs did not comply with the civil code section notice provisions before filing their lawsuit 
trial court ruling 
on october,the trial court issued a written ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike.the court pointed out that the operative complaint included so much extraneous matter that it was difficult to determine what plaintiffs theory was,and which allegations supported that theory.nevertheless,it observed that plaintiffs appeared to allege that at t guaranteed their network would support the for the life of the phone or that at t promised that its phones would not become obsolete.it found,however,that plaintiffs did not cite any authority for such a theory and did not indicate which representations by at t constituted the alleged promise.moreover,the court found that,to the extent plaintiffs alleged that at t made an express or implied promise that the would be supported for the life of the phone,no reasonable consumer would hold this puffery to constitute a statement against obsolescence.a consumer who buys a phone under a warranty and a one or contract can reasonably expect only that his phone will last for the duration of the warranty and his service for the duration of the contract.
the court concluded in sum,no clra damages claim is stated because no clra notice was given.plaintiffs argument that notice provided to at t as required by the clra may be provided years into the case,with the filing of an amended complaint,is rejected.no fraud claim is stated because plaintiffs do not allege what specific misrepresentation was made to them that they relied on and were injured by.at most,a ucl or fal claim might be found amongst the foliage,but plaintiffs have not identified where.finding that plaintiffs had failed to identify with particularity any actionable misrepresentation by at t in four rounds of pleadings,and had given no indication how they could amend to successfully state a claim,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and found that the motion to strike was moot.
plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal from the subsequent judgment dismissing all claims against at 
discussion 
standard of review 
a general demurrer is a trial of a pure issue of law and presents the same question to the appellate court as to the trial court,namely,whether the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to justify any relief,notwithstanding superfluous allegations or claims for unjustified relief.citations.t he allegations of the complaint must be liberally construed with a view to attaining substantial justice among the parties.code civ.citation.pleading defects which do not affect substantial rights of the parties should be disregarded.code civ,citation.alfaro community housing improvement system planning,th,d.when reviewing a dismissal following a demurrer,w e not only treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but also give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citations.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.
b.the ucl cause of action 
we note at the outset that,in the november general election,the voters approved proposition,which amended the standing provisions of the ucl.while the ucl previously authorized any person acting for the general public to sue for relief from unfair competition,after proposition a private plaintiff has standing to bring a claim under the ucl only if he or she has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,quoting bus,as amended by,but despite the changes to the standing requirements,the proposition amendments to the ucl left entirely unchanged the substantive rules governing business and competitive conduct.nothing a business might lawfully do before proposition is unlawful now,and nothing earlier forbidden is now permitted.in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d,tobacco ii.thus,caselaw that describes the kinds of conduct outlawed under the ucl is applicable to cases such as the present case.the only difference is that,after proposition,plaintiffs but not absent class members in a class action must establish that they meet the proposition standing requirements.tobacco ii,supra,cal th at,d.
the ucl outlaws as unfair competition any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.bus.the scope of the ucl is quite broad.citations.because the statute is framed in the disjunctive,a business practice need only meet one of the three criteria to be considered unfair competition.citation.mckell washington mutual,th,d mckell.in addition to pleading facts sufficient to show that the defendant acts constituted an unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business practice,a plaintiff alleging a ucl cause of action must also plead facts sufficient to establish he or she has standing to bring an action under the ucl as amended by proposition.
in the instant case,at t demurred to plaintiffs ucl claim on the grounds that the complaint did not allege conduct that was unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent,nor did it allege facts to establish plaintiffs standing under proposition in sustaining the demurrer to the ucl claim,the trial court did not specifically address these grounds.instead,the court found that the claim was not identifiable in light of all the extraneous allegations.respectfully,we disagree.while those extraneous allegations certainly make it significantly more difficult to identify the basis for plaintiffs ucl claim,we hold there are sufficient facts alleged to show both a violation of the ucl and that plaintiffs have standing to bring their ucl claim.
the allegations are sufficient to show a violation of the ucl 
plaintiffs argue that they have stated a valid ucl claim under all three prongs of the ucl,that the conduct alleged was unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent within the meaning of the ucl.the definitions of unlawful and fraudulent business practices are straightforward and well established.an unlawful business practice under the ucl is anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.a fraudulent business practice is one in which members of the public are likely to be deceived.tobacco ii,supra,cal th at,d.
the definition of an unfair business practice in the context of a consumer action is less settled.before,some courts of appeal held that an unfair business practice occurs when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers people casa blanca convalescent homes,d.accord,wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d,while others held that the determination whether a practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer motors,times mirror d.accord,state farm fire casualty superior court th,d.in,the supreme court defined unfair in the context of a ucl action by one competitor against a direct competitor,stating that any finding of unfairness to competitors under the ucl must be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition,supra,cal th at,d.but the supreme court also made clear that its discussion about unfair practices was limited to actions by competitors alleging anticompetitive practices,and did not relate to actions by consumers.id.at,fn,d.nevertheless,some courts of appeal have applied the definition of unfair to consumer actions see,gregory albertson,th,d schnall hertz th,d,while others including this court have applied the old definitions see,pastoria nationwide ins.th,d smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d.recently,in camacho automobile club of southern california th,d,a consumer action,division eight of this appellate district rejected both definitions and instead applied a definition based upon section of the federal trade commission act n.under the definition in camacho,a practice is unfair if the consumer injury is substantial,the injury is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition,and the injury is one that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.camacho,supra,th at,d.
in this case,we need not,and do not,decide whether the conduct alleged meets any of the definitions of unfair or whether it meets the definition of unlawful because we find that plaintiffs have alleged a fraudulent business practice under the ucl.
a claim based upon the fraudulent business practice prong of the ucl is distinct from common law fraud.a common law fraudulent deception must be actually false,known to be false by the perpetrator and reasonably relied upon by a victim who incurs damages.none of these elements are required to state a claim for relief under the ucl.citations.this distinction reflects the ucl focus on the defendant conduct,rather than the plaintiff damages,in service of the statute larger purpose of protecting the general public against unscrupulous business practices.tobacco ii,supra,cal th at,d.
as noted above,a fraudulent business practice is one that is likely to deceive members of the public.tobacco ii,supra,cal th at,d.a ucl claim based on the fraudulent prong can be based on representations that deceive because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under the ucl.mckell,supra,th at,d.for example,in pastoria nationwide,supra,th,d,the plaintiffs alleged they purchased insurance policies based upon the defendant insurance company description of the premiums,lack of deductibles,and other policy benefits less than two months later the insurer notified them of significant changes to their policies,including material increases in premiums and substantial deductibles and the insurer knew of the impending changes to the policies at the time plaintiffs purchased them,but did not communicate that to the plaintiffs.id.at,d.we held that those allegations were sufficient to state a claim for relief under the fraudulent business practices prong of the ucl.id.at,d.
in the present case,plaintiffs alleged that at t marketed and sold expensive phones which could be operated only on the at t network in conjunction with service plans,and touted the improvements it was making to its network the improvements at t made to the network significantly degraded the portion of the network on which the phones operated and at t knew at the time it sold the phones that the improvements it was going make would soon render the phones essentially useless.
at t argues that these allegations are insufficient to state a claim because they fall far short of pleading any type of actionable deception on the part of at t or proper reliance on the part of its consumers.but at t argument fails to recognize the distinction between common law fraud,which requires allegations of actual falsity and reasonable reliance pleaded with specificity,and the fraudulent prong of the ucl,which does not tobacco ii,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d,relief under the ucl is available without individualized proof of deception,reliance and injury committee on children television,general foods cal d,fn.the requirement that fraud be pleaded with specificity does not apply to causes of action under the ucl children television.
moreover,at t assertion that the representations upon which plaintiffs ucl claim is based are not actionable because those representations were puffery,statements of opinion,or predictions of future events ignores the gravamen of plaintiffs claim.their claim is not based upon their reliance on specific representations they assert were false it is based upon the effect on consumers from at t sale of an expensive cell phone in conjunction with agreements for the service needed to operate the phone,and at t marketing campaign that touted its improving and expanding network.they allege this conduct by at t led reasonable consumers to believe that at t would continue to provide the service needed to operate the phone for a reasonable period of time,which they allege was the reasonable life of the phone.
the determination as to whether a business practice is deceptive is based on the likely effect such a practice would have on a reasonable consumer.mckell,supra,th at,d.u nless we can say as a matter of law that contrary to the complaint allegations,members of the public were not likely to be deceived or misled by at t alleged conduct,we must hold that plaintiffs stated a cause of action.day v.at t th,d.the trial court in this case found that consumers would not have been deceived by at t alleged conduct because a consumer who buys a phone under a warranty and a one or contract can reasonably expect only that his phone will last for the duration of the warranty and his service for the duration of the contract.we disagree that,in light of the conduct alleged in this case,this determination can be made as a matter of law.therefore,we hold that plaintiffs stated a cause of action under the ucl.
the allegations are sufficient to showing standing 
as noted above,proposition amended the ucl to provide a standing requirement for persons seeking relief under the ucl a person bringing an action under the ucl must establish that he or she has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.bus.in tobacco ii,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court held that this standing requirement applies only to the named plaintiffs in a class action id.at,d,and that it imposes an actual reliance requirement on named plaintiffs seeking relief under the fraudulent prong of the ucl id.at,d.the court went on to explain what a plaintiff must plead and prove while a plaintiff must allege that the defendant misrepresentations were an immediate cause of the conduct,the plaintiff is not required to allege that those misrepresentations were the sole or even the decisive cause of the conduct.furthermore,where,as here,a plaintiff alleges exposure to a advertising campaign,the plaintiff is not required to plead with an unrealistic degree of specificity that the plaintiff relied on particular advertisements or statements.id.at,d.
in the present case,plaintiffs alleged that,before buying their phones,they each conducted research in which they encountered at t advertisements and press releases explaining the advanced features of the and the improvements at t was making and was going to make to its network.they also alleged that they each were subjected to similar representations when they went to the at t store and purchased their phones and service plans,and that they relied upon their research including information from the at t advertisements and press releases,and the representations in deciding to purchase the from at finally,they alleged that their phones became essentially useless within a relatively short period of time,when at t made changes to the network that degraded service to the phones.
these allegations satisfy the ucl standing requirements.plaintiffs
