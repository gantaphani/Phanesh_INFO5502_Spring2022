torpharm,appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the district of new jersey,which granted summary judgment to ranbaxy pharmaceuticals,schein pharmaceutical,danbury pharmacal,ranbaxy laboratories limited,ranbaxy schein pharma llc and ranbaxy schein pharmaceuticals,llc collectively,ranbaxy,invalidating torpharm united states patent as obvious.torpharm,ranbaxy.because torpharm had relied on the novelty of its improved form ranitidine product in prosecuting the process claims,the district court ruled that the subsequent negation of improved form ranitidine novelty in unrelated litigation precluded torpharm from rebutting ranbaxy obviousness challenge to the process claims.we hold that,despite torpharm assertion of improved form ranitidine novelty during prosecution of the patent,the lack of novelty of the product does not by itself establish that the process for making it is obvious.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment of invalidity and remand the case for further proceedings.
this appeal concerns the validity of a patent on a process for making the drug ranitidine.ranitidine is an antihistamine drug that inhibits acid secretion in the stomach,and is used to treat ulcers.several patents covering different crystalline forms of ranitidine are owned by nonparty glaxo,and have been the subject of extensive litigation.glaxo group torpharm,glaxo,novopharm,glaxo novopharm.that litigation has concerned form ranitidine,a crystalline form of ranitidine that overcame the undesirable drying and filtration characteristics of the original crystalline form,form ranitidine.
the patent in suit,owned by torpharm,relates to a different crystalline form of ranitidine referred to as improved form ranitidine.the patent discloses a process for producing improved form ranitidine by crystallizing ranitidine from a solution in isopropyl alcohol.according to the patent specification,improved form ranitidine has characteristics of being harder and denser,and providing larger sized crystals,which gives it acceptable filtration and drying characteristics.patent,ll.improved form ranitidine is distinguished from form ranitidine by two properties reflecting these characteristics bulk density and tap density.according to the patent,improved form ranitidine is characterized by a bulk density of at least,and a tap density of at least id.at ll.
all claims of the patent are directed to a process for producing improved form ranitidine.representative claim illustrates the two principal requirements of the claimed process that it yields form ranitidine of the specified densities,and that it involves a three or alcohol solvent 
process for the production of a sic improved form of form ranitidine hydrochloride having improved filtration and drying characteristics and having 
i a bulk density of not less than about and,
ii a tap density of not less than about,
said process comprising adding ranitidine hydrochloride to a substantially anhydrous hydroxylic solvent comprising at least one alkanol having carbon atoms,which has the characteristics that it dissolves ranitidine hydrochloride and subsequently recovering the improved form of form ranitidine hydrochloride.
as originally filed,the application for the patent did not include the bulk and tap density limitations,but simply claimed a process yielding an improved form of form ranitidine hydrochloride.the bulk and tap density limitations defining the product were later added by amendment to overcome obviousness rejections over the original glaxo patents disclosing form ranitidine.
a divisional of the application also yielded united states patent.the patent included a product claim directed to improved form ranitidine with the specified bulk and tap density limitations,as well as claims essentially covering the products of the process.however,in litigation between torpharm and several other pharmaceutical manufacturers in north carolina,the product claim of the patent was invalidated for lack of novelty,by reason of a prior sale of form ranitidine meeting the bulk and tap density limitations.genpharm,torpharm,bo,bo,order granting summary judgment of invalidity.evidence adduced during the north carolina litigation revealed that in,more than three years before the priority application for the patent was filed,interchem corporation sold three lots kg in all of form ranitidine hydrochloride to geneva pharmaceuticals,slip op.at.neither interchem nor geneva is related to torpharm.quality tests performed by geneva showed that two of the three lots had bulk densities of more than and tap densities of more than.accordingly,the north carolina district court held that material meeting the limitations of the product claim had been on sale more than one year prior to filing of the patent application,thereby invalidating the product claim under b,slip op.at.however,there was and still is no evidence of what process interchem used to make its form ranitidine,and by stipulation the claims of the patent were not at issue in the north carolina litigation,slip op.at.
torpharm sued ranbaxy for infringement of the process patent in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.ranbaxy moved for summary judgment of invalidity,arguing that under the principles of prosecution history estoppel and collateral estoppel,the patent was invalid.ranbaxy contended that because the patent had been allowed based on a representation by torpharm that the allowance of the patent made the patent allowable,the subsequent invalidation of the patent rendered the patent invalid as well.
the district court initially denied ranbaxy motion.torpharm ranbaxy,order denying summary judgment.while acknowledging that torpharm was estopped from the validity of the patent,the district court ruled that the patentability of the process claims was not legally linked to the patentability of the product claim.however,in reaching this conclusion,the district court assumed that improved form ranitidine could still be nonobvious,even if not novel by reason of a prior sale.because torpharm had cited the nonobviousness of improved form ranitidine when arguing for the nonobviousness of the process during prosecution,the district court reasoned that improved form ranitidine lack of novelty did not dictate obviousness of the process claims.
ranbaxy requested reconsideration of the district court decision.arguing that anticipation is the epitome of obviousness,connell sears,roebuck,uspq,and noting that section b is a source of prior art for a section determination,ranbaxy suggested that there is error in the notion that an invention can be if a patent claim embodying the invention had been invalidated by a section b prior sale.
while torpharm response maintained that the patentability of the process claims was a distinct question from the patentability of the product claim,given that the north carolina decision had not addressed how interchem ranitidine was produced,the district court was persuaded by ranbaxy argument.declaring that the distinction i made between nonobviousness on one hand and patentability on the other is a false distinction,the court granted ranbaxy motion for summary judgment of invalidity.the court reasoned i t is clear that the claims of the patent would not have been allowed but for the alleged novelty of form ranitidine.therefore,torpharm can not now argue that the nonobviousness of the claims is supported by anything other than the novelty of improved form ranitidine.given that the north carolina decision had held improved form ranitidine to lack novelty under section b,the district court concluded that collateral estoppel precluded torpharm from disputing the obviousness of the claims.accordingly,the district court reversed its initial decision,and granted ranbaxy summary judgment that the process claims were invalid as obvious under.
torpharm appeals the judgment of invalidity.we exercise jurisdiction over torpharm appeal pursuant to a.
when a district court grants summary judgment,we review without deference to the trial court whether there are disputed material facts,and review independently whether the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.novartis ben venue.the validity of a patent claim under is a legal determination based on underlying factual findings.loctite ultraseal,uspq.as we do for other matters that do not implicate this court specialized jurisdiction,we review the application of collateral estoppel as a matter of regional circuit law.bayer ag.biovail.the third circuit has acknowledged conflicting decisions applying abuse of discretion or plenary review to a district court application of collateral estoppel.witkowski welch,cir.however,because this case turns on the legal consequence of those matters rendered beyond dispute by collateral estoppel,rather than whether collateral estoppel was itself properly applied,we are presented with a question of law that we review without deference to the district court.
we begin by stating the incontestable.the test of obviousness vel non is statutory,and requires comparison of the claimed invention to the relevant prior art.a in re ochiai.as the district court recognized in its initial ruling,there are no per se rules relating the patentability of product and process in either direction.ochiai,at,at.a process yielding a novel and nonobvious product may nonetheless be obvious conversely,a process yielding a product may yet be nonobvious.
of course,if torpharm had,more than one year before the filing of the application for the patent,sold improved form ranitidine made by the claimed process,then its process claims would be invalid under section b regardless of whether the process was disclosed to the public or not.auld chroma graphics,uspq.in contrast,if the product were sold by one other than the patentee,and the process of making remained unknown,then sale of the product would not pose a statutory bar to a claim on the process.gore,garlock,uspq,auld,at,uspq at.here,not only was the form ranitidine sold by one other than the patentee interchem,but there is also no evidence of the process used to make the material that was sold.
nonetheless,the form ranitidine sold by interchem in is technical prior art against torpharm process claims if a device was in public use or on sale before the critical date,then that device becomes a reference under section against the claimed invention.baker oil tools,geo vann.the analysis is the same whether one regards this principle as an application of the bar,or an application of the law of nonobviousness,for which reason it has been termed the b bar to patentability.in re corcoran,uspq,ccpa.the court task upon such a challenge is to determine whether the claimed invention would have been obvious from the device in conjunction with the prior art.labounty,united states int l trade comm n.for the case at bar,this inquiry would require the district court to determine whether the form ranitidine of uncertain genesis sold in,in conjunction with the prior art,rendered obvious torpharm claimed process of crystallizing improved form ranitidine from a three or alcohol solvent we infer from the district court initial denial of summary judgment that the court viewed this question as raising disputes of fact,at least at this stage of the proceedings.
while ranbaxy acknowledges these general principles,ranbaxy argues and so convinced the district court that here the prosecution history of the patent obviates the need to conduct a obviousness inquiry,once the lack of novelty of the product is conceded.according to ranbaxy,torpharm argued that the process was nonobvious based on the novelty of improved form ranitidine,and the examiner allowed the claim only because the product was novel as shown by his demand that torpharm amend the process claim to explicitly recite the bulk and tap densities defining improved form ranitidine.therefore,argues ranbaxy,if improved form ranitidine is not actually novel,torpharm claimed process must be obvious.the district court agreed with ranbaxy,holding that torpharm was now estopped from arguing that anything other than the novelty of form ranitidine supports the nonobviousness of its claims.we must reject ranbaxy position,however,for it suffers from three serious deficiencies.
the first deficiency is factual.we do not agree with ranbaxy characterization of the prosecution history.as filed,torpharm original claims recited a process for recovering the improved form of form ranitidine hydrochloride without reciting the properties of the improved form.the claims did require that the process comprise at least one alkanol solvent having carbon atoms.these claims were initially rejected as anticipated or obvious in light of references disclosing crystallization of form or form ranitidine from alcohol solvents.the examiner noted a that the claims did not distinguish the improved form ranitidine from the form and form known in the prior art,and b the prior art taught crystallization of ranitidine from the same solvents recited by the claims 
torpharm did not significantly amend the claims in response.however,torpharm provided a copy of the patent,and stated that its novel form ranitidine,as disclosed in the patent,overcame the deficiencies of the prior art form ranitidine because it was a hard dense crystal,with higher density.torpharm also stated 
the method for achieving this result was based on the process which substitutes the methanol a solvent in united states patent,glaxo original form ranitidine patent by using an alkanol having carbon atoms.as stated by the pct examiner,nothing in the prior art including united states patent suggest sic to replace methanol in the preparation process by any other alkanol.thus,no person skilled in the art would replace the solvent in the preparation process and would not all expect the ranitidine hydrochloride product to have a higher bulk and tap density.
in other words,torpharm argued that it would not have been obvious to use a or alcohol solvent in place of the solvent used to crystallize form ranitidine in the prior art.
while torpharm also stated during prosecution that b ecause the product is not obvious,the process can not be obvious,we agree with torpharm that torpharm advanced two distinct arguments during prosecution a that the product was novel and advantageous over the prior art form ranitidine and b that there was no suggestion in the prior art to use alcohol solvents with three or four carbon atoms in preparing form ranitidine.thus,it is incorrect to characterize torpharm argument for nonobviousness during prosecution as relying exclusively on the novelty of improved form ranitidine.
the second problem in ranbaxy argument is purely logical.even if torpharm had advanced during prosecution only the first of the two propositions recited above,the subsequent negation of that proposition by the north carolina decision would not necessarily negate the patentability of the process.torpharm is said to have relied on essentially the following relation during prosecution if the product is patentable over the prior art,then the process is patentable over the prior art.it may now be established,by the north carolina district court decision,that the product is not in fact patentable over the prior art.but this does not lead to the conclusion that the process is not patentable.the process may or may not be patentable for other reasons.ranbaxy,in arguing that the process is patentable only if the product is patentable,simply urges the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent 
the third flaw in ranbaxy argument is a legal one.even assuming the examiner allowed the process claims only because the product was novel,it does not necessarily follow that the patent must be invalid.ranbaxy claims that the argument did not persuade the examiner,arguing that the examiner would not have required amendments reciting the product limitations the bulk and tap densities had he been persuaded by the solvent argument.we are skeptical of this claim.when a patentee argues that her claims are nonobvious because process x yields product y,it is not surprising that an examiner might require the claims to recite the properties of both x and y.but the nonobviousness inquiry does not turn on speculation about what a particul
