gabriel carrera brings this class action against bayer corporation and bayer healthcare,llc bayer,claiming that bayer falsely and deceptively advertised its product one a day weightsmart.weightsmart was promoted as a multivitamin and dietary supplement that had effects.the recommended daily dose was one tablet and prices ranged from about for fifty tablets to about for one hundred tablets.bayer sold weightsmart in retail stores,such as cvs,until january.bayer did not sell it directly to consumers.carrera alleges bayer falsely claimed that weightsmart enhanced metabolism by its inclusion of epigallocatechin gallate,a green tea extract.
carrera initially sought to certify a nationwide class under.b bringing a claim under the new jersey consumer fraud act,as bayer headquarters is in new jersey.the court denied certification,concluding that new jersey law did not apply to customers.this order is not before us on appeal.
carrera then moved to certify a rule b class of florida consumers under the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act.one of bayer challenges to certification,and the issue on this appeal,is whether the class members are ascertainable.in this case,there is no dispute that class members are unlikely to have documentary proof of purchase,such as packaging or receipts.and bayer has no list of purchasers because,as noted,it did not sell weightsmart directly to consumers.
carrera advanced two ways to ascertain the class first,by retailer records of online sales and sales made with store loyalty or rewards cards second,by affidavits of class members,attesting they purchased weightsmart and stating the amount they purchased.bayer challenged this latter method on the ground that memories of putative class members will be unreliable.bayer argued that,in carrera own deposition testimony,he failed to remember when he purchased weightsmart and that he confused it with weightsmart advanced and other generic or similar products none of which are part of this litigation.in response,carrera produced a declaration of james prutsman,who works for a company that verifies and processes class settlement claims,in which prutsman stated there are ways to verify the types of affidavits at issue here and screen out fraudulent claims.
the court certified the class,defined as all persons who purchased weightsmart in florida it characterized the issue of ascertainability as one of manageability,stating speculative problems with case management are insufficient to prevent class certification.carrera bayer,civ,wl,at,quoting klay humana,cir.the court concluded carrera had satisfied his burden,noting that the claims involved will be relatively small and plaintiff points to methods to verify claims.id.bayer appealed.it contends carrera has failed to demonstrate the class is ascertainable because there is no evidence that any retailer records show who purchased weightsmart.bayer also argues that the use of unverifiable affidavits to ascertain class members fails to comply with rule and violates its rights under the due process clause.
the district court had jurisdiction under d.we have jurisdiction under e and.f.we review a class certification order for abuse of discretion,which occurs if the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir quotation omitted.whether an incorrect legal standard has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed de novo.id.quotation omitted.
in marcus,we explained the concept of ascertainability at length for the first time.at.the claim in marcus was that bridgestone tires rfts were defective because they were highly susceptible to flats could only be replaced,not repaired and were highly priced.id.at.the district court certified a rule b class consisting of any and all current and former owners and lessees of,and bmw vehicles equipped with tires manufactured by bridgestone and sold or leased in new jersey whose tires have gone flat and been replaced.id.at quotation and alterations omitted.the defendants appealed,and we vacated the order certifying the class.
before turning to the explicit requirements of rule in marcus,we addressed two preliminary matters first,whether the class was clearly defined,and second,whether the class must be and,if so,is in fact objectively ascertainable.id.at.we concluded the class was not clearly defined.at the least,the definition of the class was broader than intended and did not define the claims,issues,or defenses to be treated on a basis.id.at.accordingly,we remanded the case for clarification of the class definition.
we then addressed ascertainability.we began by stating,m any courts and commentators have recognized that an essential prerequisite of a class action,at least with respect to actions under rule b,is that the class must be currently and readily ascertainable based on objective criteria.id.at citing cases.if class members are impossible to identify without extensive and individualized or,then a class action is inappropriate.id.at.we noted,s ome courts have held that where nothing in company databases shows or could show whether individuals should be included in the proposed class,the class definition fails.id.citing cases.
we then explained the 
ascertainability requirement serves several important objectives.first,it eliminates serious administrative burdens that are incongruous with the efficiencies expected in a class action by insisting on the easy identification of class members.second,it protects absent class members by facilitating the best notice practicable under rule c in a rule b action.third,it protects defendants by ensuring that those persons who will be bound by the final judgment are clearly identifiable.
id.citations and quotations omitted.
we set forth why the proposed class action raise d serious ascertainability issues.id.defendant bmw explained that it could not determine by its records which vehicles fit the definition of the class because it did not keep records of which cars got fitted with bridgestone rfts,because some customers may have changed tires of which bwm had no record,and because bmw would not have known which customers experienced flat tires.id.at.we stated that if plaintiff were to attempt to a class on remand,the court must resolve the critical issue of whether the defendants records can ascertain class members and,if not,whether there is a reliable,administratively feasible alternative.id.at.we cautioned against approving a method that would amount to no more than ascertaining by potential class members say so.for example,simply having potential class members submit affidavits that their bridgestone rfts have gone flat and been replaced may not be proper or just.id.quotation omitted.forcing bmw and bridgestone to accept as true absent persons declarations that they are members of the class,without further indicia of reliability,would have serious due process implications.id.
a party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with rule.wal mart stores,dukes,d.class certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule are met.hydrogen peroxide,at quoting.of sw.falcon,d.frequently that rigorous analysis will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim.that can not be helped.t he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.dukes.at alteration in original quoting falcon,at.factual determinations necessary to make rule findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.hydrogen peroxide,at.
these same standards apply to the question of ascertainability.class ascertainability is an essential prerequisite of a class action,at least with respect to actions under rule b.marcus,at.t here is no reason to doubt that the rigorous analysis requirement applies with equal force to all rule requirements.hydrogen peroxide,at quoting in re initial pub.offering sec,cir.accordingly,a plaintiff must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the class is currently and readily ascertainable based on objective criteria,marcus,at,and a trial court must undertake a rigorous analysis of the evidence to determine if the standard is met.
a party assurance to the court that it intends or plans to meet the requirements of rule is insufficient.hydrogen peroxide,at.a plaintiff may not merely propose a method of ascertaining a class without any evidentiary support that the method will be successful.a critical need of the trial court at certification is to determine how the case will be tried,id.at quoting.advisory committee note,amendments,including how the class is to be ascertained.
ascertainability mandates a rigorous approach at the outset because of the key roles it plays as part of a rule b class action lawsuit.first,at the commencement of a class action,ascertainability and a clear class definition allow potential class members to identify themselves for purposes of opting out of a class.second,it ensures that a defendant rights are protected by the class action mechanism.third,it ensures that the parties can identify class members in a manner consistent with the efficiencies of a class action.
t he device saves the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every class member to be litigated in an economical fashion under rule.falcon,at second alteration in original quoting califano yamasaki,d.if a class can not be ascertained in an economical and administratively feasible manner,marcus,at,significant benefits of a class action are lost.see id.at explaining ascertainability eliminates serious administrative burdens that are incongruous with the efficiencies expected in a class action quotation omitted.accordingly,a trial court should ensure that class members can be identified without extensive and individualized or,a determination which must be made at the class certification stage.
in this case,the ascertainability question is whether each class member purchased weightsmart in florida.if this were an individual claim,a plaintiff would have to prove at trial he purchased weightsmart.a defendant in a class action has a due process right to raise individual challenges and defenses to claims,and a class action can not be certified in a way that eviscerates this right or masks individual issues.see mclaughlin am.tobacco,cir rejecting a fluid recovery method of determining individual damages,in which aggregate damages would be based on estimates of the number of defrauded class members and their average loss,abrogated on other grounds by bridge phoenix bond indem,d see also dukes.at rejecting a method of class certification in which a sample set of class members would be used to extrapolate average damages.a defendant has a similar,if not the same,due process right to challenge the proof used to demonstrate class membership as it does to challenge the elements of a plaintiff claim.see marcus,at forcing bmw and bridgestone to accept as true absent persons declarations that they are members of the class,without further indicia of reliability,would have serious due process implications.ascertainability provides due process by requiring that a defendant be able to test the reliability of the evidence submitted to prove class membership.
the method of determining whether someone is in the class must be administratively feasible.id.a plaintiff does not satisfy the ascertainability requirement if individualized or will be required to prove class membership.id.at.administrative feasibility means that identifying class members is a manageable process that does not require much,if any,individual factual inquiry.william rubenstein alba conte,newberg on class actions ed see also bakalar vavra,class membership must be readily identifiable such that a court can determine who is in the class and bound by its ruling without engaging in numerous inquiries.
the type of challenge to the reliability of evidence that is required will vary based on the nature of the evidence.for example,if carrera produces retailer records that purport to list purchasers of weightsmart,bayer can challenge the reliability of those records,perhaps by deposing a corporate in sum,to satisfy ascertainability as it relates to proof of class membership,the plaintiff must demonstrate his purported method for ascertaining class members is reliable and administratively feasible,and permits a defendant to challenge the evidence used to prove class membership.
carrera contends the class is ascertainable.he points to two types of evidence that can be used to determine who is a class member.first,he argues the class can use records from retailers,which purportedly track customers who make purchases online or who use loyalty cards.second,he proposes using affidavits of class members attesting to their purchases of weightsmart.we conclude that,based on the evidence produced below,neither method satisfies carrera burden to show the class is ascertainable.
carrera argues he will be able to show class membership using retailer records of sales made with loyalty cards,cvs extracare cards and records of online sales.carrera points to a federal trade commission ftc settlement with cvs regarding the sale of a supplement that was falsely advertised as boosting immune systems.the supplement was sold only at cvs.the ftc stated in its press release regarding the settlement that p urchasers will be identified through the cvs extracare card program and sales on.
bayer contends there is no evidence that any other retailer of weightsmart has membership cards,that the ftc case is inapposite as it was a stipulated settlement in a context in which some of the money paid might go to class members but did not have to,and that it is speculative whether cvs or any other retailer records will reveal customers who purchased weightsmart.
the evidence put forth by carrera is insufficient to show that retailer records in this case can be used to identify class members.depending on the facts of a case,retailer records may be a perfectly acceptable method of proving class membership.but there is no evidence that a single purchaser of weightsmart could be identified using records of customer membership cards or records of online sales.there is no evidence that retailers even have records for the relevant period.the ftc press release does not support a finding that these records can determine class membership on the facts of this case.moreover,we have no evidence the ftc method was successful.
carrera also contends the class is ascertainable using affidavits of class members.he advances three arguments.first,due to the low value of the claims,class members will be unlikely to submit fraudulent affidavits.second,because bayer total liability will not depend on the reliability of the affidavits,the ascertainability requirement should be relaxed.finally,a screening method such as the one described in the prutsman declaration will ensure any unreliable affidavits are identified and disregarded.
because the claims are of low value,carrera argues it is less likely someone would fabricate a claim.he concedes it is unlikely customers would have retained a receipt,but asserts this is irrelevant to possible falsification.he contrasts the claims at issue here
