rene junk brought this action in state court on behalf of her son,tyler junk,against terminix international company terminix,dow chemical company and dow agrosciences llc collectively dow,and terminix employee jim breneman.junk alleged that multiple medical conditions were caused by exposure to dursban,an insecticide manufactured by dow,distributed by terminix,and applied to the junk household by breneman and other terminix employees.after dow removed the case to federal district court,junk moved to remand for lack of diversity since junk and defendant breneman were both citizens of iowa.the district court denied the motion after concluding that breneman had been fraudulently joined to evade diversity.junk claims against breneman were subsequently dismissed,and summary judgment was entered for dow and terminix.junk appeals.we affirm the judgment in favor of dow and terminix but reverse in respect to the claim against breneman.
junk was born two months premature with an enlarged heart and liver and tachycardia.it was also determined early in his life that had developmental delay and cerebral palsy.the junks home had been infested with spiders during rene junk pregnancy,and she contacted terminix about the problem.terminix then sent out its employee jim breneman to consult with the family.
five months before birth,breneman enrolled the junks in a residential pest control service agreement.breneman thereafter sprayed the pesticide dursban inside and outside the junks home.junk alleges that she and her husband had informed breneman that she was pregnant and had asked him about the safety of dursban.dursban contains the synthetic chemical chlorpyrifos.breneman assured them that dursban was a naturally occurring organic material which would have no impact on human beings.the junks also allege that breneman and other terminix employees made similar representations before and after birth.breneman and other terminix employees made a total of twenty dursban applications to the junk household,the last occurring two years after birth.
on behalf junk sued terminix,dow,and breneman in iowa state court junk alleged that her exposure to dursban during her pregnancy and exposure to the pesticide after his birth had caused severe neurological problems.junk claimed breach of express and implied warranties,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,products liability,and negligence.the defendants filed a timely notice of removal to federal district court under,claiming diversity jurisdiction under a.
junk moved to remand the case to state court under,arguing that the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction because defendant breneman and,the party in interest,were both citizens of iowa.the defendants did not dispute breneman iowa citizenship,but argued that he had been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction.the district court denied junk motion to remand the case to state court and her subsequent motions to reconsider.while junk argued that had a colorable negligence claim against breneman due to his false statements and other conduct,the court reasoned that junk could not maintain a cause of action under iowa common law because she had failed to allege explicitly that breneman had deviated from terminix instructions.the court later dismissed junk claims against breneman for failure to state a claim for the same reason.
discovery continued after breneman dismissal,and the district court made three subsequent pretrial evidentiary rulings which junk contests on appeal.the court first excluded the testimony of richard fenske,one of junk expert witnesses.fenske is a professor at the university of washington and an expert on human toxic exposure.the junks retained him to determine whether had been exposed to an unsafe level of chlorpyrifos during his mother pregnancy and after his birth.fenske testified that when making toxic exposure and dosage estimates in his research,he usually relies on a deterministic modeling method in which he creates an exposure model that accounts for numerous variables.in this case,however,he did not have sufficient data to perform such an analysis.instead,he compared what he knew about the circumstances of exposure with those in published studies.this comparative analysis led him to conclude that had been exposed to an unsafe level of chlorpyrifos.observing that fenske had not followed his own usual methodology and concluding that he had relied on a number of ungrounded assumptions in his comparative approach,the district court excluded his opinion on the ground that his methodology was not sufficiently reliable.see.daubert merrell dow.
cynthia bearer testimony was also excluded.she is a neonatologist and board certified pediatrician whom junk retained to give her opinion on general and specific causation.she was asked whether chlorpyrifos could have caused the type of injuries that afflict and whether it did in fact cause them.see ranes adams,iowa.the district court initially regarded bearer opinions on both general and specific causation to be reliable and admissible,but it indicated that it would revisit the issue after it had examined fenske testimony.that was because bearer opinion on specific causation relied on fenske conclusions.after the court excluded fenske testimony,it found bearer opinion on specific causation to lack a scientific factual basis and declined to admit it.
the district court also granted the defendants motion in limine to exclude an environmental protection agency epa report that summarized research on the effect of chlorpyrifos exposure on pregnant women,fetuses,and children.after examining a disclaimer on the report that appeared to cast doubt on its trustworthiness,the court expressed concern that the report carried a risk of unfair prejudice and concluded that it was not admissible under.c,or.
subsequent to those evidentiary rulings,the district court concluded that junk could not raise a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of specific causation without bearer opinion.on that basis the court granted summary judgment in favor of dow and terminix on all causes of action against them.junk appeals,challenging the district court denial of her motion for remand and the subsequent dismissal of the claims against breneman,the summary judgment for dow and terminix,and the orders excluding junk experts and the epa report.
we review the court denial of remand de novo.in re prempro prods.liab,cir.a defendant removal of a case to federal court is appropriate only if the action originally could have been filed there.a b.a plaintiff may move to remand the case if the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.c.if the district court concludes that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction,it must remand the case.see prempro,at.
subject matter jurisdiction asserted under may be maintained only where there is complete diversity,that is where no defendant holds citizenship in the same state where any plaintiff holds citizenship.prempro,at.in an exception to this rule,a district court may retain jurisdiction where the nondiverse defendant has been fraudulently joined.id.joinder is fraudulent when a plaintiff files a frivolous or illegitimate claim against a defendant solely to prevent removal.id.
the parties dispute whether we should review the district court denial of junk remand motion and subsequent dismissal of brenemen under the fraudulent joinder standard outlined in filla norfolk southern railway,cir,or under the standard in.b.this question is significant because the two standards differ,with rule b being more demanding.under the filla standard the district court task is limited to determining whether there is arguably a reasonable basis for predicting that the state law might impose liability based upon the facts involved.filla,at.in contrast,t o survive a rule b motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.
junk argues that the filla standard is the proper test to decide whether a remand to state court was appropriate and whether the court subsequent dismissal of breneman was proper.this was the approach we followed in wilkinson shackelford,cir.dow and terminix argue,however,that a remand order should be reviewed in the same manner as a rule b dismissal,citing simpson thomure,cir.
we do not consider simpson holding to be as broad as appellees suggest.in simpson a nondiverse defendant opposed remand to state court since he was immune from suit under a state workers compensation law.at.we chose not to apply the filla fraudulent joinder standard in that situation because the question there turned on the issue of immunity.id.at.here there is no contention that breneman is immune from suit in iowa,and simpson does not apply.appellees overly broad reading of that case would effectively reverse our practice of examining the question of fraudulent joinder under the filla standard rather than under rule b.
in wilkinson,a case decided before simpson,we faced facts similar to those present here.the district court decided there that a nondiverse defendant had been fraudulently joined by the plaintiff to defeat diversity jurisdiction.the court therefore denied the plaintiff motion to remand and granted the nondiverse defendant motion for dismissal.wilkinson,at.on the plaintiff appeal,we applied the filla standard to address the fraudulent joinder question first.id.at.after concluding that the district court had erred in holding there had been fraudulent joinder,we reversed the dismissal of the nondiverse defendant and instructed the court to remand the claim to state court.id.at.
we took a similar approach in menz new holland north america,cir.in menz,the district court had denied a remand motion based on fraudulent joinder and later dismissed the plaintiff claims.id.at.we reviewed the court fraudulent joinder analysis under the filla standard.id.only after holding that the nondiverse defendant had been fraudulently joined,did we then review the court subsequent dismissal order.id.at.
a comparison of these decisions shows no direct conflict between simpson and wilkinson.simpson involved a nondiverse defendant who had been fraudulently joined since he claimed immunity under a state workers compensation law.neither wilkinson nor the case before the court have such an immunity issue.moreover,even if there had been a conflict between wilkinson and simpson,the better practice normally would be to follow the earliest opinion,as it should have controlled the subsequent panels that created the conflict.united states robertson,cir for these reasons our wilkinson approach should be followed here.we therefore review the district court denial of remand under the filla standard and would then reverse it along with breneman dismissal if we were to conclude that he was not fraudulently joined.
joinder is not fraudulent where there is arguably a reasonable basis for predicting that the state law might impose liability based upon the facts involved.filla,at.that question turns on whether junk might have had a colorable claim against breneman,not on the artfulness of junk pleadings.wilkinson,at see menz,at.all doubts about federal jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand to state court.prempro,at.in considering whether breneman was fraudulently joined,the district court concluded that junk could not maintain any of the causes of action asserted against him.on appeal,junk argues only that the court erred in its analysis of the negligence claim against him.
an employee may be held liable under iowa law for on the job negligence.hartig francois,iowa.there are limits to such liability,however.an employee who carefully carries out the plans,specifications and directions given the employee by the employer is not liable for defects in those plans,specifications or directions unless they are so obviously defective and dangerous that no reasonable man would follow them.hartig francois,iowa quoting page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts ed.the district court cited hartig in ruling that junk complaint failed to allege that breneman deviated from the instructions given by his employer,terminix,regarding sales and warnings for the pest control services.
although junk complaint was not as artful as it might have been,we conclude that it stated facts sufficient to make a colorable claim against breneman under iowa law.junk alleged that breneman made representations to the junks that dursban was a naturally occurring organic material which would have no impact on human beings.in the section of junk complaint alleging negligence,junk alleged that terminix and breneman failed to warn of health risks associated with the use of dursban and did not requir e consumers to vacate their house when dursban was sprayed.although the conjunctive nature of junk complaint did not always distinguish between allegations against terminix,the employer,and breneman,the employee,all doubts should be resolved in favor of remand.prempro,at.junk complaint may reasonably be read to raise the issue whether breneman acted outside of the scope of terminix plans,specifications and directions.see hartig,at.for example,it may be reasonably inferred from the complaint that terminix would likely not have instructed its employees to represent that dursban was a naturally occurring organic material and would have no impact on human beings when dursban was in fact a synthetic chemical.
we conclude that there was arguably a reasonable basis for predicting that the state law might impose liability based upon the facts involved.filla,at.this conclusion is all that is required to defeat a fraudulent joinder challenge.wilkinson,at.the district court order denying remand and its subsequent dismissal of junk claim against breneman should therefore be reversed and that claim remanded to state court.
after the district court denied the motion for remand on april and dismissed breneman on october,the litigation proceeded against the corporate defendants throughout and.during that time the court issued orders excluding evidence and it granted summary judgment in november in favor of dow and terminix on all remaining claims.junk urges that the erroneous denial of remand should void the court subsequent rulings in favor of dow and terminix,but a district court error in failing to remand a case improperly removed is not fatal to the ensuing adjudication if federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the time judgment is entered.caterpillar lewis.upon breneman dismissal,the court diversity jurisdiction was perfected and the litigation could proceed as to dow and terminix.see wilkinson,at.
because the district court summary judgment order turned on disputed evidentiary rulings,we address those rulings first.we reverse a trial court decision on the admissibility of expert evidence only on the basis of a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.barrett rhodia,cir.rule provides 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.

richard fenske was retained by junk to offer his opinion on t.exposure to chlorpyrifos during his mother pregnancy and after his birth.fenske academic experience and expertise are not in dispute.the district court concluded,however,that fenske methodological approach in this particular case was not sufficiently reliable.fenske testified that he generally employs a determi
