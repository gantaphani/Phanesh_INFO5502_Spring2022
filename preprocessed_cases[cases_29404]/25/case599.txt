this infringement case returns to us for the second time after remand to the district court on the issue of whether aventis committed inequitable conduct before the united states patent and trademark office pto.in our earlier opinion,we held that the dosage of the prior art composition used in comparisons with the patented composition was information material to patentability,but we remanded to the district court to determine whether there was an intent to deceive by aventis in failing to disclose the dosage.after a trial on the matter,the district court found that there was intent to deceive and held the patents unenforceable for inequitable conduct.because we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in its holding of inequitable conduct,we affirm.
aventis is the owner of patent no.re the patent and patent the patent,which was surrendered upon the issuance of the patent.the patents are directed to a composition comprising low molecular weight heparins lmwhs.claim of the patent recites 
a heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides,such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less than that of heparin and said admixture consisting essentially of 
from to of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than daltons 
from to of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than daltons,and 
from of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight of between and daltons,
the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from to 
said admixture i exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and ii having an average molecular weight of between approximately and daltons.
the drug is marketed as lovenox in the united states and clexane in europe and is effective in preventing thromboses blood clotting while minimizing the possibility of hemorrhaging,especially during surgery.according to the specification,the advantage of the claimed lmwhs as compared to heparin is that they exhibit a longer,excellent bioavailability,higher rate of absorption,low clearance,resistance to degradation,increased residence time,and reduced sensitivity to serum factors.patent.
the prosecution history of the patent is germane to the issue of inequitable conduct.original claim of the patent application recited as follows 
a heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides,such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less that that of heparin and which comprise from to of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than daltons and from to of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than daltons,the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from to.
in the first office action,the patent examiner rejected the claims under b over several references,including european patent ep.the examiner stated that each of the prior art references teaches sulfated heparinic admixtures within the molecular weight mw range of the claims and is considered to be inherently the same as the claimed admixtures.in particular,the examiner explained that 
the patent and trademark office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various products,and where the prior art teaches a product which is identical or nearly identical to that claimed,it is incumbent upon the applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious property not demonstrated by the prior art products.

in response to the office action,aventis independently addressed the anticipation and obviousness portion of the rejection with respect to anticipation,aventis argued that ep does not expressly state that the mixture contains two types of polysaccharides,one with a mw less than daltons and one with a mw greater than daltons,nor does it state the number average mw ratio.presuming,therefore,that the examiner anticipation rejection rested on inherency,aventis argued that the evidence in the specification rebuts inherency.in particular,aventis pointed to example in the specification,which provides in relevant part 
this example illustrates the increase in stability,in vivo,of the mixtures of the invention,expressed by their plasma.

mg dose in of the cases,the was longer than hours,and was even longer than hours in approximately of the cases

when the product was prepared according to the process described in european patent ep,the was longer than hours in of the cases.
patent,ll.emphases added.example was prepared with the assistance of andr√© uzan,a french chemist who was a.based on the example,aventis argued that the claimed lmwhs exhibit a significantly longer than formulations prepared in accordance with ep.aventis went on to explain that,because it is well established that compounds are inseparable from their properties,the evidence of a difference in a property,serves as evidence of a difference in structure.with regard to the obviousness portion of the rejection,aventis contended that,under,the prior art must suggest the modification to one of skill in the art,yet ep provides absolutely no suggestion to select the particular combination of oligosaccharide chains of specified lengths as claimed.
the examiner was not convinced and issued a second final office action,maintaining the prior rejection for the reasons of record in the last office action.the examiner reiterated that the mw requirements of the claimed compounds are within the range of the compounds disclosed in ep and that any properties would be inherent in the prior art compounds because they have the same structure as the claimed compounds 
thereafter,aventis amended claim to read 
a heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides,such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less that that of heparin and said admixture comprising 
from to of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than daltons 
from to of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than daltons,and 
from of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight of between and daltons,
the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from to,
said admixture i exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and ii having an average molecular weight of between approximately and daltons.
aventis also submitted a declaration from uzan first uzan declaration.in of the declaration,uzan distinguished the claimed formulations from the formulations in ep.first,he noted that the of the claimed formulation is greater than hours of the time,as compared to the ep formulation which achieved such a only of the time.he remarked,this represents an increase in in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages.further,uzan stated that he analyzed the ep product and found that of the chains had a mw lower than of the chains had a mw greater than and of the chains had a mw between and.id.finally,he concluded that the formulations of ep are clearly outside the scope of the present invention.aventis relied on example and the first uzan declaration to address the anticipation rejection,arguing that the compounds disclosed in ep are not inherently the same as the claimed compounds because the claimed compounds have a longer and because compounds prepared in accordance with ep fall outside the scope of the claims.with respect to obviousness,aventis argued that the claimed compounds are over ep because the compositions in ep did not exhibit the unexpected properties of the claimed combination of mw chains.
in the third office action first office action in the continuing application,the examiner affirmatively withdrew several rejections over other prior art references.the examiner continued to reject the claims under over ep for the reasons of record in the second office action.according to the examiner,ep teaches admixtures of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides having molecular weight ranges which are not patentably distinct from those of the instant claims.the examiner explained that the instant molecular weight requirements are highly similar to those of the prior art molecular weight ranges,and that no evidence has been presented that the claimed compounds would have any properties or activities not necessarily inherent in the prior art compounds.with respect to the comparisons between the claimed compounds and ep,the examiner stated that the a pplicant has failed to provide evidence that the alleged difference between the of the ep product and that of the claimed mixture is statistically significant.further,the examiner contended that the first uzan declaration showed that the differences in composition based on mw were minimal and there was no showing of any unexpected results.aventis responded by submitting another declaration from uzan second uzan declaration.in of the declaration,uzan referenced five tables comprising the raw data from the comparisons between the claimed compound and the ep compound,which tables were attached to the declaration uzan also provided results from a statistical analysis showing a statistically significant difference between the mean for the claimed compound and that of the ep compound.specifically,uzan reported,for the claimed compound t was.for the compound of ep,t was,and the statistical analysis showed that and were statistically significant.the mean of for the claimed compound was taken from table x,which indicated the dosage to be mg.the mean of for the ep compound was taken from table iii,which did not mention the dosage.
aventis argued,in its response,that ep does not suggest compounds containing polysaccharides of the claimed mw in the claimed proportions and that the examiner improperly relied on inherency to reject the claimed compounds over ep.referring to the second uzan declaration,aventis asserted that different are obtained with the claimed preparation as compared to the preparation of ep.therefore,aventis averred,the claimed compounds have been shown to differ from the compounds of ep in both their structure and properties.
thereafter,the patent application was allowed.
amphastar pharmaceuticals,amphastar and teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva each filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda to obtain approval to a market generic version of lovenox.the anda contained a paragraph iv certification challenging the two aventis patents.
aventis sued both teva and amphastar for infringement of the patent in the united states district court for the central district of california.aventis pharma amphastar,d,aventis i.amphastar filed a motion for summary judgment on its affirmative defense and counterclaim that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.id.at.specifically,amphastar averred that uzan engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to disclose that the studies comparing the patented compound to the ep compound were at different doses.id.at.
the district court determined that the representation by aventis that the patented compound had an improved as compared to the ep compound was material to patentability because aventis referred to the improved at least four times during prosecution and the examiner ultimately allowed the patent application after the final representation that the difference in mean was statistically significant.id.at.the court found a strong inference of intent to deceive because it could find no credible explanation for comparing at different doses and because comparisons at the same dose showed little difference in.id.at.after weighing the evidence of materiality and intent,the court found weighty uncontroverted evidence establishing inequitable conduct.id.at.it,therefore,granted summary judgment against aventis and held the patent unenforceable id.
on appeal,aventis argued that the district court erred in finding materiality because if the dose information were material to patentability,the examiner would have requested it because she was presented with data that enabled her to compare various doses,uzan informed the examiner that the comparison was done at different doses,those of skill in the art frequently compare at different doses,and is independent of dose.aventis pharma amphastar,aventis ii.to support the argument that uzan informed the examiner that the comparisons were done at different doses,aventis relied on the statement in the first uzan declaration that t his represents an increase in in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages,and uzan deposition testimony stating that he believed this to mean that the comparison is a comparison between two doses of which one is lower than the other.id.at emphasis added internal quotations omitted.aventis relied on this same statement to argue that uzan did not intend to deceive the examiner.id.at.aventis further argued lack of intent based on the fact that uzan submitted data for the claimed compound at mg,as well as at mg.id.
with regard to materiality,this court held that it was not plausible to read the statement in the first uzan declaration as indicating to the examiner that the comparison was done at different doses and,therefore,there was no genuine issue of material fact that uzan did not disclose that the comparison was made using data for the two compounds at different doses.id.at.we also rejected aventis explanation for nondisclosure that using different doses in comparisons was common practice in the field because,in contrast to the references cited in support of this proposition,aventis did not disclose the actual doses.id.further,this court did not accept the explanation that the data were dose independent because the evidence clearly suggested otherwise.id.at.therefore,we concluded that the withholding of the ep dosage information prevented the examiner from considering information important to patentability and constituted a failure to disclose material information.id.at.
while this court found that the dosage of the ep composition was indeed information material to patentability,we held that the district court erred in finding intent to deceive on summary judgment.id.in particular,we held that the reasonableness of the comparison at different doses is relevant to determining whether there was an intent to deceive in withholding the dosage of the ep composition.id.at.this court reasoned 
t he district court ultimately concluded that the facts supported a strong inference of intent to deceive.the district court inference was failing to disclose that the ep data was at a mg dose,aventis may have been painting the rosiest picture possible as to the improvement of its claimed compounds in an attempt to deceive the examiner however,there is another reasonable,as aventis argues,if the comparison between different doses was reasonable,the failure to disclose may have been due purely to inadvertence.
id.at.accordingly,this court reversed the grant of summary judgment of unenforceability of the patent and patent,and remanded to the district court for determination of whether there was intent to deceive.id.
following remand,the district court held a bench trial limited to the issue of intent.aventis pharma amphastar,d,aventis iii.thereafter,the court issued its opinion,considering the principle explanations proffered by aventis for uzan failure to disclose the dose of the ep composition in its comparisons.these explanations were that comparison of at different doses was reasonable because it was customary to compare the of different drugs at the clinically relevant dose,the dose presenting the best ratio,and the comparisons were intended to show a difference in therapeutic properties,not a compositional difference comparison of at different doses was reasonable because are dose independent and the failure to disclose was due merely to inadvertence.id.at.
the district court found uzan clinical relevance justification implausible because such a justification presumed a compositional difference between the compounds being compared,yet the issue of inherency was repeatedly raised by the examiner during prosecution.id.at.the court noted that the examiner recognized that a compound properties,are inherent in its composition and thereby rejected the claims as anticipated by the ep compound under.id.therefore,the court was not persuaded that uzan presented the comparisons to show only a difference in property and not also a difference in composition.id.the court was similarly unpersuaded by aventis argument because the evidence did not establish that the were,given the high variability.id.at.
furthermore,the court rejected uzan dose justification on the grounds that it was incredible because there was no statistical difference in when the mg dose of ep composition was compared to the patented composition at a mg,mg or mg dose,there was a statistical difference only when a mg dose of the patented composition was compared the patent was not limited to safe and effective doses for particular therapeutic indications there were a number of preferred therapeutic doses for the patented composition and aventis offered no corroborating evidence to support uzan clinically relevant dose justification.id.at.
finally,the court declined to find that uzan failure to disclose the difference in doses could be justified based on inadvertence because it was not credible that a scientist with uzan qualifications could have committed,and failed to correct during a lengthy prosecution,such an egregious error,and there was a complete absence of evidence suggesting negligence throughout prosecution.id.at.
based on the totality of the facts and circumstances,the court determined that but for uzan intentional omissions,the probability was high that the patent would not have issued.id.at.accordingly,the court held the patent and the patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.id.

now,on its second time on appeal,aventis offers a new justification for uzan failure to disclose the dosage information in his comparisons according to aventis,uzan comparisons were intended to show a difference in properties in response to the obviousness rejection under,not to demonstrate a compositional difference to address the anticipation rejection under,as the district court concluded.aventis argument is premised on the fact that while a comparison must be done using equivalent doses to establish a compositional difference,a comparison may be done using different doses if the purpose is to establish a difference in property.in fact,aventis argues,it is more appropriate to use the clinically relevant dose of each compound to demonstrate a difference in property.
as a preliminary matter,it appears that aventis argument would require us,at least in part,to revisit our prior holding on materiality.the essence of aventis argument is that the reason that uzan did not disclose the dosage of the prior art compound in his comparisons is that the comparisons were not being used to show a compositional difference and,therefore,the dosage information was not material.we have previously determined,however,that the dosage information was material to patentability.aventis ii.at.nevertheless,because materiality and intent to deceive are necessarily intertwined,johnson johnson,we will consider the merits of aventis argument with respect to deceptive intent.
aventis contends that the district court made two clearly erroneous findings of fact that the central question relating to patentability was compositional differences,and that the purpose of uzan comparisons was to show compositional differences.according to aventis,coursing throughout the district court opinion is the notion that the central question relating to patentability was compositional differences.during oral argument,aventis emphasized that the district court referred to compositional differences nineteen times in its opinion.oral arg.at,available at.as an example,aventis quoted the court 
thus,the central question throughout the prosecution of the patent was whether the claimed and the ep lmwh products were compositionally different.
id.at see aventis iii,d at.aventis thus contends that the district court erroneously concluded that anticipation was the only rejection of record,even though there was an obviousness rejection present throughout prosecution.moreover,aventis asserts that the district court erred in concluding that the issue of obviousness necessarily folds into,and is subsumed,by inherency.aventis iii,d at.
we find nothing in the district court opinion to suggest that it did not recognize the existence of the obviousness rejection,or that it believed the anticipation rejection to be the only rejection of record.indeed,several statements in the opinion clearly indicate that the court was aware of the obviousness rejection.id.at it also relied on the claimed composition properties to rebut obviousness,b ecause the ratio identified by the claimed lmwh exhibited superior properties over ep,the inventive formulation could neither be inherent nor obvious,this signaled to aventis that its reliance on biochemical properties held promise for overcoming both the primary examiner inherency and obviousness rejections.emphases added.although the court incorrectly suggested,in a footnote,that obviousness is subsumed by inherency,we see this as merely a recognition by the court that the notion of inherency was part and parcel of the examiner rejections.id.at.in other words,the properties of a compound are inherent in its composition and,therefore,a difference in property could successfully demonstrate a difference in composition.id.the court understood that,based on the information available to her,the examiner viewed the patented composition and the ep composition to be inherently the same,or nearly the same,and,because the patent office did not have the facilities to test the products,the examiner invited aventis to provide evidence of a difference in property to show a compositional difference.id.at see in re best,ccpa.we find no clear error in the district court ultimate conclusion.
aventis next contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that the purpose of uzan comparison was to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection under.instead,aventis argues,the mw distribution analysis in the first uzan declaration,showing a difference between the claimed compounds and those disclosed in ep in the proportion of chains of a given mw,was directed to the anticipation rejection the comparisons were directed to the obviousness rejection.further,aventis contends,uzan statement at the end of the declaration that the formulations of ep are outside the scope of the claimed invention,was based on the mw distribution analysis,not the comparisons.according to aventis,the district court improperly concluded that aventis could not establish compositional differences with the mw distribution analysis,so it relied instead on the comparisons to show that the compounds were not identical.in support,aventis quotes the court opinion 
but aventis could not successfully distinguish the patented compound merely by appealing to its ratio of number average and weight average molecular weights.the ep patent is not limited by a specific ratio of constituents.rather it employs open claim language comprising various proportions of particular molecular weight products.therefore,aventis attacked sameness based on a difference in properties.
oral arg.at quoting aventis iii,d at.
we can not agree that the district court clearly erred in its determination that the comparisons were,at least in part,intended to show compositional differences.nothing in example suggests that the comparison was designed to show only and not lack of identity.the beginning of the example merely states this example illustrates the increase in stability,in vivo,of the mixtures of the invention,expressed by their plasma.patent,ll.moreover,the first uzan declaration does not clearly delineate between evidence intended to address the anticipation rejection and evidence intended to address the obviousness rejection.all of the evidence directed to the ep reference appears in of the declaration,without distinction between the and the aspects of the rejection,and there is no basis for concluding that the final statement in thus,the formulations of ep are clearly outside the scope of the present invention refers only to the mw distribution data and not to the data.we likewise reject aventis contention that the court did not recognize that the comparisons were,in part,intended to demonstrate nonobviousness.in fact,immediately following the portion of the opinion quoted by aventis,the court continued it also relied on the claimed composition properties to rebut obviousness.aventis iii,d at.in addition,the court,in reference to a statement by the examiner in the second office action,observed,this signaled to aventis that its reliance on biochemical properties held promise for overcoming both the primary examiner inherency and obviousness rejections.id.therefore,we conclude that the district court properly found that the comparisons were intended to address both the anticipation and obviousness rejections,and,to the extent that they were intended to address the anticipation rejection,the failure to disclose the dosage information evidenced intent to deceive 
aventis further contends that,in the third office action,the examiner withdrew the rejection and maintained only the rejection over ep.yet,aventis asserts,it was not until the second uzan declaration,which was submitted after the third office action,that uzan provided a statistical analysis showing that the differences were statistically significant.hence,aventis urges,the examiner clearly withdrew the rejection based on the mw distribution data,and the data in the second uzan declaration was intended only to overcome the rejection.aventis thus avers that the district court erred in concluding that the anticipation rejection was still pending at the time of the third office action.
the court apparently came to the conclusion that the anticipation rejection was still pending because the rejection had not been expressly withdrawn id.at.although the court may have erred in concluding that the anticipation rejection was still pending in the third office action,that conclusion was not critical to the court ultimate determination that there was intent to deceive.in fact,as explained by the court 
even if the court were to accept as true aventis s unlikely contention that,by the time of uzan second declaration,the primary examiner had conceded that the claimed and ep products were different,there can be no question that inherency was the central,dispositive question up to that point.
id.at.therefore,even if anticipation were not at issue at the time of the third office action,the court still concluded,based on evidence prior to the third office action,that there was deceptive intent.any error by the court in concluding that anticipation was still at issue in the third office action does not override the evidence of intent to deceive based on the failure to disclose dosage information in the comparisons in example of the specification and in the first uzan declaration,both of which were submitted prior to the third office action.we can not agree that the court clearly erred in its factual findings prior to the third office action and in its determinations with respect to intent to deceive based thereon.
in sum,we find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the comparisons were,in part,intended to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection under and,therefore,rejecting aventis argument that they were intended only to show differences in property,such that dosage information was immaterial.
aventis next argues that the district court clearly erred in excluding evidence that comparison of at different doses was the standard practice in the lmwh field.the clinically relevant dose,aventis avers,is the standard dose for comparison of,and every contemporaneous publication comparing did so at the clinically relevant doses,even though those doses may have differed.aventis contends that uzan selected the mg dose for the patented compound and the mg dose for the ep compound because they were the clinically relevant doses.according to aventis,the mg dose for the patented compound was the approved dose for its most important indication,namely,prevention of deep venous thrombosis dvt during orthopedic surgery.
the district court excluded the evidence of industry practice because it determined that such evidence was irrelevant to the reasonableness of uzan nondisclosure.id.at.we find no abuse of discretion by the court exclusion of the evidence.first,evidence of industry practice of doses would only be pertinent if there was a finding that the comparisons were used to address obviousness,and not anticipation,because aventis has conceded that comparisons must be at the same dose to show compositional differences.here,however,the district court found,and we have affirmed,that the comparisons were at least in part intended to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection.
furthermore,the district court,after examining all of the evidence,found it simply incredible that uzan selected the clinically relevant doses for his comparisons.in particular,the court noted that neither the claims nor the specification were limited to prevention of dvt in surgical patients and that the patented composition could be used at several different doses for several different indications that there was not nearly as significant a difference,or no difference at all,in when any other dose,mg,mg,or mg of the patented compound was compared to the mg dose of ep and that there was no evidence corroborating uzan testimony that he selected the mg dose due to its efficacy in preventing dvt id.at.evidence of industry practice using clinically relevant doses would have no impact on the court credibility determination with respect to whether uzan intended the clinically relevant doses in this case.
therefore,we can not agree that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that comparison of at different doses to demonstrate a difference in property was routine practice in the lmwh field.
aventis advances several additional arguments focused on whether uzan really had deceptive intent.first,aventis argues that the court erred in not considering exculpatory testimony by uzan indicating that he believed that he informed the examiner that he was comparing at different doses when he stated,in the first uzan declaration t his represents an increase in in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages.this court already concluded in the prior appeal,that there is no genuine issue of material fact that uzan did not disclose in this statement that the comparison was made using data from different doses.aventis ii.at.we left open the possibility,however,that uzan may have intended by this statement to convey to the examiner that the comparisons were done at different doses.id.at.the district court heard uzan testimony and considered it along with all other evidence relevant to deceptive intent,yet determined that it did not outweigh the cumulative evidence evincing an intent to deceive.we can not find that the district court clearly erred in concluding that other evidence outweighed uzan testimony that he intended by this statement to inform the examiner that the comparisons were done at different doses.
next,aventis avers that uzan did not fail to disclose the dosage information for the patented compound to the examiner.in example,aventis urges,uzan provided data for the patented compound at mg as well as at mg and,in the second uzan declaration,he attached the raw data for the patented compound in table xi,which showed that the of the patented compound was less at a mg dose than at the mg dose that was used in the comparison with the ep compound.even if we acknowledge that data at other doses for the patented compound were provided to the examiner,the data were provided in a very misleading way.paragon podiatry,klm,inference of deceptive intent may arise from misleading character of affidavit accord goodrich aircraft braking.in example,data for the patented compound at the hour,which could be readily compared to the hour data for the ep compound,were only provided at the mg dose.in the first uzan declaration,reference was made only to the comparison at the hour,without reference to the dosage of the patented compound.moreover,uzan failed to disclose,in either example or the first uzan declaration,the dosage information for the ep compound.accordingly,we can not conclude that the district court finding that uzan failed to disclose the dosage information was clearly erroneous.
lastly,aventis contends that uzan failure to disclose the dosage information was purely due to inadvertence.in support,aventis relies on other evidence of inadvertent and benign mistakes made during prosecution of the patent application,suggesting that its omission of the dose of the ep compound was likewise inadvertent.for example,aventis points out that the first uzan declaration mistakenly stated that the claimed compound had of chains below a specified mw,whereas the remarks by aventis in its response stated of the chains.here,however,in contrast to any inadvertent omissions made during prosecution,there is sufficient evidence of concealment to warrant a determination that the dose information was intentionally withheld.the fact that aventis made other inadvertent errors during prosecution has no bearing on this material failure to disclose.therefore,we can not agree that the district court clearly erred by not concluding that uzan failure to disclose the dosage information was due to mere inadvertence.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court finding of inequitable conduct and holding of unenforceability of the and patents.
this court today affirms the unenforceability of a patent due to inequitable conduct.to my eyes,this record does not show clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive the united states patent and trademark office uspto.moreover,my reading of our case law restricts a finding of inequitable conduct to only the most extreme cases of fraud and deception.
without doubt,candor and truthful cooperation are essential to an ex parte examination system.with burgeoning application rates,the uspto must rely on applicant submissions to narrow the prior art search.and,of course,those submissions must be reliable.the threat of inequitable conduct,with its atomic bomb remedy of unenforceability,ensures that candor and truthfulness.
although designed to facilitate uspto examination,inequitable conduct has taken on a new life as a litigation tactic.the allegation of inequitable conduct opens new avenues of discovery impugns the integrity of patentee,its counsel,and the patent itself excludes the prosecuting attorney from trial participation other than as a witness and even offers the trial court a way to dispose of a case without the rigors of claim construction and other complex patent doctrines.this court has even observed a number of cases,such as this one,that arrive on appeal solely on the basis of inequitable conduct where the trial court has apparently elected to try this issue in advance of the issues of infringement and validity.see,frazier roessel cine photo tech,semiconductor energy lab.samsung elecs.
this phenomenon is not new or unprecedented.at an earlier time,the federal circuit also observed that inequitable conduct as a litigation strategy had become a plague.burlington indus.dayco.in response,this court took a case to reduce abuse of inequitable conduct.kingsdown med.consultants,hollister,en banc.
in light of the rejuvenation of the inequitable conduct tactic,this court ought to revisit occasionally its kingsdown opinion.kingsdown claimed a ostomy device.id.at.the examiner rejected claim as indefinite.id.at.in response,kingsdown amended claim.id.then,later in the prosecution,kingsdown copied the rejected claim,not the amended version,into a continuation application as new claim.id.at.the once rejected,now recopied claim matured into claim of patent.id.at.on the basis of this error that certainly called into question the integrity of the examination system,the district court found inequitable conduct.id.at.this court,en banc,reversed.id.at.
in kingsdown,this court clearly conveyed that the inequitable conduct was not a remedy for every mistake,blunder,or fault in the patent procurement process.even mistakes that struck at the heart and integrity of the repeatedly recopying and acquiring rights to a rejected not amount to inequitable conduct.instead this court required culpable conduct supported by clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive the uspto.halliburton schlumberger tech,citing consol.aluminum foseco int l.at the same time,it is hard to imagine a more material mistake than reasserting claims to rejected subject matter.materiality of any undisclosed or misleading information,of course,is the other prong of an inequitable conduct analysis.cargill,canbra foods.in sum,kingsdown properly made inequitable conduct a rare occurrence.
more recently,however,the judicial process has too often emphasized materiality almost to the exclusion of any analysis of the lofty intent requirement for inequitable conduct.merging intent and materiality at levels far below the kingsdown rule has revived the inequitable conduct tactic.for example,in nilssen osram sylvania,one of the reasons this court upheld a judgment of unenforceability for an exaggerated claim of small entity status.nilssen entered into agreements with philips electronics north america philips to license the patents in suit.id.at.because phillips had more than employees,the district court found that nilssen had made several improper small entity maintenance fee payments to the uspto.id.at.this court affirmed,stating w e therefore affirm the district court decision finding that all of the patents in suit are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct in improperly claiming small entity status.id.at.in general electro music samick music,this court upheld unenforceability under circumstances that are even harder to reconcile with the en banc kingsdown rule.the mistake in that case involved a petition to make special.id.at.
the applicant sought expedited examination of its application on the ground that the claimed invention was being infringed.id.at that time,such a request required an oath or declaration that the applicant made a careful and thorough search of the prior art.id.the applicant submitted that declaration,but later conceded that it actually had only conducted an informal search as opposed to a formal search.id.this process did not result in the issuance of rejected claims,but involved nothing more than an expedited examination.still this miscarriage rendered the entire patent unenforceable.id.at.
while the case at bar does not feature small entity status or expedited examination,the record still does not,in the context of kingsdown,show a clear and convincing intent to deceive.we are cognizant of the high standard of review.to overturn a discretionary ruling of a district court,the appellant must establish that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear error of judgment.kingsdown,at.while the standard of review is high,it is not insurmountable.where the district court made clear error of fact,this court must overturn such a determination.
in this case,uzan,associate director of biological research at aventis,assisted in the prosecution of the application that led to patent covering a low molecular weight heparin mixture invented by roger debrie debrie lmwh.specifically,uzan assembled data from various clinical studies comparing the of the debrie lmwh to a prior art lmwh invented by mardiguian mardiguian lmwh.uzan submitted this data,from the duchier study and the foquet study respectively,as example of the patent.in submitting the data,uzan did not draw attention to the different doses in those studies.
without question,uzan should have disclosed the dosage of the mardiguian lmwh in example subsection.unfortunately,the foquet study chart that uzan used did not show the dosage information.uzan neglected to add the information.to make it clear,uzan did not attempt to conceal data that were otherwise present.rather he just submitted the study without adding to the disclosure.this omission,even if negligent,is hardly kingsdown culpable intent to deceive.moreover this omission strikes less at the integrity of the system than issuance of a rejected claim,which kingsdown sanctioned.
likewise,uzan ought to have disclosed to the uspto that he compared the mg dose of the prior art mardiguian lmwh to the mg dose of the debrie lmwh in the declaration he submitted on march.uzan testified that the different dose did not come to his mind.in context,this explanation has merit.uzan was asked to compare the superior pharmacokinetic properties of the debrie lmwh over the mardiguian lmwh prior art compound.comparison of drug properties at their clinically relevant and different dosages is,of course,completely appropriate.again,this oversight may have been careless,but hardly culpable.to my eyes,uzan negligence does not rise to the level of intent to deceive,particularly in comparison with kingsdown.
even a cursory review of example shows no dosage indications.the debrie lmwh in subsection indicates two dosages.dosage is an element in subsections and as well.thus,the absence of a dosage in subsection is blatantly obvious.surely if uzan had intended to deceive the uspto,he would not have made this omission so conspicuous.moreover,i find it difficult to fathom that a scientist of uzan caliber and reputation would engage in such deception.as the district court points out,uzan has had a magnificent fifty year career with aventis,has published over scientific articles and has received numerous prestigious awards including the galien research prize,france highest award for drug discovery.this scientist would hardly risk his reputation and tarnish his brilliant career for a single example in the prosecution of a patent for an invention in which he was not even involved.
the inadvertence in this case presents another difficulty for a finding of intent to deceive.the omissions and prosecution errors were committed by two individuals,uzan and schulman,aventis prosecuting attorney.collective actions call into question any showing of intent for inequitable conduct.refers to the duty of candor and good faith possessed by e ach individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application.emphasis added.schulman did not know that the doses of the debrie lmwh and the mardiguian lmwh were different.uzan admitted that he inadvertently neglected to add that information to the graphs.the dosage information was not on the original foquet chart submitted to the aventis patent department and uzan neglected to add it.schulman had no way of knowing that the comparison was at two different doses and therefore the impropriety of using that data to demonstrate compositional difference.schulman arguments also carry the markings of a good faith mistake.
most important,uzan himself revealed the error.this candor is inconsistent with deceptive intent.he submitted all of the underlying data to the patent office with his second declaration on june.thus,unlike the situation in kingsdown,uzan corrected the mistake before it resulted in an issued patent.in uzan second declaration,he clearly articulated that the data showed superior properties of the debrie lmwh over the prior art mardiguian lmwh.still,with all information before the uspto,the examiner allowed the patent.lastly,in early,before filing its infringement suit,aventis filed a reissue application for the patent.the patent reissued on june,with all of the original independent claims,but without example.the data were apparently not even necessary for patentability.the uspto determined that the debrie lmwh was inventive over the prior art mardiguian lmwh without relying on the controversial data from example.
the uspto granted the reissue a day before the district court judge granted teva and amphastar summary judgment motion that the patent was unenforceable.aventis did not have the opportunity to make this argument to the trial judge.this record does not prevent this court,however,from considering all this information in evaluating the inequitable conduct finding.thus,both materiality and intent seem suspect on this record.in sum,read in the context of kingsdown,i would reverse the district court determination of inequitable conduct.
all responses by aventis were made by its outside counsel,robert schulman.
the examiner also reiterated thatthe patent and trademark office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various products,and where the prior art teaches a product which is identical or nearly identical to that claimed,it is incumbent upon the applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious property not demonstrated by the prior art products.emphases added.
upon filing a continuing application comprising was changed to consisting essentially of,which is how the claim read when it issued.
the examiner reiterated the statement,in a slightly modified form,thatthe patent and trademark office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various products,and where the prior art teaches a product which is nearly identical to that claimed,it is incumbent upon the applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious property not demonstrated by the prior art products.emphases added.
data for the patented compound were contained in tables i,x,and xi.data for the ep compound were contained in tables a and iii.
one day prior to issuance of the district court order,aventis surrendered the patent to the pto pursuant to reissue proceedings in the patent application.aventis pharma amphastar,d.in a subsequent order,the district court granted aventis motion to substitute the patent for the patent,and amended its earlier holding of unenforceability to apply also to the patent.id.at.in so holding,the district court relied on the principle articulated in roche lemmon,that a reissue proceeding can not rehabilitate a patent held to be unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.id.at.thus,contrary to the assertion by the dissent,op.at,the district court was fully awa
