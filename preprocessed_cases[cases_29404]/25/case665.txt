background 
daniel capon,arthur weiss,brian irving,margo roberts,and krisztina zsebo collectively capon and zelig eshhar,daniel schindler,tova waks,and gideon gross collectively eshhar were the parties to an interference proceeding between capon united states patent the patent entitled chimeric chains for signal transduction pathways and eshhar patent application serial the application entitled chimeric receptor genes and cells transformed therewith.capon patent the patent,parent of the patent,was also included in the interference but was held expired for of a maintenance fee.the pto included the patent in its decision and in its argument of this appeal 
a patent interference is an administrative proceeding pursuant to g and a,conducted for the purpose of determining which of competing applicants is the first inventor of common subject matter.an interference is instituted after the separate patent applications have been examined and found to contain patentable subject matter.capon patents had been examined and had issued before this interference was instituted,and eshhar application had been examined and allowed but a patent had not yet issued.
during an interference proceeding the board is authorized to determine not only priority of invention but also to redetermine patentability.b.the question of patentability of the claims of both parties was raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge during the preliminary proceedings.thereafter the board conducted an inter partes proceeding limited to this question,receiving evidence and argument.the board then invalidated all of the claims that had been designated as corresponding to the count of the interference,all of the claims of the capon patent,claims of the capon patent,and claims,and of the eshhar application.
in accordance with the administrative procedure act,the law as interpreted and applied by the agency receives plenary review on appeal,and the agency factual findings are reviewed to determine whether they were arbitrary,capricious,or unsupported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.see dickinson zurko,d in re gartside.
the invention 
a chimeric gene is an artificial gene that combines segments of dna in a way that does not occur in nature.the patent and application are directed to the production of chimeric genes designed to enhance the immune response by providing cells with specific antibodies in a form that can penetrate diseased sites,such as solid tumors,that were not previously reachable.the parties explain that their invention is a way of endowing immune cells with specificity,by combining known producing dna and known producing dna into a unitary gene that can express a unitary polypeptide chain.eshhar summarized the problem to which the invention is directed 
effector lymphocytes,such as t cells,are very rare,limited in their recognition spectrum and difficult to obtain against most malignancies.antibodies,on the other hand,are readily obtainable,more easily derived,have wider spectrum and are not.the major problem of applying specific antibodies for cancer immunotherapy lies in the inability of sufficient amounts of monoclonal antibodies mab to reach large areas within solid tumors.
technical paper explaining eshhar invention,at.
the inventions of capon and eshhar are the chimeric dna that encodes chimeric proteins for expression on the surface of cells of the immune system,plus expression vectors and cells transformed by the chimeric dna.the experts for both parties explain that the invention combines selected dna segments that are both endogenous and nonendogenous to a cell of the immune system,whereby the nonendogenous segment encodes the variable scfv domain of an antibody,and the endogenous segment encodes cytoplasmic,transmembrane,and extracellular domains of a lymphocyte signaling protein.they explain that the scfv domain combines the heavy and light variable fv domains of a natural antibody,and thus has the same specificity as a natural antibody.linking this single chain domain to a lymphocyte signaling protein creates a chimeric scfvr gene which,upon transfection into a cell of the immune system,combines the specificity of an antibody with the tissue penetration,cytokine production,and destruction capability of a lymphocyte.
the parties point to the therapeutic potential if tumors can be infiltrated with specifically designed immune cells of appropriate specificity.

the board decision 
the board presumed enablement by the specifications of the patent and application of the full scope of their claims,and based its decision solely on the ground of failure of written description.the board held that neither party specification provides the requisite description of the full scope of the chimeric dna or encoded proteins,by reference to knowledge in the art of the structure,formula,chemical name,or physical properties of the dna or the proteins.in the board words 
we are led by controlling precedent to understand that the full scope of novel chimeric dna the parties claim is not described in their specifications under,first paragraph,by reference to contemporary prior knowledge in the art of the structure,formula,chemical name,or physical properties of many protein domains,dna sequences which encode many protein domains,which comprise proteins dna constructs made in accordance with the plans,schemes,and examples thereof the parties disclose.
bd.op.at.as controlling precedent the board cited regents of the university of california eli lilly,fiers revel,amgen,chugai pharmaceutical,and enzo biochem.the board summarized its holding as follows 
here,both eshhar and capon claim novel genetic material described in terms of the functional characteristics of the protein it encodes.their specifications do not satisfy the written description requirement because persons having ordinary skill in the art would not have been able to visualize and recognize the identity of the claimed genetic material without considering additional knowledge in the art,performing additional experimentation,and testing to confirm results.
discussion 
eshhar and capon challenge both the board interpretation of precedent and the board ruling that their descriptions are inadequate.both parties explain that their chimeric genes are produced by selecting and combining known heavy and dna segments,using known procedures.the specifications of both parties describe procedures for identifying and obtaining the desired dna segments and linking them into the desired chimeric genes.both parties point to their specific examples of chimeric dna prepared using identified known procedures,along with citation to the scientific literature as to every step of the preparative method.
the parties presented expert witnesses who placed the invention in the context of prior knowledge and explained how the descriptive text would be understood by persons of skill in the field of the invention.the witnesses explained that the principle of forming chimeric genes from selected segments of dna was known,as well as their methods of identifying,selecting,and combining the desired segments of dna.eshhar presented an expert statement wherein he explained that the prior art contains extensive knowledge of the nucleotide structure of the various segments of dna he stated that over mouse antibody dna light chains and mouse antibody dna heavy chains were known and published as early as.similarly capon expert desiderio discussed the prior art,also citing scientific literature 
the linker sequences disclosed in the patent,lines and used to artificially join a heavy and light chain nucleic acid sequence and permit functional association of the two ligand binding regions were published by,as were the methods for obtaining the mature sequences of the desired heavy and light chains for constructing a sab exhibit,batra et,biol,exhibit,bird et,science,exhibit,huston et,pnas,exhibit,chaudhary,pnas,exhibit,morrison et,science,exhibit,sharon et,nature.
desiderio declaration at.
both parties stated that persons experienced in this field would readily know the structure of a chimeric gene made of a first segment of dna encoding the variable region of an antibody,and a second segment of dna encoding an endogenous protein.they testified that to confirm these structures would not be needed in order to know the dna structure of the chimeric gene,and that the board requirement that the specification must reproduce the structure,formula,chemical name,or physical properties of these dna combinations had been overtaken by the state of the science.they stated that where the structure and properties of the dna components were known,reanalysis was not required.
eshhar specification contains the nucleotide sequences of sixteen different receptor primers and four different scfv primers from which chimeric genes encoding scfvr may be obtained,while capon specification cites literature sources of such information.eshhar specification shows the production of chimeric genes encoding scfvr using primers,as listed in eshhar table capon stated that natural genes are isolated and joined using conventional methods,such as the polymerase chain reaction or cloning by primer repair.capon,like eshhar,discussed various known procedures for identifying,obtaining,and linking dna segments,accompanied by experimental examples.the board did not dispute that persons in this field of science could determine the structure or formula of the linked dna from the known structure or formula of the components.
the board stated that controlling precedent required inclusion in the specification of the complete nucleotide sequence of at least one chimeric gene.bd.op.at.the board also objected that the claims were broader than the specific examples.eshhar and capon each responds by pointing to the scientific completeness and depth of their descriptive texts,as well as to their illustrative examples.the board did not relate any of the claims,broad or narrow,to the examples,but invalidated all of the claims without analysis of their scope and the relation of claim scope to the details of the specifications.
eshhar and capon both argue that they have set forth an invention whose scope is fully and fairly described,for the nucleotide sequences of the dna in chimeric combination is readily understood to contain the nucleotide sequences of the dna components.eshhar points to the general and specific description in his specification of known dna segments,including the examples of their linking.capon points similarly to his description of selecting dna segments that are known to express proteins,and stresses the existing knowledge of these segments and their nucleotide sequences,as well as the known procedures for selecting and combining dna segments,as cited in the specification.
both parties argue that the board misconstrued precedent,and that precedent does not establish a per se rule requiring when the structure of the component dna segments is already known,or readily determined by known procedures.
the statutory requirement 
the required content of the patent specification is set forth in section of title 
the specification shall contain a written description of the invention,and of the manner and process of making and using it,in such full,clear,concise,and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,or with which it is most nearly connected,to make and use the same,and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.
the written description requirement implements the principle that a patent must describe the technology that is sought to be patented the requirement serves both to satisfy the inventor obligation to disclose the technologic knowledge upon which the patent is based,and to demonstrate that the patentee was in possession of the invention that is claimed.see enzo biochem,at the written description requirement is the quid pro quo of the patent system the public must receive meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded from practicing the invention for a limited period of time reiffin microsoft,the purpose of the written description requirement is to ensure that the scope of the right to exclude does not overreach the scope of the inventor contribution to the field of art as described in the patent specification in re barker,ccpa the goal of the written description requirement is to clearly convey the information that an applicant has invented the subject matter which is claimed.the written description requirement thus satisfies the policy premises of the law,whereby the inventor advance is added to the body of knowledge,as consideration for the grant of patent exclusivity.
the descriptive text needed to meet these requirements varies with the nature and scope of the invention at issue,and with the scientific and technologic knowledge already in existence.the law must be applied to each invention that enters the patent process,for each patented advance is novel in relation to the state of the science.since the law is applied to each invention in view of the state of relevant knowledge,its application will vary with differences in the state of knowledge in the field and differences in the predictability of the science.
for the chimeric genes of the capon and eshhar inventions,the law must take cognizance of the scientific facts.the board erred in refusing to consider the state of the scientific knowledge,as explained by both parties,and in declining to consider the separate scope of each of the claims.none of the cases to which the board attributes the requirement of total dna,regents lilly,fiers revel,amgen,or enzo biochem,require a of what was already known.in lilly,at,the cdna for human insulin had never been characterized.similarly in fiers,at,much of the dna sought to be claimed was of unknown structure,whereby this court viewed the breadth of the claims as embracing a wish or research plan.in amgen,at,the court explained that a novel gene was not adequately characterized by its biological function alone because such a description would represent a mere wish to know the identity of the novel material.in enzo biochem,at,this court reaffirmed that deposit of a physical sample may replace words when description is beyond present scientific capability.in amgen hoechst marion roussel,the court explained further that the written description requirement may be satisfied if in the knowledge of the art the disclosed function is sufficiently correlated to a particular,known structure.these evolving principles were applied in noelle lederman,where the court affirmed that the human antibody there at issue was not adequately described by the structure and function of the mouse antigen and in university of rochester searle,where the court affirmed that the description of the enzyme did not serve to describe unknown compounds capable of selectively inhibiting the enzyme.
the written description requirement must be applied in the context of the particular invention and the state of the knowledge.the board rule that the nucleotide sequences of the chimeric genes must be fully presented,although the nucleotide sequences of the component dna are known,is an inappropriate generalization.when the prior art includes the nucleotide information,precedent does not set a per se rule that the information must be determined afresh.both parties state that a person experienced in the field of this invention would know that these known dna segments would retain their dna sequences when linked by known methods.both parties explain that their invention is not in discovering which dna segments are related to the immune response,for that is in the prior art,but in the novel combination of the dna segments to achieve a novel result.
the written description requirement states that the patentee must describe the invention it does not state that every invention must be described in the same way.as each field evolves,the balance also evolves between what is known and what is added by each inventive contribution.both eshhar and capon explain that this invention does not concern the discovery of gene function or structure,as in lilly.the chimeric genes here at issue are prepared from known dna sequences of known function.the board requirement that these sequences must be analyzed and reported in the specification does not add descriptive substance.the board erred in holding that the specifications do not meet the written description requirement because they do not reiterate the structure or formula or chemical name for the nucleotide sequences of the claimed chimeric genes.
claim scope 
there remains the question of whether the specifications adequately support the breadth of all of the claims that are presented.the director argues that it can not be known whether all of the permutations and combinations covered by the claims will be effective for the intended purpose,and that the claims are too broad because they may include inoperative species.the inventors say that they have provided an adequate description and exemplification of their invention as would be understood by persons in the field of the invention.they state that biological properties typically vary,and that their specifications provide for evaluation of the effectiveness of their chimeric combinations.
it is well recognized that in the unpredictable fields of science,it is appropriate to recognize the variability in the science in determining the scope of the coverage to which the inventor is entitled.such a decision usually focuses on the exemplification in the specification.see,enzo biochem,at remanding for district court to determine w hether the disclosure provided by the three deposits in this case,coupled with the skill of the art,describes the genera of claims and lilly,at genus not described where a representative number of cdnas,defined by nucleotide sequence,falling within the scope of the genus had not been provided in re gosteli,two chemical compounds were insufficient description of subgenus in re smith,disclosure of genus and one species was not sufficient description of intermediate subgenus in re grimme,disclosure of single example and statement of scope sufficient disclosure of subgenus.
precedent illustrates that the determination of what is needed to support generic claims to biological subject matter depends on a variety of factors,such as the existing knowledge in the particular field,the extent and content of the prior art,the maturity of the science or technology,the predictability of the aspect at issue,and other considerations appropriate to the subject matter.see,in re wallach,an amino acid sequence supports the entire genus of dna sequences that can encode the amino acid sequence because the state of the art has developed such that it is a routine matter to convert one to the other university of rochester,at considering whether the patent disclosed the compounds necessary to practice the claimed method,given the state of technology singh brake,affirming adequacy of disclosure by distinguishing precedent in which the selection of a particular species within the claimed genus had involved highly unpredictable results.
it is not necessary that every permutation within a generally operable invention be effective in order for an inventor to obtain a generic claim,provided that the effect is sufficiently demonstrated to characterize a generic invention.see in re angstadt,ccpa the examples,both operative and inoperative,are the best guidance this art permits,as far as we can conclude from the record.while the board is correct that a generic invention requires adequate support,the sufficiency of the support must be determined in the particular case.both eshhar and capon present not only general teachings of how to select and recombine the dna,but also specific examples of the production of specified chimeric genes.for example,eshhar points out that in example of his specification the fcrγ chain was used,which chain was amplified from a human cdna clone,using the procedure of kuster,et,biol,which is cited in the specification and reports the complete sequence of the fcrγ chain.eshhar example also explains the source of the genes that provide the heavy and light chains of the single chain antibody,citing the phd thesis of gideon gross,a,which cites a reference providing the complete sequence of the light chain gene used to construct the antibody.eshhar states that the structure of the heavy chain antibody was well known to those of skill in the art and readily accessible on the internet in a database as entry embl.example at page of the eshhar specification cites ravetch et,exp,for the method of producing the dna clone that was pcr amplified this reference published the complete dna sequence of the chain,as discussed in paragraph of the eshhar declaration.example of the eshhar specification uses the dna of the monoclonal antibody and states that the hybridoma that produces this antibody was deposited with the collection nationale de cultures de microorganismes,institut pasteur,paris,on august,under deposit no.cncm.it is incorrect to criticize the methods,examples,and referenced prior art of the eshhar specification as but a few pcr primers and probes,as does the director brief.
capon example provides a detailed description of the creation and expression of single chain antibody fused with receptor zeta chain,referring to published vectors and procedures.capon,like eshhar,describes gene segments and their ligation to form chimeric genes.although capon includes fewer specific examples in his specification than does eshhar,both parties used standard systems of description and identification,as well as known procedures for selecting,isolating,and linking known dna segments.indeed,the board repeated observation that the full scope of all of the claims appears to be enabled can not be reconciled with the board objection that only a general plan to combine unidentified dna is presented.see in re wands,experimentation to practice invention must not be undue for invention to be considered enabled.
the pto points out that for biochemical processes relating to gene modification,protein expression,and immune response,success is not assured.however,generic inventions are not thereby invalid.precedent distinguishes among generic inventions that are adequately supported,those that are merely a wish or plan,the words of fiers revel,at,and those in between,as illustrated by noelle lederman,at the facts of the specific case must be evaluated.the board did not discuss the generic concept that both capon and eshhar concept of selecting and combining a gene sequence encoding the variable domain of an antibody and a sequence encoding a lymphocyte activation protein,into a single dna sequence which,upon expression,allows for immune responses that do not occur in nature.the record does not show this concept to be in the prior art,and includes experimental verification as well as potential variability in the concept.
whether the inventors demonstrated sufficient generality to support the scope of some or all of their claims,must be determined claim by claim.the board did not discuss the evidence with respect to the generality of the invention and the significance of the specific examples,instead simply rejecting all the claims for lack of a complete chimeric dna sequence.as we have discussed,that reasoning is inapt for this case.the board position that the patents at issue were merely an invitation to experiment did not distinguish among the parties broad and narrow claims,and further concerns enablement more than written description.see adang fischhoff,enablement involves assessment of whether one of skill in the art could make and use the invention without undue experimentation in re wright,same.although the legal criteria of enablement and written description are related and are often met by the same disclosure,they serve discrete legal requirements.
the predictability or unpredictability of the science is relevant to deciding how much experimental support is required to adequately describe the scope of an invention.our predecessor court summarized in in re storrs,that i t must be borne in mind that,while it is necessary that an applicant for a patent give to the public a complete and adequate disclosure in return for the patent grant,the certainty required of the disclosure is not greater than that which is reasonable,having due regard to the subject matter involved.this aspect may warrant exploration on remand.
in summary,the board erred in ruling that imposes a per se rule requiring recitation in the specification of the nucleotide sequence of claimed dna,when that sequence is already known in the field.however,the board did not explore the support for each of the claims of both parties,in view of the specific examples and general teachings in the specifications and the known science,with application of precedent guiding review of the scope of claims.
we remand for appropriate further proceedings.
vacated and remanded
