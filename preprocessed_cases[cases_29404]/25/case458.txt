danisco danisco appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the northern district of california dismissing danisco declaratory judgment action against novozymes and novozymes north america,collectively novozymes for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see danisco novozymes,wl,unpublished.because we conclude that the totality of the circumstances establishes a justiciable controversy,we reverse and remand.
background 
danisco and novozymes compete to develop and supply rapid starch liquefaction rsl products,which are genetically modified industrial enzymes used for converting corn and other material into ethanol.danisco and novozymes have patents that claim enzymes,which have been genetically engineered through substitution of amino acids in the peptide sequence in order to improve their performance in the liquefaction process.
since about,novozymes has sued danisco or danisco predecessors in interest for infringement numerous times.in one instance,novozymes amended an application then pending at the united states patent and trademark office pto to claim one of danisco new products and then sued danisco in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin on the same day that the patent issued.the wisconsin court invalidated novozymes patent because the newly added claim was not supported by the written description,and we affirmed.novozymes dupont nutrition biosciences aps.
danisco owns patent the patent,issued december,and claiming the benefit of priority from a provisional application filed june.the patent claims a truncated geobacillus stearothermophilus bsg variant polypeptide with a substitution from glutamic acid e to proline p at sequence position,a substitution,that exhibits increased viscosity reduction in a starch liquefaction assay compared to the parental polypeptide.patent.the claimed enzyme is the active ingredient in danisco rsl products.
shortly after the pto issued a notice of allowance of the application that matured into danisco patent,novozymes again amended one of its own patent applications to claim a bsg variant polypeptide with an substitution,and subsequently requested an interference contesting entitlement to priority of the invention.specifically,novozymes asserted that its amended claim encompassed the same invention as danisco claim because both claims i are directed to an isolated bsg variant,ii specify sequence identity to the parental enzyme,and iii require the same substitution.id.at.in other words,novozymes contended that its amended claim covered the same invention as danisco patent,namely a bsg variant with an mutation,which is the active ingredient in danisco rsl products.the pto examiner rejected novozymes interference request on the ground that the truncated bsg variant in danisco claim did not meet the specific sequence identity limitations of novozymes amended claim.id.at.
after danisco patent issued,novozymes filed a request for continued examination,challenging the examiner conclusions and again arguing for priority over what it described as danisco interfering patent.id.at.novozymes maintained that danisco patent covered the same subject matter as novozymes amended claim and,in effect,once more represented that its amended claim read on the active ingredient in danisco rsl products.id.novozymes asserted that the examiner had mistakenly concluded that danisco patent directed to a bsg mutation d id not fall within the scope of novozymes application.id.the examiner rejected novozymes request.id.at.
although under no regulatory obligation to do so,novozymes then submitted public comments to the pto in order to clarify for the record its belief that the variant claimed by danisco patent fall s within the scope of its own claim,which later issued to novozymes as the sole claim of patent the patent on august,claiming the benefit of priority from a provisional application filed june.id.at.novozymes further commented that it refused to acquiesce to or otherwise be estopped by what it deemed to be the examiner erroneous and overly narrow view of novozymes claim scope,which consequently did not allow novozymes to invalidate danisco patent or to claim priority over the ownership of the bsg variant invention.id.
upon issuance of novozymes patent,danisco filed concurrent actions in the united states district courts for both the northern district of iowa and the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgments that its rsl products did not infringe novozymes patent count and that the patent was invalid count,or alternatively that danisco patent had priority over novozymes patent pursuant to count.following the parties stipulated dismissal of the iowa action in favor of the california action,novozymes moved to dismiss danisco complaint for lack of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim under rule b.
the district court granted novozymes motion and dismissed danisco declaratory judgment claims,holding as a matter of law that the facts as alleged did not create a justiciable article iii case or controversy as to counts and.danisco,wl,at.the court acknowledged that novozymes patent presented a substantial risk to danisco,but found that a justiciable controversy did not exist because danisco had challenged novozymes patent on the day that it issued,and thus that danisco action was filed prior to the time novozymes took,or even could have taken,any affirmative action to enforce its patent rights.id.at.the court stated that w hile matters such as a prior litigation history and statements made during prosecutions sometimes support a conclusion that an actual controversy exists,there is no precedent for finding jurisdiction based on such issuance events alone id.at emphasis in original.the court determined that danisco was missing an affirmative act of enforcement or some implied or express enforcement threat by novozymes because conduct could not satisfy that requirement.id.at.
in a footnote,the district court also summarily dismissed danisco claim,concluding that danisco third count requesting a determination of priority of invention was not ripe because it could not stand alone in the absence of the primary noninfringement and invalidity declaratory judgment claims.id.at.
danisco timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.a.
discussion 
a district court decision to dismiss a declaratory judgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review without deference.teva pharm.usa,novartis pharm,sandisk stmicroelectronics.we review the district court underlying factual findings for clear error.id.
the declaratory judgment act provides that,i n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.a.the phrase case of actual controversy refers to the type of cases and controversies that are justiciable under article iii.sony,guardian media,quoting medimmune,genentech.the burden is on the party claiming declaratory judgment jurisdiction,here danisco,to establish that an article iii case or controversy existed at the time that the claim for declaratory relief was filed and that it has continued since.benitec,nucleonics,citing steffel thompson.
danisco argues that the standard required for establishing article iii jurisdiction is satisfied by the facts of its case and that the district court therefore erred in dismissing danisco complaint for declaratory judgment because there is a substantial controversy implicating adverse legal interests in a manner that is sufficiently definite and concrete to be capable of conclusive judicial resolution.
novozymes responds that article iii is not satisfied because danisco declaratory judgment claims are based on nothing more than speculation and a subjective fear of novozymes purported enforcement of its patent rights and not on any real and immediate injury or threat of future injury caused by novozymes.novozymes asserts that
