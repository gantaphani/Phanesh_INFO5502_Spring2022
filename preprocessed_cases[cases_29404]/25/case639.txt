plaintiff,pharmaceutical,ortho,appeals the district court grant of defendant,caraco pharmaceutical laboratories,ltd.caraco,motion for summary judgment of of claim of patent the patent.see pharm.caraco pharm,wl,district court opinion.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.the patent and caraco abbreviated new drug application 
the patent has fifteen claims directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising certain weight ratios of two known drugs,tramadol and acetaminophen.patent,to.both of these drugs act as pain relievers,analgesics.the patent discloses that where these components are in certain ratios the pharmacological effects of the compositions are superadditive or synergistic.id.abstract.more specifically,the description of the invention reads 
the acetaminophen and the tramadol material are generally present in a weight ratio of tramadol material to acetaminophen from about to.certain ratios result in a composition which exhibits synergistic analgesic effects.for example,in a composition comprising a tramadol material and acetaminophen,the ratio of the tramadol material acetaminophen is preferably from about to and,more preferably,from about to.
the most preferred ratios are from about to.compositions of a tramadol material and acetaminophen within these weight ratios have been shown to exhibit synergistic analgesic effects.in addition,the particular compositions wherein the ratio of the components are sic about and about are encompassed by the present invention.
figure and table of the patent report measured values,termed values,that show the amount by weight of a combined dose of tramadol and acetaminophen needed to provide pain relief in of the test subjects,in this case male mice.id.describing the experimental design and the compilation of the data in figure and table id.id.table.the patent discloses that there are confidence intervals around the values.id.
caraco abbreviated new drug application anda,as amended on or about july,evidences caraco intent to make and sell a pharmaceutical composition containing tramadol and acetaminophen with an average weight ratio of tramadol to acetaminophen of.caraco anda also expressly requires caraco formulation to have a weight ratio of no less than in response to caraco anda,ortho alleged that caraco infringed claim of the patent.
the only claim at issue is claim,a dependent claim,which,when read in conjunction with the two claims upon which it depends,states a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tramadol material and acetaminophen,wherein the ratio of the tramadol material to acetaminophen is a weight ratio of about.id.as will be seen,the only claim construction dispute between the parties is the meaning of the phrase about.the term about is used in all of the claims of the patent to modify the weight ratios claimed therein.id.to.
proceedings in the district court 
after ortho sued caraco for infringement of claim,in due course,caraco moved for summary judgment of.the only issue before the district court on summary judgment was infringement because the parties had stipulated to be bound by the outcome of pharmaceutical,kali laboratories,and pharmaceutical,teva pharmaceutical industries,on all issues relating to validity and enforceability a major point of contention between the parties was the proper construction of the term about.caraco argued that the proper construction is approximately,subject perhaps to minor measuring errors of,say,or.ortho argued that the proper construction is approximately,and encompasses a range of ratios of at least to.
under either claim construction,caraco argued its product did not literally infringe.with respect to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,caraco argued that the doctrine should not apply to broaden the scope of the about limitation beyond the range of ratios suggested by the confidence intervals in the patent because to do so would,alternatively,improperly expand a narrow claim limitation,improperly eliminate the claim limitation,or improperly encompass the prior art disclosed in patent to flick,et the flick patent.at argument in the district court,caraco also stated that prosecution history estoppel should apply because,during reissue proceedings relating to the patent,ortho narrowed the about limitation to something very close to when ortho described the limitation and clearly distinguished it from the limitation disclosed in the flick patent.
ortho argued that,under its construction,there were issues of fact as to literal infringement.in addition,ortho contended that its experts would opine that,under the test,caraco product with a tramadol to acetaminophen average weight ratio of was indistinguishable from that with a ratio of.ortho averred that this court precedent precluded a finding that any limitation on the doctrine of equivalents was applicable.
the district court construed the about limitation of claim to mean approximately,encompassing a range of ratios no greater than to.district court opinion at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied upon both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence.the intrinsic evidence upon which the district court relied included the claims and the specification.the extrinsic evidence upon which the court relied consisted,in part,of the opinions of ortho experts,donald stanski,and eric smith,who opined that one of ordinary skill in the art would conclude that the about limitation would include a range of ratios that would extend up to and include.id.at.the experts further opined that the lower end of the range of ratios that are statistically indistinguishable from the ratio is.id.citing stanski inf,smith inf.
the district court also considered evidence related to ortho application to reissue the patent,which was pending while proceedings involving the patent were ongoing in the district court in its january,application for reissue,ortho stated that it believe d the original patent to be wholly or partly inoperative or invalid by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than patentee had the right to claim in the patent.the application retained claim,rewritten in independent form canceled claims through,and claims through and added claims through.the new claims are written in a more narrow form than the original claims,using the phrase comprising an active ingredient that consists essentially of,instead of the broader comprising language of the patent.to illustrate,new claim of the reissue patent reads a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active ingredient that consists essentially of tramadol and acetaminophen,wherein the ratio of tramadol to acetaminophen is a weight ratio from about to about.other than the more limiting language just noted,like the other cancelled claims,this claim is identical to claim of the patent.see patent.
during the reissue proceedings,upon rejection by the examiner of all of the claims under b as anticipated by a disclosure of a composition at column of the flick patent,ortho distinguished the about limitation of claim.specifically,ortho stated 
although the text appearing at column,lines of the flick patent does refer to tablets,such tablets are said to have a tramadol to acetaminophen ratio of,which differs from the ratios recited,respectively,in claims,and about,claim about,and claims about to about.
as noted above,during this appeal,on august,the patent reissued as reissued patent no.e the reissue patent.the claim at issue in this case,claim,issued as written in the reissue application.
under its construction,the district court concluded that caraco product did not literally infringe the patent.district court opinion at.in addition,the district court decided that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.relying on the doctrine of claim vitiation,see freedman seating am.seating,the court concluded that finding infringement by caraco formulation with an average weight ratio of would render meaningless the about limitation.district court opinion at.the court thus rejected ortho claim of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.in asserting infringement under the doctrine o
