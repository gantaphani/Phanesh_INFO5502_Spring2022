medichem,medichem,appeals the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a bench trial that there was no under between the claimed inventions of patent the patent belonging to medichem and the patent belonging to rolabo,rolabo.medichem,rolabo,may,district court opinion.rolabo the district court conclusion that this was not an exceptional case under and its denial of rolabo request for attorney fees.because we find the district court erred in its application of the test,we vacate its priority determination,reverse its conclusion that the patent was neither anticipated nor obvious in light of the patent,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.as further proceedings are necessary,any resolution of rolabo request for attorney fees under is at this time premature.
background 
a.the patents 
medichem is a manufacturer of pharmaceutical ingredients.the company is the assignee of the patent,entitled process for the preparation of loratadine.loratadine is an antihistamine that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the popular allergy medication claritin.rolabo is also a manufacturer of pharmaceutical ingredients based in barcelona,spain,and is the assignee of the patent,entitled process for the preparation of a,d and derivatives thereof,which,like the patent,is a process for the preparation of loratadine.
claims and of the patent claim read 
a process for the preparation of loratadine consisting of reacting,in an organic solvent and in the presence of a tertiary amine,dihyrobenzo cyclohepta,of formula vii with a titanium species.
the process of claim,wherein the titanium species are generated by reduction of titanium tetrachloride with zinc dust.
patent,to.claims and of the patent read 
a process for preparing a,d comprising reacting a dibenzosuberone or an aza derivative thereof with an aliphatic ketone in the presence of titanium wherein said titanium is generated by zinc.
a process as claimed in claim for preparing loratadine.
patent,ll,ll.emphasis added.both the and the patents involve chemical reactions generally known in the art as mcmurry reactions,after professor john mcmurry,who described the intermolecular coupling between the different carbonyl groups in a compound using titanium in a publication.
proceedings to date 
district court proceedings 
medichem filed a complaint under against rolabo in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on april.section,entitled interfering patents,provides a cause of action to one patent owner against another patent owner where the inventions claimed by their respective patents interfere with one another.addressing priority first,the district court found that the evidence submitted by medichem supported an invention date in the fall of for the patent.since rolabo did not allege an invention date prior to the fall of,the district court awarded priority to medichem.
the district court turned next to the issue of between the and patents,and announced that it was applying the test for identifying an interference provided in the patent and trademark organization pto regulation,n.under the test,the district court first treated the patent as prior art,identifying the key question as whether the inclusion of tertiary amine in medichem patent claims is material in a way that negates obviousness and makes the patents noninterfering.because of the presence of a tertiary amine throughout the patent claims and examples,the district court found that a tertiary amine would appear to a reader of the patent as a necessary component of medichem process.absent the tertiary amine,the district court explained,it would not be obvious that the same result could be achieved.therefore,the absence of a tertiary amine requirement in the patent strongly suggest ed that the two processes were materially different.
continuing its analysis under the interference inquiry,the district court assessed whether one of ordinary skill in the art would find the elimination of a tertiary amine obvious or anticipated in light of the patent and the prior art in,the invention date of the patent.the district court accepted each of the parties expert witnesses,five in all,as representative of the ordinary skill in the relevant art of synthetic organic chemistry.all witnesses were not,however,determined by the district court to be equally credible in their testimony.ultimately,the district court relied entirely on the testimony of rolabo third expert,leckta.
leckta confirmed the district court belief that,while a person of skill in the art in would have understood the role of the tertiary amine in medichem process,the result if the tertiary amine were omitted would not have been obvious.the tertiary amine,leckta noted,was significant in aiding medichem process for creating loratadine,but also had drawbacks in the form of longer reaction times,lower yields,and additional workup time.based on its conclusion that the removal of the tertiary amine would not be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art in,the district court found that one leg of the test,treating the patent as prior art required by the pto test for interferences under section n was not satisfied and,as a result,there could be no.the district court did not reach the second leg of the test.medichem timely appealed the district court finding of no interference and rolabo the district court denial of attorney fees under.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
interim pto proceedings 
on december,during the interim period between the district court resolution of the case and the date on which rolabo filed its brief in this court,the board of patent appeals and interferences board declared an between claim of the patent and claim of the patent.stampa jackson,wl.lexis bd.int.the board proceedings occurred under the parallel interference procedures of a,which govern interferences between an application for a patent and another pending application or unexpired patent.these requirements were met in this instance because,on september,stampa,one of the listed inventors on the patent,had filed reissue application the reissue for the patent.a reissue application qualifies as an application under a.
the board began by concluding that a proceeding did not preclude the director of the pto from declaring an interference under a due to the difference in statutory requirements.stampa,wl,at.lexis at see also masco united states,issue preclusion is appropriate only when the issue is identical to one decided in the first action the issue was actually litigated in the first action resolution of the issue was essential to a final judgment in the first action and plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action.the board,like the district court,applied the test described by n to identify the existence of an between the reissue application and the patent.unlike the district court,however,the board found that the term comprising in the transition of claim of the patent permitted the inclusion of additional elements,including tertiary amines.because tertiary amines were not excluded from the patent,claim was anticipated by claim of the patent.applying the second leg of the the patent as prior the board found that the use of tertiary amines to carry out mcmurry reactions was well known in the art.therefore,the board concluded,the second leg of the test was also satisfied,resulting in an.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court has only indirectly addressed the standard used in reviewing a district court conclusions regarding interference under.see advance transformer levinson,upholding a district court determination of no interference where that conclusion was not shown to be clearly erroneous.by pto regulation,however,the underlying questions to the inquiry are those of anticipation and obviousness under.see j an exists when at least one claim of a party that is designated to correspond to a count and at least one claim of an opponent that is designated to correspond to the count define the same patentable invention.emphasis added n invention a is the same patentable i
