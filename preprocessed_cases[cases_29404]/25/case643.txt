acell,acell,stephen badylak,and alan spievack appeal the decision of the united states district court for the northern district of indiana denying acell motions pertaining to claim construction,infringement,and the adequacy of the jury verdict form following the jury finding that acell commercial product,acell vet tm,infringed patent the patent owned by purdue research foundation and that badylak and spievack willfully induced acell to infringe.cook biotech acell,as,wl,order,cook biotech and purdue research foundation respectively,cook and prf collectively,appellees or,the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to inventorship and the district court denial of their motions pertaining to willful infringement and whether any relief should have been awarded following the jury finding of infringement.because the district court erred in its claim construction which formed the basis for the jury finding of infringement and because,under the correct construction,there is no material factual dispute that the acell vet tm product can not infringe claims,and of the patent literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,the judgment of infringement is reversed.as a result,the issues raised in cook pertaining to its willful infringement case and its requests for relief following the jury verdict in its favor are rendered moot.finally,because the district court did not err in determining on summary judgment that badylak is not a of patent the patent,spievack is an inventor of the patent,and prf unjust enrichment claim must fail,we affirm the district court rulings with respect to those issues as raised in prf.
background 
factual.badylak activities and the patent 
badylak was employed by purdue university from until october.in the,badylak and others in his laboratory at purdue university discovered that certain tissue compositions could be used as scaffolds for tissue reconstruction.as advancements were made using these tissue compositions,now known as extracellular matrices or ecms,the tissues came to be categorized according to the source of the tissue,small intestinal submucosa sis,stomach submucosa,liver basement membrane,urinary bladder submucosa ubs,and urinary bladder matrix ubm.the two organ tissue sources relevant to this case are ubs and ubm.
the patent,entitled urinary bladder submucosa derived tissue graft,issued on september.the patent is directed to a urinary bladder submucosa derived tissue graft composition comprising bladder submucosal tissue delaminated from the abluminal muscle layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of the urinary bladder tissue,patent,ll,that can be implanted to replace or support damaged or diseased tissues.claim of the patent is representative of the claims at issue 
a composition comprising urinary bladder submucosa delaminated from both the abluminal muscle layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of a segment of a urinary bladder of a warm blooded vertebrate.
patent,ll.emphasis added.
the patent names four inventors,one of whom is badylak.pursuant to his employment contract,badylak assigned the patent and the rights to other patents on inventions he had developed to prf.on february,prf granted cook an exclusive license with respect to many of its patents in this field of tissue engineering,including the patent for all and applications.
spievack,the patent,and acell 
spievack,a harvard university professor and surgeon,developed an interest in the regenerative capabilities of the epithelial basement membrane during his studies as a fulbright scholar in the.in early,spievack first met badylak at a conference during a presentation given by badylak pertaining to sis.
according to spievack,in march,he tested techniques for removing various tissue layers of the bladder wall and in july of that year,he successfully treated poison ivy on one of his legs with a bladder basement membrane composition.spievack testified that between february and october,he did not discuss the results of his basement membrane tests with badylak,but from the end of through the end of,he visited badylak at purdue university and discussed his work on graft compositions.
beginning in,spievack sought to obtain a license from prf for products.when prf ultimately turned him down,spievack continued to work on what he considers to be his own ubm technology.in,spievack formed acell,to research and develop extracellular matrix technology.on december of that year,spievack filed a provisional application on a ubm composition,which led to the issuance of two patents naming him as the sole inventor,the patent and patent the patent.the term ubm first appeared in the patent,which issued on june.ubm refers to a matrix of tissues including the basement membrane and tunica propria of the urinary bladder of a mammal.the patent discloses and claims,inter alia,a tissue graft composition including the epithelial basement membrane.
on august,while the patent was still pending,prf asked the united states patent and trademark office the pto to declare an interference pursuant to a.in its petition,prf asserted that four other individuals,including badylak,were with spievack of the invention claimed in the patent 
the accused product,acell vet tm,is sold by acell in three forms hydrated,lyophilized,and powdered.since the issuance of the patent,acell has represented that its product includes the epithelial basement membrane as disclosed and claimed in the patent.
procedural history 
appellees infringement case 
cook and prf sued acell for,inter alia,patent infringement of claims,and of the patent,correction of inventorship for a number of issued patents collectively,the disputed patents,and common law unjust enrichment for the research and inventions disclosed in the disputed patents.on september,appellees moved for a preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin the sale of acell vet tm.the district court denied the motion based on the record before it,preliminarily finding that claim of the patent does not extend beyond an essentially submucosa composition,and emphasized that its findings were based on a preliminary record and were not intended to be a markman ruling on claim construction.cook biotech acell,as,slip op.at.
after conducting a markman hearing,during which the district court solicited the parties proposed constructions in the form of jury instructions,the district court adopted appellees proposed instructions.see cook biotech acell,as,markman order.of particular relevance,the district court rejected acell proposed construction for urinary bladder submucosa and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa and adopted appellees proposed construction of the phrase at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa.the district court rejected acell proposed construction of urinary bladder submucosa because it believed that the invention disclosed in the patent was broad enough to include compositions that contained tissues other than submucosa,slip op.at.further,because the district court believed that acell proposed construction of urinary bladder submucosa would rewrite the claims,change an open transition,comprising,into a closed transition,consisting essentially of,it was unwilling to accept that construction.the district court was also convinced by the evidence presented at the hearing and the ordinary meaning of the tunica mucosa that the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa refers only to the epithelial cells,slip op.at.
on june,the district court considered a motion by appellees seeking summary judgment of patent infringement or,in the alternative,partial summary judgment that the only issue remaining for the jury with respect to whether acell infringes claims,and of the patent is whether acell product contains submucosa.based on the submissions of the parties,the district court granted appellees alternative motion for partial summary judgment leaving only one issue for trial with respect to infringement of those claims whether the acell product contained any urinary bladder submucosa accordingly,the district court instructed the jury that appellees must prove 
t hat it is more likely than not that acell product includes any amount of submucosa.in making this determination you should keep in mind that submucosa,as i have defined it,does not require any particular amount of submucosa,and that the presence of any submucosa in the acell product requires a finding of infringement.
in response,the jury returned a verdict finding that acell infringed claims,and of the patent,but found that the infringement was not willful.
with respect to damages,on the first day of trial,the district court granted acell motion in limine seeking to preclude appellees from presenting lost profits damages to the jury because the district court found that appellees failed to establish an appropriate record with respect to damages sufficient to raise a jury issue.that ruling effectively precluded appellees from obtaining damages because they had sought only lost profits damages,and not a reasonable royalty.thus,even though the jury returned a verdict in their favor,appellees were not awarded any damages.
following the judgment,both parties filed motions.acell moved the district court to amend the judgment after this court issued its opinion in phillips awh,en banc.acell contended that this court decision in phillips made it clear that acell proposed claim constructions were correct and that a product that did not remove the lamina propria,basement membrane,and epithelial cells could not infringe the patent.appellees filed motions for lost profits damages,willfulness as a matter of law,and attorney fees.while the district court denied the parties motions,it also stayed enforcement of a permanent injunction because it found that this court decision in phillips raises enough doubt at this point under these under sic the totality of the circumstances of this case to cause this court to stay its hand and grant the stay of enforcing a permanent injunction pending the appeal in this case.order,slip op.at.
prf case and inventorship 
the district court also considered several motions for summary judgment relating to inventorship issues filed by appellees and acell.specifically,appellees sought to establish on summary judgment that badylak is a joint inventor of the patent.appellees alleged that badylak collaborated with spievack in developing the urinary bladder as a tissue graft composition as claimed in the patent,and that because badylak is under an obligation to assign the inventions he made while at purdue to prf,prf is a rightful owner of the patent.acell filed its own summary judgment motion on count iv unjust enrichment of prf complaint and a partial summary judgment motion on counterclaim counts i rights to technology and ii inventorship.
the district court first noted that appellees had failed to assert that badylak is the sole inventor of the patent in their complaint,their interrogatory responses,and the pretrial order.instead,the district court found that appellees assertions were limited to omitted inventors.thus,the district court precluded appellees from asserting that badylak was the sole inventor or that spievack was not a proper inventor of the patent because of those failures.
second,the district court found that appellees had failed to present clear and convincing evidence that badylak contributed in some significant manner to the conception of the invention claimed in the patent.in reaching that conclusion,the district court began its analysis with the presumption that the named inventors on a patent are correct,and also found that badylak had filed papers under oath with the pto in which he denied inventorship of the patent the evidence demonstrated that spievack conceived and reduced to practice the invention claimed in the patent spievack had completed the invention claimed in the patent by the summer of when he successfully treated his poison ivy with it and any discussions between badylak and spievack after the summer of were irrelevant to the issue of inventorship because spievack conceived the patented invention by that summer.
finally,the district court found that the deposition excerpts cited by appellees,in support of their assertion that spievack discussed the use of the basement membrane as a tissue graft material with badylak at the conference,fail ed to show that badylak contributed anything to spievak sic conception of the invention,let alone that badylak contributed in some significant manner as required by our holding in bj services halliburton energy services.cook biotech acell,as,slip op.at.june,inventorship order.because the district court found that appellees evidence failed to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard to correct inventorship,it denied appellees motion for summary judgment that badylak was a of the patent.
in considering acell partial summary judgment motion on counterclaim counts i rights to technology and ii inventorship,the district court noted that it interpreted acell motion as a request for a declaration to the effect that spievack is an inventor of the patent.relying on its previous determinations with respect to inventorship,the district court granted acell motion for a declaration that spievack is an inventor of the patent.see infra part.
with respect to acell motion for summary judgment on appellees counterclaim count iv unjust enrichment under indiana law,the district court found that because the rights of the parties were controlled by an express contract,recovery could not be based upon a theory implied in law,unjust enrichment.additionally,the district court found that appellees chosen remedy,assuming they could prove unjust enrichment,of a constructive trust was not available because they failed to assert either actual or constructive fraud in their complaint.
acell appeals the district court construction of urinary bladder submucosa and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa,the jury findings of infringement of claims,and of the patent,and the adequacy of the verdict form.cook several rulings by the district court with respect to its willfulness case and the district court decision to stay an award of a permanent injunction until after appeal to this court.prf several of the district court rulings pertaining to inventorship and its dismissal of prf unjust enrichment claim.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

claim constructiona.urinary bladder submucosa 
acell asserts that the district court erred in construing the term urinary bladder submucosa in claims,and of the patent.acell asserts that the pto did not grant the patent inventors a patent to the naturally occurring submucosa layer of a urinary bladder,but rather that it granted them a patent covering a tissue graft composition derived from that layer.acell argues that the specification makes clear that urinary bladder submucosa is a defined term which was defined to expressly exclude other urinary bladder tissue layers,specifically the abluminal muscle cell layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa layer.
cook argues that the patent specification,specifically in the detailed description of the invention section,teaches that the term urinary bladder submucosa is broader than acell proposed construction because it states that the resulting composition typically consists essentially of urinary bladder submucosa.cook thus asserts that the use of typically implies that there is another possible embodiment of the claimed composition that merely comprises urinary bladder submucosa,but may also include other tissues.
as noted above,claim recites a composition comprising urinary bladder submucosa delaminated from both the abluminal muscle layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of a segment of a urinary bladder of a warm blooded vertebrate.patent,ll.emphasis added.the patent specification,in the background and summary of the invention section,states that u rinary bladder submucosa for use in accordance with the present invention is delaminated from the abluminal muscle layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of the urinary bladder tissue.id.at,ll.emphasis added.the first paragraph of the detailed description of the invention section states 
the tissue graft of composition in accordance with the present invention comprises urinary bladder submucosa of a vertebrate delaminated from adjacent bladder tissue layers.the present tissue graft composition thus comprises the bladder submucosa delaminated from abluminal muscle cell layers and at least the luminal portion of the mucosal layer of a segment of urinary bladder of a vertebrate.typically the delamination technique described below provides a tissue composition consisting essentially of urinary bladder submucosa.these compositions are referred to herein generically as urinary bladder submucosa ubs.
id.at,ll.emphases added.
t he specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.in such cases,the inventor lexicography governs.phillips,at.we believe that this is exactly what the patentees did in this case.as the above quoted portions of the specification indicate,the composition invented was defined to be urinary bladder submucosa delaminated from abluminal muscle cell layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of the urinary bladder tissue.see,patent,ll.the specification also indicates that the resulting composition typically consists essentially of urinary bladder submucosa.thus,while the composition clearly includes urinary bladder submucosa,it may also include other tissues,such as the portion of the tunica mucosal layer.however,it can not include that which was expressly excluded in the patentees definition,the abluminal muscle cell layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa.therefore,we construe urinary bladder submucosa as it is defined in the patent specification to mean urinary bladder submucosa delaminated from the abluminal muscle cell layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of the urinary bladder tissue,and it thus becomes necessary to determine which tissue layers are encompassed by the phrase at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa.
the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa 
acell argues that the district court erred in construing the term the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa.acell asserts that this term was defined by the patentee through the patent incorporation by reference of the procedure for preparing intestinal submucosa as detailed in patent the patent.according to acell,the patent specification defines the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa as layer g which includes the lamina epithelialis mucosa or the epithelium layer and its lamina propria.thus,acell asserts that the term the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa in the patent should be given the same meaning,the epithelium layer and the tunica propria layer.
appellees argue in response that the phrase at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa does not require a special definition and accuse acell of fishing for a special definition.further,appellees assert that there is no basis for importing a definition,even assuming the term is defined as acell alleges,of the term from the patent into the patent because the patent is directed to sis whereas the patent is directed to ubs.appellees assert that the district court construction of the term as the epithelial cells should be affirmed.
the phrase urinary bladder submucosa is present in all three claims at issue.based on our construction of that term as meaning urinary bladder submucosa delaminated from at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa,our construction of the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa applies to all three claims with equal force.we begin with the representative claim language from claim of the patent,which states 
a composition comprising urinary bladder submucosa delaminated from both the abluminal muscle layers and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of a segment of a urinary bladder of a warm blooded vertebrate.
patent,ll.emphases added.the patent specification informs our inquiry into the meaning of the claims.the background and summary of the invention section discloses that t he wall of the urinary bladder is composed of the following layers the tunica mucosa including a transitional epithelium layer and the tunica propria,a submucosa layer,up to three layers of muscle and the adventitia a loose connective tissue layer listed in thickness crossection from luminal to abluminal sides.id.at,ll.the detailed description of the invention section sheds considerable light on the issue before us.it states 
the preparation of ubs from a segment of urinary bladder is similar to the procedure for preparing intestinal submucosa detailed in patent,the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.a segment of urinary bladder tissue is first subjected to abrasion using a longitudinal wiping motion to remove both the outer layers particularly the abluminal smooth muscle layers and the luminal portions of the tunica mucosa epithelial layers.the resulting submucosa tissue has a thickness of about micrometers,and consists primarily greater than of a cellular,eosinophilic staining h e stain extracellular matrix material.
id.at,ll.emphasis added.that paragraph makes clear that the luminal portions of the tunica mucosa layers were defined by the patentee as the epithelial layers and that the procedure for preparing intestinal submucosa as detailed in the patent is expressly incorporated by reference into the patent specification.
the term epithelial layers may arguably be subject to two interpretations.on the one hand,it refers to layers which appears to reflect that it was meant to encompass more than just the transitional epithelium layer,the transitional epithelium layer and the tunica propria layer,the only other layer that the patent teaches is part of the tunica mucosa.see id.at,ll.on the other hand,as recognized by the district court,the epithelium in the urinary bladder is made up of multiple layers of epithelial cells.markman order,slip op.at.even accepting that the disclosure in the patent specification itself is less than clear as to which interpretation is correct,the second important disclosure of the specification is dispositive.as noted,the patent specification expressly incorporates by reference the procedure for preparing intestinal submucosa from the patent.
incorporation by reference provides a method for integrating material from various documents into a host document by citing such material in a manner that makes clear that the material is effectively part of the host document as if it were explicitly contained therein.advanced display,kent state,citations omitted.to incorporate material by reference,the host document must identify with detailed particularity what specific material it incorporates and clearly indicate where that material is found in the various documents.id.citations omitted.whether and to what extent material has been incorporated by reference into a host document is a question of law.id.
the relevant portions of the patent specification are as follows 
layers e,f,and g collectively represent the tunica mucosa.layer e is a layer of smooth muscle cells known as the lamina muscularis mucosa.layer f,the stratum compactum,consists of acellular collagen and elastin fibers.layer g consists of the lamina epithelialis mucosa and its lamina propria,which together and arranged in villous processes,a series of outgrowths of the mucous membrane.
the tissue graft material of this invention is prepared by abrading intestinal tissue to remove the outer layers including both the tunica serosa and the tunica muscularis layers b and c in and the inner layers including at least the luminal portion layer g of the tunica mucosa layers e through g in.
patent,ll,emphases added.
as this disclosure makes clear the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa is represented by layer g in figure of the patent,and layer g in that figure corresponds to the lamina epithelialis mucosa and its lamina propria.id.even acknowledging appellees argument that the layers of the wall of the intestine are somewhat structurally different than the layers of the wall of the bladder,neither party disputes that the basement membrane of the transitional epithelium is located between the epithelialis mucosa layer and its lamina propria layer in both organs.thus,because the basement membrane is located between the two tissue layers explicitly identified,the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa must also refer to the basement membrane.therefore,the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa means the lamina epithelialis mucosa or transitional epithelium layer,the basement membrane,and the lamina propria.
the patent incorporation by reference of the patent procedure for preparing intestinal submucosa,in combination with the patent disclosure pertaining to which tissue layers are removed by that procedure,leads to the conclusion that the patentee definition of the claim term as reflected in the patent as the epithelial layers and in the patent as the lamina epithelialis mucosa and its lamina propria was intended to refer to the same structures,the lamina epithelialis mucosa or transitional epithelium layer,the basement membrane,and the lamina propria.
the district court reasoning is contradicted by its own analysis.relying on a medical dictionary,the district court recognized that the tunica mucosa comprises the epithelium,basement membrane,lamina propria mucosae,and lamina muscularis mucosae.markman order,slip op.at.the court then rejected acell proposed construction that the luminal portion of the tunica musoca means the epithelial cells,the transitional epithelium,the basement membrane,and the lamina propria because the term would not require the entire tunica mucosa including the basement membrane,tunica propria and all epithelial cells to be removed as acell contends,slip op.at.
that statement by the district court reflects that it believed acell proposed construction of that term encompassed the entire tunica mucosa,rather than just the luminal portion as the claim requires.the district court reasoning,however,overlooks the fact that acell construction permits the retention of the lamina muscularis mucosae layer of the tunica mucosa.this construction is consistent with both the medical dictionary list of layers that comprise the tunica mucosa,and the teachings of the patent,which specifically refer to that layer as layer e of the tunica mucosa.patent,ll.as this discussion indicates,acell proposed construction does not require removal of the entire tunica mucosa as the district court opinion suggests,but rather removal of only a portion of the tunica mucosa therefore,we construe the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa to mean the lamina epithelialis mucosa or transitional epithelium layer,the basement membrane,and the lamina propria.
infringement 
literal infringement 
acell asserts that if we agree that the district court erred in its claim construction,a new trial is not necessary and we should reverse the judgment of literal infringement.it submits that its acell vet tm product can not infringe claims,and of the patent because those claims require that the urinary bladder submucosa in the claimed compositions be delaminated from the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa,and its product is not so delaminated.rather,acell product retains part of the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of a segment of a urinary bladder,the basement membrane and the lamina propria.thus,acell argues that because the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa is not delaminated as required by those claims,its product can not infringe the asserted claims.appellees agree with acell that if we were to interpret any of the claims to exclude lamina propria,the acell vet tm product can not literally infringe the asserted claims.
we agree with the parties that the acell vet tm product can not,as a matter of law,literally infringe claims,and of the patent because it contains the basement membrane and the lamina propria,tissue layers that are expressly excluded by the terms urinary bladder submucosa and the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa as the patentees have so defined them,and as we have thus construed them.
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents 
appellees assert,however,that even if summary judgment of is appropriate with respect to literal infringement,a new trial may be necessary on the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.they argue that the evidence supports the theory that compositions that include lamina propria and submucosa are equivalent to compositions that consist essentially of submucosa because the two compositions perform the same function,in the same way,to achieve the same result.
acell makes two arguments in response.first,it asserts that appellees did not preserve any argument under the doctrine of equivalents because they failed to assert
