wedgewood village pharmacy wedgewood challenges the decision of the united states drug enforcement administration dea to revoke its registration as a practitioner within the meaning of f.before the revocation of its registration,wedgewood business focused primarily on supplying equine veterinarians with specially formulated medications.following an investigation of wedgewood sewell,new jersey facility,dea determined that wedgewood was operating outside the scope of its registration.specifically,dea objected to wedgewood practice of preparing large amounts of compounded controlled substances and then delivering the medications to veterinarians and physicians instead of directly to their patients.dea viewed these practices as manufacturing and distributing controlled substances as defined by the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of,stat.codified as amended at et csa or act.under wedgewood dea registration as a practitioner,however,it is authorized only to compound and dispense controlled substances.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the revocation of wedgewood registration and remand to the agency for further proceedings.
background 
the congress enacted the csa in to reduce drug abuse by preventing the diversion of controlled substances.see gonzales oregon,d discussing legislative history of csa.a central feature of the csa is its closed system of distribution in which all persons in the legitimate distribution chain of controlled substances must register with dea,as reprinted in.in its closed distribution system,the csa created three categories of registrants manufacturer,distributor and practitioner each with distinct requirements for registration.see a criteria for manufacturer registration,b criteria for distributor registration,f criteria for practitioner registration.a manufacturer is authorized to engage in t he production,preparation,propagation,compounding,or processing of a drug.id.emphasis added.a distributor is authorized to deliver other than by administering or dispensing a controlled substance.id.emphasis added.the csa describes a practitioner as a physician,dentist,veterinarian,or pharmacy registered to distribute,dispense,or administer a controlled substance in the course of professional practice.id.emphasis added.the csa explains that dispens ing,as used in the definition of practitioner,is the deliver y of a controlled substance to an ultimate user,including compounding necessary to prepare the substance for such delivery.id.emphases added.delivery includes the actual,constructive,or attempted transfer of a controlled substance.id.emphasis added.in addition,the csa specifies that the preparation or compounding of a drug by a practitioner as an incident to his administration or dispensing of the drug does not constitute manufacturing.id.emphases added.the csa does not define compounding.
the scope of the terms manufacture,compound,distribute and dispense as used in the csa remains unsettled.beginning in the,the united states food and drug administration fda,along with other government agencies,grew concerned that some pharmacies were using their compounding authorization under and to,in effect,manufacture controlled substances without fda approval.in response to their concern,the congress enacted the food and drug administration modernization act of fdama,stat.according to the legislative history of the fdama,its intent was to ensure continued availability of compounded drug products as a component of individualized therapy,while limiting the scope of compounding so as to prevent manufacturing under the guise of compounding.conf,at,as reprinted in.
the fdama contained a definition of compounding that required a prescription therefor to be unsolicited by a retail pharmacy and prohibited the pharmacy from advertising the compounding of a particular drug.codified at a,c.several pharmacies with large compounding practices,including wedgewood,challenged these provisions as violative of the first amendment.see thompson states med,d.the supreme court agreed,holding that the fdama improperly restricted solicitation and advertising,both legitimate forms of commercial speech.id.accordingly,its holding invalidating the language left a statutory definition of compounding 
agency proceedings against wedgewood 
in early,dea began investigating wedgewood after receiving reports that wedgewood was ordering controlled substances in unusually large quantities.see in re wedgewood vill.pharmacy,docket,at,ja alj describing reports.dea obtained an administrative inspection warrant to search wedgewood sewell,new jersey facility.dea executed the warrant between march,and collected evidence that it believed demonstrated that wedgewood was both manufacturing and distributing controlled substances.see order to show cause ja describing evidence.for example,according to dea and fda investigators,wedgewood had large quantities of bulk drug substances to manufacture large quantities of unapproved drug products as well as large scale equipment,neither of which,they concluded,was consistent with traditional retail pharmacy activities.report of investigation,ja.the inspectors also examined wedgewood log of scripts.the log,which contained a record of all controlled substances sold by wedgewood between january,and december,indicated that wedgewood routinely delivered controlled substances to another practitioner rather than directly to the ultimate user,using prescriptions that listed the same person as both prescribing doctor and patient.see log of scripts ja see also wedgewood vill.pharmacy revocation of registration,dea,ja over of wedgewood sales were to physicians or veterinarians documented by what the pharmacy called prescriptions which contained the name of the physician or veterinarian as the patient.under dea reading of the csa,a retail pharmacy may dispense controlled substances only to the ultimate user and not to another practitioner.see id.at ja see also d ispense means to deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user id.u ltimate user means a person who has lawfully obtained a controlled substance for his own use or for an animal owned by him.
following the inspection,dea informed wedgewood by letter that wedgewood was not configured as a typical retail pharmacy,but rather as a drug manufacturing and distribution facility,and that wedgewood was operating in a manner outside the scope of its registration as a practitioner.dea letter,at ja.dea ordered wedgewood to immediately cease and desist manufacturing and distributing activities outside the scope of its registration or risk revocation of its registration pursuant to id.despite the cease and desist order,wedgewood continued to compound controlled substances for approximately two months as wedgewood challenged dea decision.wedgewood vill.pharmacy.at ja.it eventually ceased operation after it moved to a new facility in swedesboro,new jersey and dea declined to allow it to modify its registration to reflect its new address pursuant to.see alj hr g tr.ja discussing wedgewood inability to handle controlled substances following dea denial of wedgewood requested modification.id 
on september,dea began proceedings to revoke wedgewood registration as a retail pharmacy by issuing an order to show cause order.see order to show cause ja.the order charged,inter alia,that wedgewood was manufacturing controlled substances in violation of wedgewood registration as a retail pharmacy.see id.at ja.the order explained that a ll compounding of drugs must be patient specific,and dispensed only by the compounder to that patient identified in the order.id.at emphasis added.by compounding batches of controlled substances pursuant to orders which did not identify a specific patient,wedgewood exceeded its registration.see id.at ja noting most of wedgewood sales were made pursuant to orders listing prescribing veterinarian or physician as patient.the order also explained that a drug compound prepared for distribution to practitioners is considered to be a manufacturing activity under the controlled substances act.id.at ja.because wedgewood delivered controlled substances to other practitioners,veterinarians and physicians,the controlled substances were manufactured and not compounded.see id.at ja noting that wedgewood routinely distributed office stock to other practitioners.accordingly,dea informed wedgewood that it intended to revoke wedgewood registration if wedgewood did not request a hearing within thirty days.see id.at,ja.
wedgewood timely requested a hearing which was held before a dea administrative law judge alj on january.approximately one year after the hearing,the alj issued her decision,concluding that wedgewood had manufactured and distributed controlled substances without a valid dea registration authorizing such activities.alj ja.the alj further determined that wedgewood continued registration would not be in the public interest.id.as a framework for her analysis,the alj used the public interest test set forth in f.id.at ja she determined that three of the five factors weighed in favor of revoking wedgewood registration 
first,regarding factor experience dispensing controlled alj found that 
wedgewood had violated two dea regulations.under b,a prescription may not be issued in order for an individual practitioner to obtain controlled substances for supplying the individual practitioner,a veterinarian or physician for the purpose of general dispensing to patients.the alj noted the testimony of wedgewood owner,george malmberg,before the new jersey pharmacy board,to the effect that the majority of the controlled substances dispensed by wedgewood would be used by physicians and veterinarians for office use in their practice,rather than by an individual patient seeking medications for his own ingestion.id.at ja.the alj also focused on the rule.id.at ja.under,a practitioner may dispense controlled substances to another registered entity,provided the total number of dosage units thus dispensed does not exceed of the total number of controlled substances dispensed by that registrant during the calendar year.alj ja citing a.relying on the entries in wedgewood log of scripts,the alj determined that during the calendar year,wedgewood dispensed prescriptions which accounted for a total of dosage units of controlled substances.of this number dosage units were distributed pursuant to prescriptions written by a physician,with the named patient also being the physician.alj ja.based on the log,the alj concluded that wedgewood had plainly violated the rule.id.at ja.
regarding factor with state and federal alj considered inter alia,whether wedgewood was manufacturing or compounding controlled substances.the alj noted that,although the csa defines manufacturing,it does not define compounding.id.at ja.consequently,the alj look ed to the fda regulations for guidance in defining compounding.id.according to fda guidelines,compounding is the preparation of a customized medication for an individual patient in response to a licensed practitioner prescription.id.quoting fda compliance policy guide emphases added.the alj concluded that wedgewood was routinely filling orders for veterinary medicines in bulk rather than pursuant to a prescription from a licensed physician for a specifically identified patient use and therefore wedgewood was manufacturing,not compounding,controlled substances.id.at ja.
finally,with regard to factor conduct that may threaten the public health and alj noted that wedgewood did not keep records of regulated transactions,it had overages and shortages of controlled substances,it had been untruthful during the dea investigation and that it had challenged the dea authority to regulate its activities.id.at ja.the alj concluded that the government ha d clearly met its burden of proof and recommended revocation of wedgewood registration as a practitioner.id.at ja.
on april,over one year after the alj decision,dea deputy administrator da issued the agency final decision,which adopted in full the alj findings and recommendations.wedgewood vill.pharmacy.at ja.the da decision characterized the central issue as whether wedgewood was compounding as an adjunct to dispensing controlled substances in the course of retail pharmacy practice or manufacturing and distributing controlled substances as those terms are defined in the controlled substances act.id.at ja.the da concluded that wedgewood actions constituted manufacturing and distributing for two reasons.first,wedgewood practice of not preparing or compounding medications on an individualized patient basis was inconsistent with the traditional view of compounding.id.at ja.using the supreme court description of compounding in thompson western states medical center,see supra note,the da explained that 
to be exempt from the definition of manufacturer under the csa a dea practitioner registrant must be engaged in compounding controlled substances on an individual patient basis.that is,a pharmacy must receive a prescription for a specific patient from a physician or other individual practitioner since the evidence in this case clearly demonstrates that wedgewood is not preparing or compounding medications containing controlled substances on an individualized patient basis,wedgewood activities constitute manufacturing under the csa and it must be registered as a manufacturer to conduct such activity.
id.emphases added.second,the da reasoned that under the csa definition of dispensing,a practitioner may deliver controlled substances only to an ultimate user.because a physician or a veterinarian who receives controlled substances is not the ultimate user,but another dea practitioner registrant,wedgewood practice of delivering controlled substances to other practitioners for the latter administering to their respective patients constituted distribution and not dispensing.id.accordingly,the da adopted the alj recommendation to revoke wedgewood registration 
wedgewood timely petitioned for reconsideration.recons.letter,at ja.in its request,wedgewood advanced the new argument that standard procedures for veterinary medicine practice which is approximately of wedgewood controlled substance sales are different than the protocol for human health care.id.wedgewood explained that u nlike human health care physicians,equine veterinarians usually do not treat animals on an individual basis.id.at ja.instead,v eterinarians,particularly those with an equine practice,travel to their patients,examine and diagnose them,and administer the appropriate medicines on site,a procedure that requires them to have a variety of medicines at their immediate disposal.id.according to wedgewood,dea interpretation of dispensing threatened to severely handicap the practice of equine veterinary medicine by making it difficult for a veterinarian to administer controlled substances to horses at the stables.id.at ja.furthermore,the requirement that a practitioner must dispense controlled substances directly to the ultimate user,the animal owner runs counter to the goal of the csa because it is a considerably more secure procedure and provides better protection against drug diversion for a licensed veterinarian to possess and be responsible for the controlled substances rather than to send medications for each animal to the farm or stable where any worker has access to them.id.at ja.
on june,the da denied wedgewood request for reconsideration,giving two reasons therefor.recons.letter,at ja.the da first noted that section of the csa makes no distinction among physicians,veterinarians,dentists and researchers as practitioners.id.second,the da concluded that,in any event,a veterinary exception was unnecessary because the law and regulations provide an adequate mechanism for any practitioner,including a veterinarian,to obtain controlled substances for general office use obtaining controlled substances to be dispensed to a herd or a large group of animals as opposed to a specific animal.id.a practitioner,including a veterinarian,may obtain controlled substances for general dispensing from any properly registered manufacturer,distributor or pharmacy subject to the rule.id.therefore,the da concluded,no exception was necessary to accommodate the needs of veterinary practice.
wedgewood timely petitioned this court for review of the da revocation decision as well as the denial of wedgewood petition for reconsideration.we consolidated the two petitions for briefing and argument.order granting mot.to consolidate,june.
we review the da decisions,insofar as they interpret statutes,under the standard articulated by the supreme court in chevron natural resources defense council,d.under chevron,we do not set aside an agency statutory interpretation unless the interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.a n agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.morall dea,interpreting administrative procedure act,a and quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d alterations in original.having reviewed the da decisions,we can not help but conclude that the da decision entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem before her.id.
wedgewood argues before us,as it did during the administrative proceedings,that the csa does not limit dispensing to a direct transfer of controlled substances to a patient.rather,wedgewood argues,the csa permits a pharmacy to constructively dispense controlled substances to a patient by delivering the controlled substances to an intermediary such as a veterinarian.wedgewood relies on the express language of section of the csa.as noted earlier,the csa authorizes a practitioner like wedgewood to distribute,dispense or administer a controlled substance in the course of professional practice.emphasis added.the csa defines dispensing as the deliver y of a controlled substance to an ultimate user including any compounding necessary to prepare the substance for such delivery.id.emphases added.and delivery expressly includes the actual,constructive,or attempted transfer of a controlled substance.id.emphasis added.
according to wedgewood,constructive in the definition of delivery is critical.by allowing a constructive transfer,the csa recognizes that a pharmacy is not limited to dispensing controlled substances directly to the ultimate user.instead,wedgewood argues,dispensing controlled substances to a veterinarian for later administration to his animal patients is a paradigmatic example of a constructive transfer.see petitioner reply br.therefore,wedgewood argues,dea conclusion that wedgewood distributed controlled substances because wedgewood did not deliver them directly to specific patients is incorrect because dea failed to consider delivery by constructive transfer.see petitioner br.quoting recons.letter,at ja emphasis in original.
although neither the alj nor the da addressed wedgewood constructive transfer argument,dea now posits that wedgewood view of constructive transfer is too broad.according to dea,constructive must be defined narrowly to maintain a meaningful distinction among the three classes of registrants recognized by the csa.wedgewood interpretation of constructive transfer,dea claims,would eviscerate the distinction between a distributor and a dispenser by allow ing any practitioner to become a distributor of controlled substances,under the guise that the drugs were delivered constructively to the ultimate user.respondent br.
in despite its silence during its own now offers its interpretation of this language according to dea,a constructive transfer is limited to circumstances in which no actual transfer of controlled substances takes place.see id.at.specifically,dea claims that other courts have 
limited constructive transfers to situations in which controlled substances were not actually delivered,but rather were constructively delivered by virtue of a person illegally distributing prescriptions,which in turn could be used by the recipient to obtain the controlled drugs from a pharmacy.
id.at citing united states roya,cir united states tighe,cir dea argues that its interpretation is reasonable because it maintains a meaningful distinction among the three categories of dea registrants.see id.at.nevertheless,the definition of constructive transfer dea now,the fact that at least one actual transfer of controlled substances to another person or entity be it a postal carrier,authorized agent or other intermediary has occurred necessarily means there can be no constructive for at least three reasons.
first,dea interpretation does not tally with the ordinary meaning of constructive transfer.black law dictionary defines constructive transfer as a delivery of an.a controlled someone other than the owner but at the owner direction.black law dictionary ed.nothing in the definition precludes a constructive transfer simply because an actual transfer has taken place.
second,dea view is not supported by the statutory definition.to repeat,the csa defines delivery as the actual,constructive,or attempted transfer of a controlled substance or a listed chemical,whether or not there exists an agency relationship.emphases added.the definition of delivery includes an attempted transfer as a distinct term,presumably to cover circumstances in which there is no actual transfer.moreover,the definition of delivery expressly provides that delivery may,in some circumstances,occur constructively through an agent.the csa definition thus appears to conflict with dea assertion that dispensing includes only the direct transfer of a controlled substance to the ultimate user.
finally,dea narrow interpretation of constructive transfer also appears to conflict with at least one of dea regulations interpreting the csa.dea regulation defining prescription provides that a prescription is an order for medication which is dispensed to or for an ultimate user.b emphasis added.that a prescription may be dispensed for the ultimate user suggests a definition of constructive transfer broader than dea set forth in its brief.
at oral argument,dea retreated from the definition set out in its brief.when asked to clarify her understanding of the term,dea counsel offered a new in which an actual transfer does not preclude a constructive transfer.she explained that under the csa constructive transfer language,the patient or even the ultimate user does not have to be the person that actually picks up the prescription,but the transfer requires that the pharmacy identify who that patient is.recording of oral argument at emphasis added.dea counsel amended definition of constructive transfer suggests that dea primary concern may not be with the practice of dispensing controlled substances through an intermediary but instead with the practice of compounding medications without an individualized prescription this statement may accurately reflect the da concerns about general dispensing.see,wedgewood vill.pharmacy.at a pharmacy must receive a prescription for a specific patient id.at wedgewood is rarely dispensing controlled substances to specific patients,and,in the majority of cases,has no documentation of the identity of the patients to whom the controlled substances will ultimately be dispensed or administered.it does not,however,explain why the da prohibited practitioners from acting as intermediaries on behalf of ultimate user s.see,id.at sending controlled substances to another dea practitioner for dispensing is distribution,not dispensing.we note that requiring the identification of a specific patient for delivery comports with the statutory scheme.see,b prohibiting using prescriptions for the purpose of general dispensing all prescriptions shall bear the full name of the patient permitting practitioners to distribute without being registered to distribute of total dosage units for the purpose of general dispensing.moreover,requiring individualized dispensing maintains the distinction between dispens ing and distribut ing by preserving the ultimate user requirement.see.when a pharmacy dispenses controlled substances without identifying a specific patient,as wedgewood apparently did here,it is unclear who the ultimate user is.nonet
