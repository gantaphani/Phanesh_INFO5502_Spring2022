plaintiff appellant medisim medisim appeals the grant of judgment as a matter of law jmol by the united states district court for the district of new york that patent patent is anticipated by medisim own prior art fht thermometer.see medisim bestmed llc,d.it also appeals the district court grant of jmol in bestmed,llc bestmed favor on medisim unjust enrichment claim.id.at.because bestmed failed to preserve its right to jmol on anticipation under federal rule of civil procedure,we vacate the district court grant of jmol on that claim.however,we affirm the district court grant of jmol on medisim unjust enrichment claim and its conditional grant of a new trial on anticipation.we remand this case for further proceedings.
background 
medisim owns the patent,which is directed to a fast thermometric device that displays a core body temperature.patent ll.the claimed device is placed against an external skin surface,takes temperature readings from one or more temperature sensors,determines parameters of temperature change responsive to those readings,and calculates a deep tissue temperature.id.at.the claimed device then calculates a core body temperature by correcting for the difference between the deep tissue temperature and the core body temperature.id.at ll.claim is representative 
a thermometric device,comprising a probe,comprising 
a membrane configured to be applied to an external surface of a body of a subject and 
one or more temperature sensors located within the probe in thermal contact with the membrane and 
a processing unit configured to receive a plurality of temperature readings from the one or more temperature sensors,to determine parameters of temperature change responsively to the plurality of temperature readings,to calculate,a deep tissue temperature of the body at a location under the skin that is a source of heat conducted to the one or more temperature sensors,and to calculate a core body temperature by correcting for a difference between the core body temperature and the deep tissue temperature.
id.at ll.the other independent claim,recites the same concept in method format.id.at ll.
more than a year before filing the application that eventually issued as the patent,medisim marketed and sold the fht thermometer.therefore,medisim own product qualifies as prior art to the patent under b the fht thermometer uses a algorithm disclosed in another medisim patent,patent patent,which covers a method of quickly estimating a local body temperature.see patent.
from november to may,bestmed marketed and sold several of medisim thermometers in the united states under an international distribution agreement ida.while the ida was in effect,bestmed was privy to technical information concerning many of medisim thermometers and its testing procedures,including its water bath testing protocol.this water bath testing protocol enabled medisim thermometers to be approved by the food and drug administration for sale in the united states.
in,the parties entered into a new purchase and sale agreement psa,which set out the terms governing the parties separation.the psa authorized the parties to offer competing products to current customers as long as delivery occurred after may.the parties also released all claims that had arisen or might arise out of their past performance or disputes regarding the ida.
after the expiration of the psa,bestmed began selling competing thermometer products made by k jump health.
ii.procedural history 
medisim filed suit against bestmed in the southern district of new york on march,accusing bestmed,inter alia,of directly and indirectly infringing the patent by selling the k jump thermometers and of benefitting from unjust enrichment.before the case was submitted to the jury,both parties made several motions requesting jmol under federal rule of civil procedure a.in opposing medisim motion for jmol of no anticipation,bestmed counsel stated on anticipation,i submit that the jury can readily find that the fht product,medisim own product,is anticipatory.there clear and convincing evidence,we submit,on that issue.also medisim witnesses testimony support s that position.but,again,it definitely something for the jury.
in addition,bestmed expressly moved for jmol under rule a of no unjust enrichment at the close of medisim,generally contending that t here is no evidence of unjust enrichment and particularly challenging medisim evidence on each element of the claim.the district court denied all jmol motions,and the jury found the patent to be not invalid and infringed.see medisim d at.the jury awarded medisim million in patent infringement damages and million in damages for its unjust enrichment claim.id.
following the jury verdict,bestmed moved for jmol of anticipation and no unjust enrichment under rule b.medisim d at.the district court granted those motions,overturning the verdict and finding that the asserted claims of the patent are anticipated by the fht thermometer.id.at.further,the district court noted that to the extent that bestmed sales of the accused products occurred during the operation of the contracts between the parties,before may,any claim for unjust enrichment was waived by those contracts.id.it then found that medisim remaining unjust enrichment claim for any period after may,was not grounded in the record,as there was no evidence to support a finding that bestmed received an incremental benefit over that compensable by the patent laws.id.at.the district court also granted bestmed a new trial on anticipation,conditioned on an appellate court determining that bestmed failed to preserve its right to bring a motion for jmol.id.at.
the district court ruling vacated medisim entire damages award,and medisim has appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
iii.discussion 
this appeal concerns medisim challenges to the district court grant of jmol on anticipation and unjust enrichment.medisim argues that bestmed forfeited its right to jmol under rule b for both claims when it failed to properly move for jmol under rule a at the close of evidence.medisim also challenges the district court grant of jmol on anticipation and unjust enrichment on the merits.finally,medisim argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting a conditional new trial on anticipation.we address each of medisim challenges in turn.
forfeiture of jmol 
federal rule of civil procedure sets forth the procedural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such challenges.rule a allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury.see.a.rule b,by contrast,sets forth the procedural requirements for renewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge after the jury verdict.see id.b see generally unitherm food,swift eckrich,d.these two provisions are linked together,as a motion under rule b is not allowed unless the movant sought relief on similar grounds under rule a before the case was submitted to the jury.exxon shipping baker,d.
in the past we have found that parties forfeited the right to move under rule b by failing to first properly move under rule a.for example,in duro last,custom seal,we rejected the appellant contentions that its specific jmol motions at the close of evidence regarding inequitable conduct and the bar encompassed broader motions that the patents were not invalid for obviousness.we then explained that s ince a motion for jmol can be granted only on grounds advanced in the motion,duro last was precluded from making a motion under rule b for jmol that its patents were not invalid for obviousness.id.at.similarly,in limited partnership microsoft,we concluded that the appellant waived its right to challenge the factual findings underlying the jury implicit obviousness verdict because it did not file a jmol on obviousness for three specific references.see,aff,d.with this precedent in mind,we can now turn to the questions of whether bestmed failed to properly move for jmol on anticipation and unjust enrichment.
forfeiture of jmol on anticipation 
medisim first argues that bestmed failed to move for jmol on anticipation under rule a,so it was foreclosed from doing so under rule b.therefore,medisim claims that the district court should have refrained from ruling on anticipation after the jury verdict under rule b.
bestmed denies such forfeiture.in support of its argument,it points to a statement it made on the record at the close of evidence in opposition to medisim jmol motion for no anticipation.its counsel stated on anticipation,i submit that the jury can readily find that the fht product,medisim own product,is anticipatory.there clear and convincing evidence,we submit,on that issue.also medisim witnesses testimony support s that position.but,again,it definitely something for the jury.
while bestmed concedes that this statement was not a model of clarity,it argues that medisim was on notice of bestmed position.appellant br.further,bestmed notes that when medisim moved to strike bestmed rule b motion on anticipation,the district court recognized that bestmed had asserted its present invalidity contentions on the record,and the court ha d stated that all of its contentions had been and preserved.order at,medisim bestmed llc,cv,ecf.the district court concluded that medisim had not been unfairly surprised by bestmed anticipation contentions.id.the district court explained 
t he rule of duro last,custom seal,which partnership applies,is based on the proposition that it would be impermissible under the seventh amendment to the jury verdict upon grounds not raised prior to the verdict.here,this rule is easily met bestmed has pressed its invalidity contentions since well before the jury was sworn,the jury was instructed as to invalidity,and bestmed presented its present invalidity contentions,and its supporting evidence,on the record.
while medisim may not have been surprised by bestmed invalidity contentions,the supreme court has held previously that our federal rules of civil procedure are to be strictly followed in circumstances such as this one.in unitherm,for example,a party moved for a directed verdict under rule a prior to the district court submission of the case to the jury,but following the verdict the party failed to renew its motion for jmol pursuant to rule b.see at.in preventing the party from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal,the supreme court stated that a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on appeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict motion in the district court.id.at.while the issue here is whether bestmed failed to move under rule a,the principle of forfeiture articulated in unitherm remains the same.see,yakus united states.no procedural principle is more familiar to this court than that a right may be forfeited by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.
with that principle in mind,we conclude that bestmed forfeited its right to move for jmol on anticipation.the statement that bestmed now relies on as evidence of a motion for jmol actually indicates the opposite bestmed counsel stated that anticipation was definitely something for the jury.further,bestmed counsel made this statement in opposition to medisim motion for jmol under rule a bestmed never moved on its own for jmol on anticipation before the case was submitted to the jury.see id.indeed,bestmed counsel conceded that bestmed did not expressly say that we for jmol when they moved for jmol on the anticipation issue oral arg.available at.finally,regarding the district court statement that bestmed had preserved the record,and renewed all the motions previously made,we note that this statement was made following a discussion of bestmed unjust enrichment claims.see.the district court later statement that the c ourt ha d stated that all of its contentions had been and preserved came only after medisim requested that the district court strike bestmed rule b motion regarding validity.see order at,medisim bestmed llc,cv,ecf.but by then it was too late bestmed had already forfeited the right to move for jmol under rule b.therefore,we conclude that the district court legally erred in ruling on any validity issues after the jury verdict under rule b.
because we vacate the district court grant of jmol on anticipation due to forfeiture,we need not consider whether the district court erred in granting jmol on anticipation on the merits.
no forfeiture of jmol on unjust enrichment 
we next turn to medisim procedural challenge to the district court grant of jmol on unjust enrichment.again,medisim argues that bestmed forfeited its right to move for jmol under rule b when it failed to properly move for jmol under rule a.medisim claims that although bestmed did move for jmol under rule a,the basis for its motion bears no resemblance to the basis for its rule b motion.
bestmed responds that it expressly moved for jmol of no unjust enrichment at the close of medisim,generally contending that t here is no evidence of unjust enrichment and particularly challenging medisim evidence on each element of the claim.bestmed alleges that the district court cut bestmed counsel off and denied the motion.when bestmed counsel tried to renew bestmed jmol motions later,the district court barred any further discussion,saying you preserved the record.
we conclude that bestmed did not forfeit its right to move for jmol on unjust enrichment under rule b because it adequately made such a motion under rule a.on appeal,medisim bases its unjust enrichment argument on misappropriation of its allegedly proprietary water bath testing procedure,but during a trial medisim did not present much evidence on this issue.in fact,during oral argument,we asked medisim counsel to show us where in the record it had presented an unjust enrichment claim based on its water bath testing procedure.medisim counsel responded by saying,at this point i could specifically say where oral arg.available at http.he then admitted that s ometimes things are not as precise as you would like.id.at.after reviewing the record,we too could not find a precise presentation of an unjust enrichment claim based on the water bath testing procedure.instead,medisim used its unjust enrichment claim to request a remedy without explaining its basis for the actual claim.faced with a generic case,bestmed could only make a generic motion under rule a.and it clearly accomplished that its motion explained why medisim was not entitled to prevail on unjust enrichment because it had failed to show that it had been denied a legitimate expectation of compensation,a necessary element of the claim.since we conclude that there was no forfeiture of jmol under rule b,we next review whether the district court erred in granting bestmed motion on the merits.
grant of jmol on unjust enrichment 
the second circuit reviews a district court resolution of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and applies the same standard as the district court itself was required to apply.diesel town of lewisboro,cir citations omitted.in doing so,the second circuit will consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the evidence that the jury might have drawn in that party favor,id.citation omitted,but can not assess the weight of conflicting evidence,pass on the credibility of the witnesses,or substitute its judgment for that of the jury,leblanc sternberg fletcher,cir citations omitted.unjust enrichment requires that the defendant benefited at the plaintiff expense and that equity and good conscience require restitution.kaye grossman,cir citation omitted.
below,the district court found that there was no evidence in the record to support the jury award of damages to medisim for unjust enrichment.medisim,d at.it noted that t o the extent that bestmed sales of the accused products occurred during the operation of the ida and the psa,any claim for unjust enrichment is waived by those contracts,which medisim conceded.id.at.therefore,the only issue that remains is whether medisim is entitled to damages for unjust enrichment following the expiration of the ida and psa.
medisim argues that its
