ventana medical systems,ventana appeals the decision of the united states district court for the district of arizona granting judgment of noninfringement of patent the patent in favor of,biogenex laboratories,biogenex.because the district court erred in its claim construction,we vacate the judgment of noninfringement and remand for further proceedings.
background 
ventana is the owner of several patents relating to automated methods and apparatuses for staining microscope slides.such methods and apparatuses may be used,for example,to detect diseases in the tissues of patients.in a process known as immunostaining,pathologists first mount tissue samples on microscope slides.the slides then undergo a series of treatment steps including the application of various reagents such as antibody stains.each of these treatment steps is separated by multiple rinse steps,during which unreacted reagents are removed from the slides.finally,the stained slides are examined by pathologists to detect the presence of diseases.
at issue in this case is ventana patent,entitled automated biological reaction apparatus.as the title suggests,the patent claims automated apparatuses and methods used to perform a variety of biological assays,including immunostaining.the patent stems from the same original patent application as six other patents assigned to ventana patent the patent patent the patent patent the patent patent the patent patent the patent and patent the patent.all seven of these patents share a common specification.the common specification discusses various previously known automated staining devices and asserts that such prior art devices are limited in their performance and unable to satisfy the needs for automated,high precision immunohistology.patent,ll.to overcome these problems,the inventors of this family of patents sought to 
provide a device which provides more rapid,reliable and more reproducible results than standard methods can perform any standard immunochemical assay preforms sic all steps of the immunohistochemical assay irrespective of complexity or their order,at the time and temperature,and in the environment needed and is cost effective in terms of equipment,reagent and labor costs.
the common specification discloses an automated slide staining apparatus possessing multiple features,and each of ventana seven patents claims various combinations of these features and methods related to these features.for example,the patent is entitled method for mixing reagent and sample mounted on a slide and the claims relate to methods that use streams of gas to stir the reagents on the slide surface.in contrast,the claims of the patent relate to automated dispensing systems that employ bar reagent containers slides.as described in the patent specification,
b ar code reader above slide reads a slide bar code and on each slide.the slide bar codes sic identifies the slide sample and the particular immunohistochemical process required for that sample.this information is fed into the computer and correlated with the indexed position of that slide with respect to home,to control the sequence of reagent chemicals to be applied to that slide in the reagent application zone.
patent,ll.the specification further discloses that the reagent containers may also be labeled with bar codes 
a reagent bar code reader can be mounted on post,positioned to scan a reagent bar code on the reagent bottle.bar code identifies the contents of the reagent bottle.at the beginning of a slide treatment operation,the reagent carousel is rotated past the bar code reader,and the bar code on each reagent bottle is scanned.the scanned information is fed to the computer and correlated with the indexed position of the reagent carousel.this information is used to rotate the reagent carousel to place the correct reagent bottle in the application zone for each slide treatment step for each slide.
biogenex manufactures and sells automated staining devices.on february,ventana filed suit against biogenex alleging infringement of claims,and of the patent.the district court held a markman hearing and construed certain disputed claim terms in a written opinion.ventana med,biogenix sic,slip op.at,claim construction order.in light of the district court construction of the claim term dispensing,which appears in all of the asserted claims,ventana stipulated to a judgment of noninfringement and reserved its right to appeal the district court claim construction.accordingly,the district court entered a final judgment of noninfringement.ventana med,biogenex,slip op.at.ventana now appeals.
discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is the proper construction of the claim term dispensing in asserted claims,and of the patent.of the asserted claims,claims and are independent.both cover a method of dispensing reagents onto a slide.claim reads 
a method of dispensing reagents onto a slide,the method comprising the steps of 
providing at least one reagent container 
providing at least one slide on a slide support 
automatically identifying the reagent container using a computer 
automatically determining whether reagent in the reagent container should be dispensed onto the slide and 
dispensing the reagent in the reagent container onto the slide based on the determination of whether the reagent in the reagent container should be dispensed onto the slide,
wherein the step of automatically determining whether reagent in the reagent container should be dispensed onto the slide includes the steps of 
providing a bar code reader 
reading a slide bar code placed on the slide using the bar code reader thereby acquiring slide information,the slide information indicating reagents to be applied to the slide and 
sending the slide information to the computer.
patent.emphases added.and claim reads

determining a sequence of reagents to be applied on the at least one slide based upon the reading of the slide bar code on the slide and 
dispensing the reagents in the reagent containers based upon the sequence of reagents to be applied.
patent,ll.emphases added.
the district court construed the dispensing claim limitation to require direct dispensing,meaning that the reagent is dispensed directly from the reagent container onto the slide,rather than utilizing an intermediate transport mechanism to transfer reagent from the reagent container to the slide.claim construction order,slip op.at.the district court held that the context in which the dispensing term is used in the claim necessitates direct dispensing by stating that the reagent in the reagent container is dispensed onto the slide,meaning the reagent is dispensed directly from the reagent container,slip op.at.the district court also noted that the written description and figures supported a narrow construction of dispensing because all of the disclosed embodiments dispense reagent directly from the bottom of the reagent container without using any intermediate transfer device,slip op.at.
after construing the term dispensing to mean direct dispensing,the district court held that the inventors disclaimed a particular type of dispensing,sip and spit dispensing,during the prosecution of an ancestor application.in sip and spit dispensing,an intermediate transport mechanism such as a pipette uses suction to sip the reagent from the reagent container and then releases or spits the reagent onto the slide.the patent issued from a continuation of a continuation of a division of a continuation of patent application the application,which originally presented claims independent claim of the application provided 
a biological reaction apparatus for dispensing a selected reagent directly to a sample,said biological reaction apparatus having 
a reagent carousel having a plurality of reagent container supports thereon 
homing and indexing means,operatively coupled to the reagent carousel,for identifying the position of each reagent container support with reference to a home position and 
drive means,engaging the reagent carousel and operatively coupled to said homing and indexing means,for rotating the reagent carousel and positioning a preselected reagent container support in a reagent supply zone wherein said reagent supply zone is oriented so that a reagent in a container in said preselected reagent container support is dispensable directly to a sample.
emphases added.the examiner rejected independent claim and dependent claims and of the application under as being unpatentable over two prior art references,wakatake et and assmann et.in response,the inventors argued that neither the wakatake nor the assmann reference disclosed the capability to dispense reagent directly to a sample 
e ven in the unlikely event that wakatake and assmann were successfully combined into one system,the resulting system would still lack the present invention novel capability to dispense reagent directly to a sample as set forth in applicants claim,at line.
t he recited apparatus provides for direct dispensing of reagent from a reagent container to a sample the present invention uses the drive means to rotate the reagent carousel.the reagent carousel holds the reagent containers.as can be seen in the figures,the reagent carousel is positioned above the samples and the reagent containers are oriented within the carousel with their outlet nozzles pointing down such that they are ready to dispense reagent directly to the sample below 
in contrast,wakatake et al teaches reagent tables positioned side by side with a reaction table.wakatake et al,figure.this side by side configuration precludes dispensing of the reagent directly to a sample or the incorporation of a reagent delivery zone as set forth in claim of the present invention.the wakatake side by side configuration requires an additional device,a reagent pipetting device,to transfer the reagent between tables and mediate the dispensing of reagent to the sample.the reagent pipetting device is used to suck up an aliquot of reagent from a reagent container on one of at least two reagent tables,pivot so that the pipetting tube of the device is held just above a selected reaction vessel on a separate reaction table,and dispense the aliquot of reagent to the vessel wakatake at column,line to column,line.such devices are referred to in the trade as sip and spit devices.
the district court held that these statements during prosecution amounted to a clear and unmistakable disclaimer of sip and spit dispensing from claim of the application.claim construction order,slip op.at.the district court further held that this disclaimer attached to claims and of the patent 
because there is a common claim limitation to which the disclaimer is directed direct dispensing.the court has already construed the claim term dispensing in the patent to mean direct dispensing and thus,the application and patent have the same claim limitation.the sip and spit disclaimer may properly attach to the patent direct dispensing limitation.
this court reviews claim construction de novo.cybor fas,en banc.on appeal,ventana argues that the district court improperly limited the scope of the term dispensing to cover only those methods of dispensing in which the reagent container is also the reagent dispenser,direct dispensing.accordingly,ventana asks this court to reverse the district court claim construction and construe the phrase dispensing to mean to apply reagent to the slide.we agree that the district court improperly imported limitations from the specification when it construed the term dispensing to require direct dispensing.
claim terms are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning.phillips awh,en banc quoting vitronics conceptronic.and the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art.id.at.in this case,ventana argues that there is nothing in the record to suggest that a person of ordinary skill in the art would interpret the disclosure and claims of the patent to mean that the term dispensing is limited to direct dispensing.we agree.
to start with,claims and do not contain any language that could be read to limit the term dispensing to require direct dispensing.although direct dispensing is one type of dispensing,biogenex does not appear to dispute that other types of dispensing,such as sip and spit dispensing,also fall within the ordinary meaning of dispensing.though the district court held that the word onto in the language of the claim necessitated direct dispensing because the claims require that reagent in the reagent container be dispensed onto the slide,biogenex agreed at oral argument that the word onto does not by itself exclude the sip and spit method of dispensing from the ordinary meaning of dispensing.
instead,biogenex argues that the patent specification compels a narrow construction of dispensing.biogenex first points to the background art section of the patent,which discusses a number of prior art automated staining devices,including a device that biogenex alleges employs the sip and spit method of dispensing.patent,ll.biogenex argues that because the patent goes on to state that t he previously known devices are limited in their performance and unable to satisfy the needs for automated,high precision immunohistology and that it was an object of the invention to provide a device which provides more rapid,reliable and more reproducible results than standard methods,id.at,ll,the patent makes clear that the invention does not practice the sip and spit method of dispensing.
we decline to interpret these general statements by the inventors to effect a complete surrender from the claims of the patent of all types of dispensing except direct dispensing.for one thing,the background art section includes discussion of a number of different prior art devices that employ a number of different dispensing techniques,including a device that employs a direct dispensing technique.id.at,stark,et al.describes a microprocessor controlled system including a revolving table or carousel supporting radially positioned slides.a stepper motor rotates the table,placing each slide under one of the stationary syringes positioned above the slides.a predetermined volume of liquid,determined by a dial,is delivered to a slide from each syringe.thus,if biogenex argument were correct,the inventors have also disavowed coverage of direct dispensing,which is the type of dispensing employed by the patent preferred embodiment.for this reason,biogenex argument can not be correct.
moreover,this is not a case in which the inventor distinguishing the invention over the prior art in the specification results in a disavowal of coverage by the inventor of features in the prior art.in phillips,we recognized that in certain cases,the specification may reveal an intentional disclaimer,or disavowal,of claim scope by the inventor.phillips,at.in such cases,this court interprets the claim more narrowly than it otherwise would to give effect to the inventor intent to disavow a broader claim scope.honeywell int l,itt,scimed life,advanced cardiovascular.here,however,biogenex points to only general statements by the inventors indicating that the invention is intended to improve upon prior art automated staining methods the previously known devices are limited in their performance and unable to satisfy the needs for automated,high precision immunohistology.it is an object of this invention to provide a device which provides more rapid,reliable and more reproducible results than standard methods patent,ll.such general statements,without more,will not be interpreted to disclaim every feature of every prior art device discussed in the background art section of the patent.
next,biogenex points out that all of the patent disclosed embodiments employ a direct dispensing method of dispensing.biogenex submits that when the specification is read in its entirety,one of skill in the art would come to the inescapable conclusion that the novelty of ventana invention is the birthday cake or carousel arrangement for direct dispensing.as a result,biogenex argues,the specification has implicitly defined the term dispensing to mean direct dispensing.
there are,however,several problems with this argument.it is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.phillips,at quoting water,safari water filtration.a lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention,we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments.id.at.while the fact that the disclosed embodiments are limited can assist in interpreting claim language,the mere fact that the patent discloses embodiments in which the reagent container is also the reagent dispenser does not in and of itself mean that the method claims at issue are limited to the disclosed embodiments.
the second problem with biogenex argument is that each claim does not necessarily cover every feature disclosed in the specification.when the claim addresses only some of the features disclosed in the specification,it is improper to limit the claim to other,unclaimed features.id.at see also golight,stores,p atentees are not required to include within each of their claims all of the advantages or features described as significant or important in the written description,an invention may possess a number of advantages or purposes,and there is no requirement that every claim directed to that invention be limited to encompass all of them.here,the claims of the patent are directed toward automated methods of dispensing that use bar codes to determine which reagents should be dispensed onto which slides.although the preferred embodiments also contain a direct dispensing feature,the inventors were not required to claim this feature in the patent and,indeed,did not do so.
ventana also argues that the district court erred in holding that the inventors of the patent disclaimed coverage of sip and spit dispensing during prosecution of the application,an ancestor of the patent.biogenex responds that the inventors disclaimed sip and spit dispensing when they distinguished the prior art sip and spit devices because of those devices inability to dispense reagent directly to a sample,as required claim of the application.
biogenex thus raises the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer.t he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution,making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.phillips,at.accordingly,we examine the patent prosecution history,when placed in evidence,to determine whether the inventor disclaimed a particular interpretation of a claim term during the prosecution of the patent in suit or during the prosecution of an ancestor application.advanced cardiovascular medtronic.but the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer generally does not apply when the claim term in the descendant patent uses different language.invitrogen clontech,t he prosecution of one claim term in a parent application will generally not limit different claim language in a continuation application,lansa,although a parent patent prosecution history may inform the claim construction of its descendant,the parent patent prosecution history is irrelevant to the meaning of this limitation because the two patents do not share the same claim language.advanced cardiovascular,at.
in this case,the allegedly disclaiming statements were made with respect to claim language that expressly required reagent in the reagent container to be dispensable directly to a sample.indeed,in distinguishing the prior art,the inventors stated that the prior art sip and spit devices lacked the present invention novel capability to dispense reagent directly to a sample as set forth in applicants claim,at line emphasis added.because claims and of the patent use different claim is,they do not require that reagent be dispensable directly to a sample the alleged disclaimer of sip and spit dispensing during the prosecution of the application does not apply to the asserted claims of the patent 
indeed,we agree with ventana that the prosecution history of the patent supports a broad construction of dispensing.for example,during the prosecution of the application that led to the patent,the examiner issued a restriction requirement.with respect to the application claims that eventually resulted in claims and of the patent,the examiner observed that the process as claimed can be practiced by another materially different apparatus or by hand,such as a manual pipette means.this statement shows that the patent examiner did not consider the dispensing claim term to be limited to the direct dispensing embodiment disclosed in the specification.moreover,the inventors did not rely on direct dispensing as a distinction between the claims at issue in this case and the prior art.instead,in response to rejections over the prior art,the inventors limited their arguments to the ability of the claimed inventions to address the shortcomings of manual reagent identification and manual determination of reagent dispensing protocols.
biogenex next argues that the inventors disclaimed sip and spit dispensing from claims and of the patent during the prosecution of two patents,the patent and the patent.the district court did not address the relevance,if any,of the prosecution histories of the and the patents in its claim construction opinion.nevertheless,for the reasons described below,we agree with ventana that the prosecution histories of these later patents do not inform the proper construction of dispensing in claims and of the patent.
the patent issued from patent application the application.each of the patents resulted from continuations of the application independent claim of the application which issued as claim of the patent provided,in part 
a biological reaction apparatus for dispensing a selected reagent to a slide containing a sample,said biological reaction apparatus comprising a reagent carousel having a plurality of reagent container supports thereon 
a homing and indexing device,operatively coupled to the reagent carousel,for identifying the position of each reagent container support with reference to a home position 
and a motor engaging the reagent carousel and operatively coupled to said homing and indexing device,for rotating the reagent carousel and positioning a preselected reagent container support in a reagent supply zone,wherein said reagent supply zone is oriented so that reagent in a container in said preselected reagent container support is dispensable to a slide and wherein each of the reagent container supports is arranged to accommodate a reagent container such that it is positioned above a slide when in the reagent supply zone whereby the reagent is dispensable from a lower end of said container onto the slide 
emphases added.
in responding to a obviousness rejection of application claim and its corresponding dependent claims,the inventors distinguished a prior art sip and spit reference because it transferred reagents by pipettes into cuvettes held in sample analysis carousels that are adjacent to and not below the reagent carousel as required by the claims.in distinguishing another prior art reference,the inventors stated that 
the invention of claim et includes a sample carousel arranged beneath a reagent carousel and the reagent is dispensed onto a slides sic position below the reagent carousel 
locating the carousel including samples containing slides below the reagent carousel is an important feature of the claimed invention because it allows the reagent to be applied directly to the samples on the slides.
biogenex asserts that these statements amount to a disclaimer of sip and spit dispensing that should be applied to the claims of the paten
