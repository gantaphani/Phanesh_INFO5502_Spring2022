andrew von eschenbach,acting commissioner of the food and drug administration,the united states food and drug administration fda or the agency,michael leavitt,secretary of the department of health and human services,the department of health and human services,and the united states,appeal from a judgment of the district court denying their motion for summary judgment and granting the of for summary judgment.nutraceutical crawford,d,nutraceutical corporation and its subsidiary,solaray corporation collectively,nutraceutical,manufacture and sell ephedra,a product containing dietary supplements eds.in,the fda issued a regulation which banned all eds sales in the united states market.nutraceutical brought this action challenging the regulation as unlawful.the district court agreed with nutraceutical.id.at.our jurisdiction arises under,and we reverse.
background 
in its published decision,the district court determined that the analysis employed by the fda to support an eds ban was contrary to the intent of congress and that the fda had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that eds pose an unreasonable risk of illness or injury at milligrams mg or less a day.nutraceutical,d.it accordingly entered summary judgment in favor of nutraceutical,enjoined the fda from enforcing its proscription against nutraceutical for the sale of products with a recommended daily dosage of mg or less of eds and remanded to the fda for new.
the issues raised by this appeal are whether the fda correctly interpreted the relevant statute to require a analysis in determining if a dietary supplement presents an unreasonable risk of illness or injury and whether the fda satisfied its burden of proving that dietary supplements containing eds present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury when doses of mg or less per day are suggested or recommended in labeling.
nutraceutical alleges that the fda lacked statutory authority to promulgate and enforce a ban of all eds.the fda argues that it acted pursuant to the broad authority delegated to it by the food,drug and cosmetic act fdca,et,to regulate dietary supplements for safety.the fdca provides the fda with broad authority to regulate food,drug,and dietary supplement products in order to ensure public health and safety.id.in,congress amended the fdca with the dietary supplement health and education act dshea,stat.under dshea,the fda regulates vitamins,minerals,herbs,amino acids,and other dietary substances.dietary supplements are generally regulated in a manner similar to food and the fda is authorized to prevent adulterated products from entering the market.see a,b,c,k adulteration and distribution of adulterated food are prohibited acts.congress declared that a dietary supplement is adulterated 
if it is a dietary supplement or contains a dietary ingredient that 
a presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under 
i conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling,or 
ii if no conditions of use are suggested or recommended in the labeling,under ordinary conditions of use 
f.the fda argues that eds are adulterated and points to the unreasonable risk of illness or injury provision of dshea as the primary source of statutory authority for its eds ban.f a.
ephedrine alkaloids are a class of chemical stimulants that occur naturally in some botanicals.in the and,manufacturers promoted the sale of eds for weight loss and athletic performance enhancement.in the,the fda received numerous adverse event reports aers which documented harmful side effects,including heart attacks,strokes,seizures,and death,associated with eds intake based on the circumstantial evidence of the aers,the fda began to investigate the effects of eds.the investigation included a literature review of scientific studies and a food advisory committee on dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids meeting held on august,food advisory committee.in,the agency proposed a regulation which would have required specific warnings and established a dosage regimen.june.
the fda proposed regulation of eds faced substantial opposition,including from the general accounting office gao.the gao determined that the fda had not been thorough in its investigation and requested further research.see gao,dietary supplements uncertainties in analyses underlying fda proposed rule on ephedrine alkaloids.responding to the gao concerns,the fda withdrew the proposed regulation.
the fda continued to receive aers and compile scientific literature regarding eds.given the fact that dietary supplement manufacturers are not required to submit scientific data on their products,the body of scientific literature on eds was limited.among the studies on which the fda relied was a report commissioned by the national institutes of health.to further supplement the record,the agency hired mario inchiosa,to conduct further research on the health effects of eds in.during the public notice and comment period,nutraceutical submitted to the fda several requests for an exemption of eds,to no avail.the administrative record grew to over pages,approximately aers were collected and extensive public notice and comment resulted in over comments.
after seven years of investigating eds,the fda adopted a regulation which banned eds at all dosage levels from the national market.final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk,final rule.in the final rule,the fda concluded that t he best clinical evidence for a benefit supports only a modest weight loss,insufficient to positively affect cardiovascular risk factors or health conditions associated with being overweight or obese.id.at.based on this analysis,the fda determined that all eds present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury under all ordinary or recommended conditions of use.id.at.as such,the final rule classified eds adulterated within the meaning of dshea.
the district court held that the fda requirement that eds demonstrate a benefit is contrary to the clear intent of congress and found the agency definition of unreasonable as entailing a analysis to be improper.d.the district court also found that the fda failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a dosage of mg or less of ephedrine alkaloids presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.id.at.based on these findings,the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs and denied summary judgment for defendants.
discussion 
standard of review 
the district court conclusions as to whether the fda had acted pursuant to congressionally delegated authority in promulgating a rule is reviewed de novo.however,the parties dispute the appropriate standard of review of the administrative decision.dshea provides that the court shall decide any issue under this paragraph on a de novo basis.f.the district court did not reach the question of whether the fda statutory construction should be reviewed de novo.d at.in the interest of clarity and consistency,we now reach this question.
courts are to review agency actions under dshea using the traditional tools of statutory construction.pharmanex shalala,cir.the de novo standard,under section f,applies to enforcement actions by the united states against manufacturers of dietary supplements.such enforcement actions may result in imprisonment or monetary fines.see united states park,d.reading the statute as a whole,it is clear that the de novo standard applies when courts decide matters rather than when they review administrative decisions.as such,it is appropriate to limit the de novo standard of review,which affords the fda no deference,to enforcement proceedings.challenges by private parties to fda rules promulgated under dshea are reviewed pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,and the normal rules for judicial deference regarding agency action apply.nve,hhs,cir.had congress intended to supplant the procedures for apa challenges,it would have been clearer about its objective.id.at.
chevron analysis 
a court reviewing the fda construction of the fdca must determine whether congress has directly spoken to precise question at issue and if not,then whether agency construction of statute is permissible one.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.in reviewing the fda interpretation of dshea under chevron,we ask two questions 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress chevron step.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.if congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated authority to an agency,legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute chevron step.

the apa reflects the principles of chevron and provides that agency action must be set aside if the action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or if the action failed to meet statutory,procedural,or constitutional requirements.valley cmty.comm mineta,cir internal quotation omitted citing.when we review an agency decision under the arbitrary,capricious or abuse of discretion standard of the apa,our review is narrow and deferential we must uphold the agency action if it has articulated a rational basis for the decision and has considered relevant factors.slingluff occupational safety health review comm n,cir citing mountain side mobile estates sec y of hud,cir.under the apa,regulations are presumed to be valid,and review is deferential to the government agency.
unreasonable risk 
in this case,we must determine whether congress unambiguously manifested its intent to restrict the fda from weighing benefits when determining the risk posed by a dietary supplement.the district court was correct to proceed under chevron step one in deciding the question of whether the fda properly used a analysis in determining whether eds pose an unreasonable risk.chevron,at.we nevertheless reverse the district court after finding that congress unambiguously required the fda to conduct a analysis under dshea.
in,congress enacted dshea to clarify that dietary supplements,absent declarations promoting the supplements as drugs,would be regulated in a manner similar to food products.accordingly,in the interest of public health,congress imposed a duty on the fda to keep adulterated dietary supplements off the market.stat.at instructing the fda to take swift action against dietary supplements that are unsafe or adulterated.dshea classifies a dietary supplement as adulterated if it presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.f.the fda understood t he plain meaning of unreasonable to connote comparison of the risks and benefits of the product.we agree.the plain language of the statute directs the fda to restrict distribution of dietary supplements which pose any risk that is unreasonable in light of its potential benefits.see merck kgaa integra lifesciences i,d unanimously finding that unreasonable risk,as used in another fdca provision,i b i,involves a comparison of the risks and the benefits.
congress enacted dshea in an effort to improve public access to dietary supplements based on the belief that there may be a positive relationship between dietary supplement use,reduced expenses,and disease prevention.see pharmanex,at it is true that dshea was enacted to alleviate the regulatory burdens on the dietary supplement industry,allowing consumers greater access to safe dietary supplements in order to promote greater wellness among the american population.citation omitted.the fdca should not be read too restrictively but in manner consistent with the statute overriding purpose to protect public health.see et united states rx depot,cir the fdca primary purpose is to protect the public health.citing united states v.an article of drug,d.accordingly,dshea should receive a liberal construction where the fda has taken remedial steps in response to a perceived public health problem.
according to the district court,by injecting a analysis,the fda required nutraceutical to make a showing of the benefits of its product.however,at no time has the fda required manufacturers of eds to provide data on the benefits of their products.rather,the fda has assumed its responsibility of gathering data,soliciting comments,and conducting the analysis congress expressly placed the burden of proof on the government to determine whether a dietary supplement is adulterated.accordingly,eds were allowed to enter the market without findings of safety or effectiveness.the fda did not impose a requirement for the sale of eds.for example,nutraceutical has been selling eds since.as dictated by the statutory scheme,the fda assumed the duty of surveillance and imposed the eds ban following numerous aers,public notice and comment,and significant scientific review.see.based on the record,we disagree with the district court and find that the fda did not shift the burden of proof to manufacturers.the analysis is conducted by,and at the expense of,the agency.id.at the agency performs a analysis to ascertain whether the risks of the product outweigh its benefits.despite nutraceutical characterization of the process,the agency did not require proof of a substantial benefit to counterbalance risk as a condition precedent to lawful sale of eds.appellee brief,at.the burden remains on the agency to show that risks associated with a dietary supplement outweigh benefits and are,therefore,unreasonable.thus,a analysis does not undermine congressional intent by improperly shifting the burden of proof onto manufacturers of dietary supplements.
under the rules of statutory construction,courts consider the whole act and evaluate terms in context.pharmanex,at we examine the statutory provision in context.the rule against surplusage encourages courts to give meaning to every word used in a statute to realize congressional intent.in effect,this rule embodies the belief that congress would not have included superfluous language.thus,in dshea,an unreasonable risk has a meaning independent from a significant risk.the plain meaning of a significant risk is a great danger.unreasonable risk is a distinct term and requires more than evaluation of the significance of risk.a risk could be significant but reasonable if the benefits were great enough to outweigh the risks.at.in other words,an unreasonable risk is relative to the circumstances the potential risk is more unreasonable if the potential benefit is smaller.see castrignano squibb sons,cir upholding jury instructions which define unreasonable as the balance between the expected beneficial effects of the product as opposed to its harmful effects,if any.the district court erred by conflating the terms significant and unreasonable,thereby rendering unreasonable superfluous.in contrast to significant risk,unreasonable risk accounts for whether the benefits justify the risks.the use of unreasonable to qualify risk in addition to significant makes it clear that congress intended to integrate a analysis in the former.thus,because we find the statute is clear,we now review the fda absolute prohibition of eds under the apa.
conditions of use 
under dshea,the government bears the burden of proof to show that,under conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling,a dietary supplement is adulterated.f a i.it is undisputed that the fda must consider the dosage recommended in a dietary supplement labeling when making an adulteration determination under section f a.the district court held that the fda failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a dosage of mg or less of ephedrine alkaloids presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury,and has failed to give effect to the language of f a i.d at.
