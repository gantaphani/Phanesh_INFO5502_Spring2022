background 
hormone replacement therapy 
hormone replacement therapy hrt drugs are used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.such symptoms include hot flashes,chills,headache,irritability,and vaginal atrophy.hrt drugs consist of a combination of estrogen and progestin.the women health initiative whi,a group focused on defining the risks and benefits of strategies that could reduce heart disease,cancer,and fractures in women,began studying the effects of hrt drugs in the.the whi enrolled women between and years of age into a set of clinical trials.
whi studied the effect of estrogen plus progestin in women with an intact uterus.women were either assigned a daily dose of estrogen plus progestin or a placebo.in,an independent data and safety monitoring board revealed that the number of cases of breast cancer in the estrogen plus progestin group had crossed the boundary established as a signal of increased risk.the independent board recommended that the trial be ended early based on an increased breast cancer risk.the results of the whi study were published in the journal of the american medical association.see risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women,am.med.ass,available at.org cgi content full.
b.the lawsuits 
this case concerns three lawsuits.the kirkland suit was brought by women who each alleged injuries resulting from their use of hrt medications.the kirkland plaintiffs alleged they each developed breast cancer after taking hrt drugs that were manufactured,marketed,and sold by one or more of eleven manufacturers.fourteen kirkland plaintiffs are citizens of the same state as at least one of the manufacturers.three of those fourteen plaintiffs asserted claims against manufacturers with the same citizenship.for example,nancy states is a citizen of pennsylvania,the same state as wyeth pharmaceuticals,a company that manufactured and marketed hrt drugs she took.
the jasperson suit was brought by rick jasperson,as trustee of the of six decedents who used hrt drugs.the jasperson plaintiffs alleged that in each case,the sustained injuries when a woman family member developed breast cancer as a result of taking hrt drugs that were manufactured,marketed,and sold by one or more of six defendants.one of the six decedents,elizabeth mendelson,was a citizen of new jersey,the same state as pharmacia corporation,wyeth,and pharmacia upjohn company,companies that manufactured and marketed hrt drugs that mendelson took.
the allen suit was brought by women who also alleged they each developed breast cancer as a result of hrt medications manufactured,marketed,and sold by one or more of eight defendants.five allen plaintiffs are citizens of the same state as at least one of the defendants.three of these five plaintiffs asserted claims against manufacturers who were citizens of the same state.for example,rachel epstein is a citizen of new york,the same state as pfizer,a company that manufactured and marketed hrt drugs that she took.
procedural history 
the kirkland,jasperson,and allen plaintiffs filed suits for damages in minnesota state court in july.in each of the three consolidated cases,the plaintiffs alleged they or a decedent family member had developed breast cancer from taking hrt medications.the plaintiffs asserted state law claims for negligence,strict liability,breach of implied warranty,breach of express warranty,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and statutory violations of the false and misleading advertising act,the prevention of consumer fraud act,and the uniform deceptive trade practices act.
the manufacturers removed all three cases to the united states district court for the district of minnesota.in the manufacturers removal petitions,they argued diversity jurisdiction existed under the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine.they alleged that the plaintiffs joined their claims together against the manufacturers to defeat diversity jurisdiction.the manufacturers argued that the plaintiffs claims were fraudulently misjoined,stating that those claims did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence,a requirement for joinder under federal rule of civil procedure a.
the plaintiffs filed motions to remand the cases to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting that complete diversity between the plaintiffs and defendants did not exist.before the plaintiffs motions were addressed,the litigation came before the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl.the kirkland and jasperson cases were transferred to the eastern district of arkansas and assigned to an mdl judge.plaintiffs requested that the mdl court rule on their pending motions to remand to state court.
before the mdl court ruled on the question of remand,on december,the manufacturers moved to dismiss most of the claims brought by the kirkland plaintiffs and all of the claims brought on behalf of the jasperson decedents on the grounds that the plaintiffs claims were duplicative of earlier filed california claims plaintiffs oppositions to the motions were due on december,and they requested an extension of time to reply to the manufacturers motions to dismiss.
on december,the court denied plaintiffs requests for an extension,stating that it did not grant your motion for extension of time to respond,because i satisfied that you could say anything that would change my mind on the issues involved here.on that same day,the court denied in part plaintiffs motions to remand the kirkland and jasperson cases to state court,concluding that the plaintiffs were misjoined.the court stated that there was no reason for the joinder of the plaintiffs other than to defeat diversity jurisdiction,and explained 
mdl courts have repeatedly held that misjoined plaintiffs will not defeat diversity e ven if a plaintiff has a valid cause of action against a defendant,that plaintiff may not prevent removal based on diversity of citizenship if there is no reasonable basis for the joinder of that plaintiff with the other plaintiffs.quotations omitted.
appellants add.at.
the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to properly join under rule because t he only thing common among plaintiffs is that they took an hrt not necessarily the same hrt drug.plaintiffs are residents of different states and were prescribed different hrt drugs by different doctors,for different lengths of time,in different amounts,and they suffered different injuries.id.at.
the court granted four of the kirkland and jasperson plaintiffs motions to remand because those plaintiffs had asserted claims against a defendant who was from the same state.the court denied kirkland and jasperson plaintiffs motions to remand because the plaintiffs were not asserting claims against manufacturers from the same state.the court granted the manufacturers motions to dismiss as to these plaintiffs.the court dropped the plaintiffs from the lawsuit and dismissed their claims,because they duplicated california claims.
on december,the plaintiffs moved pursuant to rule e to alter or amend the december orders of dismissal.the plaintiffs argued that the court improperly dismissed the cases without giving them an opportunity to respond to the motions,and the court abused its discretion by dismissing the cases rather than staying the minnesota actions pending disposition of the california cases.the district court denied the rule e motions on december.
in february,the united states judicial panel on mdl transferred the allen case to the same mdl court for coordinated proceedings with other pending hrt cases.on february,plaintiffs refiled their motions to remand the allen case to state court.the court denied the motions on that same day,stating that the plaintiffs were improperly joined under rule and that he could see no reason for the joinder of the plaintiffs other than to defeat diversity jurisdiction.id.at.the court granted three of the allen plaintiffs motions to remand because those women had asserted claims against a manufacturer who was from the same state.the court granted the manufacturers motions to dismiss as to the remaining plaintiffs.the court dropped the remaining plaintiffs from the lawsuit and dismissed their claims because of their duplicative cases.
as a result of the district court orders in kirkland,jasperson,and allen,seven plaintiffs cases were remanded to state court and the remaining plaintiffs were dropped from the litigation and their cases were dismissed.
the dismissed plaintiffs appeal the district court december,orders and judgments denying plaintiffs motions to remand to state court and granting defendants motions to dismiss duplicative cases and the district court december,orders on plaintiffs rule e motions to alter or amend the final orders of dismissal.plaintiffs argue the district court erred in denying their motions to remand to state court when it adopted the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine erred by dismissing the plaintiffs from the cases without giving them a reasonable opportunity to be heard and abused its discretion by refusing to stay the duplicative minnesota claims pending final resolution of the california claim.we reverse on the first issue thus we need not address the final two issues.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue the district court erred in denying their motions to remand by applying a discredited theory known as fraudulent misjoinder when it concluded they were improperly joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction.
we review the district court denial of the remand motion de novo.menz new holland north america,cir see also wilkinson shackelford,cir whether a plaintiff has fraudulently joined a party to defeat diversity jurisdiction is a question of subject matter jurisdiction we review de novo.
a defendant may remove a state law claim to federal court only if the action originally could have been filed there.phipps fdic,cir.diversity jurisdiction under requires an amount in controversy greater than and complete diversity of citizenship among the litigants.a.complete diversity of citizenship exists where no defendant holds citizenship in the same state where any plaintiff holds citizenship.onepoint solutions,llc borchert,cir.
after removal,a plaintiff may move to remand the case to state court,and the case should be remanded if it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.c.the defendant bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.altimore mount mercy college,cir.all doubts about federal jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand to state court.wilkinson,at.
courts have long recognized fraudulent joinder as an exception to the complete diversity rule.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward copper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.fraudulent joinder occurs when a plaintiff files a frivolous or illegitimate claim against a defendant solely to prevent removal.filla norfolk ry,cir.when determining if a party has been fraudulently joined,a court considers whether there is any reasonable basis in fact or law to support a claim against a nondiverse defendant.wilkinson,at.
a more recent,somewhat different,and novel exception to the complete diversity rule is the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine which one appellate court and several district courts have adopted.fraudulent misjoinder 
occurs when a plaintiff sues a diverse defendant in state court and joins a viable claim involving a nondiverse party,or a resident defendant,even though the plaintiff has no reasonable procedural basis to join them in one action because the claims bear no relation to each other.in such cases,some courts have concluded that diversity is not defeated where the claim that destroys diversity has no real connection with the controversy involving the claims that would qualify for diversity jurisdiction.
ronald parsons,should the eighth circuit recognize procedural misjoinder.
the eleventh circuit first considered and adopted the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine in tapscott ms dealer serv,cir.tapscott concerned a putative class action filed in alabama state court.id.at.in the initial complaint,one alabama plaintiff sued four defendants,one of whom was an alabama resident.id.the first amended complaint added sixteen named plaintiffs and named defendants.id.the plaintiffs then amended their complaint again,naming four additional plaintiffs,all alabama residents,and three named defendants.id.one of those defendants,lowe home centers,was a north carolina resident.id.
the initial complaint and first amended complaint alleged fraud violations arising from the sale of automobile service contracts.id.the second amended complaint alleged fraud violations arising from the sale of extended service contracts in connection with the sale of retail products.id.the result of the amended complaints and joinder under rule was to create two distinct groups of plaintiffs and defendants the automobile class and the diverse merchant class.id.at.
lowe home centers removed the case to federal court and moved to sever the claims against it from the claims against the automobile class defendants.id.at.the plaintiffs moved to remand to state court for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.id.the district court granted lowe home centers motion to sever and denied the plaintiffs motion to remand to state court,holding that there was no allegation of joint liability between lowe and any other defendant and no allegation of conspiracy and there was an improper and fraudulent joinder,bordering on a sham.id.at internal quotations omitted.
on appeal,the eleventh circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion to remand.id.the court held there was misjoinder under rule because there was no real connection between the two sets of alleged transactions.id.the court reasoned that the alleged transactions concerning the automobile class were wholly distinct from the transactions involving the merchant class.id.the only similarity between the two classes was that both classes violated particular fraud provisions in the alabama state code.id.the eleventh circuit cautioned that mere misjoinder is not fraudulent misjoinder.id.however,the plaintiffs joinder of these two groups of unrelated defendants was so egregious as to constitute fraudulent joinder.id.therefore,the eleventh circuit reasoned that the district court did not err in concluding the plaintiffs attempted to defeat diversity jurisdiction by misjoinder.id.
courts reactions to tapscott have been mixed.some district courts have adopted the doctrine as a means of ensuring defendants their statutory right of removal to the federal courts and precluding plaintiffs from preventing removal to federal court.see,in re diet drugs,wl,at.july,unreported explaining that plaintiffs egregious misjoinder wrongfully deprives defendants of their right of removal.reed american medical sec.group,d,adopting the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine because diverse defendants ought not be deprived of their right to a federal forum by such a contrivance as this.see also laura hines steven gensler,driving misjoinder the improper party problem in removal jurisdiction,explaining that fraudulent misjoinder protects access to federal courts.
other courts have criticized tapscott,arguing that questions of joinder under state law do not implicate federal subject matter jurisdiction,federal jurisdiction is to be narrowly construed,and the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine has created an unpredictable and complex jurisdictional rule.see,osborn metropolitan life ins,
