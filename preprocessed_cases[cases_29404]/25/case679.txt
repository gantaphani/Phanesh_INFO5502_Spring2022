following a bench trial,the united states district court for the northern district of illinois determined that the generic paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate product to be produced by apotex,apotex,and torpharm,collectively apotex will not infringe claim of patent patent owned by smithkline beecham and beecham group,collectively smithkline.smithkline beecham apotex,d.based on this court revision of the trial court erroneous claim construction,apotex product would infringe claim of the patent.nonetheless,because claim of the patent is invalid as anticipated under b,this court affirms the district court judgment in favor of apotex.
in the late,a british company,ferrosan,invented a new class of compounds,including a compound that became known as paroxetine.see patent patent.the patent claims paroxetine and its salts and discloses their antidepressant properties.ferrosan eventually developed a process to produce the crystalline hydrochloride salt of paroxetine,or paroxetine hydrochloride phc.in,ferrosan licensed the patent and its other technology to smithkline.smithkline began manufacturing phc in its harlow plant in england.
in march,alan curzons,a chemist in smithkline worthing,england laboratory,discovered a new crystalline form of phc while attempting to improve phc production.curzons test results established that the new product was the hemihydrous form of phc phc hemihydrate.ferrosan original form was anhydrous phc phc anhydrate.phc anhydrate comprises crystals of phc without bound water molecules.phc hemihydrate comprises phc crystals with one bound water molecule for every two phc molecules.phc hemihydrate proved more stable,and thus more easily packaged and preserved,than phc anhydrate.
smithkline filed a patent application in the british patent office on october,relating to crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride,its preparation and its uses as a therapeutic agent.the british application identified the invention as both the hemihydrate and the anhydrate form of phc,as well as mixtures that contain a major portion of either form.one year later,on october,smithkline filed a application claiming priority to the british application that issued as the patent in.the patent does not claim phc anhydrate and does not claim mixtures of the two phc forms.the only claim at issue in this case is claim,which reads in its entirety crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate.
in,after completing the necessary fda approval process,smithkline placed its antidepressant drug with phc hemihydrate as the active ingredient on the market under the name paxil.in,torpharm,an apotex affiliate and manufacturer of apotex generic antidepressant,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda,under j,seeking approval to market its own phc antidepressant drug.apotex identified the active ingredient in its antidepressant as phc anhydrate.apotex anda included a paragraph iv certification,see j a iv,that indicated apotex intent to market the drug before the expiration of the patent because its drug would not infringe that patent.
in,smithkline initiated this infringement action against apotex under e on the basis of apotex anda filing.smithkline alleges that apotex proposed drug will infringe claim of the patent.smithkline does not allege that claim of the patent covers phc anhydrate.after all,phc ferrosan prior art for the patent.smithkline asserts that apotex will infringe by manufacturing phc anhydrate tablets that necessarily contain,by a conversion process discussed below,at least trace amounts of phc hemihydrate.
the parties filed various summary judgment motions,including cross motions for summary judgment that claim of the patent was invalid or valid under b for an impermissible public use.the b motions acknowledged that clinical trials occurred more than one year before smithkline filing date for the patent,but disputed whether those tests qualified for the experimental use negation.the district court denied apotex motion and granted smithkline motion,holding that the patent was not invalid for public use under b.the district court reasoned that the clinical trials qualified as experimental uses.see smithkline beecham apotex,d.
the district court then held a bench trial to determine the proper interpretation of claim and to resolve the remaining infringement and validity issues.on the question of claim construction,the district court limited claim to phc hemihydrate in commercially significant amounts.smithkline beecham,d at.the trial record contained uncontested testimony that a phc mixture would need to possess a percentage of phc hemihydrate in the high double digits if the hemihydrate component were to contribute any commercial value.id.the district court imported that commercial significance into the claim and held that apotex proposed phc drug will not infringe claim of the patent.the district court found,as a factual matter,that apotex phc anhydrate tablets will not contain commercially significant amounts of phc hemihydrate and rejected smithkline evidence to the contrary.id.at.the trial court also determined that claim is not invalid.
smithkline contested the district court claim interpretation noting that claim is clear on its face and encompasses phc hemihydrate in any amount,however small or insignificant.in rejecting that proposed claim interpretation,the district court also opined that smithkline proposed construction would render claim indefinite.the district court reasoned that smithkline interpretation would place potential infringers in the untenable position of never knowing whether their product infringes because even a single undetectable crystal of phc hemihydrate would infringe.id.at.
to show that manufacture of phc anhydrate tablets necessarily creates phc hemihydrate,smithkline proffered expert testimony on the seeding or disappearing polymorph theory.under this theory,ferrosan may have originally created a crystalline compound,namely phc anhydrate,in a relatively unstable form.for presently unknown reasons,the phc anhydrate morphed into a more stable form,namely the phc hemihydrate discovered in smithkline facilities.with this new form or polymorph in existence,smithkline experts explained,the general environment became seeded with crystals of phc hemihydrate.in this seeded environment,the phc anhydrate converts to the phc hemihydrate upon its inevitable contact with seeds of phc hemihydrate.in other words,the creation of pure phc anhydrate became extremely difficult,if not impossible the old polymorph,pch anhydrate,has effectively disappeared in its pure form because it changes naturally into the new polymorph,pch hemihydrate.
smithkline experts applied the disappearing polymorph theory to show that apotex phc anhydrate tablets inevitably convert to hemihydrate when combined with moisture,pressure,and practically ubiquitous phc hemihydrate seeds.the district court found that smithkline evidence on the seeding and the disappearing polymorph theories supported the inference that apotex phc anhydrate tablets will contain at least trace,even if undetectable,amounts of phc hemihydrate.id.at.thus,under smithkline claim construction,the district court held that apotex phc anhydrate drug would infringe claim of the patent.id.
alternatively,if claim was construed to cover any amount of phc hemihydrate and was,therefore,infringed,the district court purported to create a new equitable defense to infringement in favor of apotex.id.at.under this new defense,smithkline was responsible for producing the hemihydrate,which,by virtue of smithkline disappearing polymorph theory,seeded the environment.consequently,smithkline caused the alleged infringement.the district court reasoned that apotex should enjoy the right to practice the prior art by manufacturing phc anhydrate.accordingly,under its alternative equitable defense,the district court absolved apotex of liability for the consequences of smithkline own conduct that rendered the practice of the prior art impossible without infringing the patent.the district court also held that its inherent equitable powers and the equitable nature of injunctions in general placed the injunction mandated by e a within the discretion of the district court.id.at.
smithkline also sought to assert a claim of induced infringement against apotex on the theory that phc anhydrate tablets convert to phc hemihydrate in the stomach of a patient due to the increased humidity and pressure present inside the stomach.id.at.the district court excluded smithkline evidence on this issue,finding that smithkline would likely not meet its burden of showing gastrointestinal infringement.id.at.finally,the district court considered other alternative claim constructions,which would allow claim to cover phc hemihydrate in amounts detectable either by methods available at the time the patent was filed or by any means that later became available.id.at.the record shows that smithkline presented the results of tests on various samples of apotex tablets.these tests showed phc hemihydrate in the apotex product.the district court rejected this evidence as unreliable,mainly because smithkline counsel excluded certain tablets from the testing without reasonable explanation.id.at.the trial court found these excluded tablets to represent the product apotex would manufacture upon anda approval.id.accordingly,the district court held that smithkline did not prove that apotex tablets will contain any detectable amount of phc hemihydrate.
smithkline presents five arguments on appeal.first,the district court erred in limiting claim to commercially significant amounts of phc hemihydrate.second,contrary to the district court ruling,a claim construction that covers phc hemihydrate in any amount does not render claim indefinite.third,the district court erred in creating an equitable defense to infringement based on smithkline contribution to causing the infringement.fourth,the district court erred in holding that the injunctive relief required under e is within the district court discretion.fifth,the district court abused its discretion in excluding smithkline evidence of induced infringement.
in its,apotex argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment that smithkline clinical tests qualified as an experimental use.in particular,apotex asserts that claim of the patent is invalid for public use under b as a matter of law.this court has jurisdiction over these appeals under a.

in this case,both parties sought summary judgment the district court granted one and denied the other.thus,the record shows that the parties conceded,and the district court found,that no material factual issues remain in dispute.see beech aircraft,at.if this court determines that no material facts remain in dispute,it may proceed to determine entitlement to judgment under the law.see eli lilly barr,r eversal is required if the district court engaged in a faulty legal analysis in applying the law to the facts and a correct application of the law to those facts might bring a different result.quoting litton indus,solid state,see also anderson liberty lobby,d.

factual findings 
as an initial matter,this court holds that the record,for the most part,supports the district court factual findings.in particular,the district court did not clearly err in concluding that apotex phc anhydrate product will include trace amounts of phc hemihydrate based on the record evidence that the anhydrate form inevitably changes into the hemihydrate form.see smithkline beecham,d at.
the district court also did not clearly err in finding that apotex anhydrate product will not contain detectable quantities of phc hemihydrate because smithkline selectively tested the apotex samples without explaining its reasons for excluding some apotex products from the examination.specifically,the district court discretionary exclusion of smithkline unreliable evidence on this issue does not render the subsequent factual finding clearly erroneous.
although the district court clearly accepts as true the theories of disappearing polymorphs and seeding,it did not make findings of fact regarding precisely how or when phc hemihydrate first came into existence.indeed,traces of phc hemihydrate in phc anhydrate pills were not detectible in amounts less than five percent before.however,curzons undisputedly made his serendipitous discovery of phc hemihydrate while making phc anhydrate presumably pursuant to the teachings of the patent.moreover,although curzons does not claim to have discovered phc hemihydrate until march,further review of samples of smithkline phc anhydrate revealed that smithkline harlow plant had unwittingly made phc hemihydrate as early as december.these undisputed facts conclusively establish that phc anhydrate made in accordance with the patent converts into phc hemihydrate both with and without seeding.accordingly,this court decides the legal issues in this appeal against the factual background as determined by the district court.
claim construction indefiniteness 
claim interpretation requires the court to ascertain the meaning of the claim to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention,lansa,phillips petroleum huntsman polymers.this task requires the court to place the claim language in its proper technological and temporal context.the best tools for this enterprise are the various forms of intrinsic evidence and,when appropriate,extrinsic evidence.see vitronics,conceptronic.the intrinsic evidence,the patent itself,including the claims,the specification and,if in evidence,the prosecution history is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.id.
of course,at all times,the language of the claims governs their scope and meaning.see dow chem.sumitomo chem.unless the intrinsic evidence compels a contrary conclusion,the claim language carries the meaning accorded those words in the usage of skilled artisans at the time of invention.see vitronics,at.
as stated earlier,claim of the patent reads crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate.this language is not ambiguous but rather describes a very specific compound.the record repeatedly shows that artisans in this area of technology at the time of invention would have understood that the claim embraces phc hemihydrate without further limitation.
the inquiry proceeds to the remainder of the intrinsic record to determine if the patent applicant gave these unambiguous words some unexpected definition.the district court limited claim to commercially significant amounts of phc hemihydrate.the trial court found support for this limitation in portions of the patent that discuss the pharmaceutical and commercial properties of phc hemihydrate.smithkline beecham,d at.for example,the specification discusses the superior handling properties of the hemihydrate form that improve the manufacture of phc.those references,however,do not redefine the compound in terms of its commercial properties,but emphasize that the new compound exhibits favorable characteristics.a description of characteristics does not redefine a compound with an established and unambiguous structural definition.
moreover,nothing in the patent limits that structural compound to its commercial embodiments.rather,the specification discloses phc hemihydrate as a compound without reference to its commercial applications.for example,the specification states that the present invention provides crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate as a novel compound.patent,ii.furthermore,nothing in the prosecution history of the patent defines the invention in terms of commercially significant quantities.thus,reading claim in the context of the intrinsic evidence,the conclusion is inescapable that the claim encompasses,without limitation,phc crystal form of paroxetine hydrochloride that contains one molecule of bound water for every two molecules of paroxetine hydrochloride in the crystal structure.
the district court openly discussed the policies that led to its insertion of commercially significant quantities as a limitation on the meaning of the claimed compound.smithkline beecham,d at.the district court observed that a claim construction that covers trace amounts of phc hemihydrate would likely preclude attempts to make the prior art phc anhydrate compound.id.after explaining the in terrorem effect of such a broad claim construction,the district court rejected the literal scope of claim because it would produce absurd results and would not serve any policy of patent law.id.claim construction,however,is not a inquiry.as stated earlier,it is a contextual interpretation of language.the scope of patent claims can neither be broadened nor narrowed based on abstract policy considerations regarding the effect of a particular claim meaning.see quantum rodime,plc,i t is well settled that no matter how great the temptations of fairness or policy making,courts do not redraft claims.for this precise reason,this court has repeatedly stated that a court must construe claims without considering the implications of covering a particular product or process.see neomagic trident microsys,sri int l matsushita.
the district court also justified its limitation to preserve the claim validity in the face of a challenge to its definiteness under,second paragraph.in essence,the district court considered the claim indefinite if construed to cover undetectable trace amounts of phc hemihydrate.in other words,the trial court feared that potential infringers would not be able to determine and avoid infringement if they can not detect the claimed compound.see morton int l,cardinal chem.this reasoning misses the proper purpose of the definiteness requirement.
the second paragraph of requires the specification of a patent to conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.to satisfy this requirement,the claim,read in light of the specification,must apprise those skilled in the art of the scope of the claim.see miles,shandon.moreover,claims need not be plain on their face in order to avoid condemnation for indefiniteness rather,what this court has asked is that the claims be amenable to construction,however difficult that task may be.exxon research eng g united states.in this case,the claim covers a definite chemical structure.to a chemist in this field,this claim is plain on its face.thus,claim of the patent can not be invalid for indefiniteness under.
in morton,this court affirmed a district court judgment of indefiniteness because one skilled in the art could not determine whether a given compound was within the scope of the claims.at.thus,the claims at issue were not sufficiently precise to permit a potential competitor to determine whether or not he is infringing.id.the morton case,therefore,does not hold that the inability to detect the claimed compound in the infringing device renders a compound claim indefinite.rather,morton stands for the unremarkable proposition that a compound claim,to be definite,must apprise a skilled artisan of the bounds of the claim.the record in morton contained considerable evidence showing that those skilled in the art could not make the claimed compounds using the procedures of the specification,and no evidence that such compounds even exist.id.at.
this case bears little similarity to morton.here,claim unambiguously identifies the bounds of the claim.it states crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate.thus,this claim recites in clear terms a discernible chemical structure.it would be difficult to imagine a more clear and definite claim.
the test for indefiniteness does not depend on a potential infringer ability to ascertain the nature of its own accused product to determine infringement,but instead on whether the claim delineates to a skilled artisan the bounds of the invention.in this case,the problem for apotex is that it can not accurately ascertain the nature of its own product.the scope of this claim is clear the infringement of the apotex product is not.even if a claim is broad enough to embrace undetectable trace amounts of the claimed invention,b readth is not indefiniteness.in re gardner,ccpa.stated more precisely,this claim is neither broad nor narrow,but definitive of this particular chemical structure.for inventing and disclosing this structure,the inventor enjoys the exclusive right to practice that invention for the patent limited term.accordingly,claim,as construed above,is not indefinite under,second paragraph.
infringement and equity 
having interpreted claim to cover phc hemihydrate without further limitation,this court turns to infringement.in anticipation of this very scenario,the district court performed a factual infringement analysis based on this correct claim construction.the district court held that the evidence showed that apotex phc anhydrate tablets would contain trace amounts of phc hemihydrate.smithkline beecham,d at.as indicated above,the record supports this factual finding.this court,therefore,affirms the district court finding that apotex product will infringe under this court claim construction.
because apotex seeks to practice the prior art,and because that practice infringes,the next logical inquiry involves anticipation.that is,if the prior art infringes now,logically the prior art should have anticipated the claim before the filing of the patent.see squibb ben venue,restating the axiom that that which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier.at trial,apotex asserted that ferrosan process of making phc anhydrate inherently resulted in trace amounts of the hemihydrate prior to the patent and thus inherently anticipated that patent.the district court,however,determined that apotex did not present clear and convincing evidence of inherent anticipation.according to the district court findings,no one knows when the hemihydrate form of paroxetine came into existence,although it is a reasonable inference that it did not exist in a detectable amount until smithkline serendipitous discovery.smithkline beecham,d at.apotex does not dispute that phc hemihydrate was first detected by curzons in,or that it is unable to prove precisely when phc hemihydrate came into existence.
smithkline argues that practicing the patent infringes claim of the patent,but that the patent does not anticipate claim of the patent.smithkline uses the disappearing polymorph theory to justify its apparently inconsistent positions.on the one hand,smithkline asserts that the creation of a prior art compound will result in a product containing at least trace amounts of their patented compound.on the other hand,smithkline contends that the creation of the prior art compound before smithkline discovery of its compound did not have the same result.for this reason,the district court was understandably uncomfortable about allowing claim to embrace its literal scope.the district court feared such a construction would result in a considerable extension in the effective patent term of paroxetine because it might become difficult or even impossible to manufacture the pure anhydrous form after the ferrosan patent expired.id.at.while these concerns are certainly legitimate,claim construction,as noted before,proceeds independent of its policy implications.fortunately,the district court had the foresight to consider alternative analyses in this unique situation.
the district court,in its alternative infringement analysis,properly found infringement,but created a new equitable defense to shield apotex from liability for that infringement.id.at.in short,the defense would apply where the patentee significantly contributed to causing the infringement.after all,smithkline creation of the hemihydrate form of phc created a seeded environment that,under the facts found by this district court,makes the practice of the prior art an infringement,while arguably precluding the operation of anticipation by inherency.in this unique and unprecedented circumstance,the trial court understandably reached out to find an equitable remedy to protect apotex.in any event,notwithstanding the potential merit of a new equitable doctrine in this unprecedented instance,this court can resolve this case without its application because claim is invalid as inherently anticipated under b.accordingly,this court declines to address the trial court proposed equitable defense.
the concurring opinion seeks to remedy the perceived inequity in this case by applying,arguing the subject matter of claim does not cover patentable subject matter.unfortunately,the concurrence confuses patent eligibility under with patentability under other provisions in the patent act,such as.the concurrence admits that phc hemihydrate is a synthetic,compound eligible for patent protection.in fact,the claimed invention is without question a composition of matter or an article of manufacture within the terms of.accordingly,the claimed invention represents subject matter eligible for patent protection under.with that conclusion,the inquiry under ends.
the concurring opinion,however,would expand the subject matter eligibility analysis under to encompass some review of the scope of the claims.to the contrary,e ither the subject matter falls within section or it does not.animal legal def.fund quigg.the scope of the claims is not relevant to subject matter eligibility.subject matter does not take on a different eligibility status with adjustments in the scope of the proposed claim.patent eligibility under is simply not an issue in this case.
anticipation b 
a patent claim is not valid if the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states b.for prior art to anticipate a claim it must be sufficient to enable one with ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention.mining chemque,citing in re borst,ccpa.whether a prior art reference is enabling is a question of law based upon underlying factual findings.id.citing crown operations int l solutia.anticipation is a question of fact.see id.however,without genuine factual disputes underlying the anticipation inquiry,the issue is ripe for judgment as a matter of law.
the patent is undisputed prior art under b,even though the patent discloses how to make phc anhydrate and does not discuss phc hemihydrate.phc hemihydrate was not even discovered until years after the patent was filed.nonetheless,the patent anticipates claim of the patent because the inherently discloses phc hemihydrate.
this court recently set forth the standards for anticipation by inherency 
a patent is invalid for anticipation if a single prior art reference discloses each and every limitation of the claimed invention.lewmar marine,barient.moreover,a prior art reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is necessarily present,or inherent,in the single anticipating reference.continental can monsanto.
schering geneva.in schering,this court also decided that the doctrine of inherent anticipation applies to the entire claimed subject matter just as it does to a single claimed feature.id.at because inherency places subject matter in the public domain as well as an express disclosure,the inherent disclosure of the entire claimed subject matter anticipates as well as inherent disclosure of a single feature of the claimed subject matter.moreover,this court reiterated in schering that inherent anticipation does not require a person of ordinary skill in the art to recognize the inherent disclosure in the prior art at the time the prior art is created.id.at citing in re cruciferous sprout,int l milgraum,atlas powder hanex.
the district court addressed the issue of inherent anticipation in this case,but it found in favor of smithkline because apotex did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that it was impossible to make pure phc anhydrate in the united states before the critical date of the patent.see smithkline beecham,d at i t is equally possible,as far as anyone knows,that practicing patent in goodness knows there were some in the united states as of the critical not have produced any hemihydrate.the district court erred in requiring apotex to meet this standard of proof,which is too exacting.apotex did not need to prove that it was impossible to make phc anhydrate in the united states that contained no phc hemihydrate,but merely that the disclosure of the prior art is sufficient to show that the natural result flowing from the operation as taught in the prior art would result in the claimed product.in re oelrich,ccpa accord int l,at see also atlas powder,at affirming the district court finding of inherent anticipation despite a finding that the inherent element could be avoided by taking extraordinary measures when practicing the prior art.contrary to this court precedents,the district court analysis of inherent anticipation did not consider the teachings of the patent separately from the actual production of phc hemihydrate.see schering,at anticipation does not require the actual creation or reduction to practice of the prior art subject matter anticipation requires only an enabling disclosure.citing in re donohue.thus,whether it was actually possible to make pure pch anhydrate before the critical date of the patent is irrelevant.the patent suffices as an anticipatory prior art reference if it discloses in an enabling manner the production of phc hemihydrate.see id.the patent discloses a method of manufacturing phc anhydrate that naturally results in the production of phc hemihydrate.consequently,applying the facts as found by the district court to the correct standard,this court holds that claim of the patent is invalid for anticipation by the patent.
the record shows,and smithkline admits through its proffered arguments,that producing phc anhydrate according to the patent inevitably results in the production of at least trace amounts of anticipating phc hemihydrate.the parties do not dispute that the first known existence of phc hemihydrate resulted from an attempt to produce phc anhydrate according to the patent.in december,smithkline serendipitously made phc hemihydrate at its harlow plant while attempting to manufacture phc anhydrate according to the patent.as discussed previously,curzons discovery of phc hemihydrate in worthing also occurred while he was making phc anhydrate according to the patent.both of these undisputed events support a finding that practicing the patent naturally results in the production of phc hemihydrate.the district court also found,and the parties do not dispute,that neither apotex nor smithkline can presently produce phc anhydrate that does not contain at least trace amounts of phc hemihydrate.see,smithkline beecham,d at apotex can not eliminate all crystals of hemihydrate emphasis in original.in sum,the record shows that the manufacture of phc anhydrate according to the patent necessarily results in the production of phc hemihydrate.this fact finds further record support in the holding that apotex would infringe claim of the patent under the single crystal claim construction.id.at.
the district court made these findings,at least in part,because phc anhydrate produced at the parties manufacturing facilities would convert to phc hemihydrate because the facilities had been seeded with phc hemihydrate crystals.id.smithkline takes the position that apotex infringement will result wholly from the phc hemihydrate seeds present in apotex facility,and that apotex could avoid infringement if it manufactured phc anhydrate in a facility clean of hemihydrate seeds.while phc hemihydrate seeds will certainly exacerbate the presence of phc hemihydrate in apotex phc anhydrate pills,this court does not accept smithkline assertion that the hemihydrate seeds will be the sole cause of the undesired phc hemihydrate in apotex anhydrate pills.indeed,smithkline argued at trial that phc hemihydrate seeds are not necessary to produce phc hemihydrate.
smithkline position on the source of apotex alleged infringement is inconsistent with the undisputed creation of phc hemihydrate as discussed supra.the production of phc anhydrate at both smithkline harlow and worthing plants resulted in the serendipitous production of phc hemihydrate.the only plausible explanation for this appearance of phc hemihydrate at the harlow plant and the likely explanation for its appearance at the worthing plant is that phc hemihydrate arises as a natural derivative of practicing the patent.smithkline did not offer any evidence that pure phc anhydrate can be produced in facilities that are not seeded.id.at district court noting the absence of any experiments by smithkline to show the difference between pch anhydrate manufactured in a facility both before and after it is seeded.smithkline only counter to this explanation is that it had been manufacturing phc anhydrate according to the patent for years before the hemihydrate was first detected in.smithkline would have the court infer from this argument that it is possible to make pure phc anhydrate according to the patent in unseeded conditions.the district court,however,properly dismissed this logic noting that existence and detection are not the same thing.id.at.the district court went on to explain that phc hemihydrate may have existed in undetectable amounts since ferrosan first produced phc anhydrate in the,particularly because the technology to detect pch hemihydrate in small amounts did not exist until.the district court reasoned that it may also be possible for phc anhydrate to coexist with low levels of phc hemihydrate without further conversion,thereby rejecting smithkline argument that the absence of conversion in early batches of phc anhydrate prove that the hemihydrate form did not exist prior to.see id.at reconciling conflicting expert testimony by discussing a possible equilibrium point at which conversion plateaus at a few percentage points,h emihydrate in small amounts does nothing for the anhydrate with which it is mixed.noting that inconsistent test results impl y that the hemihydrate and the anhydrate can coexist in an equilibrium.
because the record contains clear and convincing evidence that production of phc anhydrate in accordance with the patent inherently results in at least trace amounts of phc hemihydrate,this court holds that the patent inherently anticipates claim of the patent under b.consequently,it was legal error for the district court to base its finding of no inherent anticipation upon a finding that apotex did not present clear and convincing evidence that phc hemihydrate existed before the critical date of the patent.additionally,the district court supposition that apotex could possibly prevent phc anhydrate from converting to phc hemihydrate by building a new plant that was not seeded with phc hemihydrate,or by preventing the phc anhydrate from being exposed to moisture,does not change this result.this court law does not require apotex to take extraordinary measures to practice the prior art without infringing claim of the patent.see atlas powder,at affirming the district court finding of inherent anticipation despite a finding that the inherent element could be avoided by taking extraordinary measures when practicing the prior art.
smithkline has sued apotex for infringement of the patent in an express attempt to prevent apotex from practicing the patent upon its expiration.in atlas powder,this court noted that one of the principles underlying the doctrine of inherent anticipation is to ensure that t he public remains free to make,use or sell prior art compositions or processes,regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup or the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate.at accord schering,at.invalidating claim of the patent for inherent anticipation by the patent furthers this policy of allowing the public to practice expired patents.
this holding is also in accord with this court precedent.in re seaborg,ccpa,held that claims for an isotope of americium made by a nuclear reaction were not inherently anticipated by a prior art patent disclosing a similar nuclear reaction process but with no disclosure of the claimed isotope.in finding no anticipation,this court predecessor found no positive evidence that the claimed isotope was inherently produced by the prior art process.id.at.the court properly held that the mere possibility that the small amount of the claimed element may have been produced was insufficient to invalidate the claim for anticipation.id.similarly,it is undisputed that smithkline and apotex practice of the patent results in the production of the claimed phc hemihydrate in trace amounts.
as noted in schering,a patentee may obtain patent protection for an inherently anticipated compound through proper claiming.at.this court holding today merely precludes patent protection for the bare compound phc hemihydrate as claimed in claim of the patent because the compound is inherently anticipated by the patent.
miscellaneous issues 
smithkline also appealed the district court decision to prevent smithkline from pursuing its contributory infringement claim.as discussed above,that claim asserted that the ingestion of apotex phc anhydrate tablet by a patient would result in conversion to phc hemihydrate.again,smithkline allegations of contributory infringement based upon the theory that phc anhydrate converts into phc hemihydrate upon ingestion further supports this court finding of inherent anticipation.nevertheless,because claim is invalid for anticipation under b,smithkline appeal on contributory infringement is moot.
similarly,smithkline appeal of the district court ruling that injunctive relief under e is within the district court discretion is also moot.that ruling was not necessary for the district court judgment below and is immaterial to the determination of this appeal.this court,therefore,does not address that issue in this opinion.
in summary,this court reverses the claim construction of the district court and holds that claim of the patent covers any amount of crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate without further limitation.based on the factual findings of the district court,this court affirms the district court finding that apotex phc anhydrate product will infringe claim under that broad construction.notwithstanding that conclusion,this court holds,based on the undisputed facts,that claim of the patent is invalid for inherent anticipation by the patent under a.apotex is,therefore,not liable for infringing claim of the patent.this court affirms the district court judgment.

ferrosan applied for,and on february,was assigned,patent the patent.paroxetine was among the compounds that ferrosan discovered and that the patent protected.in,ferrosan granted beecham group limited now part of skb an exclusive license to make,to have made,to use,and to sell paroxetine throughout the world save for specified scandinavian countries.
in,skb began manufacturing paroxetine hydrochloride in its harlow plant.these early manufacturing activities did not lead to a commercial product immediately.before a new pharmaceutical drug can be placed on the market,it must undergo elaborate testing for safety and efficacy.quantities of paroxetine hydrochloride were distributed to different parts of the world,including the,for use in clinical trials.skb scientists also experimented with paroxetine hydrochloride in its bulk form,its form prior to being made into pills to improve the production of the bulk material.
skb experimentation on bulk form paroxetine led to an important discovery.on may,an skb scientist named alan curzons issued a memorandum entitled paroxetine polymorphism.in the memorandum,curzons stated that paroxetine had been shown to exist in two discreet sic crystalline polymorphic forms,a stable,nonhygroscopic hemihydrate and a hygroscopic anhydrate.curzons tests confirmed that the anhydrate and the hemihydrate were indeed distinct crystalline forms of paroxetine.
crystallinity is central to understanding both curzons reference to polymorphism and this case.polymorphs are distinct crystalline structures containing the same molecules.these structural differences can affect various properties of the crystals,such as melting points and hardness,graphite and diamonds are both crystalline forms of carbon.the two forms of paroxetine hydrochloride that curzons discovered were technically pseudopolymorphs,though pseudopolymorphs are often loosely called polymorphs an apparently common looseness that the district court adopted and that i have retained in this opinion.pseudopolymorphs not only have their molecules arranged differently but also have a slightly different molecular composition.a common type of pseudopolymorph is a solvate,which is a crystal in which the molecules defining the crystal structure trap molecules of a solvent.the crystal molecules and the solvent molecules then bond to form an altered crystalline structure.when the trapped and bonded solvent is water,the solvate is called a hydrate.hydrates bonding one water molecule to every two of the other molecules constituting the unit crystal cell are called hemihydrates.paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate paroxetine hemihydrate is a crystalline structure binding one water molecule to every two paroxetine hydrochloride molecules.despite the presence of water molecules,a hemihydrate is a solid,a powder,at room temperature.
prior to curzons discovery,the only known form of paroxetine hydrochloride had been an anhydrate,a crystalline form of paroxetine that does not contain a bound water molecule.in may,curzons made a batch of paroxetine,added isopropyl alcohol,a solvent,and found that the batch crystallized as a hemihydrate rather than as an anhydrate.curzons immediately recognized the significance of the superior handling well as its potential for a new patent relating to those properties.
these superior handling properties are natural effects of water bonded into the paroxetine hemihydrate.the anhydrous form of crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride paroxetine anhydrate is hygroscopic that is,it attracts water.this water is not attached to the paroxetine anhydrate by molecular bonds.as a result,the water is easily dispersed by heating paroxetine anhydrate at a significantly lower temperature than would be required to liberate the water molecule bound in paroxetine hemihydrate crystals.the anhydrate hygroscopicity makes it difficult to handle in the manufacturing process measures must be taken to control humidity and other sources of moisture,lest soggy anhydrate degrade into other compounds in ways that might impair the safety or the efficacy of the product.because the hemihydrate is not hygroscopic,it is easier to handle with fewer precautionary measures protecting its safety and efficacy.
beecham applied for a british patent on curzons discovery on october,and for a patent on october.on january,the patent and trademark office pto issued the patent,entitled crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate,which,according to the abstract,provides crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate,processes for its preparation,compositions containing the same and its therapeutic use as an.patent.
the claims as issued were identical to those in the original application.the patent combines product claims claims,and,process claims claim,and use claims claims and.only claim is at issue in the current litigation.it reads 
crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate.
subsequent experimentation taught skb a few additional lessons about paroxetine hemihydrate.first,skb learned that hemihydrate likely existed at least as early as december and possibly earlier,even though curzons did not identify it as such until.second,and more significantly,skb learned that the two forms of paroxetine are related through a phenomenon known as disappearing polymorphs.at times,the appearance of a new polymorph or pseudopolymorph affect the process that was previously used to make the old.the result is such that the same process will no longer produce the old least as here in its pure form.
the causal mechanism of polymorphic creation and transformation is not clear.modern science does not yet understand the full complexity of the atomic interactions at play in the phenomenon of polymorphism,and specifically in the disappearance of some polymorphs.scientists have,however,identified three factors believed to be significant.first,polymorphs tend to be more stable than earlier ones.because a stable crystalline form is not as likely to change into a less stable one than vice versa,there tends to be a natural drift toward more stable polymorphs.second,impurities retard crystallization,including crystallization into new forms.technological progress in chemical allowed manufacturers to reduce the impurities in their products.because of this increased purity technology creates increasingly favorable conditions for the natural drift towards stability.third,and most significantly to this case,once a new and more stable crystal emerges,should it be mixed,even in very small quantities,with the old,less stable crystal,the old form may convert to the new.
this process of seeding a batch of the old crystalline structure with its new,stable polymorphs can serve as a method of manufacturing the new polymorph by converting the old into the new.seeding and conversion can also be accidental of new,stable crystals becoming airborne and contaminating the laboratory or plant in which the old crystal is being manufactured.while controlled conversions in the former case are obviously desirable production methods,natural conversion in the latter case may be undesirable interferences with the production of the old polymorph.
seeding and conversion are central to this case.a single crystal of paroxetine hemihydrate can seed an environment to induce to render the production of pure paroxetine anhydrate in that environment impossible.while it is often possible,at least in theory,to build clean unseeded environments in which the old process will produce pure forms of the original polymorph,that possibility often remains only a matter of theory seeds introduced into the environment frequently permeate all parts of the globe and render it impossible to develop such clean environments.no one knows whether it is possible today to build clean environments in which a pharmaceutical company could produce pure paroxetine anhydrate.nor,for that matter,is anyone certain precisely what caused the first crystal of paroxetine hemihydrate to it does appear likely that a crystal from that december batch of paroxetine hemihydrate seeded curzons laboratory prior to his initial identification of the paroxetine hemihydrate polymorph.
as noted,scientific uncertainty surrounds the entire phenomenon of disappearing polymorphs,as well as its particular manifestation in paroxetine.apotex expert in fact,testified that the phenomenon does not manifest itself in paroxetine,and that paroxetine anhydrate and paroxetine hemihydrate can coexist happily in a single batch of paroxetine.
after weighing the testimony of all of the experts,the district court hypothesized that while the presence of paroxetine hemihydrate seeds in a batch of paroxetine anhydrate is likely,only a small percentage of the paroxetine anhydrate is likely to convert to hemihydrate under normal conditions of humidity,temperature,or pressure.the district court continued to hypothesize that given enough humidity,heat,or pressure,conversion may continue until it reaches percent,and that by the same token,with much tighter controls less,maybe no,conversion will take place despite the presence of seeds.finally,the district court noted that the clearest case of limited conversion occurs where there are no water molecules in the environment of the anhydrate.
for the purposes of this case,the district court admitted all proffered expert testimony concerning both disappearing polymorphism as a scientific phenomenon and its applicability to paroxetine,and found it to be a credible explanation of various factual occurrences in the discovery and the spread of paroxetine hemihydrate.
this language is all straightforward,and claim only four the most straightforward of all.the plain language of a claim asserting rights to crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate claims any amount of crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate.the plain language of this claim is precisely the single crystal theory that the district court rejected on other grounds.the district court explicitly recognized that the claim plain language included even a single crystal of hemihydrate the district court rejected that construction on the grounds that it would have absurd consequences.
the district court suggested that even skb had expressed some discomfort with the implications of the single crystal construction of claim.as a result,throughout the course of this litigation,both parties and two trial judges have considered multiple limitations that could be read into the of which proposed a minimum amount considerably larger than a single crystal.during the summary judgment hearing,judge kocoras dismissed several attempts to introduce such limitations.though he himself never adopted a construction,his ruling that skb could admit evidence of infringement developed using all available testing techniques implies that skb could pursue an infringement claim against anyone making,using,or selling detectable amounts of paroxetine hemihydrate.in his ruling following the bench trial,judge posner noted that under ordinary circumstances,claims with unambiguous plain language should be interpreted in a manner consistent with that plain language.there is little doubt that the single crystal interpretation is the only one consistent with the claim plain language.
nevertheless,many of the absurd consequences that that the district court foresaw are,in fact,absurd,and would the public were they the law.the proper place for resolutions of such conflicts between patent law and patent policy,however,is congress,not the courts.for the most part,though,such absurdities are likely to lie not in the law itself,but rather in misapplications of the law.here,the district court applied two additional elements of patent law to avoid the perceived absurdities.the district court found the single crystal theory indefinite,and applied various rules of claim construction to save the claim by limiting its scope.the district court introduced a limitation explicitly excluding hemihydrate produced by involuntary conversion of a proportion of an anhydrous mixture so small as to lack any commercial significance.
this conclusion,however,misinterprets the meaning of indefiniteness.the district court was certainly correct that indefinite claims could create socially undesirable zone s of uncertainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of infringement claims.united carbon binney smith.such zones would undoubtedly discourage invention only a little less than would unequivocal foreclosure of the field.id.the district court nevertheless erred in concluding that the mere possibility that a single crystal interpretation might discourage innovation and experimentation necessarily rendered the claim indefinite.the proper standard for assessing whether a patent claim satisfies the statutory requirement of definiteness is whether one skilled in the art would understand the bounds of the claim when read in light of the specification.miles,shandon,exxon.
as the supreme court has noted,all patents are capable of discouraging at least some innovation.brenner manson,d h ow likely is disclosure of a patented process to spur research by others into the uses to which the product may be placed to the extent that the patentee has power to enforce his patent,there is little incentive for others to undertake a search for uses.this discouragement,however,is simply part of the cost that the public bears to promote an overall patent system whose goal is to motivate more innovation than it deters.it is certainly possible that some individual patents will not have the desired effect,and will deter more innovation than they motivate.while such a result would hardly serve the public interest,this negative policy outcome is insufficient alone to render a patent claim indefinite.indefiniteness must be examined within the framework provided by statute as clarified by our case law.we recently explained that a claim is indefinite if,when read in light of the specification,it does not reasonably apprise those skilled in the art of the scope of the invention.amgen hoechst marion roussel.the contrapositive of this statement is also true.if the claim,read in light of the specification,reasonably apprises those skilled in the art of the scope of the invention,it is definite within the meaning of.
given that standard,the district court error is evident.the plain language of claim is unambiguous.it claims crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate,unambiguously meaning all crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate,without any exceptions.nothing in the claim language contradicts this straightforward,for that matter,does anything in the patent written description,the patent figures,or the prosecution history.there is no reason for anyone,much less one skilled in the art,to read this plain language as meaning anything else,nor to believe that the patent meant to exclude small or trace amounts of crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate from its coverage.those skilled in the art should certainly have appreciated the scope of the if they also viewed its breadth as damaging to their own efforts in experimentation and invention.
the district court read limitations from the written description into the claim language for reasons that appear to have stemmed from its public policy concerns.the court motivation notwithstanding,the practice of reading limitation from written descriptions into claims invariably leads to misconstrued claims.simply pointing to discussions in the specification or prosecution history can not rebut the presumption that claims should be afforded their ordinary meanings.ccs fitness,brunswick.we recognize that there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification,and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification.comark communications harris,citations omitted.in this case,there is little doubt that the district court crossed that line.
the single crystal theory provides the only interpretation that is entirely consistent with the language of claim of the patent.this interpretation meets the statutory requirement for definiteness.it puts those skilled in the art on notice that the patent protects crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate,in all amounts,and that any manufacture,use,or sale of this inadvertent manufacture,use,or infringe the patent.the correct construction of claim adheres to the single crystal theory.
because the patent claims every single crystal of paroxetine hemihydrate,and because apotex paroxetine product contains at least some hemihydrate crystals,skb has proven that apotex product prima facie claim is valid.because claim is broad enough to encompass both patentable and unpatentable subject matter,however,i would find that it is invalid under.
the question of patentability under section does not arise often,and a court decision to raise it sua sponte is even less common.the centrality of patentable subject matter to the entire scope of the patent law suggests that there are times when such inquiries are critical.the supreme court established long ago that the question whether the invention,which is the in controversy,is patentable or not is always open to the consideration of the court,whether the point is raised by the answer or not.slawson grand.see also richards chase elevator.these precedents remain good law,though the courts have relied upon them infrequently.the policy that drove them,however,remains vibrant.less than a decade after slawson,in the context of an interference,the supreme court stressed that 
t he parties to the present suit appear to have been willing to ignore the question as to patentability in the present case,and to have litigated merely the question of priority of invention,on the assumption that the invention was patentable.but neither the circuit court nor this court can overlook the question of patentability.
hill wooster.in our law,b specifically allows an administrative patent judge to raise the issue of patentability sua sponte as to claims designated to correspond to a count of an interference.
beyond administrative proceedings,courts have found the occasional need to raise section issues sua subsequent to the revisions to the patent act.at least three of our sister circuits,whose rulings on patent law prior to do not bind this court but retain persuasive value,raised section issues that the parties had not addressed.the ninth circuit announced that it is the duty of the court to dismiss a patent infringement suit whenever it affirmatively appears that the patent is invalid.barkeij lockheed aircraft,cir.according to the second circuit,e ven were section not raised by appellees,it was not error for the district court to consider it since it had the power to do so.section deals with the subject matter of patents and,as such,it is always open to the consideration of the court howes great lakes press,cir.and the third circuit explained that 
i t has been clear from an early date,that the court could dismiss a bill because the invention described in the patent was not patentable,even when no defense of invalidity was set up in the answer accordingly,when a party brings suit on a patent alleging infringement,it is accountable for the validity of the patent 
borden clearfield cheese,cir.
the federal circuit has independently raised section concerns without prompting from the parties at least once before.in titanium metals banner,we considered a patent that the pto had rejected as both anticipated under section and obvious under section.id.at.the district court reversed,and issued an order authorizing the commissioner of patents and trademarks to issue the patent.titanium metals mossinghoff.the government appealed.the matter therefore reached this court on issues relevant to sections and,not to section.we explained,however,that 
t he patent law imposes certain fundamental conditions for patentability,paramount among them being the condition that what is sought to be patented,as determined by the claims,be new.the basic provision of title applicable here is the title of the application here involved is titanium alloy,a composition of matter.surprisingly,in all of the evidence,nobody discussed the key issue of whether the alloy was new,which is the essence of the anticipation issue 
titanium metals,at.we concluded that the decision and order of the district court holding that claims,and are directed to patentable subject matter and authorizing the issuance of a patent thereon were clearly erroneous and are reversed.id.at.in other words,we recognized that we could neither affirm nor reverse the district court holdings under sections and in a principled way without addressing the underlying erroneous assumption that the invention at issue met the requirements of section.see also brassica prot.prods.llc sunrise farms in re cruciferous sprout litig,characterizing as common sense titanium metals rationale,including the injection of section into an anticipation analysis.
both this court and the supreme court have recognized that there is a significant public policy interest in removing invalid patents from the public arena.in cardinal chem.morton int l,d,the supreme court reversed our practice of vacating findings of invalidity where the court found in light of the strong public interest in resolving questions of patent validity.in,of,d,the supreme court commented at length on the wasteful consequences of relitigating the validity of a patent after it has once been held invalid.in united states glaxo group,d,the supreme court ruled that the government,like patent licensees,could always challenge the validity of a patent in the course of prosecuting an antitrust action to vindicate the public interest in enjoining violations of the sherman act.the court cited numerous cases as sufficient authority to support this holding,which it saw as furthering a longstanding policy it is as important to the public that competition should not be repressed by worthless patents,as that the patentee of a really valuable invention should be protected in his monopoly pope gormully.
these decisions mirror our own recognition that p ublic policy requires that only inventions which fully meet the statutory standards are entitled to patents.constant advanced,citations omitted,and that t here is a stronger public interest in the elimination of invalid patents than in the affirmation of a patent as valid.nestier menasha.the best way to ensure that patents issue only for inventions in full compliance with the statutory standards is to allow the validity of a patent,which was originally obtained in ex parte proceedings in the pto,to be challenged in court.constant,at.
the sua sponte section inquiry that this case warrants therefore falls well within a long if somewhat sparse tradition,driven in part by concerns of public policy but grounded entirely in legal authority.where,as here,the facts are both unusual and undisputed,where the legal implication of these facts is clear,and where a consideration of fundamental aspects of law and policy is necessary to maintain the integrity of the patent law,a sua sponte inquiry into the patentability of the claimed subject matter is appropriate.
theory of infringement 
because the proper construction of claim follows the single crystal theory,skb must prove that apotex product does and will continue to contain at least some hemihydrate.though skb legal burden is only to prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence,bravo,containment techs,skb nevertheless faces a significant challenge.as the district court found,apotex wants to manufacture pure anhydrate any hemihydrate present in its product is an undesirable impurity.see sk ii,d at.both skb and the district court explicitly rejected the possibility that the anhydrous and hemihydrous forms of paroxetine came into existence simultaneously,and that every batch of paroxetine ever manufactured or that ever will be manufactured contains at least trace elements of argument that would not only prove skb point about apotex product,but would also invalidate the patent as inherent in the prior art.id.at.
skb basic theory of infringement,which the district court recognized as establishing a prima facie case of infringement when applied to the single crystal construction,id.at,rests upon two scientific principles that remain matters of controversy within the scientific community,both as a general phenomena and as applied to paroxetine seeding and conversion.see id.at.under this infringement theory,the form of paroxetine discovered in the was,indeed,pure anhydrate hemihydrate did not exist until late.
skb expert bernstein testified that he was absolutely convinced that no hemihydrate had existed before december terence threlfall,apotex expert on polymorphism,testified that bernstein absolute certainty is not tenable.no one knows when the hemihydrate form of paroxetine came into existence,although it is a reasonable inference that it did not exist in a detectable amount until then.
id.at.from that date forward,however,it was impossible to produce pure anhydrate in a seeded environment because even under normal climactic conditions,at least some of the anhydrate would convert to become hemihydrate.
this process of seeding the old with the new can be is,can be a method of manufacturing the new adventitious,a result of the fact that some of the crystals become airborne and contaminate the laboratory or plant in which the old crystal is being manufactured t he seeds relevant to this case are seeds that cause one polymorph to convert to another and these seeds are crystals of the form to which conversion occurs.a single tiny crystal,constituting a single seed,might induce conversion the creation of the new polymorph is likely to make the laboratory or plant where it is produced seeded,with the result that efforts to produce the old polymorph may instead produce the new one,since it is the more stable form.in principle it should be possible to the old polymorph,just by replicating the exact procedure by which it used to be created,only this time in a environment i n practice efforts to old polymorphs do not always succeed,probably because the critical mass of molecules that is required to cause conversion is so minute 
id.at.skb therefore argues that any paroxetine manufactured in a seeded environment must inevitably contain at least some hemihydrate,that this condition has only prevailed since some time in late,and that apotex facilities have been or inevitably will become seeded.
according to smithkline,the bci plant in which apotex manufactures anhydrate is seeded with hemihydrate crystals because it was there that apotex,exercising the broadened privilege conferred by the act,used and made hemihydrate in the course of developing its anhydrous product.
skb proof supporting this theory must rest upon factual demonstrations.as an appellate court,we accept all facts found by the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.shockley arcan.the district court,however,stated its most significant finding as an hypothesis 
the conflicting testimony of bernstein on the one hand and of threlfall on the other can largely be reconciled on the following hypothesis while the presence of hemihydrate seeds in a batch of anhydrate is likely,provided the ambient humidity and temperature are no lower than is normal in the temperate zone,to produce conversion within a short time,once the amount converted reaches a few percent of the mixture further conversion is unlikely without substantially greater humidity,temperature,or pressure.
sk ii,d at.findings of fact stated as hypotheses pose particularly challenging problems for appellate courts.did the district court accept this hypothesis as a fact upon which legal arguments and conclusions can rest,or was the district court merely trying to make sense of the scientific testimony that the two experts proffered 
the district court own legal conclusions make it clear that the court accepted them as facts,by stating,for example,that apotex bci plant is seeded as a result of the experiments,id.at emphasis added,and that the anhydrate as it proceeds through the process at the bci plant will at several junctures be exposed to air that contains enough water molecules to permit conversion of anhydrate to hemihydrate.id.these statements make sense only if the district court found that both seeding and conversion are valid scientific facts,at least as applied to paroxetine for the purposes of this case.
the district court understandable hedging of its language when dealing with controversial scientific theories nevertheless led it to definitive factual conclusions bci probably will be making at least some hemihydrate crystals and therefore infringing,at least prima facie,patent if claim is interpreted to cover single crystals of the hemihydrate.id.emphasis added.some conversion from anhydrate to hemihydrate is likely to occur in a seeded facility in which the anhydrate is exposed to air bci plant is seeded and the anhydrate manufactured there is exposed to nondehumidified air before it leaves the plant.id.emphasis added.but in concrete syllogistic conclusion,t his evidence is sufficient to support an inference that bci will be making at least tiny amounts of the hemihydrate if it is permitted to manufacture the anhydrate.id.emphasis added.
the district court therefore found,as a matter of fact,that paroxetine anhydrate in a seeded environment characterized by normal climactic conditions can convert itself spontaneously into paroxetine hemihydrate.id.the district court further found that skb had met its burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that such conversion was inevitable at apotex bci manufacturing facility.id.at.
the district court next turned to consider apotex defenses.if claim is valid and will be infringed by a single crystal of hemihydrate then apotex has a complete affirmative defense that smithkline is the cause of the infringement.id.at.this conclusion makes sense only after a factual finding that apotex legal experimentation with paxil seeded the bci plant.id.at.apotex can not eliminate all crystals of hemihydrate under a interpretation of claim,and smithkline is the sole cause of infringement.id.at emphasis in the original.
finally,the district court explained that 
it is difficult,and in some cases it may be impossible paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate may be one of those one knows,to destroy all the seeds in seeded premises bernstein testified that if apotex,desperate to avoid a charge of infringement built a new plant in antarctica where no hemihydrate seeds had ever been and started manufacturing anhydrate there,and a depressed worker in the plant dropped a paxil on the floor,the result might be to seed the plant and make it impossible from then on to produce pure anhydrate there.
in short,the district court made four critical factual findings hemihydrate crystals did not exist before their first emergence in an skb laboratory in late,id.at hemihydrate seeds spread easily,and increasingly large parts of the environment are becoming seeded,id.at under normal climactic conditions in a seeded environment,at least some anhydrate crystals will convert spontaneously to become hemihydrate crystals,id.at and apotex manufacturing facilities have been seeded,id.at.
these findings of fact highlight the unique challenge that the infringement analysis of the patent poses infringing matter has an unusual tendency to appear even where it is unwanted.such a spontaneous appearance of a patented product vitiates the public notice function of patents.see id.at.under normal circumstances,
one of ordinary skill in the art should be able to read a patent,to discern which matter is disclosed and discussed in the written description,and to recognize which matter has been claimed.the ability to discern both what has been disclosed and what has been claimed is the essence of public notice.it tells the public which products or processes would infringe the patent and which would not.
psc computer prods.foxconn int l.when the claimed product can be made via the spontaneous conversion of a noninfringing product into an infringing one,adequate notice is if the claimed product was initially synthesized in a laboratory.
long before,when section formalized the modern written description requirement,the supreme court observed that 
whoever discovers that a certain useful result will be produced,in any art,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,by the use of certain means,is entitled to a patent for it provided he specifies the means he uses in a manner so full and exact,that any one skilled in the science to which it appertains,can,by using the means he specifies,without any addition to,or subtraction from them,produce precisely the result he describes.and if this can not be done by the means he describes,the patent is void.and if it can be done,then the patent confers on him the exclusive right to use the means he specifies to produce the result or effect he describes,and nothing more.
morse,how.the supreme court further explained that 
a ccurate description of the invention is required by law,for several important purposes.that the government may know what is granted,and what will become public property when the term of the monopoly expires.that licensed persons desiring to practise the invention may know during the term how to make,construct,and use the invention.that other inventors may know what part of the field of invention is unoccupied.
bates coe.while these cases may not apply directly to the modern written description requirement of section,they do demonstrate the longstanding centrality of the public notice function to patent policy.
paroxetine hemihydrate forces us,for the first time,to confront the requirement that a patentee specify in a manner so full and exact,that any one skilled in the science to which it appertains,can,by avoiding the means he specifies,how.at,avoid producing the claimed product.otherwise,there will be no way for other inventors to know what part of the field of invention is unoccupied.bates,at.effective notice is impossible if a natural physical process can convert a noninfringing product into an infringing one.
the district court was correct in concluding that claim of the patent,subject to the proper single crystal construction,fails to provide suitable notice.sk ii,d at.a paroxetine anhydrate manufacturer,such as apotex,could exert reasonable efforts to manufacture only products already in the public domain,could direct its entire production process toward developing only products that scrupulously respected all patent rights,and could nevertheless infringe because a natural physical process acting upon its legitimate anhydrous product made new hemihydrous crystals that apotex then sold to the public.apotex has tried to prevent conversion of its product to the patented form and a principal issue in this case is whether it has succeeded there is no suggestion that apotex desires conversion.sk ii,d at emphasis in original.
claim therefore can not be valid.but the failure of notice is a consequence of its invalidity,not the source of it.we must consider whether or not the patent covers only patentable subject matter.see slawson,at.
patentable subject matter 
whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof,may obtain a patent thereof.the supreme court has interpreted this statutory range of patentable subject matter to be quite broad,but hardly universal.in choosing such expansive terms as manufacture and composition of matter,modified by the comprehensive any,congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.diamond chakrabarty,d.that wide scope nevertheless excludes laws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas.such discoveries are manifestations of nature,free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.id.at,quoting funk.seed kalo inoculant.see also diamond diehr,d parker flook,d.
phenomena of nature,though just discovered,mental processes,and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable,as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work.gottschalk benson,d.a single standard applies to product claims and process claims alike.id.w hether patents are allowable for challenged subject matter is not a matter of discretion,but of law either the subject matter falls within section or it does not.animal legal def.fund quigg.and as a matter of law,the critical distinction guiding all section inquiries into the patentability of subject matter is that,or synthetic,products or processes are patentable,while products and processes of nature are not.see chakrabarty,at.ag supply pioneer int l,d.
the district court found as a matter of fact that at some point,likely in late,something occurred in skb laboratories that gave rise to two new phenomena simultaneously.sk ii,d at.the first was a synthetic crystal later named paroxetine hemihydrate,ostensibly a patentable invention under chakrabarty.the second was a natural physical process whereby paroxetine anhydrate a synthetic crystal that today is in the public domain could,under normal climactic conditions and with no human intervention,bond with water molecules and convert itself into paroxetine hemihydrate,sk ii,d at,ostensibly an unpatentable,newly discovered natural process under chakrabarty.
this distinction between the synthetic product and its natural reproduction process is subtle,but critical.paroxetine hemihydrate is not the first invention to blur the line between a natural process and a synthetic product,nor is it the first to engender confusion in the patent law.in the nineteenth century,the conflation of the natural acoustical principles of telephony with the invention of telephone equipment gave rise to massive litigation.see telephone cases.in disentangling this complex patent litigation,the supreme court noted that 
in one of the cases on appeal the court says there can be no patent for a mere principle.the discoverer of a natural force or a scientific fact can not have a patent for that.but it proceeds to make this exception nugatory by confounding the natural process or scientific fact with the invented process for working the apparatus sustaining the patent for the last upon a construction which blindly sweeps in the first.
id.at.the patent similarly confounds the scientific fact of paroxetine conversion with the invented product of paroxetine skb similarly asks us to sustain the patent for the last upon a construction which blindly sweeps in the first.id.we should not only decline to do so,as the majority has and as the district court did in the alternative,but we should be clear about both the character and the implications of the underlying request.
paroxetine hemihydrate is presumably a synthetic compound,created by humans in a laboratory,never before existing in nature,that is nevertheless capable of reproducing itself through a natural process.sk ii,d at.this crystalline compound raises a question similar to one that might arise when considering the invention of a fertile plant or a genetically engineered organism,capable of reproduction,released into the wild.consider,for example,what might happen if the wind blew fertile,genetically modified blue corn protected by a patent,from the field of a single farmer into neighboring cornfields.the harvest from those fields would soon contain at least some patented blue corn mixed in with the traditional public domain yellow infringing the patent.the wind would continue to blow,and the patented crops would spread throughout the continent,thereby turning most if not all north american corn farmers into unintentional,yet inevitable,infringers the the patent owner would be entitled to collect royalties from every farmer whose cornfields contained even a few patented blue possibly be correct.the underlying question that engaged the district court,and that led it to develop numerous alternative holdings,is why this implication is incorrect.
at oral argument,when faced with this hypothetical,skb expressed its belief that such a patent would be very strong.such a belief is misplaced.the implicit concept of inevitable infringement stems from
