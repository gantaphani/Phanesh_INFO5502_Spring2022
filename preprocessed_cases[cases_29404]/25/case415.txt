this case arises under the hatch waxman act and involves glenmark pharmaceuticals and glenmark pharmaceuticals,usa collectively,glenmark proposed generic version of finacea gel,a topical medication for various skin disorders.glenmark appeals the united states district court for the district of delaware final judgment entered in favor of intendis gmbh,intraserv gmbh.kg,and bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals collectively,appellees.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
appellee bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals holds approved new drug application nda for finacea gel,which contains azelaic acid as the therapeutically active ingredient in a concentration of by weight and is indicated for the topical treatment of inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate rosacea.finacea gel inactive ingredients,known as excipients,include triglycerides and lecithin.finacea gel is manufactured in the form of a hydrogel,which the district court construed to mean a semisolid dosage form that contains water and a gelling agent to form a gel,which may contain dispersed particles insoluble liquids.intendis gmbh glenmark pharm,d.
the food and drug administration fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluation,commonly known as the orange book,lists patent the patent as covering finacea gel.the patent,entitled composition with azelaic acid,is assigned to appellee intraserv gmbh and exclusively licensed to appellee intendis gmbh.the patent issued in march and claims priority to a provisional application filed on february.sole independent claim of the patent recites 
a composition that comprises 
i azelaic acid as a therapeutically active ingredient in a concentration of to by weight,
iii at least one in a concentration of to by weight,
iv propylene glycol,and 
v at least one polysorbate,in an aqueous phase that further comprises water and salts,and the composition further comprises 
ii at least one polyacrylic acid,and 
vi lecithin,
wherein the composition is in the form of a hydrogel.

glenmark pharmaceuticals submitted an abbreviated new drug application anda to the fda seeking to market a generic version of finacea gel.the submission included a paragraph iv certification pursuant to j a vii iv asserting that the patent is invalid and not infringed.unlike finacea gel,the proposed generic product substituted isopropyl myristate for the claimed triglyceride and lecithin.pursuant to j b ii,glenmark pharmaceuticals,usa informed appellees that an anda had been filed.in response,appellees filed a complaint against glenmark in the united states district court for the district of delaware,alleging that glenmark submission of the anda infringed the patent under e a.
the district court held a markman hearing on january,and a bench trial from february,on the issues of infringement and validity.on july,the district court issued an opinion concluding that claims of the patent were infringed under the doctrine of equivalents and not invalid.
with respect to infringement,the central dispute was whether isopropyl myristate in glenmark generic product met the claim elements triglyceride and lecithin under the doctrine of equivalents.the district court found that it did,relying on the test.the district court rejected glenmark arguments that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents i would encompass the prior art and ii was barred by prosecution history estoppel.
with respect to validity,the district court found that none of the prior art references raised by glenmark disclosed every element of independent claim and rejected glenmark argument that the claims would have been obvious.prior to finacea gel,bayer marketed and sold a topical azelaic acid cream known as skinoren,which is prior art to the patent.the district court agreed with glenmark that a person of ordinary skill in the art would pursue a hydrogel formulation of azelaic acid because the skinoren formulation had undesirable qualities such as phase separation of the emulsion,whitening effect,and spreadability problems.however,the district court determined that glenmark failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the prior art references in a manner that would render claim of the patent obvious.it determined that even if glenmark had,glenmark failed to show a reasonable expectation of success in making such combination.finally,the district court found that the objective indicia of nonobviousness,namely,unexpected results of the claimed formulations and commercial success of finacea gel,weighed in favor of nonobviousness.
on august,the district court entered a final judgment in favor of appellees and directed the fda not to approve glenmark anda until after the november,expiration of the patent.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,glenmark argues that i the district court erred in its application of the function prong of the test for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,ii infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would encompass the prior art,iii appellees expressly disavowed and disclaimed a formulation without lecithin,and iv the district court erred in its obviousness analysis.we address each argument in turn.
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents 
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact that we review for clear error following a bench trial.allergan,sandoz.even when an accused product does not meet each and every claim element literally,it may nevertheless be found to infringe the claim if there is equivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention.warner jenkinson hilton davis chem,d quoting graver tank linde air prods.one way to show equivalence is by showing on an basis that the accused product performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way with substantially the same result as each claim limitation of the patented product,often referred to as the test.crown packaging,rexam beverage can.each prong of the test is a factual determination.in this case,neither party objects to employing the test as a means to determine equivalency of these chemical compounds.
glenmark argument on appeal is limited to the district court determination that glenmark isopropyl myristate performed substantially the same function as the claimed triglyceride and lecithin.we review the district court determination that they perform substantially the same function,a question of fact,for clear error.biovail.int l andrx.to be clear,we are not presented with the issue of the substantiality of the differences between the chemical structures of isopropyl myristate,triglyceride,and lecithin.this appeal is limited to whether the district court clearly erred when it determined that triglyceride and lecithin function as penetration enhancers in the claimed compounds.
glenmark argument was based on the claim elements triglyceride and lecithin collectively,claimed excipients,which are recited in the sole independent claim.even though glenmark generic product did not physically contain triglyceride or lecithin,the district court found that the claimed excipients were met under the doctrine of equivalents.first,the court found that isopropyl myristate in glenmark generic product glenmark excipient performs substantially the same function as the claimed excipients namely,enhancing azelaic acid penetration of the skin.it reasoned that several experts testified that the claimed excipients could act as penetration enhancers and that nothing in the record indicated they could not.it also reasoned that glenmark anda included repeated statements that both glenmark excipient and the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers.it noted that glenmark should not be permitted to liken their product to the claimed composition to support their bid for fda approval,yet avoid the consequences of such a comparison for purposes of infringement.intendis,d at.second,the court found that glenmark excipient performed in substantially the same way as the claimed excipients namely,by disrupting the lipids in the skin outermost layer,known as the stratum corneum.it based its finding on testimony by various experts,as supported by scientific literature.third,the court found that glenmark excipient obtained substantially the same result as the claimed excipients namely,a therapeutically effective azelaic acid composition that is able to penetrate the skin in order to deliver the active ingredient.it relied on data from the patent,glenmark own patent application,a skin penetration study,and a clinical trial.
on appeal,glenmark argues that the district court erred in its finding regarding the function prong because appellees failed to prove that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers in the claimed composition.it argues that t he patent itself is silent on the question of whether lecithins or triglycerides function as penetration enhancers.intendis,d at.according to glenmark,this absence of support in the patent itself for the notion that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers is fatal to appellees infringement case.glenmark argues that appellees theory is also contradicted by evidence outside the patent.it points to appellees fda filings and development reports as such examples,which identified the claimed lecithin and triglyceride as an emulsifier and an emollient,respectively.it argues that not a single literature reference in evidence identified lecithin or triglyceride as a penetration enhancer,and appellees expert testimony was rejected by the district court.according to glenmark,the district court justified its finding that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers on the basis that the evidence did not exclude that possibility,despite the lack of any affirmative evidence.
we see no clear error in the district court finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.as an initial matter,we disagree that the lack of disclosure of the claimed excipients as penetration enhancers in the patent is fatal to appellees infringement case.we have never held that a patent must spell out a claim element function,way,and result in order for the doctrine of equivalents to apply as to that element.to the contrary,we have held that w hen the claims and specification of a patent are silent as to the result of a claim limitation,we should turn to the ordinary skilled artisan.stumbo eastman outdoors.
certainly,a patent disclosure is relevant and can at times be dispositive of the function.glenmark is correct that the proper analysis focuses on the claimed element function in the claimed composition,not a function that element could perform in the abstract divorced from the claimed composition.but glenmark is wrong to the extent that it argues that a determination of the claimed element function is limited to a review of the intrinsic record.the relevant inquiry is what the claim element function in the claimed composition is to one of skill in the art,and a fact finder may rely on extrinsic evidence in making this factual determination.zenith,bristol myers squibb.
glenmark argues that the district court erred in its determination that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers in light of the evidence of record.we see no clear error in this district court fact finding.fatal to glenmark argument is its own anda submission to the fda repeatedly referring to the claimed excipients triglyceride and lecithin as penetration enhancers.for example,glenmark stated in its filing to the fda that i sopropyl myristate was selected as a penetration enhancer instead of lecithin and medium chain triglyceride under the heading selection of penetration enhancer.glenmark repeated statements to the fda that the claimed excipients function as penetration enhancers tend to show that one of skill in the art would understand the claimed excipients to function as penetration enhancers.we see no reason why a district court acting as a fact finder should ignore a party representation to a federal regulatory body that is directly on point.based on this record,the district court finding regarding the function of the claimed excipients is not clearly erroneous.
in a strange turn of events,glenmark argued at oral argument to this court that its statements in its fda submissions about the claimed excipients triglyceride and lecithin functioning as penetration enhancers should be rejected and can not be evidence to support the district court finding.it argued that lecithin and triglycerides are not known to the art as penetration enhancers and that its representation to the fda that they do function as penetration enhancers was a guess and wrong.oral argument at,intendis gmbh glenmark,available at.these seemingly extemporaneous arguments do not persuade us that there is clear error in the district court decision that isopropyl myristate in glenmark generic product and the claimed triglyceride and lecithin perform substantially the same function.no such arguments were made by glenmark in any of its briefing to this court.and when asked whether glenmark had notified the fda of these purported inaccurate representations to the fda,glenmark counsel was unaware of such notification.id.at.
the district court did not clearly err in its findings regarding the doctrine of equivalents.
ii.encompassing the prior art 
a patentee may not assert a scope of equivalency that would encompass,or ensnare,the prior art.depuy spine,medtronic sofamor danek,quotation marks omitted.even if an accused element meets the test,no equivalent will be found if the scope of equivalency would capture the prior art.hypothetical claim analysis is a practical method to determine whether an equivalent would impermissibly ensnare the prior art.see ultra tex surfaces,hill.chem.hypothetical claim analysis is a process.the first step is to construct a hypothetical claim that literally covers the accused device.depuy spine,at.next,prior art introduced by the accused infringer is assessed to determine whether the patentee has carried its burden of persuading the court that the hypothetical claim is patentable over the prior art.id.at.in short,we ask if a hypothetical claim can be crafted,which contains both the literal claim scope and the accused device,without ensnaring the prior art.we review a district court conclusion that a hypothetical claim does not encompass the prior art de novo and resolution of underlying factual issues for clear error.id.at.
the district court determined that a proper hypothetical claim included the claimed excipients and glenmark excipient,namely,the hypothetical claim includes isopropyl myristate as an alternative to the claimed triglyceride and lecithin.glenmark argued that finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would ensnare a prior art reference entitled in vitro permeation of azelaic acid from viscosized microemulsions gasco,which disclosed a microemulsion containing azelaic acid as the active ingredient and dmso as a penetration enhancer.the parties agreed that gasco did not disclose isopropyl myristate,lecithin,or triglyceride.the district court determined that the hypothetical claim was not anticipated or rendered obvious by gasco,and rejected glenmark argument that finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents would ensnare gasco.it reasoned,based on expert testimony,that a skilled artisan i would not necessarily have substituted the hypothetical claim excipient isopropyl myristate or lecithin and triglyceride for gasco dmso,and ii would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.
glenmark argues that the district court erred in determining that the doctrine of equivalents was not precluded by ensnarement.it argues that the district court hypothetical claim was inexplicably narrower than appellees range of equivalents.it argues that a proper hypothetical claim should have matched appellees theory of infringement and thus included any penetration enhancer.it argues that a proper hypothetical claim would have been anticipated by or obvious over the prior art and thus the doctrine of equivalents should be precluded.
we agree with the district court dete
