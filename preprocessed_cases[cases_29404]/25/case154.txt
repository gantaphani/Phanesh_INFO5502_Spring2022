merck,planned an initial public offering of its wholly owned health solutions.before the ipo was to occur,however,information about medco aggressive policy came to light.some details about the policy were disclosed in merck registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission,but a wall street journal article reading between the lines of this disclosure precipitated a decline in merck stock.after further disclosures and larger declines in merck stock price,the medco ipo was canceled.union investments privatfonds gmbh,as lead plaintiff for a class of merck stockholders,claims that merck and medco committed securities fraud under section b of the securities exchange act of and that merck officers made material misstatements or omissions in the registration statements in violation of section of the securities act of.union also alleges that the merck officers and merck,as medco parent company,are jointly and severally liable as controlling persons under section a of the act.the district court dismissed all of these claims on a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b.we affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
because we review this case at the rule b stage,we take as true the facts pled in the plaintiff complaint.union is the lead plaintiff for a class of investors owning stock in merck,a global pharmaceutical company this suit stems from the actions surrounding merck plan to spin off medco in a initial public offering.union alleges that medco engaged in improper accounting practices,which were not fully disclosed until,after several amendments,merck filed a registration statement gaining sec approval.union further alleges that merck and medco made misleading statements about the independence of the two entities.
merck first announced its plans for the medco ipo in a january press release,in which raymond gilmartin,merck chairman and ceo,said that the two companies would pursue independent strategies for success.on april,merck filed its first form with the sec.the sec did not approve this,and merck kept trying,finally securing sec approval with its fifth,filed on july.market reaction led merck to drop medco offering price,to postpone indefinitely the ipo,and finally to drop the ipo altogether.
medco policy 
medco is a pharmacy benefits manager pbm.it saves its clients plan sponsors money by negotiating discount rates with pharmacies and influencing doctors to prescribe cheaper,but still therapeutically appropriate,medicines.when a customer buys drugs at a local pharmacy,the pharmacist checks with medco to ensure that the customer is an approved beneficiary.then the customer makes a between and goes directly to the pharmacy,not to medco.
although medco did not handle these,it interpreted the accounting standards to allow it to recognize the as revenue but it did not disclose this policy.in fact,merck sec form stated that medco recognized revenue for the amount billed to the plan sponsor.after merck changed auditors,and before it began filings for the medco ipo,it changed this language in its form to state that revenues were recognized based on the prescription drug price negotiated with the plan sponsor.
merck april form disclosed for the first time that medco had recognized as revenue the paid by consumers,but it did not disclose the total amount of recognized.the day this was filed,merck stock price went up to merck filed an amendment to its on may and another on june.
on june,the wall street journal reported that medco had been recognizing as revenue and estimated that in billion in had been recognized.barbara martinez,merck included among revenue,wall,june,at.later disclosures would show the actual number to be billion.the market reaction was immediate that day merck stock lost from to.six days later,merck announced the postponement of the medco ipo and indicated that it would drop medco offering price.
merck filed its fourth on july,finally disclosing the full amount of it had recognized as revenue.the showed that medco had recognized over billion dollars in as revenue,billion in,billion in,and billion in.four days later,merck announced that it would postpone the medco ipo indefinitely,even as it filed its last,which was approved by the sec.
merck stock continued to fall,reaching on july,the end of the class period,and on july.
merck and medco independence 
in the january press release,gilmartin said,regarding the planned medco ipo,w e believe the best way to enhance the success of both businesses going forward is to enable each one to pursue independently its unique and focused strategy.the independence of merck and medco had been and was to become a subject of some debate.
the federal trade commission had launched an investigation of medco in to determine whether it was giving preferential treatment to merck drugs.the ftc also investigated some of merck competitors for similar reasons.other drug manufacturers divested their pbms,but merck kept medco.in merck entered into an ftc consent decree,which suggested,inter alia,that medco had given favorable treatment to merck drugs.
merck and medco throughout the class period asserted that the two companies stayed independent.both companies maintained policies of independence posted on their websites.
but union produced data suggesting that merck market share of drugs sold by medco was in several instances much higher than merck national market share.in its april,merck disclosed that medco would be obligated to continue this elevated level of merck drug sales the two companies had signed an agreement requiring medco to sell a higher share of merck drugs than merck national market share.the may and june amendments to the fleshed out the terms of this agreement,which required medco to pay merck of its lost revenue if it failed to hit the sales targets.
c.the class action is filed 
the initial complaint was filed in july.union was appointed lead plaintiff in november,and it filed its corrected amended complaint in march.at the time,union lead counsel was bernstein litowitz berger grossman llp.defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,and the district court granted it in july.union appealed that decision in august.only then did it hire milberg weiss bershad schulman llp as its counsel for this appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under and under and.it granted a motion to dismiss under rule b,so we have jurisdiction under.
we exercise plenary review of the district court grant of a rule b motion,and we apply the same test as the district court.maio aetna,cir.in reviewing the motion to dismiss,we must accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to union.id.at.union claims are also subject to the heightened pleading standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure b and under the private securities litigation reform act pslra of,stat.codified in scattered sections of,pursuant to b.
iii.discussion 
may union retain milberg weiss to prosecute this appeal 
lead plaintiffs in securities class actions must secure court approval of their counsel,but union retained milberg weiss as appellate counsel after the notice of appeal was filed and without any court approval.we decide that milberg weiss may prosecute this appeal but that future lead plaintiffs must obtain court approval for any new counsel,including appellate counsel.
congress passed the pslra in part to reduce abusive class action litigation,at,reprinted in.to this end,the pslra requires courts to appoint as lead plaintiff the most adequate plaintiff the plaintiff with the most money at stake.a.the theory behind this requirement is that plaintiffs with the largest financial interests,typically institutional investors,will best represent the plaintiff class interests and will choose the best counsel.elliott weiss john beckerman,let the money do the monitoring how institutional investors can reduce agency costs in securities class actions,yale,see also,at nn,reprinted in,citing weiss beckerman,supra.
although congress was confident that the lead plaintiff would select the best counsel,it relied on the courts power to approve or disapprove the lead plaintiff choice of counsel when necessary to protect the interests of the plaintiff class,at,reprinted in.thus,the pslra provides that the most adequate plaintiff shall,subject to the approval of the court,select and retain counsel to represent the class.a b v emphasis added.this is not an empty requirement courts have the power and the duty to supervise counsel selection and counsel retention.in re cendant,cir.
union was selected lead plaintiff,and the district court approved bernstein litowitz berger grossman llp as lead counsel.but as noted,after the notice of appeal was filed,union retained milberg weiss as appellate counsel.bernstein litowitz consented to milberg weiss retention,but union neither sought nor obtained the district court approval of milberg weiss as class counsel.
in its brief,merck challenges milberg weiss ability to prosecute this appeal without court approval,and union responds with three arguments.we deal with each in turn.
first,union argues that merck does not have standing to protest the choice of lead counsel.we find few cases,from our court or others,that have addressed this issue.it could be that defendants ability to challenge lead counsel selection is the same as their ability to challenge lead plaintiff selection.if so,the weight of authority falls against merck.compare king livent,d,granting the defendant standing to challenge a motion to appoint a lead plaintiff and lead counsel,with cal.pub.employees ret.chubb,d,stating that the majority of courts have denied defendants the right to challenge the adequacy of lead plaintiffs and their chosen counsel and citing cases,gluck cellstar,deciding that defendants could not challenge the appointment of a lead plaintiff,and greebel ftp software,same.this makes sense because defendants will rarely have the best interests of the class at heart.see,a b iii ii allowing only a member of the purported plaintiff class to rebut the lead plaintiff presumptions cendant,at weiss beckerman,supra,at.
on the other hand,it may be that defendants ability to challenge lead counsel is separate from their inability to challenge lead plaintiff appointment.at least one court has allowed a defendant to challenge the selection of lead counsel.see in re usec sec,d,the defendants challenge the plaintiffs selection of two separate law firms as lead counsel.when the challenge is not to adequacy but is,as here,to a lead plaintiff procedural failure to secure court approval,we hold that defendants do have standing to challenge the retention of lead counsel.
second,union claimed that the pslra does not prevent it from retaining unapproved appellate counsel,which it characterized as somehow different from lead counsel.merely stating this argument lays out the span of such a stretch.the pslra does not distinguish between lead counsel and appellate counsel it simply requires court approval of class counsel.a b v.the court has a duty to consider the lead plaintiff choice and whether it should be approved.cendant,at.this inquiry is limited to whether the lead plaintiff selection and agreement with counsel are reasonable on their own terms,id.at,but it is an inquiry that must be made.we hold that all retentions of class counsel by the lead lead counsel,trial counsel,or appellate counsel require court approval under the pslra.
third,union argues that its retention of milberg weiss is valid by virtue of a jurisdictional loophole the district court lost jurisdiction after the filing of the notice of appeal,and our court is not in a position to make the findings required to approve new lead counsel.while it is generally true that district courts are divested of lose the power to the notice of appeal is filed,there are exceptions to this general rule.bensalem twp.int l surplus lines ins,cir.we have identified several,but limited,instances in which a district court retains its power to act a court may,for example,review attorney fees applications,order the filing of bonds,modify or grant injunctions,issue orders regarding the record on appeal,and vacate bail bonds and order arrests.venen sweet,cir.we limit these exceptions to avoid the confusion and inefficiency of having two courts dealing with the same issues.id.at.
the power to approve lead plaintiffs counsel under the pslra would not engender this same kind of confusion and inefficiency the approval or disapproval of counsel would lie with the district court,and we typically would not need to or make this decision ourselves.therefore,we add this approval power to the short list of actions a district court may take during the pendency of an appeal.
that leaves this case,in which for the sake of efficiency we eschew a remand and proceed as if milberg weiss were approved as appellate counsel.moreover,because we affirm the district court opinion,we do not require union to secure ex post approval for this appeal.
does union have a valid claim under section b 
section b of the exchange act makes it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.b.rule makes it illegal,as a manipulative or deceptive device,t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.
to make out a securities fraud claim under section b,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a materially false or misleading statement or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading the defendant acted with scienter and the plaintiff reliance on the defendant misstatement caused him or her injury.cal.pub.employees ret.chubb,cir citing in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.these requirements are heightened by the pslra,which requires that the complaint state with particularity all facts on which plaintiff belief is formed.b.at issue in this case is whether merck statements were material and whether union properly alleged false or misleading statements by merck and medco.
when merck disclosed information regarding its revenue calculations,was the disclosure material 
we have said that establishing materiality is the first step for a plaintiff with a section b claim.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.the district court discussed briefly the issue of materiality regarding union b claim,but it did not reach the issue because it ultimately found that union had failed sufficiently to show scienter.union argues that merck statements were material,citing the fact that merck stock dropped significantly when the wall street journal s article detailing medco accounting practices appeared.merck claims that because its stock price rose immediately following its initial,minimal disclosure,the disclosure was immaterial as a matter of law.
our court,as compared to the other courts of appeals,has one of the clearest commitments to the efficient market hypothesis nathaniel carden,comment,implications of the private securities litigation reform act of for judicial presumptions of market efficiency,chi.our burlington opinion created a standard for measuring the materiality of statements in an efficient market see at.in,we ratified the burlington standard in oran stafford,cir citing burlington.the standard holds that the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement,in the period immediately following disclosure,of the price of the firm stock.id.
in oran,information was disclosed on july,and the stock price rose for four days afterward.we held that the failure to disclose the information earlier was immaterial.id.at.similarly,in in re nahc.securities litigation,we discerned no negative effect on a company stock price immediately following the date of disclosure,cir.again,we held the disclosed information immaterial as a matter of law.id.
in this case,the disclosure occurred on april,and there was no negative effect on merck stock.the wall street journal s article,accompanied by a significant decline in merck stock,appeared two months later.union claims that this june stock decline demonstrates the materiality of the information merck disclosed.but the situation we faced in nahc was similar the company stock price plunged just three weeks after the disclosure was made.id.at.that disclosure was made on november,with no negative effect on the stock price,but the stock plummeted on november,after another disclosure.id.at.we held the first disclosure not material.merck stock did not drop after the first disclosure,and that is generally when we measure the materiality of the disclosure,not two months later.
in basic levinson,the supreme court declined to resolve how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price,d.union tells us that we can not therefore apply the standard.but it overlooks that our court has resolved how quickly and completely public information is absorbed into a firm stock price.we have decided that this absorption occurs in the period immediately following disclosure.oran,at.
this does not mean instantaneously,of course,but in this case there was no adverse effect to merck stock price from the disclosure in the period immediately following disclosure.in fact,merck stock continued to rise from its baseline of,including the april filing date,for five trading days after the disclosure.the rise was followed by a decline,which reached a low of.then,starting on may,merck stock remained above until june.but union expects us to ignore this increase in merck stock price in favor of a decline of little over.this we will not do.
union also argues that the april disclosure was so opaque that it should not have counted as a disclosure.although merck disclosed that it had recognized as revenue in april,it did not disclose the sum total of those until july.this is why,union claims,the stock price did not drop until the wall street journal s reporter made public the estimated magnitude of the recognition.in effect,union is arguing that investors and analysts stood in uncomprehending suspension for over two months until the journal brought light to the market darkness.
the journal reporter arrived at an estimate of billion of recognized in by using one assumption and performing one subtraction and one multiplication on the information contained in the april.she determined the number of retail prescriptions filled million by subtracting prescriptions filled million from total prescriptions filled million.she then assumed an average and multiplied that average by the number of retail prescriptions filled to get billion 
the issue is whether needing this amount of mathematical proficiency to make sense of the disclosure negates the disclosure itself.we scrutinized a disclosure requiring calculation in ash lfe,cir.a proxy statement disclosed directors current pension amounts and,in another section,their newly proposed pension amounts,but it did not disclose the increase.id.at.we held that requiring readers to perform the subtraction themselves was immaterial because the facts we re disclosed prominently and candidly.id.at we decline to hold that those responsible for the preparation of proxy solicitations must assume that stockholders can not perform simple subtraction.the calculation from merck was somewhat more required some close reading and an assumption as to the amount of the.but the added,albeit minimal,arithmetic complexity of the calculation hardly undermines faith in an efficient market.
union points out nonetheless that merck was followed by many analysts,including morgan,morgan stanley,and salomon smith barney,who closely examine a company revenue and revenue growth when valuing a company stock in merck industry.compl.the logical corollary of union argument then is the following rhetorical question if these focused on unable for two months to make a handful of calculations,how can we presume an efficient market at all union is trying to have it both ways the market understood all the good things that merck said about its revenue but was not smart enough to understand the disclosure an efficient market for good news is an efficient market for bad news.the journal reporter simply did the math on june the efficient market hypothesis suggests that the market made these basic calculations months earlier.
but we do not wish to reward opaqueness.we decline to decide how many mathematical calculations are too many or how strained assumptions must be,but merck was clearly treading a fine line with this delayed,piecemeal disclosure.it should have disclosed the amount of recognized as revenue in the april it should have disclosed this policy as soon as it was adopted.sunshine is a fine disinfectant,and merck tried for too long to stay in the shade.the facts were disclosed,though,and it is simply too much for us to say that every analyst following merck,one of the largest companies in the world,was in the dark.
did union properly allege that false or misleading statements were made by merck and medco 
i were the merck and medco statements regarding their independence false or misleading 
union complaint alleges that medco made false statements about merck and medco independence.the district court held that these statements were not actionable because union supporting evidence came mostly from dates outside the class period.medco website contained statements about medco independence policy.the website stated,among other things,that medco would make decisions on the therapeutic aspects of its programs without substantive influence from merck and would treat merck products no differently from those of any other manufacturer,observing the same procedures for independent clinical review as it does for drugs of any other manufacturer.compl.union produced data showing the extent to which merck market share among medco beneficiaries was significantly higher than its nationwide market share.
the district court discarded this evidence,holding it unusable because most of it arose from outside the class period.to support its holding,the court cited only a case from the northern district of california,clearly canadian,which held statements made or insider trading done outside the class period irrelevant to the plaintiffs fraud claims.in re clearly canadian sec.the clearly canadian court,though,had just denied the defendants motion to dismiss and was striking from the plaintiffs complaint nearly pages of allegations of statements and insider trading from outside the class period.id.the court was removing claims because the defendants were not liable for them it was not addressing their relevance as evidence.
two second circuit cases have,however,addressed information for the purposes of allowing inferences to be drawn.in novak kasaks the plaintiffs complaint provided facts about inventory from after the expiration of the class period,and the court held that those facts supported the plaintiffs allegations that inventory issues existed during the class period,cir.it further held that a report showing inventory information six months after the class period supports the inference that inventory during the class period was similar.id.at.in a case the second circuit reversed the district court,holding that data was relevant to show defendants knowledge at the start of the class period.in re scholastic.sec,cir.the court made clear that both data and data could be used to confirm what a defendant should have known during the class period,noting that a ny information that sheds light on whether class period statements were false or materially misleading is relevant.id.
the district court in our case found that union could not rely on statistical data collected prior to the commencement of the class period to buttress its contention that the statements on medco website were misleading.in re merck.sec,src,slip op.at july.this finding directly conflicts with the second circuit holding in scholastic,and the clearly canadian case is meager support.we shall follow the second circuit here and hold the data regarding merck market share relevant to showing medco statements to be misleading.t
