this is an appeal from the final written decision of the united states patent and trademark office,patent trial and appeal board board in two consolidated inter partes review ipr proceedings of patent the patent,owned by novartis ag and mistubishi tanabe pharma collectively,novartis.the board instituted iprs on all claims of the patent based on petitions filed by torrent pharmaceuticals limited,apotex,and mylan pharmaceuticals collectively,petitioners.after reviewing the claims,receiving extensive briefing,and hearing oral argument,the board found all original claims of the patent and novartis proposed substitute claims unpatentable as obvious.see torrent pharm.novartis ag,nos,wl ptab,final written decision.novartis raises a series of challenges to the board analysis of the evidence and ultimate determination of unpatentability.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
the patent relates to a solid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration,comprising a phosphate receptor agonist and a sugar alcohol,which the patent explains is useful for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.patent,lines,lines.according to the specification,receptor agonists generally exhibit properties that make formulations suitable for oral administration of a solid composition difficult to create.however,solid compositions comprising a sugar alcohol provide formulations which are particularly well suited to the oral administration of receptor agonists.see id.at,lines.they also provide a convenient means of systemic administration of receptor agonists,do not suffer from the disadvantages of liquid formulations for injection or oral use,and have good physiocochemical and storage properties.id.at,lines.in such a composition,the receptor agonist is the active ingredient and the sugar alcohol acts as an excipient the substance formulated alongside the active ingredient as a diluent,carrier,filler bulking agent for the composition.see id.at,lines.
the patent states that there are multiple known receptor agonists appropriate for use in the claimed invention,set forth in the specification as formulas i xiii.id.at,line to,line.the patent also states that a particularly preferred receptor agonist of formula i is,ethyl diol in free form or in a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form id.at,lines.is also known as fingolimod.the patent further discloses that the specific sugar alcohol used in the claimed composition may suitably be mannitol,because of its properties,it is not likely to absorb moisture,which is beneficial in manufacturing solid oral pills.id.at,lines.
claims and of the patent are the only independent claims and are illustrative of the claimed subject matter 
a solid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration,comprising 
a a receptor agonist which is selected from l ethyl diol,chloropheny l,chlorophenyl,or chlorophenyl,and its phosphates or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and 
b a sugar alcohol.
a solid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration,comprising mannitol and ethyl diol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
id.at,lines,lines.thus,claim is directed towards a solid oral composition comprised of the combination of one of a handful of receptor agonists and any sugar alcohol,whereas claim is directed towards the specific combination of fingolimod and mannitol in a solid oral composition.
the dependent claims are directed towards various refinements of the composition,including for example,the addition of a lubricant 
a composition according to claim,further comprising a lubricant.
id.at,lines.other claims are directed towards adjusting the respective amount of ingredients 
a composition according to claim,wherein the compound ethyl diol,or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,is present in an amount of to by weight,based on the total weight of the composition.
a composition according to claim,wherein mannitol is present in an amount of to by weight,based on the total weight of the composition.
id.at,lines.
while the application leading to the patent was pending at the patent office,novartis applied to the food and drug administration fda for approval to sell a pill to treat multiple sclerosis under the gilenya brand name.the fda approved gilenya for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in.
on may,torrent filed a petition to institute an inter partes review of claims of the patent.torrent petition presented three separate patentability challenges 
claims are unpatentable as obvious over the combination of patent chiba and pharmaceutics the science of dosage form design aulton and 
claims,and are unpatentable as anticipated by patent sakai and 
claims are unpatentable as obvious over chiba and sakai.
chiba teaches the use of immunosuppressive compounds with fingolimod as the preferred species.chiba also teaches that these immunosuppressive compounds are useful for treating autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis,among other diseases and conditions.chiba goes on to disclose oral administration of fingolimod,including admix ing with a carrier,excipient,diluent,and so on and formulat ion into capsules or tablets for administering to patients.in discussing the preparation of these capsules and tablets for oral administration of fingolimod,chiba teaches that pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients for use with the compounds noted herein are known in the art or can be readily found by methods and tests known in the art.in other words,chiba teaches a solid oral composition of fingolimod combined with a generic excipient.
aulton teaches the use of tablets and capsules to administer drugs orally.it specifically teaches that t he successful formulation of a stable and effective solid dosage form depends on the careful selection of the excipients which are added to facilitate administration,promote the consistent release and bioavailability of the drug and protect it from degradation.aulton recommends mannitol as a common diluent used in t ableting by the wet granulation process,which aulton describes as the most widely used method for pharmaceutical materials.aulton describes mannitol as expensive,but commonly used as an excipient in solid oral compositions.
sakai describes a pharmaceutical composition containing fingolimod as an active ingredient.more particularly,sakai discloses that the composition can be formulated into a liquid preparation,or can be a solid lyophilized product.sakai further discloses that the addition of a saccharide,such as sugar alcohol,to the composition can result in a less irritating resulting liquid solution.sakai discloses a list of eight exemplary saccharides,including mannitol.the saccharide,such as mannitol,can be dissolved in the liquid for dissolution,or alternatively may be contained in the lyophilized product along with the active ingredient.sakai teaches that this liquid pharmaceutical composition can be used for immunosuppression in connection with organ or bone marrow transplantation,autoimmune diseases,or allergic diseases.id.in short,sakai teaches the specific combination of fingolimod and mannitol for a liquid formulation.
on december,the board granted in part torrent petition and instituted trial to review patentability of the challenged claims in.specifically,the board instituted on the first ground,the combination of chiba and aulton,but declined to institute on grounds two or three.the board found that chiba discloses the use of fingolimod in a solid formulation for oral administration when combined with conventional excipients.it then found that aulton teaches the use of mannitol as a conventional excipient that a person of skill in the art would have looked to when formulating a solid composition with fingolimod.
the board found sakai to be an improper anticipatory reference because the reference does not describe a solid composition suitable for oral administration.it then rejected the grounds predicated on the combination of chiba and sakai for similar reasons,noting that,unlike aulton,sakai does not identify mannitol as a conventional excipient in solid pharmaceutical compositions,and sakai stated reasons for using mannitol in liquid pharmaceutical compositions are inapplicable to its potential use in connection with solid pharmaceutical compositions.
apotex and mylan thereafter filed a separate petition seeking to institute an ipr of claims of the patent based on the grounds and requested joinder with the torrent proceedings.on february,the board instituted trial in this proceeding in and joined it with the torrent proceeding.
after briefing and oral argument,the board issued its final written decision in the consolidated proceeding.the board concluded that chiba and aulton collectively teach each limitation of claims of the patent.it first addressed claim,directed towards the specific combination of fingolimod and mannitol.the board found that chiba and aulton together strongly suggested the claimed combination 
first,chiba teaches that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been able to identify or easily determine excipients that would have been compatible with fingolimod pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients for use with the compounds noted herein are known in the art or can be readily found by methods and tests known in the art.second,aulton teaches that mannitol is not only a known diluent for direct compression manufacturing,but also commonly used in wet granulation,which aulton teaches is the most widely used method for pharmaceutical materials.this combination of teachings already strongly suggests that mannitol likely would have been a target of investigation for a person of ordinary skill in the art interested in finding an excipient compatible with fingolimod 
final written decision,wl,at.after finding that the two references themselves strongly suggested the claimed invention,the board expressly found additional evidence of the reason to combine fingolimod and mannitol.id.first,the board noted that sakai directly instructs that the two ingredients should be combined.id.although novartis argued in its briefs below that sakai teaching is narrowly limited to pharmaceutical compositions,as opposed to the claimed solid oral dosage forms,the board observed that novartis own expert,stephen byrn,had written an article describing how solution studies can be very helpful in understanding drug degradations in the solid state.id.despite novartis attempt to minimize the article meaning,the board concluded that a suggestion to combine ingredients in the liquid phase would have been relevant to the determination of a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the same ingredients in the solid phase.id.
acknowledging that it had denied instituting the ipr based on sakai alone per or in combination with chiba per,the board distinguished its final decision usage of sakai,explaining that its final decision simply relied on sakai as a background reference that offered additional motivation evidence to combine chiba with aulton.the board explained that even though sakai did not teach that mannitol is a conventional excipient for use in solid pharmaceutical compositions,the record evidence relating to byrn article,which was debated by the parties,supported a finding that sakai teaching would have been relevant to the decision on which excipient to use in formulating a solid oral dosage form of fingolimod.id.
the board went on to find that several additional background references in the proceeding demonstrate that mannitol provides advantages when used as a diluent in tableting,further supporting a reason to combine.the board concluded its motivation to combine analysis 
given the knowledge in the art that mannitol provided advantages in formulating tablets generally,chiba teaching that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been able to identify or easily determine excipients that would have been compatible with fingolimod,aulton teaching that mannitol was a diluent commonly used in the most common form of pharmaceutical manufacture,sakai teaching that mannitol and fingolimod should be combined in the liquid phase,and byrn statement that compatibility was relevant to the prediction of compatibility,we conclude that petitioners have shown a reason to combine the teachings of chiba and aulton.
the board next turned to the objective indicia of nonobviousness.first,it found that independent claims and were not commensurate in scope with the purported unexpected result of fingolimod low concentration stability when combined with mannitol,because the independent claims are not limited to any particular dose or dose range of fingolimod.id.at.therefore,the board concluded,even if the stability of the combination at low doses was unexpected,it is insufficient to support a legally significant finding of unexpected results.id.at.the board also rejected novartis but unsolved need,industry praise,and commercial success arguments because all of novartis proffered evidence was directed solely toward the fact that gilenya was a solid oral multiple sclerosis treatment,which was already known in the prior art.
the board then analyzed the dependent claims in turn.relevant to this appeal,the board turned to dependent claims,and,and proposed amended claims,and,directed towards concentrations with low percentages of fingolimod by weight.the board found that petitioners provide evidence that the selection of the relative amounts of the constituents of the claimed formulation is the result of routine optimization.id.at.it further noted,w e have not been directed to any evidence of record contradicting this evidence,so we find that a person of ordinary skill in the art familiar with chiba and aulton would have been able and motivated to optimize the amount of fingolimod id.
in conclusion,the board held every claim unpatentable as obvious and denied novartis motion to amend for essentially the same reasons it rejected the original claims.appellants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under a a.
discussion 
we review board decisions using the standard set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.in re sullivan,fed.cir.citing dickinson zurko,see also belden berk tek llc,fed.cir.under the apa,we must hold unlawful and set aside agency action not in accordance with law or without observance of procedure required by law.
we review the board legal conclusions de novo but review for substantial evidence any underlying factual determinations.see nike,adidas ag,fed.cir.in re giannelli,fed.cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb,see in re applied materials,fed.cir.
on appeal,novartis first contends that the board violated the apa when it relied on sakai in the final written decision without affording novartis proper notice and a chance to be heard.novartis goes on to argue that the board also erred on the merits,specifically in its analysis of the motivation to combine evidence and in its treatment of the alleged objective indicia of nonobviousness.
apa due process 
we first turn to novartis argument that the board violated the requirements of notice and an opportunity to respond found in the apa when it used the sakai reference as part of its motivation to combine analysis in the final written decision.according to novartis,the board ruled sakai entirely out of the case in the institution decision,and on that basis,denied institution of the two proposed grounds based on sakai.novartis contends that it relied on that ruling and consequently submitted a vastly different record than it would have if it had known sakai was still a live issue.
in a formal adjudication,such as an ipr,the apa imposes certain procedural requirements on the agency.the patent and trademark office,including the board,must provide the patent owner with timely notice of the matters of fact and law asserted,and an opportunity to submit facts and argument.b c,c dell acceleron,llc,fed.cir.the notice and opportunity to be heard provisions of the apa have been applied to mean that an agency may not change theories in midstream without giving respondents reasonable notice of the change and the opportunity to present argument under the new theory.belden,at quoting rodale press,ftc,cir.in this case we conclude that the relevant apa provisions were satisfied.
we first disagree with novartis that the board ruled sakai out of the case entirely in the institution decision.in the institution decision,the board declined to read sakai as an anticipatory reference or primary obviousness reference because sakai does not disclose mannitol as a conventional excipient in solid pharmaceutical compositions,and sakai stated reasons for using mannitol in liquid pharmaceutical compositions are inapplicable to its potential use in connection with solid pharmaceutical compositions.in other words,although sakai discloses the combination of fingolimod and mannitol,it does not expressly disclose the combination in a solid pharmaceutical composition nor does its teaching of a liquid composition necessarily translate to a solid oral composition.
this conclusion,however,is not contrary to the board discussion of sakai in the final written decision that sakai teachings would have nevertheless been relevant to one of skill in the art in deciding which excipients to use in formulating a solid oral dosage form of fingolimod.having already found that chiba and aulton strongly suggest the combination of fingolimod and mannitol in a solid oral composition,the board found that sakai merely reinforced its finding that the person of ordinary skill in the art would have expected mannitol to be compatible with fingolimod because sakai discloses a stable combination of these two ingredients suitable for preservation.the board discussion of sakai in the final written decision was not inconsistent with its review of sakai in the institution decision.
we also reject as unfounded novartis complaints of surprise and contention that,following the institution decision,the parties paid sakai scant attention in subsequent proceedings.the parties debated sakai at length throughout the proceeding and in the same context that it was discussed by the board in the final written decision.
as an initial matter,we note that in addition to asserting sakai as a primary reference,torrent petition also argued that several references,including sakai,further support the motivation to combine the teachings of chiba and aulton.specifically,torrent argued in connection with the combination of chiba and aulton that sakai ex.reinforced the expectation to the artisan that mannitol would have been compatible with fingolimod because sakai discloses pharmaceutical injectable compositions containing fingolimod and mannitol in solution,as well as lyophilized product meant for preservation in vials containing fingolimod and mannitol.and in support of their petition,apotex and mylan also explained that sakai would direct the person of ordinary skill in the art to the combined teachings of chiba with aulton.it reiterated the argument raised in the torrent petition that the ordinarily skilled artisan would have naturally considered mannitol because of its known compatibility with fingolimod,again citing sakai disclosure of a stable composition comprised of these two ingredients.
following institution of the proceeding and joinder with the torrent proceeding,the relevance of sakai to support a motivation to combine chiba and aulton was an ongoing,debated issue that novartis addressed directly,on multiple occasions.in its patent owner response,novartis specifically argued that petitioners reliance on sakai in connection with the motivation to combine inquiry lacked merit because sakai is relevant only to liquid compositions.petitioners continued to press the issue in their reply,contending that sakai would have provided a person of skill in the art with a reasonable expectation that mannitol is compatible with fingolimod.
furthermore,both petitioners expert and novartis expert went into significant detail in their declarations discussing sakai and its applicability to the motivation to combine inquiry.novartis counsel then questioned petitioners expert at length about sakai.and novartis submitted observations on cross examination repeatedly explained why sakai did not support petitioners motivation to combine argument.at the hearing,both parties submitted demonstrative slides dedicated to sakai and spent considerable attention discussing sakai relevance as a background reference supporting the motivation to utilize mannitol with fingolimod in an oral formulation.based on this record,it is quite clear that novartis had more than sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard on sakai potential relevance,and in fact actively and repeatedly attempted to distinguish sakai to defeat the very argument relied on by the board in the final written decision.
in sum,we reject novartis contention to this court that it believed sakai was not at issue in the proceeding for this reason we reject novartis apa challenge.
finding no apa violation for the reasons discussed above,we nevertheless also reject novartis characterization of sakai as the missing link in the board obviousness analysis.contrary to novartis contention,sakai was discussed by the board as one of several independent grounds supporting the motivation to combine fingolimod and mannitol in a solid oral composition.in finding a motivation to combine,the board explained that the teachings of chiba and aulton alone already strongly suggests that mannitol likely would have been a target of investigation for a person of ordinary skill in the art interested in finding an excipient compatible with fingolimod.final written decision,wl,at.
nevertheless,the board continued to bolster its analysis with additional evidence of the reason to combine fingolimod and mannitol.id.and sakai teaching to combine fingolimod and mannitol was just one of those additional reasons.the board further explained that i n addition to the direct teaching in sakai that mannitol and fingolimod should be combined,several documents that would have been known to a person of ordinary skill in the art teach that mannitol provides advantages when used as a diluent in tableting.id.at.the board went on to explain that these references all unchallenged on appeal describe known advantages of using mannitol as an excipient in solid oral compositions that provide a strong reason to combine chiba teaching of a solid oral dosage form of fingolimod and aulton teaching of mannitol as an excipient for making solid oral dosage forms.id.these additional references are also substantial evidence supporting the board motivation to combine conclusion,independent of sakai.this is not a case where sakai provided the linchpin of the board analysis,as novartis contends.
for all these reasons,we find no violation of the apa with respect to the board discussion of sakai in the final written decision.
ii.obviousness 
we turn to novartis remaining challenges to the board obviousness analysis.
obviousness is a mixed question of fact and law.the board ultimate conclusion that the claims are not obvious is a legal determination subject to de novo review,however,the subsidiary factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence.in re gartside,fed.cir.motivation to combine is one of those underlying factual issues.id.the presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact.whether objective indicia support a finding of nonobviousness is also a factual question.merck cie gnosis,fed.cir.
motivation to combine 
novartis argues that the board further erred in its motivation to combine analysis because it failed to read the prior art as a whole and overlooked critical evidence of mannitol known disadvantages as an excipient for solid compositions.in particular,novartis argues that it pointed out mannitol negative properties,including difficulty to manufacture,the existence of impurities,and expense.because the board did not expressly state that it was weighing all of these negatives against mannitol positives,novartis contends that the board motivation to combine analysis was legally flawed.in support of its contention,novartis directs the court to medichem,rolabo,fed.cir.in medichem,thi
