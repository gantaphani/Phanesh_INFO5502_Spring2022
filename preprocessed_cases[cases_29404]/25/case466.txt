zydus pharmaceuticals usa,and cadila healthcare limited appellants or zydus appeal from a final judgment of the district court for the district of new jersey finding that appellants had infringed claim of patent patent and had failed to establish that it was invalid.for the reasons stated below,we reverse the district court finding of infringement,but affirm its ruling on invalidity.
background 
takeda pharmaceutical company limited,takeda pharmaceuticals north america,takeda pharmaceuticals,llc,takeda pharmaceuticals america,and ethypharm,appellees or takeda own patents that claim the formulation for the drug prevacid solutab.prevacid solutab contains the active ingredient lansoprazole,which is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease,or acid reflux.it is the only proton pump inhibitor available as an orally disintegrable tablet.a patient taking prevacid solutab simply allows the tablet to disintegrate in his or her mouth,leaving behind thousands of granules which the patient then swallows.the stated objective of the patent is that the formulation contains granules small enough to avoid a feeling of roughness in the patient mouth upon disintegration.
in,zydus filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration,seeking to manufacture a generic version of prevacid solutab.takeda then filed suit,alleging that zydus anda product infringed multiple claims of several patents.only claim of the patent remains at issue.zydus counterclaimed,alleging that claim was invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of.
claim recites 
an orally disintegrable tablet which comprises i fine granules having an average particle diameter of m or less,which fine granules comprise a composition coated by an enteric coating layer comprising a first component which is an enteric coating agent and a second component which is a agent,said composition having weight or more of an physiologically active substrate that is lansoprazole and ii an additive wherein said tablet having a hardness strength of about to about kg,is orally disintegrable.
patent ll.the district court held a claim construction hearing,at which it construed the claim term fine granules having an average particle diameter of m or less.takeda argued that the term should be construed to include a deviation of,because it is universally accepted that there is a standard of error for particle size measurements.zydus,on the other hand,argued that the term should be construed as precisely.the district court agreed with takeda,and construed the term to mean fine granules up to and including the enteric coating layer having an average particle diameter of m or less.takeda pharm.zydus pharms.usa,wl,at.
the issue of infringement turned on how particle size was measured.during the manufacturing process,individual cores of lansoprazole are enteric coated using a coating process.inevitably,that process results in a certain portion of the coated cores becoming fused together.these fused granules are known as hard agglomerates.
takeda argued that the average particle diameter should be determined by measuring each individual core,regardless of whether they had fused together into a hard agglomerate.taking that measurement requires virtual dissection of hard agglomerates,meaning drawing an artificial line between the two fused cores such that the software will treat them separately for measurement purposes.obviously,artificially dividing large hard agglomerates into several smaller granules for measurement purposes lowers the average particle size of a sample,making it more likely to infringe claim of the patent.zydus argued that,to the contrary,because the specification describes measuring particle size after the coating process and says nothing about deagglomeration,it by definition includes hard agglomerates in the measurement of average particle diameter.in support of its position,zydus pointed out that the actual size of the fused particles is what is relevant to how the granules feel in the patient mouth,regardless of the size of the smaller fused cores that make up a hard agglomerate.under the district court claim construction,where the maximum average particle size is m,zydus anda product would infringe claim of the patent if hard agglomerates were virtually dissected prior to measurement,but would not infringe if hard agglomerates were included in the measurement.
after a bench trial,the district court agreed with takeda and found that the patent requires measuring the average diameter of each core,regardless of how many cores are in a given hard agglomerate.takeda pharm,zydus pharms.usa,slip op.at may,opinion.based on that finding,the district court determined that zydus anda product infringed claim of the patent.id.at.the district court further concluded that zydus had failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that claim was invalid.id.at.the court then entered an injunction preventing zydus from manufacturing or selling its anda product until the expiration of the patent.id.at.zydus appealed all of the district court rulings.
we have jurisdiction under a.
claim construction 
claim construction is a question of law that we review without deference.cybor fas,en banc.our starting point in construing a claim term must be the words of the claim itself.see vitronics conceptronic,phillips awh,en banc t he claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms.however,it is axiomatic that the claims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.phillips,at quoting markman westview instruments,en banc,aff.additionally,a court should also consider the patent prosecution history,if it is in evidence.markman,at.although courts are permitted to consider extrinsic evidence,such as expert testimony,dictionaries,and treatises,we have cautioned that such evidence is generally of less significance than the intrinsic record.phillips,at citing bard,surgical.ultimately,t he construction that stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns with the patent description of the invention will be,in the end,the correct construction.renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the disputed claim language.zydus challenges the district court construction of the claim term fine granules having an average particle diameter of m or less.the district court construed that term to include a deviation.zydus argues that it should be construed to require an average particle diameter of precisely m or less.we agree with zydus that the district court erred in reading a margin of error into the disputed claim term.
beginning with the claim language itself as we must there is no indication in the claim that m was intended to mean anything other than exactly to the contrary,the phrase m or less is not qualified by the word about or any other indicator of imprecision.
moreover,the specification confirms that the inventors did not intend to deviate from that clear and unambiguous plain meaning.first,the specification contrasts the fine granules of the claimed invention with larger conventional granules,which it defines as m or more of average particle diameter.patent ll.the specification explains that conventional granules of that size produce a feeling of roughness in the mouth one of the very problems the claimed invention purports to solve.id.ll.that clear dividing line between the fine granules of m or less which avoid a feeling of roughness in the mouth and conventional granules of m or more which do not disappears if the fine granules are construed as incorporating a deviation.thus,there can be little doubt that the narrower construction most naturally aligns with the patent description of the invention.renishaw,at.
second,the specification goes on to explain that the maximum particle size is practically m or less,where practically means that the particles may include a small quantity about weight or less of particles whose particle diameter is out of above described range.patent.elsewhere,the patent defines average particle diameter to mean the median particle diameter.see id.ll.it would be impossible for a tablet to comply with the specification maximum particle diameter of practically m meaning that only of particles have diameters larger than m if it had a median particle diameter of m meaning that of the particles are larger than m,as the district court claim construction would permit.this tension suggests that the inventors did not intend to incorporate a deviation into the average particle diameter of claim.
takeda argues that the inventors effectively acted as their own lexicographers and modified the plain meaning of the term fine granules in the specification.the specification states 
in the present invention,fine granules having an average particle diameter of m or less,which fine granules comprise a composition coated by an enteric coating layer,said composition having weight or more of an physiologically active substance have an average particle diameter of about m or less,in order that roughness is not felt in the mouth.preferably,the average particle diameter of the fine granules is to 
patent ll.emphasis added.takeda maintains that the inventors therefore expressly defined m as an approximate figure,and that a skilled artisan would know that a standard deviation for measurements is.we disagree.
the word about is used to modify the phrase m or less only three times in the specification.in addition to the passage quoted above,the specification states 
t he average particle a sic diameter of the included granules must be about m or less,preferably about 
id.ll.and later,it reiterates 
the fine granules have an average particle diameter of about m or less,preferably m or less.preferably the average particle diameter of the fine granules is to 
id.ll.in every one of these instances,the word about is immediately followed by a preference for an average particle size lower than nowhere does the specification suggest that an average particle size greater than m even within of that figure could achieve the inventive result of avoiding a feeling of roughness in the mouth.thus,we are not persuaded that the mere presence of the word about at three points in the specification can justify a expansion of claim scope.
indeed,the remainder of claim demonstrates that the inventors knew how to express ambiguity in claim language when they so desired it provides that the tablet must have a hardness strength of about to about kg.patent emphasis added.plainly,then,had the inventors desired the average particle diameter to include a margin of error,they could easily have included the word about in the claim language.in the absence of their decision to do so,however,we will not take it upon ourselves to rewrite the claim in that way.
this reading of the specification is confirmed by the prosecution history.there,the inventors distinguished the claimed invention over a potentially invalidating prior art reference because the reference failed to disclose an average particle diameter of m or less.the inventors explained that b y having the average particle diameter of the granules within m,the feeling of roughness in a mouth can be prevented.emphasis added.in other words,the inventors have consistently relied on m as the dividing line between granules that would avoid roughness in the mouth and those that would not meaning those that were within the scope of the invention,and those that were not.we long ago established that w here there is an equal choice between a broader and a narrower meaning of a claim,and there is an enabling disclosure that indicates that the applicant is at least entitled to a claim having the narrower meaning,we consider the notice function of the claim to be best served by adopting the narrower meaning.athletic alternatives,prince.thus,even if the two proposed constructions before us presented an equal choice and they do not the narrower construction would be more appropriate.
we therefore reverse the district court claim construction and conclude that the proper construction of the disputed claim term is fine granules having an average particle diameter of precisely m or less.
ii.infringement 
as explained above,the dispute as to literal infringement turned on whether the patent required virtual dissection of hard agglomerates prior to particle size measurement.even using virtual dissection,however,takeda measured zydus anda product as having an average particle diameter of m well outside the claimed range as we have now construed it.appellants br.thus,there can be no dispute that zydus anda product does not literally infringe claim of the patent 
we therefore reverse the district court finding of literal infringement.
iii.invalidity 
zydus raises several challenges to the validity of the patent based on a failure to satisfy the requirements of.a number of those arguments related to the claim construction adopted by the district court,which we have now reversed,and are therefore moot.we will address the remaining arguments in turn.
indefiniteness 
we review a district court ruling on indefiniteness de novo,as it is a question of law.eplus,lawson software.whether a claim is invalid for indefiniteness requires a determination whether those skilled in the art would understand what is claimed when the claim is read in light of the specification.morton int l,cardinal chem.as always,the party challenging the patent bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.microsoft.
zydus argues that the patent is indefinite because it does not specify the method of measurement that should be used to determine average particle diameter zydus insists that there are several methods that could potentially be used to take that measurement,and the same sample could be either infringing or depending on the measurement technique used.thus,the skilled artisan has no way to determine whether his or her product infringes the patent based on the information provided in the specification.
we disagree.it is true that there was evidence from both parties experts that there are several possible ways to measure average particle diameter.indeed,the patent specification itself identifies laser diffraction as just one example of such a measurement technique,patent ll,and the experts agreed that optical microscopy is another equally viable method.additionally,the experts agreed that different measurement techniques could indeed produce different results.the variation arises from the difficulty in measuring the average diameter of particles that are not perfect spheres.by necessity,both techniques involve indirect measurements laser diffraction involves analyzing the diffraction patterns of a laser beam passed through a field of particles,while optical microscopy involves equating a pixelated image with an equivalent spherical diameter.see.because the two methods use different means of approximating average particle diameter,they can produce different results even for the same sample.
however,we do not believe that the mere possibility of different results from different measurement techniques renders claim indefinite.rather,the evidence established that both methods of measurement accurately report average particle diameter the experts agreed that the correct but differing particle size results obtained using various instruments are all equally correct,but each simply may be expressing its correct results in different terms.testimony of zydus expert harry brittain see also testimony of takeda expert stephen byrn.
moreover,there is no evidence that the differences between these techniques are in fact significant there was evidence before the trial court that although the results may be different,there is a high degree of correlation for the results between the two techniques,which should give equivalent numbers with respect to any variants associated with either technique.see.and indeed,there was no evidence in this case that different measurement techniques in fact produced significantly different results for the same sample.to the contrary,the measurements of zydus anda product using laser diffraction and optical microscopy,though not exactly the same,were substantially similar.compare wit
