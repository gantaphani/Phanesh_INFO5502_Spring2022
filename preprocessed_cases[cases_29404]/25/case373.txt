malladi drugs and pharmaceuticals,malladi dpl,a corporation based in india,is a supplier of pharmaceutical raw materials.at the time of the underlying events,malladi,a united states subsidiary of malladi dpl,imported list i chemicals from malladi dpl and sold them in the united states to novus fine chemicals,llc novus,among other companies.novus is now a subsidiary of malladi dpl,and malladi,which is not a party to this litigation,has ceased operations.
on april,dea agents inspected malladi,procedures for list i chemicals at its corporate headquarters in new jersey.the agents expressed reservations about the organization of malladi,file room,its document retention system,and the availability of documentation necessary to reconcile inventory.the dea agents returned to malladi,headquarters two days later and seized drums of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in inventory,valued at.on april,the agents again returned to malladi,corporate headquarters and,according to the allegations of the complaint,demanded surrender of the company dea import registration,which the manager relinquished under duress and pressure from several dea officials.after malladi,surrendered its import registration,the dea seized three shipments of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine shipped from malladi dpl in india to malladi,in new jersey upon their arrival at united states ports drums of ephedrine hydrochloride,valued at,on april drums of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride,valued at,on april and drums of ephedrine hydrochloride,valued at,on may.the aggregate value of all four seizures from malladi,was.
the dea notified malladi,of the four seizures and its intention to administratively forfeit the chemicals.the letters of notification also informed malladi,of the procedures and deadlines for filing a claim to contest the forfeiture in court and for filing a petition requesting remission or mitigation of the forfeiture from the dea.malladi did not file a claim for the property,which would have entitled it to judicial forfeiture proceedings,but instead allowed the dea to administratively forfeit the goods and then filed a petition for remission of each of the four seizures.the dea denied all four petitions and administratively forfeited the chemicals.
malladi then filed suit against the dea in district court for return of the chemicals or the institution of judicial forfeiture proceedings.in its action,malladi contended that the dea was required to pursue judicial,rather than administrative,forfeiture because the four aggregated value of which exceeded part of a single plan accomplished when the dea seized malladi inventory and then constructively seized the three inbound shipments by demanding malladi import registration.see.malladi also argued that the dea should have treated its petitions for remission as claims compelling judicial proceedings and that the administrative forfeitures violated its fifth amendment due process rights.the dea moved to dismiss the complaint,urging that malladi never filed a claim seeking judicial process,that aggregation of the four seizures was not required,and that malladi waived the aggregation argument by not raising it before the dea.the district court granted the motion to dismiss,concluding sua sponte that aggregation was inappropriate because the dea could not have constructively seized the shipments by demanding malladi import license under duress,when malladi itself stated that it voluntarily surrendered its list i registration in its four petitions to the dea,which it attached to its complaint.the court also held that malladi petitions for remission could not be considered claims requiring the dea to commence judicial forfeiture proceedings and that the due process argument failed because it was predicated on the other two unsuccessful arguments.
malladi appealed and now argues that the district court failed to accept the facts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to malladi when the court rejected the factual allegation of duress because it believed that allegation contradicted malladi explanation in its petitions to the dea that it voluntarily surrendered its import registration.we affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint,but on the alternative ground that malladi failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before the dea and should not now be given a second opportunity to pursue judicial forfeiture when it failed to seek that remedy
