jsp is a small new york company that manufactures unithroid,an orally administered ls tablet used to treat thyroid diseases.on august,fda announced that,although doctors had been prescribing ls tablets to millions of patients since the,they were considered new drugs because no currently marketed orally administered levothyroxine sodium product ha d been shown to demonstrate consistent potency and stability.accordingly,fda required ls manufacturers to submit ndas for fda approval by august,and allowed the continued marketing of unapproved ls tablets until that date.see id.fda stated that after the nda deadline,any unapproved orally administered ls drug would be subject to regulatory action.id.
on october,jsp filed an nda for unithroid.pursuant to fda requirements,the nda contained jsp trade secrets and confidential information for the manufacture of safe,stable,and effective ls,compl,including t he order in which unithroid ingredients are added together the steps that the additions go through in the formation of unithroid tablets and the processing of the active ingredient,levothyroxine sodium,id.on april,fda extended the august,approval deadline by one year to allow manufacturers additional time to conduct studies and to prepare applications.
on august,fda approved unithroid,making it the first orally administered ls drug to be approved under the new requirements.the next day,without jsp knowledge or consent,fda posted on its website jsp trade secrets and confidential information for manufacturing unithroid.on december,upon discovering fda disclosure of its trade secrets,jsp demanded that the information be removed immediately from fda website.after repeated requests,fda removed some of the information on january,and the remaining information on january.consequently,jsp trade secrets were available to the public on fda website for five months.
meanwhile,following fda approval and anticipating increased demand for unithroid,jsp doubled its staff and invested million in expanding its facilities.on november,jsp filed a petition asking fda not to extend the nda deadline a second time,asserting that it was prepared to supply the entire market for ls drugs.nonetheless,on july,fda announced that because it will take time for the millions of patients taking unapproved ls products to switch to approved products,and for manufacturers of approved products to scale up their production and to introduce this increased production into the distribution chain,manufacturers with ndas pending by august,could continue marketing their unapproved ls tablets for an additional two years,july.following this announcement,abbott laboratories flooded the retail market with synthroid,its unapproved ls tablet.compl.having lost de facto market exclusivity due to fda publication of its secrets and fda extensions of compliance deadlines,jsp was forced to lay off half its workforce and to destroy excess unithroid worth up to million.id.
on october,jsp filed a complaint against fda in the district court.counts i and ii alleged that,by disclosing jsp trade secrets and confidential information,fda misappropriated jsp trade secrets and breached its confidential relationship with jsp.counts iii and iv alleged that fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets violated procedural and substantive due process.counts v and vi alleged that fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets and its extensions of the nda deadlines were arbitrary and capricious under the apa.the complaint sought more than billion in compensatory damages for jsp injuries resulting from fda misappropriation of jsp trade secrets and breach of fda confidential relationship with jsp,compl,and declaratory relief for the remaining claims.
fda filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b,which the district court granted.see jerome stevens,fda,d,jsp.the district court construed counts i and ii as alleging injuries caused solely by fda extensions of the nda deadlines,and ruled that the tort claims in those counts were barred by federal sovereign immunity because the deadline extensions fell within both the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions to the ftca.id.at.the district court ruled that counts iii,iv,and v failed to present a live case or controversy because fda had already removed jsp trade secrets from its website.id.at.finally,the district court ruled that count vi was barred by the apa presumption that agency enforcement actions are not subject to judicial review.id.at.jsp appeals the dismissal of counts i,ii,and vi.
the ftca grants federal district courts jurisdiction over claims arising from certain torts committed by federal employees in the scope of their employment,and waives the government sovereign immunity from such claims.sloan,at see b.the grant of jurisdiction and waiver of sovereign immunity are subject to several exceptions,including the discretionary function exception and the intentional tort exception.see.the discretionary function exception bars claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.id.a.the intentional tort exception bars a ny claim arising out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights.id.h.
to determine whether the discretionary function exception applies,the court must engage in a inquiry.gaubert,at.macharia united states.first,the court must determine whether the challenged action involves an element of judgment or choice,or whether federal law specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,leaving the employee no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.gaubert,at.quoting berkovitz united states,d internal quotation marks omitted macharia,at.second,the court must determine whether the challenged action is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield that is,actions based on considerations of public policy.gaubert,at.quoting berkovitz,at.internal quotation marks omitted macharia,at.
jsp complaint challenges both fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets and fda extensions of the nda deadlines in favor of jsp competitors.the parties appear to agree that the disclosure of trade secrets is not a discretionary function because federal laws prohibit it.see br.of appellant at citing j b br.of appellee at.the parties also appear to agree that the extension of the nda deadline is a discretionary function because it involves an element of choice and is based on considerations of public health.see br.of appellant at br.of appellee at reply br.of appellant at.thus,the only issue in dispute is whether jsp tort claims are based upon the disclosure of trade secrets or the extensions of the nda deadlines.
in dismissing counts i and ii for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court interpreted those counts as alleging injuries arising from fda extensions of the nda deadlines rather than from fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets.see jsp,d at.based on this interpretation,the district court ruled that jsp tort claims were barred by the discretionary function exception because extending the deadlines clearly involves an element of judgment or choice and is based on considerations regarding the health needs of the millions of thyroid patients.id.at quoting macharia,at.the district court also stated in a footnote that t he exception also appears to bar the tort claims,as the claims arguably arise out of fda alleged interference with the contract rights and prospective economic advantage of jsp and its partner,watson laboratories.id.at see also id.at citing h art,united states.
the district court based its interpretation of counts i and ii on the economic loss report that jsp submitted as part of its administrative claim for damages.see jsp,d at.the report explains the basis for jsp claim for billion in compensatory damages,relying on the assumption that jsp and jones only other ls manufacturer to meet the august,deadline would have split of the market between them.id.at quoting mem.in support of the united states mot.to dismiss,attach.at.this outcome was possible,the district court noted,only if fda had not extended the august deadline to allow other ls manufacturers to remain in the market.id.at.the district court thus concluded that the action causing jsp injury was not the disclosure,but rather the deadline extensions and more specifically,the july extension.id.jsp points out,however,that the report was not submitted as part of the complaint but was instead attached to fda motion to dismiss.although the complaint sought the same amount of damages as the amount analyzed in the economic loss report,jsp maintains that it is not barred from relying on other expert reports or damages evidence at trial to prove the claims in counts i and ii.br.of appellant at.for the following reasons,we hold that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the complaint failed to allege an independent injury caused by fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets.
at the pleading stage,the issue before the district court was not whether jsp had established sufficient proof of damages caused by fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets,but whether jsp had sufficiently pled claims for such damages.scheuer rhodes,d.while the district court may consider materials outside the pleadings in deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,see herbert acad.of sciences,the court must still accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true,gaubert,at.quoting berkovitz,at.internal quotation marks omitted.count i of the complaint alleged that jsp nda for unithroid contained trade secrets and confidential information that fda disclosed such information on its website and that fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets and confidences has caused jsp substantial and irreparable injury.compl.count ii alleged that fda had a legal duty to maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information contained in jsp nda that fda breached that duty by posting jsp information on its website and that fda disclosure of jsp confidential information for unithroid has caused jsp to lose protection for its property interest in the confidences unlawfully disclosed and has thus caused jsp to suffer substantial and irreparable injury.compl.these allegations sufficiently pled claims for damages caused by fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets and confidential information.
in treating counts i and ii as claims arising from fda extensions of the nda deadlines,the district court relied on jsp statement that it lost de facto market exclusivity due to fda publication of its secrets and fda extension of compliance deadlines.jsp,d at quoting compl.emphasis added by the district court.from this statement the district court concluded that jsp does not allege some harm arising from the disclosure that was separate from the deadline extensions,and thus any harm from the disclosure is not sufficiently separable from the deadline extensions to support suit under ftca.id.at alterations in original quoting sloan,at.similarly,fda contends that jsp challenges to the disclosure of its trade secrets are intertwined with its broader challenge to the extension of the agency deadlines.br.of appellee at.fda observes that it examined the ndas filed by jsp competitors and found that none of them used or relied upon jsp information in any way.id.however,this observation is irrelevant,for the only question at the pleading stage is whether jsp sufficiently alleged an injury caused by fda disclosure of its trade secrets.jsp complaint specifically alleged that jsp suffered substantial and irreparable injury arising from fda disclosure of its trade secrets and confidential information,compl,and sought more than billion for jsp injuries resulting from fda misappropriation of jsp trade secrets and breach of fda confidential relationship with jsp,id.indeed,the complaint sought only declaratory relief,not damages,for jsp injuries resulting from fda extensions of the nda deadlines.
in construing jsp tort claims as arising from fda s deadline extensions,the district court cited two department of housing urban development,and fisher.sales,united states,cir en banc.see jsp,d at.in sloan,a contractor sued the department of housing and urban development under the ftca for negligently conducting an audit of his construction site and for suspending him from government contract work based on the erroneous audit.at.on appeal from the district court dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the contractor contended that while the suspension of his government contract work was a discretionary function,the audit was not a discretionary function because it was governed by standards of professional practice.id.at.the court rejected that contention,holding that there was no meaningful way in which the allegedly negligent investigatory acts could be considered apart from the totality of the prosecution.id.quoting gray bell,internal quotation marks omitted.the court noted that t he complaint does not allege any damages arising from the investigation itself,but only harm caused by the suspension to which it assertedly led.id.at.
similarly,in fisher,chilean fruit growers sued fda under the ftca for banning the importation of chilean fruit based on a negligently conducted laboratory test concluding that the fruit contained cyanide.at.recognizing that the commissioner decision to ban the fruit was a discretionary function,the fruit growers alleged injury based upon the negligence of the laboratory technicians,who were bound by fda regulatory procedures manual.id.at.the third circuit rejected this characterization of the claim,reasoning that t he reality here is that the injuries of which the plaintiffs complain were caused by the commissioner decisions and,as a matter of law,their claims are therefore based upon those decisions.id.the court concluded that a claim must be based upon the exercise of a discretionary function whenever the immediate cause of the plaintiff injury is a decision which is susceptible of policy analysis and which is made by an official legally authorized to make it.id.at emphasis added.
here,unlike in sloan and fisher,the district court could not conclude properly as a matter of law that none of jsp alleged injuries were caused independently and immediately by fda disclosure of jsp trade secrets.whereas the contractor in sloan did not allege injuries caused by the negligent audit,and the negligent laboratory test in fis
