opinion of the court 
in,congress passed the dietary supplement health and education act dshea,declaring dietary supplements that present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury to be adulterated food under the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca.dshea,f.in,the food and drug administration fda promulgated a final regulation stating that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids eds were adulterated under the unreasonable risk standard of dshea.the effect of the regulation was to prohibit the distribution of these supplements.nve,a former manufacturer and distributor of eds,brought this suit seeking to set aside the regulation.
relying on a provision of dshea that states a court shall decide any issue under f on a de novo basis,nve sought to supplement the administrative record by offering affidavits,expert testimony,and other evidence.in orders dated august,and august,the district court declined nve request,limiting its review to the administrative record for the challenged rule.however,pursuant to b,the district court certified these orders for interlocutory appeal and identified four questions of law for our review 
may the party challenging the rule supplement the administrative record 
may the party challenging the rule present expert affidavits testimony 
may the reviewing court conduct a trial or is its review limited to a review of the administrative record 
may the party challenging the rule conduct discovery 
because we conclude that the de novo standard of f does not apply to a private action brought under the apa to challenge administrative rulemaking,we will answer the first,second,and fourth questions posed by the district court in the negative and conclude with respect to the third question the district court review is limited to the administrative record.
we also address the district court ruling that it owed no deference in this case to the fda legal or factual conclusions.though this issue was not one of the questions of law certified to us by the district court,it was a part of the orders from which nve appeals and is closely related to the question of whether nve may supplement the record.under b,we are not limited to the specific questions of law identified by the district court when reviewing the orders certified for appeal.howard hess dental labs.dentsply int l,cir.we therefore take up the question of deference here as part of our review of the district court orders of august,and august,and conclude that the normal rules for judicial deference regarding agency action apply in the instant suit.
we begin with a discussion of the regulatory scheme at issue.the fdca prohibits t he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated.a.the united states enforces this provision through suits for injunctive relief,id,fines or imprisonment,id,or seizure of the adulterated food,id.it is that the government bears the burden of proving that a food is adulterated in enforcement actions brought directly under the fdca.see united states two plastic drums,more or less of an article of food,cir noting that the fda has the burden of showing that food is injurious to health.
the fdca also grants to the secretary of health and human services broad power to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of th e act.a.this provision authorizes the secretary to issue substantive regulations,interpretive regulations,and statements of policy.pharmaceutical mfrs.ass fda.because courts owe deference to an agency interpretation of the statute and regulations it administers,chevron,natural res.def.council,d,regulations validly promulgated under the fdca normally have the force of law in enforcement proceedings,united states mead,d.see also united states algon chem,cir deferring to fda regulations in enforcement proceedings under the fdca.thus,where the fda determines through rulemaking that a food is adulterated,the introduction of that food into interstate commerce violates the fdca unless the rule is procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.mead,at.see also united states undetermined quantities of various articles of device,determining,based on fda regulations,that medical device was adulterated and misbranded under fdca.
congress passed dshea after a dispute with the fda about how strictly dietary supplements should be regulated.members of congress believed the fda had pursued a enforcement agenda against dietary supplements for over years prior to dshea enactment,at.both congress and the courts consistently resisted the fda regulation of dietary supplements,yet the fda continued its course.id.at.senator orrin hatch summarized the attitudes of many in congress in when he stated that,with respect to dietary supplements,i t is the congress versus the food and drug administration.cong.rec,see also cong.rec.statement of harkin criticizing the fda for restricting access to information about dietary supplements.in response to what it perceived as an inappropriate regulatory strategy,at,congress passed dshea in october with strong bipartisan support.
dshea changed very little about the basic administrative tools available to the fda for the regulation of dietary supplements.the agency could still regulate dietary supplements through enforcement actions or rulemaking.however,dshea provided substantive and procedural limits on the fda ability to restrict the use of dietary supplements.dshea identified the limited alternative conditions under which a dietary supplement or food containing a dietary supplement could be deemed adulterated.first,a dietary supplement is adulterated if it poses a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.f a.second,a dietary supplement is deemed adulterated if it is a new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate information to establish that it does not pose a significant or unreasonable risk.id.f b.third,the secretary may declare that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it poses an imminent hazard to public health or safety,provided that the secretary promptly initiates formal adjudication to affirm or withdraw the declaration.id.f c.finally,a dietary supplement is deemed adulterated if it is poisonous or unsanitary.id.f d 
in addition to providing substantive limits on the circumstances under which dietary supplements may be considered adulterated,congress imposed new procedural checks on the fda ability to regulate dietary supplements through the courts.after listing the ways in which a dietary supplement can be deemed adulterated,the provision states 
in any proceeding under this subparagraph,the united states shall bear the burden of proof on each element to show that a dietary supplement is adulterated.the court shall decide any issue under this paragraph on a de novo basis.
id.f emphasis added.congress intended that these provisions would protect against unreasonable regulatory barriers limiting the flow of safe dietary supplements to consumers.dshea codified in note to ff.
beginning in,the fda began to consider regulatory action with respect to certain products containing eds.the fda chose to regulate eds through administrative rulemaking rather than through enforcement actions brought directly under the fdca.the fda proposed several alternatives,including regulation of items containing certain threshold amounts of eds,limitations on the duration of use and daily uses of eds,labeling requirements on products containing eds,and prohibition of mixing certain ingredients with eds.see dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids,proposed june,to be codified at pt.in,the fda withdrew most of these proposals and ceased activity aimed at regulatory action in the face of a negative public response and questions about the sufficiency of evidence that eds was unsafe.april.
in,the fda received a report from the rand corporation calling for more study of the safety of eds.the next year,the fda reopened the comment period on the proposed rule in light of new scientific evidence about the effects of eds on health.march.the fda compiled an administrative record consisting of more than comments and pages.see final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk,to be codified at pt.based on the pharmacology of ephedrine alkaloids,the scientific literature on the effects of ephedrine alkaloids,and the adverse events reported to have occurred in individuals following consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids,id.at,the fda issued a final rule the eds rule declaring that all dietary supplements containing eds present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury and were therefore adulterated under the fdca.
nve brought suit in march to enjoin the enforcement of the rule.it claimed that the fda violated the administrative procedure act apa by acting arbitrarily,capriciously,and contrary to law,in violation of a exceeding its statutory authority,in violation of c acting in a manner that is unwarranted by the facts,in violation of f and failing to give proper notice of the fda intended actions,in violation of and d.nve also claimed that the fda violated its right to due process under the fifth amendment by failing to give nve a reasonable opportunity to comment on the substance of the rule.
nve contended that the de novo provision of f should apply to its suit such that the district court must decide the issues nve raised on a de novo basis.f.nve argued that under this standard the district court should resolve all legal and factual issues anew,independent of any findings that the fda made during its rulemaking.nve claimed that a true de novo review gives the district court the power to consider evidence outside of the administrative record.consequently,nve sought to submit evidence,such as expert testimony and affidavits,to aid the district court in determining whether all dietary supplements containing eds are adulterated,as the eds rule declared.nve also sought to conduct discovery to the same extent as in any other civil case proceeding under the federal rules of civil procedure.
the district court requested that the parties submit briefs and present oral argument as to the proper standard of review and whether the parties were entitled to discovery.in an opinion and order dated august,subsequently clarified by an august,order,the district court held that the case was brought under the apa and the apa therefore governed the scope of review.because parties are typically not permitted to supplement the administrative record or engage in discovery in apa cases challenging rulemaking,the district court ruled that the parties could neither supplement the record nor conduct discovery.however,the district court also held that the de novo provision of dshea required that it give no deference to the fda factual and legal conclusions rather,it could decide the issues anew.at nve request,the district court certified its august,and august,orders for immediate appeal under b and identified four controlling questions of law for our review.we granted nve petition for permission to appeal on november.
before we conduct our analysis of the questions the district court certified for review we must examine the nature of the suit brought by nve in the district court.nve claims are brought under the apa.dshea does not provide a private cause of action,nor does it contain a waiver of sovereign immunity that would permit nve to sue a federal agency.the only cause of action that nve can maintain in order to challenge the eds rule arises under the apa,which provides both a waiver of sovereign immunity and a right of judicial review for any person suffering legal wrong because of agency action.nve complaint identifies the apa as the source of its claims,and nve has not contended before this court that it has a cause of action directly under dshea.consequently,we agree with the district court that the apa,not dshea,provides the mechanism for nve challenge of the eds rule.because nve suit arises under the apa,the district court must apply the apa standards for scope of review and discovery,unless we conclude that congress intended somehow to override the apa standards when it enacted dshea and provided for de novo judicial review as to issues thereunder.we believe that the determination of the appropriate under the apa or dictate the answers to the questions posed to us.
of the four questions certified to us for review,the first three comprise a single inquiry into whether nve may supplement the administrative record.in a challenge to administrative action under the apa,the administrative record can not normally be supplemented.see camp pitts,d in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard,the focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.horizons int l,baldrige,cir describing review of the existing administrative record as one of the traditional limits of judicial review applied under section of the apa.the apa explicitly directs a reviewing court to review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party.
only one provision of the apa permits a reviewing court to look beyond the administrative record.under f,a court may conduct a trial de novo to determine if administrative action is unwarranted by the facts.nve alleged in its complaint that this provision applies here.the supreme court,however,has limited trial de novo review under the apa to two situations when the action is adjudicatory in nature and the agency factfinding procedures are inadequate,and when issues that were not before the agency are raised in a proceeding to enforce nonadjudicatory agency action.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.neither of these situations exists in the instant case.nve is challenging rulemaking,not adjudicative actions,and the fda considered the issues raised in this suit during the administrative proceedings.therefore,the scope of review standards contained in the apa would limit the district court review to the administrative record.
congress may override the apa rule that judicial review of administrative action is limited to the administrative record.see united states carlo bianchi,d noting that congress can set forth the standards to be used or the procedures to be followed during a court review of the record upjohn schweiker,cir when de novo review of agency action is not expressly required by statute,it is the exception rather than the rule.emphasis added.nve argues that this is precisely what congress did by including in dshea a provision requiring courts to decide any issue under this paragraph on a de novo basis.f.we disagree and conclude that congress did not intend reviewing courts to conduct de novo review in challenges to fda rulemaking under dshea.
a challenge to administrative action under the apa raises a unique set of issues.judicial review in such suits focuses on the agency decision making process,not on the decision itself.a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency in an apa challenge.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.rather,it must ensure only that the agency has applied the procedures for rulemaking required by law and reached a rational conclusion.
in the instant case,nve claimed that the defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously,contrary to law,in excess of their statutory jurisdiction,and without adequate notice of,or opportunity to comment on,the proposed rule.each of these claims under the apa is distinct from any substantive inquiry into whether dietary supplements containing eds are actually adulterated under the fdca.
the arbitrary and capricious standard focuses a court on the agency process of reasoning.to determine whether an agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously,a court looks to whether the agency relied on factors outside those congress intended for consideration,completely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or provided an explanation that is contrary to,or implausible in light of,the evidence.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.reversal is appropriate only where the administrative action is irrational or not based on relevant factors.pennsylvania dep t of pub.welfare united states dep t of health and human,cir.
likewise,in evaluating whether the fda exceeded its statutory jurisdiction by promulgating the eds rule,a court must consider the scope of authority congress granted to the agency,in this case under a,and compare it with the claimed excessive action.wilkinson abrams,cir western union.fcc,cir.what is important is that the reviewing court reasonably be able to conclude that the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.chrysler brown,d.this review is so basic that it rarely arises as a meaningful challenge to agency action.charles alan wright charles koch,federal practice and procedure.
with respect to nve claim that the fda failed to provide adequate public notice of its contemplated action,the district court must determine whether the notice given was sufficient to fairly apprise interested parties of all significant subjects and issues involved.am.iron steel inst.epa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it will concentrate on whether that notice provided either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved,b,and whether interested parties had the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process,fertilizer inst.browner,cir.in considering whether the notice was deficient because the final rule differed from the proposed rule,a reviewing court asks whether the final rule was a logical outgrowth of the rulemaking proposal and record.aeronautical radio,fcc,united steelworkers of am.pendergrass,cir.the district court will follow this same analysis in determining whether the fda violated nve due process right to comment on the rule.see vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d holding that where rulemaking fulfills basic apa standards for notice and procedure,a court will not impose additional process.
thus,in this case the district court should concern itself solely with whether the challenged administrative action followed the procedures for legitimate rulemaking.nothing about dshea indicates that congress intended the courts to consider on a de novo basis issues concerning the process of the agency reasoning or the notice it provided to the public.to the contrary,congress was clear that dshea de novo standard applies only when a court is deciding an issue under this paragraph.used in this context,this paragraph refers to f.see koons buick pontiac gmc,nigh,d describing the hierarchical scheme for subdividing statutory sections.paragraph f defines the conditions under which a dietary supplement may be deemed adulterated.an issue therefore arises under that paragraph only if it is probative of the question of whether a dietary supplement qualifies as an adulterated food.as discussed above,a dietary supplement may be deemed adulterated under dshea when one of four conditions is satisfied.see f a d.consequently,by its own terms,application of the de novo provision is limited to judicial inquiries aimed at establishing the presence or absence of one of these conditions of adulteration.in the instant case,the district court must not consider whether the fda determination that eds is adulterated was correct,but rather if its action in rulemaking was arbitrary,capricious,contrary to law,in excess of the fda statutory jurisdiction,or preceded by inadequate notice.congress did not state any intention that rulemaking was to be reviewed on a de novo basis.indeed,as noted below,there is no mention in dshea of review of agency action.
there are other clues in the text of dshea that reinforce this conclusion.the de novo provision immediately follows the sentence stating that the united states shall bear the burden of proof on each element to show that a dietary supplement is adulterated.f.the fact that the united states bears the burden of proof is significant for determining the type of proceedings to which congress was referring in this context.it is the united the fda,its commissioner,the department of health and human services,or its is the named party in enforcement actions.see a a ll such proceedings for the enforcement,or to restrain violations,of this chapter shall be by and in the name of the united states.by contrast,private parties challenging agency rulemaking generally name as a defendant the agency or administrative officials responsible for the regulation,not the united states.see requiring any mandatory or injunctive decree under the apa to specify the federal officers or officers by name or by title,and their successors in office,personally responsible for compliance.pl.pr.forms fed.pract.proc.providing form of complaint under apa in which agency and agency officers,but not united states,are named defendants fed.proc.forms same fed.proc.forms same this strongly suggests that the proceedings in which the united states has the burden of proof under f,and as to which the de novo standard is to apply,are enforcement proceedings brought by the united states to enforce dshea.
this view is bolstered by the fact that congress made another provision of subsection f specifically apply to the secretary of health and human services.in f,congress distinguished between the secretary and the united states attorneys,to whom the secretary reports violations of a,indicating that congress did not use the terms the secretary and the united states interchangeably in dshea.had congress intended the burden of proof provision to apply to apa actions as well as enforcement actions,it would have indicated that the provision applied to proceedings to which the secretary was a party as well.
in light of our view that the united states bears the burden of proof only in enforcement actions,the most natural reading of the de novo immediately follows the burden of proof that it applies to the same proceedings in which the united states bears the burden of proof.see koons buick pontiac gmc.at noting that ambiguity can often be resolved by reference to the remainder of the statutory scheme quoting united sav.of timbers of inwood forest,d deal united states,d t he meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.thus,application of the de novo standard,like the burden of proof provision,is limited to enforcement actions brought by the united states.
we also note that dshea de novo provision instructs courts to decide issues under f on a de novo basis,rather than to conduct de novo review.this distinction is highly significant given that a court function in an apa suit is always to review administrative action.see a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action is entitled to judicial review thereof.id.defining standards under which a reviewing court may set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions.by contrast,in an enforcement action under f,a court role is not to review an underlying administrative action,but rather to decide in the first instance whether a dietary supplement is adulterated.this choice of language in the de novo provision further suggests that the de novo standard does not apply in apa suits for judicial review of agency action.
nve contends that differences between a draft of dshea passed by the senate and the final bill suggest that congress intended the de novo provision to apply to private challenges to rulemaking the version of dshea first passed by the senate would have required the secretary to promulgate regulations in order to declare that a dietary supplement posed an unreasonable risk of illness or injury.the senate draft did not include a provision that required courts to decide issues on a de novo basis in the final version of the bill,the fda could employ the unreasonable risk standard in both rulemaking and enforcement actions.see f a id.f.along with this change,congress added the de novo standard for judicial decision of any issue under this paragraph.
nve argues that the changes from one legislative draft to the next demonstrate that the concept of rulemaking was clearly in the forefront of congress mind,and if it had wanted to exempt rulemaking from the de novo standard,it would have done so explicitly.
