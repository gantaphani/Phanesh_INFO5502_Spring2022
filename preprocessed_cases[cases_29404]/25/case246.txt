global distributors,global made eight large sales of release,a cold medicine containing pseudoephedrine,to four businesses in florida in the summer of.the pseudoephedrine was converted into almost a half million dollars worth of methamphetamine.the government brought a civil action against global and john asoofi,the owner and sole shareholder of global,for failing to demand proof of identity from these four customers as required by the comprehensive drug abuse prevention control act of.the district court ordered summary judgment in favor of the government and assessed the maximum fine per violation jointly against global and asoofi for each of the eight violations.
global and asoofi challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to the government,claiming that the evidence did not show unequivocally that they had failed to comply with the statute and its underlying regulations.they also challenge the court imposition of the maximum civil penalty against them.we agree with the district court that summary judgment for the government was required,but we remand for reconsideration of the amount of fines to which the defendants should be subjected.
john asoofi owns and operates global distributors,which sells household products to local retail stores for consumer sale.one of these products is the cold medicine release.the active ingredient in release is pseudoephedrine,which is a chemical regulated by the drug enforcement administration the dea because it can be used to produce methamphetamine.global was registered and licensed with the dea to distribute products containing pseudoephedrine asoofi obtained that license on global behalf.
the comprehensive drug abuse prevention control act the drug abuse act requires distributors of pseudoephedrine to obtain and record the identity of each party to whom they sell the chemical.these records must be available for inspection by dea officials.id.in,the dea began investigating global sales of release.the records that global produced for the dea showed eight sales in june and july of of release to four customers in fort myers,florida last call,last call liquor,texaco mart,and back bay market.each sale involved more than release tablets,which is above the sales amount that triggers compliance with the drug abuse act.
global records did not meet the dea requirements,as they did not show that global had obtained proof of identity of these four customers before making the sales.asoofi tried to explain the problem in several ways.he claimed that he did not know proof of identity was required.he also claimed that a former global sales representative,naser ali,had been responsible for the sales at issue.regardless of where the truth lay,the dea investigation showed that much of the release that global sold to these four customers in made its way into the illegal drug market through an individual named khaled fatayer,a clerk at last call liquor.fatayer was making purchases under the name of last call liquor,unbeknownst to the business owner he also arranged to receive the release for which he paid cash at back bay market.
in,the government brought this action against global later,it added asoofi as a defendant.it claimed that both had violated title ii of the drug abuse act,the controlled substances act,et,which sets out a regulated person obligations in ensuring and recording purchasers identities before a sale of a controlled chemical is completed.in august,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment.
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.alexander.dep t of health and family,cir.at the outset,it is important to define exactly what requirements the controlled substances act the act and its underlying regulations impose on global and asoofi.the act makes it illegal for a regulated person to engage in a regulated transaction without obtaining the identification required.a.global is a regulated person under the act because it distributes a listed chemical pseudoephedrine in quantities above the threshold established by the statute.asoofi,as global owner and agent,is also a regulated person and subject to the act.id.at.
the identification required is further defined by the controlled substances act as requiring a r ecord of regulated transactions,which includes specific obligations for the regulated person.a.specifically,
i t is the duty of each regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction to identify each other party to the transaction.it is the duty of such other party to present proof of identity to the regulated person.the attorney general shall specify by regulation the types of documents and other evidence that constitute proof of identity for purposes of this paragraph.

b the regulated person must verify the existence and apparent validity of a business entity ordering a listed chemical,tableting machine or encapsulating machine.for domestic transactions,this may be accomplished by such methods as checking the telephone directory,the local credit bureau,the local chamber of commerce or the local better business bureau,or,if the business entity is a registrant,by verification of the registration.for export transactions,a good faith inquiry to verify the existence and apparent validity of a foreign business entity may be accomplished by such methods as verifying the business telephone listing through international telephone information,the firm listing in international or foreign national chemical directories or other commerce directories or trade publications,confirmation through foreign subsidiaries of the regulated person,verification through the country of destination embassy commercial attache,or official documents provided by the purchaser which confirm the existence and apparent validity of the business entity.
