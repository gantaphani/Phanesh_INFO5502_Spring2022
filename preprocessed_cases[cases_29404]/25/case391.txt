since december,the district court has issued three decisions in connection with disputes between apotex,apotex and purepac pharmaceutical purepac over the marketing of a generic version of the drug gabapentin.the food and drug administration fda or agency has approved gabapentin,sold by pfizer,pfizer under the brand name neurontin,for the treatment of epilepsy.the first two decisions,purepac pharmaceutical thompson,d purepac i,and torpharm,thompson,d torpharm,were affirmed by this court in a consolidated appeal.see purepac pharm.thompson,purepac ii.
at issue in this case is a dispute over the proper interpretation and application of the version of the generic marketing exclusivity provision of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,j b iv amended.the parties disagree over whether the version of this statutory provision adopts a approach or approach in establishing the period for generic marketing exclusivity.applying a interpretation of j b iv,fda awarded purepac two separate periods of exclusivity for the same generic gabapentin drug.purepac first exclusivity period has expired.but the second exclusivity period,which fda awarded on the basis of a patent,is now running and will not expire until april.meanwhile,fda has delayed final approval of apotex application to market its generic version of gabapentin pending the expiration of purepac period of marketing exclusivity.apotex claims that fda erred in awarding multiple periods of marketing exclusivity for the same drug when,in its view,the statute allows only awards for a single period of exclusivity to the first applicant.
apotex filed the present suit in district court against fda and federal officials collectively federal appellees,advancing apotex interpretation of j b iv and seeking an injunction directing fda to issue final approval for apotex gabapentin application.purepac intervened as a defendant.after consolidating apotex motion for a preliminary injunction and defendants motions to dismiss or for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.the district court judgment rested on two grounds.first,the district court ruled that res judicata barred apotex action,because the parties in this case are the same parties who appeared in torpharm a final judgment was rendered against apotex in torpharm the causes of action in this case and torpharm share a common nucleus of facts there has been no intervening change in the law and there have been no material changes in the facts since the judgment in torpharm.in the alternative,the district court held that,even if res judicata did not apply,the defendants would be entitled to summary judgment,because fda interpretation of j b iv was reasonable and thus entitled to deference.
we agree that res judicata bars apotex from bringing this suit.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court on this ground alone.we vacate the district court alternative holding reaching the merits of whether fda interpretation of j b iv is reasonable.
background 
statutory and regulatory framework 
the fdca requires that companies seeking to market a drug that has not previously been approved by fda submit a new drug application nda to fda.see b,amended by pediatric research equity act of,b,stat.ndas are usually lengthy,and they must include,among other things,evidence surrounding the drug safety and information about any patents that cover or might cover the drug.purepac pharm.thompson,purepac ii citing b.
in,congress passed the amendments to the fdca.see drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat.eased the process of generic drug approval by allowing companies seeking to market generic versions of approved drugs to submit abbreviated new drug applications andas.andas must contain,among other things,information demonstrating that the generic version is the bioequivalent of the approved version of the drug.see j a iv.
andas must also address patents that apply or might apply to the drug for which the anda is submitted.anda applicants can satisfy this requirement by making one of four certifications with regard to the patent claim on the drug.id.j a vii.the relevant certification for the purposes of this case,known as a paragraph iv certification,requires an anda applicant to certify that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.id.j a vii iv.when an anda includes a paragraph iv certification,the anda applicant must notify the owner of the patent and the holder of the nda for the approved drug.see id.j b i.if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought against the anda applicant within days from the date notice is received,fda approval of the anda is automatically stayed for months.see id.j b iii.
an anda applicant who submits a paragraph iv certification is entitled under certain circumstances to a period of generic marketing exclusivity during which no other company can market a generic version of the drug.see id.j b iv.this exclusivity provision was amended in,but this case arose under j b iv as it existed prior to the amendments.see medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modemization act of,stat,amendments.all references to j b iv are to the statute as it existed prior to the amendments.
because we conclude that apotex is barred by res judicata from bringing this case,we need not provide an elaborate discussion of this generic marketing exclusivity provision.rather,what is important here is that the parties have advanced competing interpretations of j b iv.these competing interpretations emanate from the fact that nda holders may receive additional patents that claim an approved drug,or that claim a method of use for the drug,after the approval of their ndas.thus,an anda applicant who filed the first anda with a paragraph iv certification for a particular drug may not be the first anda applicant to file paragraph iv certifications for all patents that claim the drug.
consistent with fda determination in this case,the federal appellees and purepac understand j b iv to allow a company to be eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity if it was the first anda applicant to file a paragraph iv certification for a particular patent,once the other statutory triggers are satisfied,even if another company had previously filed a paragraph iv certification for another patent claiming the same drug.under this interpretation,multiple companies could be eligible for generic marketing exclusivity,and multiple periods of exclusivity are possible.this is the approach.by contrast,apotex argues that j b iv should be interpreted to grant generic marketing exclusivity only,only to the generic manufacturer who filed the first anda with a paragraph iv certification for any patent involving a particular drug product,and only based on that first paragraph iv certification.this is the approach.
although no court had addressed these competing interpretations before january,the possible tension between them has been apparent since at least.in august of that year,fda issued a proposed rule that would have adopted the approach.see generic drug exclusivity for abbreviated new drug applications,august proposed rule.the agency never implemented the august proposed rule,however,and instead continued to apply the approach in disputes surrounding generic marketing exclusivity.see,letter from fda office of generic drugs ogd to genpharm,of,joint appendix,letter from ogd to american pharmaceutical partners,of.the august proposed rule was formally withdrawn in.see generic drug exclusivity for abbreviated new drug applications.
before turning to the factual background of the present dispute,we note that the four types of certifications enumerated in j a vii are not the only mechanisms by which an anda applicant can address a potentially relevant patent.a generic company can instead submit a statement pursuant to j a viii section viii statement.a section viii statement asserts that a patent does not prevent fda from approving the company anda because the anda applicant seeks to market the drug for a use other than that covered by the patent.see j a viii.as we have previously explained,applicants use paragraph iv certifications to challenge the validity of applicable patents,whereas they submit section viii statements to assert that patents do not apply.purepac ii,at.anda applicants who submit section viii statements are not eligible for generic marketing exclusivity pursuant to j b iv.
as noted above,this case involves gabapentin,a drug sold by pfizer under the name neurontin,which fda has approved for the treatment of epilepsy.in,fda approved neurontin capsules based on a nda submitted by,which later assigned pfizer the rights to neurontin.in,submitted information to fda on two patents that were not part of its original nda filing patent patent,claiming a crystal form of gabapentin,and patent,claiming a method for using gabapentin to treat neurodegenerative diseases.see letter from to fda of.in,submitted information on an additional patent,patent patent,claiming a pharmaceutical composition of gabapentin.see submission from to fda of.
in,purepac submitted andas for a generic version of gabapentin.purepac andas contained a paragraph iv certification for the patent and a section viii statement for the patent.in may,purepac submitted a paragraph iv certification to fda with respect to the patent.purepac was the first anda applicant to file paragraph iv certifications for the and patents.see purepac pharm.thompson,d,purepac i.
apotex also submitted an anda for gabapentin in,and apotex ultimately submitted paragraph iv certifications for all three patents,as well as a section viii statement for the patent.id.at.apotex was at that time an affiliate of torpharm the distinction between apotex and torpharm is of no relevance for this appeal,and we refer to the companies both individually and collectively as apotex.
in two separate proceedings filed in,sued purepac and apotex for infringement of the and patents.although ultimately lost both suits,the andas filed by purepac and apotex were stayed for months pursuant to j b iii.see purepac i,d at.in,initiated lawsuits against both purepac and apotex for infringement of the patent.under fda interpretation of the statute,these lawsuits triggered additional stays before fda could approve the companies andas.see id.at.purepac exclusivity period based on the paragraph iv certification for the patent began in,when all statutory conditions were satisfied.however,infringement suit precluded fda from granting final approval of purepac anda,so purepac exclusivity period passed without purepac having the opportunity to market the drug.
in april,fda notified purepac that,because,in the agency view,a section viii statement was not appropriate for the patent,purepac could not receive final approval of its anda before it filed a certification for the patent.see id.at.purepac filed suit in district court challenging fda decision.purepac also sought to enjoin fda from approving apotex anda for gabapentin,because of the adverse consequences of such approval for any exclusivity purepac would have pursuant to its paragraph iv certification for the patent.see id.at.apotex intervened as a defendant,arguing among other things that purepac claims were barred by the doctrine of laches.see id.at.apotex did not present the interpretation of j b iv.because purepac paragraph iv certification for the patent was the first paragraph iv certification submitted for any patent claiming gabapentin,the approach would not have promoted generic marketing exclusivity for the andas relating to the an patents.rather,an argument founded on the approach would have rested on the premise that no anda,save for the one related to the patent,could serve as the basis for generic marketing exclusivity to the disadvantage of competing claims.apotex did not raise this argument in the purepac i litigation.
the district court ruled in purepac favor on the section viii issue,ordering fda to accept purepac section viii statement.see purepac i,d at.however,the court declined to enjoin fda from approving apotex anda,stating that it was up to fda to determine,in the first instance,the effect of the court decision.see id.at.
in response to purepac i,fda sought comments from generic gabapentin applicants,including apotex and purepac.see letter from ogd to apotex of,letter from ogd to purepac of.apotex submitted several letters,which argued that,notwithstanding purepac i,apotex was entitled to at least share in any exclusivity period with purepac,because apotex was the first to file a paragraph iv certification for the patent.in addition,the letters asserted that apotex was the first company to submit a valid paragraph iv certification for the patent.once again,apotex did not raise the approach to j b iv.see,letter from gilbert to ogc of,letter from gilbert to ogc of.
on january,fda issued a letter ruling addressing the dispute between purepac and apotex concerning generic marketing exclusivity for gabapentin.fda sided with purepac,ruling that apotex was not entitled to any exclusivity based on its paragraph iv certification for the patent,and that purepac alone would be entitled to exclusivity based on the patent.letter from ogd to apotex and purepac of.
apotex challenged fda actions in district court.once again,apotex failed to advance the interpretation of j b iv.rather,apotex argued for a interpretation of the statute,contending that apotex was entitled to exclusivity based on its paragraph iv certification for the patent,or that apotex should at least be eligible for a period of shared exclusivity along with purepac based on apotex submission of the first paragraph iv certification for the patent.see letter from ogd to torpharm of,quoting torpharm memorandum in support of its motion for preliminary injunction.in april,the district court rejected apotex challenge,entering summary judgment in favor of fda.torpharm,thompson,d,torpharm.
apotex appealed the district court decisions in both purepac i and torpharm.once again,apotex failed to advance the interpretation of j b iv.this court consolidated the appeals and affirmed the district court rulings in all respects on january.purepac ii,at.
less than two weeks before this court decision in purepac ii,district court judge roberts issued a written order memorializing an oral decision in a separate action filed by apotex regarding generic marketing exclusivity for the drug paroxetine.torpharm,fda,no.civ,wl,paroxetine,vacated as moot.in paroxetine,judge roberts ruled that the plain language of j b iv compelled the as opposed to the interpretation of the statute.see id.based on paroxetine,apotex submitted a letter to fda requesting immediate approval of its gabapentin anda.for the first time,apotex asserted that fda was bound to follow the approach in awarding generic marketing exclusivity for gabapentin.as explained above,under the approach,purepac exclusivity for gabapentin stemmed solely from the patent,and that exclusivity period had expired.see letter from torpharm to ogd of.
on february,fda rejected apotex request.the agency concluded that apotex had waived the argument as the company had not previously raised it before fda,the district court,or this court,despite having had the opportunity to do so in the previous litigation concerning gabapentin.in fact,fda noted that apotex had taken the opposite exclusivity arguments premised on the reading of the statute.according to fda,the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred apotex from advancing these inconsistent positions.see letter from ogd to torpharm of.the agency also rejected apotex contention that collateral estoppel required that fda adopt the approach in line with paroxetine,and announced that it would continue to apply the approach in determining exclusivity for gabapentin andas.see.
apotex challenged fda decision in district court,and purepac intervened as a defendant.speaking through judge huvelle,the district court ruled for the agency.apotex,fda,no.civ.june,oral decision,reprinted in.the court held that apotex claims were barred by res judicata,and that collateral estoppel did not prevent fda from implementing the approach to j b iv concerning gabapentin andas.see.judge huvelle als
