plaintiff and appellant john coleman sued defendants and respondents medtronic,and medtronic sofamor danek usa,collectively,medtronic,alleging he suffered painful complications after a spinal surgery in which infuse,medtronic bone fusion medical device,was used in an manner.coleman seven causes of action are generally based upon allegations that medtronic defectively manufactured infuse,promoted uses of infuse without adequately warning of the associated risks,and failed to take available steps to warn coleman of the risks of such uses.the trial court sustained medtronic demurrer to coleman third amended complaint without leave to amend on the grounds that each cause of action was preempted by federal law.we conclude that coleman may allege causes of action for negligence and strict liability in a manner that avoids federal preemption but has waived any claim of error with respect to the remaining causes of action.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
medtronic manufactures and sells infuse,a medical device used in surgery to strengthen the spines of individuals with degenerated vertebral discs.infuse consists of an absorbable collagen sponge,rhbmp a manufactured version of a protein found in small quantities in the human body,and a titanium threaded fusion cage.during surgery,the doctor infuses the collagen sponge with liquid rhbmp and inserts the sponge into the cage to both stabilize the spine and maintain spacing between the vertebrae during the fusion process.
under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act of fdca,as amended by the medical device amendments of mda,the federal drug administration fda granted infuse premarket approval for use in certain types of spinal fusion surgeries,including anterior lumbar interbody fusion anterior fusion,where the surgical incision is on the patient abdomen.posterior lumbar interbody fusion posterior fusion is an alternate form of spinal fusion surgery that approaches the spine through an incision in the patient back.posterior fusion is considered an use of infuse because the fda has only approved infuse for use in anterior fusion 
coleman third amended complaint alleges medtronic promoted the use of infuse while downplaying the risk of complications,violating both state and federal laws.medtronic sponsored a clinical trial in to explore the use of infuse in posterior fusion but halted the trial because early results showed unwanted and uncontrolled bone growth in more than percent of patients.between and,medtronic entered into consulting and royalty agreements with key opinion leaders who were physicians touting infuse through presentations and medical journal articles.studies funded by medtronic omitted discussion of bone growth in the spinal canal as an adverse event and instead reported no adverse events.medtronic,however,was aware that adverse events or complications had been reported in between and percent of cases where infuse was used in posterior fusion.medtronic also provided information and instructions for surgeries by placing sales personnel in hospital operating rooms.medtronic promotional activities increased the use of infuse in posterior fusion.at the same time,various investigations by media,the department of justice,and the congress raised questions about the safety of infuse and about payments from medtronic to physicians.
in april,coleman underwent posterior fusion surgery of his vertebrae.his surgeon used infuse in an manner.coleman began suffering numbness and pain after the surgery.ct scans showed the collagen sponge had leaked rhbmp and unwanted bone growth had encased the nerves in coleman spine.
in april,coleman filed suit against medtronic.the trial court sustained medtronic demurrers to coleman complaint and first amended complaint with leave to amend.medtronic filed a demurrer to coleman second amended complaint.coleman opposition to the demurrer attached a third amended complaint.on april,the court sustained the demurrer to the second amended complaint but found the proposed third amended complaint sufficient,with the exception of coleman manufacturing defect claim.the court ordered coleman to file a third amended complaint without the manufacturing defect claim and ordered medtronic to file an answer.
four days later,a panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals held that a state law negligence cause of action based on a failure to report adverse information about an medical device as required by federal regulations was preempted by federal law.stengel medtronic,cir stengel i.based on the decision in stengel i,medtronic demurred to coleman third amended complaint.the trial court sustained medtronic demurrer without leave to amend on june.

discussion 
in his timely appeal,coleman contends his failure to warn,negligence,and manufacturing defect claims are not preempted because they are based on state law duties that parallel requirements under federal law medtronic contends that coleman state law claims can not survive preemption,and to the extent they do,they are inadequately pleaded.

federal regulation of class iii medical devices 
the mda imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight including a rigorous regime of premarket approval for class iii medical devices riegel medtronic,riegel.before the fda will grant premarket approval to a class iii medical device,it must be reasonably assured of the device safety and effectiveness.d.the premarket approval process is very involved,and applicants,usually the device manufacturers,must meet many requirements both before and after the fda grants premarket approval.riegel,supra,at.the agency must weigh any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.a c.the fda also reviews the device proposed labeling as part of the premarket approval process,evaluating safety and effectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the label a b,and determining that the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading d a.after this review process,the fda decides whether to grant or deny premarket approval to a given device.d.
after premarket approval,applicants must report adverse events to the fda.these are incidents in which the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury,or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurred.a.applicants must also report new clinical investigations or scientific studies concerning the device of which the applicant knows or reasonably should have known,b.the fda may withdraw premarket approval based on newly reported data or existing information it must withdraw approval if it determines that a device is unsafe or ineffective under the conditions in its labeling.e see also riegel,supra,at.
the manufacturer can not make any changes to the design,manufacturing,or labeling of approved devices without first obtaining additional approval from the fda.d riegel,supra,at.the fda has an established procedure a manufacturer must follow if it wants to change the intended use for a device.see d a.
nothing in the mda prevents a doctor from using a medical device in an manner.but the mda and its implementing regulations place restrictions on manufacturers who know or have reason to know of uses other than those approved by the fda.see f.fda regulations prohibit a device manufacturer from promoting the use of a device in a manner inconsistent with premarket approval.a see also providing that a device may not be advertised in a manner that is inconsistent with any conditions to approval specified in the premarket approval order for the device riley cordis d,riley discussing federal regulations on promoting uses.the fda forbids this practice because the fda review of a device safety and effectiveness was not universal it focused only on the intended use specified by a manufacturer.see a,c.ramirez medtronic,cv phx gms d dist.lexis ramirez.
preemption of state law claims 
express preemption 
the mda expressly preempts any state law that imposes with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.a.
in riegel,the united states supreme court established a framework for determining whether section a expressly preempts a state law claim.first,the fda must have established requirements applicable to the particular medical device at issue.riegel,supra,at.the premarket approval requirements applicable to class iii medical devices satisfy this first prong.id.at.next,state law claims are preempted if they impose requirements that relate to safety and effectiveness and are different from,or in addition to the requirements under federal law.id.at see also farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at.state law requirements can be established by either statute or common law.riegel,supra,at.
state law causes of action that provide a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of fda regulations are not expressly preempted if they parallel,rather than add to,federal requirements.riegel,supra,at,quoting medtronic,lohr,see also stengel iii,supra,at en banc.in order for a state requirement to be parallel to a federal requirement,and thus not expressly preempted under section a,the plaintiff must show that the requirements are genuinely equivalent.state and federal requirements are not genuinely equivalent if a manufacturer could be held liable under the state law without having violated the federal law.wolicki gables arrow int l,cir,wolicki gables,quoting mcmullen medtronic,cir.the california supreme court applied the same approach in permitting the plaintiffs to proceed on claims based on state law food labeling requirements that were identical to federal requirements.farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at states are free to provide for private remedies under state law,so long as state law requirements are identical to federal law requirements.
a state law claim that the warnings on a class iii medical device are inadequate,or that a device manufacturer failed to give additional warnings regarding use of the device,would be expressly preempted because the claim would impose a requirement under state law that is different than or in addition to what is required under federal law.see caplinger medtronic,d,caplinger plaintiff fraudulent misrepresentation claim expressly preempted because it would establish labeling and warning requirements different from,or in addition to,federal requirements.to permit a jury to decide a plaintiff claims that the information,warnings,and training material the fda required and approved through premarket approval process were inadequate under state law would displace the fda exclusive role and expertise in this area and risk imposing inconsistent obligations on the defendant.hughes boston scientific cir,hughes,quoting gomez jude medical daig div.cir.
in contrast,if a plaintiff state law claims are based on requirements that parallel federal law,they are not expressly preempted.in stengel iii,supra,the plaintiffs alleged a negligence failure to warn claim under arizona law,claiming the device manufacturer breached its duty of reasonable care by failing to report to the fda adverse events associated with a class iii medical device.the en banc opinion from the ninth circuit held that the plaintiff state law claim was not expressly preempted because it relied on a state law requirement duty to warn the fda of adverse outcomes that paralleled requirements under federal law.id.at.the concurring opinion,signed by seven of the eleven judges on the panel,explains the plaintiffs negligence claim is not expressly preempted because it seeks to hold medtronic accountable only for failing to do what federal law mandated nothing more.the state law duty,as alleged by the plaintiffs,is precisely parallel to the duties imposed by federal law.id.at conc.opn.of watford.in hughes,supra,at pages,the fifth circuit reached a similar conclusion,holding that the plaintiff state law claim is not expressly preempted when it does not impose additional or different requirements to the federal regulations,but is parallel to the federal requirements.
implied preemption 
a state law cause of action for violation of the fdca is barred under the doctrine of implied preemption if it is cognizable only by virtue of the provisions of the fdca itself,rather than traditional state tort law.buckman plaintiffs legal comm,buckman.subdivision a of section states all actions to enforce fdca requirements,including requirements under the mda,shall be by and in the name of the united states.the buckman court interpreted section a to mean that the federal government rather than private litigants are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions.buckman,supra,at,fn.the plaintiffs in buckman sought to pursue a state law fraud claim based on purported misrepresentations the defendants made to the fda during the premarket approval process.because the plaintiffs claim existed solely by virtue of federal requirements,it was impliedly preempted under section.id.at.the court recognized that plaintiffs pursuing state law claims relying on traditional state tort law which had predated the federal enactments in question would not be subject to implied preemption,but the claims before them did not meet that criteria.id.at.to survive implied preemption,the conduct on which the plaintiffs claim is based must be the type of conduct that would traditionally give rise to liability under state law and that would give rise to liability under state law even if the fdca had never been enacted.riley,supra,d at.
the california supreme court briefly mentioned buckman when discussing the preemptive effect of section on the plaintiff efforts to privately enforce a california statute regulating food labeling that was identical to fdca regulations.farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at.the court rejected the argument that section bars such a suit,reasoning that the p laintiffs do not seek to enforce the fdca rather,their claims are predicated on violations of obligations imposed by state law.id.at.section does not apply to the state law claims presented here.the statute,by its very terms,only implicates efforts to enforce federal law.what section does not do is limit,prohibit,or affect private claims predicated on state laws.id.at.also,in mcguan endovascular technologies,th,the court found the plaintiff state law fraud claims to be impliedly preempted under buckman,where the plaintiff alleged the defendant made fraudulent statements to the fda.
several federal courts,including the ninth circuit,have interpreted buckman narrowly,concluding that state law causes of action that refer to federal statutes and regulations as providing the basis for state law liability are not impliedly preempted because they remain based in traditional state tort law.see,stengel iii,supra,at no preemption of a state law claim based on a state law duty that parallels a federal requirement hughes,supra,at negligence claim not impliedly preempted based on buckman distinction between claims and claims relying on traditional state tort law bausch stryker cir,bausch the plaintiff manufacturing defect claims are not impliedly preempted because they are tort law claims,not fraud on a federal agency.
other courts have taken a broader approach,focusing on buckman reasoning that a state law claim could survive implied preemption only if it relied on traditional state tort law which had predated the federal enactment in question.see,in re medtronic,sprint fidelis leads products liability litigation cir,sprint fidelis claims based on failure to file adverse event reports are simply an attempt by private parties to enforce the mda foreclosed by implied preemption houston medtronic,july,cv sh d dist.lexis houston any negligence claim based solely on illegal promotion is impliedly preempted under buckman and a caplinger,supra,d at negligence claim based on promotion impliedly preempted because it is not based on conduct that would give rise to a recovery under state law even in the absence of the fdca.
the panel opinion in stengel i that preceded the en banc opinion in stengel iii interpreted buckman broadly,reasoning that there was no meaningful distinction between the plaintiffs claims and the claims held to be preempted in buckman.stengel i,supra,at.the en banc panel in stengel iii came to a different conclusion,finding neither express nor implied preemption where the plaintiffs proposed complaint alleged a continuing duty to monitor the product after premarket approval and to discover and report to the fda any complaints about the product performance and any adverse health consequences of which it became aware and that are or may be attributable to the product,that medtronic failed to perform its duty under federal law to warn the fda,and because medtronic failed to comply with its duty under federal law,it breached its duty to use reasonable care under arizona negligence law.stengel iii,supra,at.
permissible state law claims are not subject to express or implied preemption 
in order to state a claim that avoids both express and implied preemption,a plaintiff must be suing for conduct that violates the fdca or else his claim is expressly preempted by a,but the plaintiff must not be suing because the conduct violates the fdca such a claim would be impliedly preempted under buckman.sprint fidelis,supra,at,quoting riley,supra,d at.stated differently,to survive both express and implied preemption,a state law cause of action must be premised on conduct that both violates the fdca and would give rise to a recovery under state law even in the absence of the fdca.riley,supra,d at.
failure to warn 
coleman state law claim for failure to warn is expressly preempted to the extent it is based on the theory that medtronic should have given warnings different than those approved by the fda.allowing coleman to proceed on such a claim would impose requirements different from,or in addition to federal requirements.a see also riegel,supra,at.however,coleman focuses on two other theories of liability for failure to warn.he contends medtronic violated state common law and parallel federal requirements by failing to report adverse information about infuse to the fda after fda approval and promoting the use of infuse in posterior fusion.we address the two theories separately.
f ailure to warn the fda 
medtronic initially contends that coleman forfeited the argument that his failure to warn claims should survive preemption based on medtronic failure to file adverse event reports by conceding that issue before the trial court.we disagree.coleman opposed medtronic demurrer,arguing he adequately alleged a cause of action for failure to warn.at the hearing on the demurrer,coleman did not concede he failed to state a cause of action.coleman did acknowledge the existence of the original stengel i opinion,but never stated it had been correctly decided.given the de novo standard of review,and the state of the record on appeal,we find that coleman did not forfeit the issue.even if he did,we have discretion to permit parties to propose new theories in appellate briefing when the issue posed is purely a question of law based on undisputed facts,and involves important questions of public policy.citation.farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at,fn,quoting cedars sinai medical center superior court cal th.
coleman failure to warn claim based on medtronic failure to file adverse event reports with the fda is not subject to express or implied preemption.stengel iii,supra,at hughes,supra,at.federal law requires manufacturers of class iii devices to file adverse event reports whenever the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury,or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurred.a.california law imposes a parallel requirement under the common law strict liability tort of failure to warn.the device manufacturer can be found liable if it did not adequately warn of a particular risk that was known or knowable in light of the generally recognized and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge available at the time of manufacture and distribution.anderson owens corning fiberglas cal d,see also,rest d torts,products liability,subds.b d.
we conclude stengel iii provides the correct framework for analysis,and we are not persuaded by medtronic argument that stengel iii is wrongly decided.we recognize,of course,that stengel iii is not binding on this court,but it is persuasive authority that we elect to follow.james state th,fn.the fifth and ninth circuits have now determined that state law claims based on failure to file adverse event reports with the fda are not subject to preemption.stengel iii,supra,at hughes,supra,at.we see no distinction between the present case and the allegations at issue in stengel iii,other than the fact that coleman claim is a strict liability failure to warn claim under california law,while the plaintiff in stengel iii alleged a negligence claim under arizona law.
the eighth circuit has taken a different approach to similar allegations,holding that to the extent a state law claim is premised upon a manufacturer failure to follow an fda regulation,such a claim is impliedly preempted under buckman.the p laintiffs alleged that medtronic failed to provide the fda with sufficient information and did not timely file adverse event reports,as required by federal regulations.as the district court concluded,citation,these claims are simply an attempt by private parties to enforce the mda,claims foreclosed by section a as construed in buckman,at page.citation.sprint fidelis,supra,at.we believe such a broad interpretation of buckman is unwarranted,as it would preempt almost any state law claim that references a federal requirement,even though the plaintiff is relying on state law,not federal law,to state a cause of action.see,farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at bars private enforcement of the fdca,but it does not bar private enforcement of state law requirements that are identical to fdca provisions.
medtronic contends failure to warn the fda is not a cognizable claim under california law because a device manufacturer only has a duty to warn doctors,who then convey the warnings as appropriate to their patients.carlin superior court cal th,carlin.coleman responds by pointing out that medtronic does not explain why the duty to warn the medical profession would not include the duty to warn the fda,if that is the sole permissible mechanism for publicizing the additional risks associated with a medical device.such a duty to convey warnings to a third party who can reasonably be expected to warn the consumer is recognized in other contexts.see,persons salomon north america,d.we agree with coleman that the duty to warn should not be so narrowly defined as to exclude a requirement to file adverse event reports with the fda if that is the only available method to warn doctors and consumers.as the concurrence pointed out in stengel iii,construing this duty in that way creates a causation hurdle that plaintiffs would not otherwise face.to prevail,they will ultimately have to prove that if medtronic had properly reported the adverse events to the fda as required under federal law,that information would have reached the plaintiff doctors in time to prevent his injuries.stengel iii,supra,at conc.opn.of watford.however,at this state of the proceedings,taking the allegations of the complaint as true,coleman has alleged facts sufficient to state causes of action in strict liability and negligence based on medtronic failure to warn.
off label promotion 
a separate theory for coleman failure to warn claim is grounded in medtronic alleged practice of promoting uses for infuse,specifically its use in posterior fusion.here,the preemption analysis is slightly different and leads us to the conclusion that,to the extent coleman failure to warn claim is based on medtronic promotion of use,it is expressly preempted.
stengel iii only involved a failure to warn claim based on a manufacturer failure to provide adverse event reports to the fda the court did not consider any allegations of promotion.stengel iii,supra.in our view,coleman failure to warn claim can not include a theory of promotion because he would inherently be claiming that by promoting the use of infuse,medtronic incurred a duty to warn plaintiff and his doctors about the risks of such use.because medtronic has already complied with federal requirements for warnings and labeling,any state law requirement to provide additional warnings would be different from,and in addition to,federal requirements.riegel,supra,at see also caplinger,supra,d at,fn.the federal requirement that manufacturers not promote devices for uses is not genuinely equivalent to the state law requirements that a manufacturer provide adequate warnings to physicians about the risks of its medical device.
coleman contends that his state law claim parallels the federal prohibition against manufacturers promoting use because federal regulations prohibit adulteration and misbranding.however,we do not consider the state and federal requirements to be genuinely equivalent.federal regulations prevent device manufacturers from promoting use of devices.see,ramirez,supra,d at dist.lexis at.those requirements are substantively different than the requirements imposed by california common law in the failure to warn context.strict liability failure to warn under california law imposes a requirement to warn of a particular risk that was known or knowable in light of the generally recognized and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge available at the time of manufacture and distribution.carlin,supra,cal th at.we are unaware of any case law recognizing a state law claim for failure to warn based upon allegations that the manufacturer had a duty to refrain from marketing altogether,rather than marketing with adequate warnings.because the federal and state requirements are not genuinely equivalent,coleman failure to warn claim is expressly preempted under section.
at least one recent case involving infuse used in posterior fusion takes a different approach,concluding that state law claims based on promotion are not subject to a preemption analysis because promotion takes manufacturers outside the protection of the statutory scheme,including the protection afforded by preemption.ramirez,supra,d at dist.lexis.the starting premise in ramirez is that the fda reviewed infuse safety and effectiveness only for the uses medtronic specified in its premarket approval application,and the regulations are premised on that review.citations.id.at.examining whether plaintiff claims based on medtronic promotion were expressly preempted,the court noted that the fundamental purpose of express preemption is to avoid having another entity jury,state regulators,or state legislatures arrive at a determination regarding a device safety that conflicts with the conclusion the fda made after the rigorous premarket approval process.id.at.when a plaintiff brings a claim against a manufacturer that arises out of a use that has not been reviewed by the fda but has been promoted by the manufacturer the purpose of express preemption is not served by preempting the claim.ibid.it would make little sense to allow medtronic to receive the protection of preemption when it is actively promoting uses that have not been reviewed by the fda.id.at.the ramirez court concluded that the shield provided by express preemption drops when the manufacturer violates the prohibitions against promotion.the court also found the plaintiff claims were not subject to implied preemption because they are not wholly derivative of federal law,like the claims at issue in buckman.it held that the plaintiff could bring a state law claim for knowingly concealing information in promotion even if promotion was legal under federal law.the core of her claim under state law does not turn on the existence of a federal infraction,and is therefore permissible under buckman.id.at.
we find the approach taken in ramirez unpersuasive.to avoid preemption,a plaintiff must state a cause of action based on state law that parallels a federal requirement.riegel,supra,at.here,because the requirements imposed by state law do not parallel the federal requirements,coleman promotion failure to warn claim is expressly preempted by section a.
negligence 
coleman negligence claim is based on the same two theories as his failure to warn claim failure to submit adverse event reports to the fda and promotion.we address each theory separately.
failure to warn the fda.
for the same reasons discussed with respect to coleman failure to warn claim,the negligence cause of action based on medtronic failure to report adverse events to the fda is not preempted,and is adequately pleaded to survive demurrer.
medtronic contends that coleman allegation of negligence per se is insufficient to save the claim from preemption because section a constrains a state ability to use a federal statute violation as a basis for state tort liability.kemp medtronic,cir,kemp.but kemp predates both buckman and riegel,and the cases are divided on whether a claim based on negligence per se is subject to preemption.there is no unanimity in the courts which have addressed the issue of whether negligence per se claims should be allowed to proceed under the fdca while a substantial number of jurisdictions allow claims based on the violation of federal requirements denoted as parallel claims,others determine that even those claims are preempted.howard zimmer,fns.listing cases permitting parallel state law claims and cases finding preemption of state law claims.we agree with the cases finding no preemption of state law claims based on negligence per se.see,howard zimmer,cir,negligence per se claim for violation of federal regulation is recognized under oklahoma law and is not preempted hughes,supra,invoking negligence per se to support state negligence claim parallel to federal requirements is not expressly or impliedly preempted ellis bard,cir georgia law permits a claim for negligence per se for violation of the fdca.the only convincing reason to dismiss a cause of action based on negligence per se is if such a claim is not cognizable under state law.see,mcclelland medtronic,d dismissing a plaintiff claim because florida does not recognize violation of federal laws or regulations as a basis for a state law cause of action.
california recognizes the applicability of negligence per se in a broad range of scenarios,including violation of federal law.there is no doubt in california that a federal statute or regulation may be adopted as a standard of care.citation.more to the point,a federal standard in the fdca has been adopted as a standard of care in a negligence action.citation.dirosa showa denko th,see also evraets intermedics intraocular,th,evraets a claim resting on the doctrine of negligence per se is not preempted by the fdca.the primary limitation on the applic
