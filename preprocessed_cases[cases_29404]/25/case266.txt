background 
kv manufactures metoprolol succinate er in missouri,and markets and distributes it throughout the united states.lefaivre,a resident of rhode island,had a prescription for the medication and purchased it several times at retail pharmacies in rhode island.
on march,the food and drug administration fda filed a complaint against kv alleging that kv had not manufactured the medication in compliance with fda standards under certain provisions of chapter v of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,a b.on march,the fda and kv jointly filed a consent decree of permanent injunction consent decree that settled the fda complaint with kv.in the consent decree,kv neither admitted nor denied the fda claims.
kv stipulated as part of the consent decree that it had sold drugs that were adulterated as defined by a b,meaning that the drugs were manufactured,processed,packed,labeled,held,and distributed in violation of the fda current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements.kv acknowledged that it had not used proper quality control procedures when manufacturing the medication.it also stipulated that some of the medication sold to retail pharmacies had been misbranded in violation of federal regulations.kv agreed to destroy the remaining stock of adulterated drugs and issue a recall for all stocks of the medication sold to retailers between may and february.kv issued the recall notice at the retail level.a recall instructs all retailers that had purchased the medication to return all unsold product to kv.the consent decree did not require kv to distribute its recall notice to individual purchasers of the medication,and it did not do so.
lefaivre filed suit against kv alleging a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and violations of the mmpa.specifically,lefaivre alleged that the medication was unmerchantable because it was not manufactured,marketed distributed in compliance with cgmp and was accordingly adulterated as a matter of law.lefaivre sought damages in the amount of the difference between the values of the medication as warranted their values if they were manufactured in full compliance with cgmp and the values of the medication as actually received adulterated.with regard to the mmpa claim,lefaivre alleged that kv concealed,suppressed and omitted to disclose the material fact that the medication was adulterated under federal law in connection with its sale of the medication in trade or commerce in and from the state of missouri.lefaivre requested an award of actual damages and punitive damages under the mmpa.
kv moved to dismiss the suit,asserting that the claims were essentially claims for violation of federal regulations themselves and that no private cause of action existed.the district court held that lefaivre state law claims were preempted by federal law because the claims were based entirely on violations of federal regulations and the enforcement of federal regulations is solely the province of the federal government.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,lefaivre asserts that the district court ruling leaves him and all other purchasers of the adulterated medication without a legal remedy for economic injuries.according to lefaivre,the district court determination that the fdca impliedly preempts his state law causes of action is without legal support and contrary to wyeth levine,d,in which the supreme court held that the fdca does not preempt state law claims against drug manufacturers for failure to adequately warn of potential hazards.additionally,lefaivre asserts that the district court erred in relying on the supreme court decision in buckman plaintiffs legal committee,d,as support for its finding of preemption.lefaivre distinguishes buckman arguing it concerned claims not present here.
in response,kv maintains that the district court simply applied a basic legal lefaivre may not convert fdca violations into private causes of dismiss lefaivre claims.according to kv,the supreme court in wyeth left this doctrine intact.
the general law of preemption is grounded in the constitution command that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land.in re aurora dairy.organic milk mktg.sales practices,cir quoting const.art.vi,cl.as a result,any state law conflicting with federal law has no effect.id.internal quotation and citations omitted.whether a particular federal statute preempts state law depends upon congressional purpose.id.we entertain two presumptions when interpreting the presence and scope of preemption.id.at.
first,congress does not cavalierly causes of action.in all cases,and particularly in those in which congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.second,congressional purpose is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.
id.internal quotations,alterations,and citation omitted.
the express language of a statute or its structure and purpose may indicate congress preemptive intent.id.a state law is expressly preempted when a federal statute states the congressional intention to preempt state law by defining the scope of preemption.id.here,kv has not asserted,nor do we find any evidence of,explicit language in the fdca to bar lefaivre present claims.id.internal quotation and citation omitted.therefore,we need only consider whether lefaivre claims are impliedly preempted.
implied preemption exists where a federal statutory or regulatory scheme is so pervasive in scope that it occupies the field,leaving no room for state is termed field preemption.implied preemption also occurs where state law has not been completely displaced but is superseded to the extent that it conflicts with federal is known as conflict preemption.
id.internal quotation and citation omitted.there are two types of conflict preemption and obstruction preemption.see.pub.intervenor mortier,d.impossibility preemption arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.id.internal quotation and citation omitted.impossibility is a demanding defense.wyeth.at.obstruction preemption exists when a state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.pub.intervenor,at internal quotation and citation omitted.
in determining whether lefaivre claims are impliedly preempted,we must determine congress purpose and intent in enacting the fdca.to determine congress intent,we may consider the statute itself and any regulations enacted pursuant to the statute authority.aurora,at.a tension exists between the presumption against preemption and the possibility of implied preemption as a result,it is often a perplexing question whether congress has precluded state action or by the choice of selective regulatory measures has left the police power of the states undisturbed except as the state and federal regulations collide.id.internal quotation,alteration,and citation omitted.
fortunately,the court extensively discussed congress purpose with regard to
