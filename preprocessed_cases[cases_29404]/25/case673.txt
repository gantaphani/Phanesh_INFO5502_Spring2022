eli lilly and company lilly sued aradigm corporation aradigm seeking,inter alia,to have two of its scientists recognized as joint inventors on aradigm patent the patent.based on a jury verdict,the united states district court for the southern district of indiana entered final judgment in favor of lilly insofar as it ordered the patent and trademark office to add one of lilly scientists,dimarchi,as an inventor.eli lilly aradigm,no.ip f.on the inventorship issue,aradigm cross appeals and we reverse.
in the same district court proceedings,lilly also sought to recover damages based on contract and unjust enrichment causes of action.the district court entered final judgment in favor of aradigm on the unjust enrichment claim and in favor of lilly on the contract claim,but it awarded only nominal contract damages to lilly.id.lilly appeals the district court judgment on these state law claims,and we affirm.
lilly is a pharmaceutical company.in may,patent the patent issued to lilly.it claims among other inventions the insulin analog lispro now commercially marketed by lilly as humalog,and it lists dimarchi as an inventor.traditionally,regular,or natural,insulin is administered by subcutaneous injection,via a needle that deposits the insulin under the skin,to help diabetics regulate their blood glucose levels.when regular insulin molecules are in aqueous solution in the syringe,they into a stable hexamer,or cluster.it is believed that the approximately delay between the insulin injection and the onset of its therapeutic effect can be traced to the time required for the hexamer delivered under the skin to disassociate into unclustered monomers and to diffuse away from the injection site and into the blood stream.
lispro is a modified version of regular insulin.like all proteins,insulin is a molecule made up of linear sequences of amino acids strung together in chains.lispro is comprised of chains of amino acids identical to those in regular insulin except that two amino acids at one point in one of the chains are reversed in order.according to the patent,this slight structural alteration makes lispro less prone to than regular insulin and endows lispro with a comparatively more rapid onset of activity,while at the same time enabling lispro to retain the biological activity of regular insulin.patent,ll.in other words,a lthough lispro exists in solution as a hexamer,it very rapidly disassociates into a virtually entirely monomeric form following subcutaneous administration permitting it to be absorbed quantitatively faster than regular insulin after subcutaneous administration.patent,ll.
aradigm business focuses on drug delivery through the inhalation of aerosols.in january,a number of aradigm scientists filed a patent application that,in march,issued as the patent.titled use of monomeric insulin as a means for improving the bioavailability of inhaled insulin,aradigm patent claims methods of aerosolized administration of lispro,among other monomeric insulin analogs,in which the lispro quickly enters the circulatory system after being inhaled into the lung.id.at,ll.one difficulty with administering regular insulin in aerosolized form is believed to be that inhaled insulin is sequestered in the lung to a significant degree and therefore does not rapidly or predictably enter the bloodstream where insulin must be located to have its therapeutic effect.id.at.when filing the patent,aradigm believed that inhalation of lispro instead of regular insulin would reduce the tendency of insulin to remain in the lungs because,as with subcutaneous delivery,the disassociation of insulin from hexameric to monomeric form is an important first step prior to the absorption of insulin into the blood stream,and because lispro dissociates more rapidly than regular insulin does.id.at,ll.
as relevant to this appeal,the patent contains the following method claims 
a method of improving the bioavailability of insulin delivered via the lung,comprising 
aerosolizing a formulation of an insulin analog which analog rapidly disassociates into monomeric form 
inhaling the aerosolized formulation of the insulin analog into the lungs in a manner which allows the particles of the insulin analog to deposit on the lung tissue.
the method of claim,wherein the inhaled insulin analog is insulin lispro which rapidly disassociates in a monomeric form producing a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of recombinant human insulin.
a method of reproducibly effecting a serum glucose level,comprising 
aerosolizing a formulation comprising monomeric insulin 
administering the aerosolized formulation.
the method of claim,wherein the monomeric insulin is insulin lispro.
id.at,to,ll.
all of lilly allegations reduce to a single alleged wrong that aradigm improperly appropriated information about the advantages of pulmonary delivery of lispro from lilly and incorrectly claimed the invention in the patent as exclusively its own.in and,lilly and aradigm held four meetings to discuss a possible collaboration that would take advantage of lilly expertise in insulin compounds and aradigm expertise in aerosolized drug delivery.several scientists from lilly were involved in the four meetings with aradigm scientists in june and november of,harrison from lilly attended in june,roeder from lilly attended and in july,dimarchi and wolff from lilly,among others,attended.lilly insists that its scientists conveyed to aradigm during these meetings the specific advantages to be expected from using lispro instead of regular insulin in an aerosol delivery device.
in the district court,lilly brought a claim under to address the alleged omission of harrison and dimarchi from the list of inventors on the patent arguing to the jury that both were joint inventors of the inventions in dependent claims and.the verdict form instructed the jury to answer whether or not lilly had proved by clear and convincing evidence that either harrison or dimarchi had contributed to either of the two following inventions inhaling an aerosolized formulation of insulin lispro into the lungs,which produces a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of regular insulin,or a method for aerosolizing a formulation of insulin lispro and administering that aerosolized formulation.the former states the invention of claim,and the latter states the invention of claim.the jury found that dimarchi a of the former invention claimed in claim,but that neither lilly scientist was a of the latter invention of a method for aerosolizing and administering lispro claimed in claim.
in its,which we address first,aradigm argues that the jury verdict finding dimarchi to be a of claim can not stand.aradigm argues that the district court instructions to the jury on the inventorship issue were legally erroneous,and that,even if the instructions were not erroneous,lilly did not introduce substantial evidence to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that dimarchi was a of the invention in claim.we hold that the instructions were not erroneous,but that the record does not contain substantial evidence to support the jury finding that dimarchi was a given lilly clear and convincing burden of proof on the issue.lilly argues that,if we reverse the jury verdict due to insufficient evidence,a new trial is required because lilly should only have been required to satisfy a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof to demonstrate we reject this argument 
lilly also tried two contract claims and an unjust enrichment claim to the jury.these claims resulted in only two dollars of nominal damages against aradigm.in its briefing,lilly did not argue that the jury findings on these claims were incorrect.instead,lilly argued that the jury findings demonstrated that lilly was entitled to an injunction prohibiting aradigm from continuing to file and prosecute patent applications containing information in which lilly retains contractual or equitable rights.the district court denied lilly requests for injunctive relief,and lilly appeals this denial to us.we affirm.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
section creates a cause of action in the district courts for correction of of an inventor on a patent provided the error occurred without deceptive intent.see permitting correction of inventorship w henever through error an inventor is not named in an issued patent and such error arose without any deceptive intention on his part mcv,thermos,holding that deceptive intent in failing to join an inventor would not permit correction of inventorship under section and could invalidate the patent 
in a section proceeding,t he inventors as named in an issued patent are presumed to be correct.hess advanced cardiovascular.the general rule is that a party alleging misjoinder or of inventors must meet the heavy burden of proving its case by clear and convincing evidence,see id.citing garrett united states,and must provide evidence to corroborate the alleged joint inventor conception,see ethicon,united states surgical,holding that an alleged must supply evidence to corroborate his testimony of conception.
section of title is the statutory locus of joint inventorship doctrine.it provides that a person not listed on a patent need not demonstrate that he made a contribution equal in importance to the contribution made by the listed inventors to claim his right to joint inventor status.see inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though they did not physically work together or at the same time,each did not make the same type or amount of contribution,or each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent.in fact,section sets no explicit lower limit on the quantum or quality of inventive contribution required for a person to qualify as a joint inventor.fina oil chem.ewen.however,a long line of decisions in this court holds that a person is a joint inventor only if he contributes to the conception of the claimed invention.see,bard,fina oil,at the case law thus indicates that to be a joint inventor,an individual must make a contribution to the conception of the claimed invention that is not insignificant in quality,when that contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention.sewall walters,see also burroughs wellcome barr,conception is the touchstone of inventorship,the completion of the mental part of invention.the line between actual contributions to conception and the remaining,more prosaic contributions to the inventive process that do not render the contributor a is sometimes a difficult one to draw.contributions to realizing an invention may not amount to a contribution to conception if they merely explain what was then state of the art,hess,at,if they are too far removed from the realization of an invention,see,garrett,at one who merely suggests an idea of a result to be accomplished,rather than means of accomplishing it,is not a joint inventor,or if they are focused solely on such realization,see,ethicon,at o ne does not qualify as a joint inventor by merely assisting the actual inventor after conception of the claimed invention.
it is however uncontroversial that the alleged joint inventor seeking to be listed on a patent must demonstrate that his labors were conjoined with the efforts of the named inventors.joint inventorship under section can only arise when collaboration or concerted effort is,when the inventors have some open line of communication during or in temporal proximity to their inventive efforts 
what is clear is that the statutory word jointly is not mere surplusage.for persons to be joint inventors under section,there must be some element of joint behavior,such as collaboration or working under common direction,one inventor seeing a relevant report and building upon it or hearing another suggestion at a meeting 
j oint inventorship under section requires at least some quantum of collaboration or connection.

first,we review aradigm suggestion that the jury instructions are erroneous.we apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district court sits,here the seventh circuit,to this issue.the standard of review for jury instructions is prejudicial legal error.digital,telegenix,see also hasham cal.state bd.of equalization,cir t he first question to be answered is whether the instructions misstate or insufficiently state the law.if they do,the next question is whether the flawed instruction confused or misled the jury causing prejudice to a litigant.quoting doe burnham,cir citation omitted.in reviewing the correctness of jury instructions,the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit look s to the instructions as a whole,in a common sense manner,avoiding fastidiousness,inquiring whether the correct message was conveyed to the jury reasonably well.c f packing ibp,quoting wilk am.med.ass n,cir.a party seeking to alter a judgment based on erroneous jury instructions must establish that it made a proper and timely objection to the jury instructions,those instructions were legally erroneous,the errors had prejudicial effect,and it requested alternative instructions that would have remedied the error.advanced display,kent state,citations omitted.if the challenging party prevails,then it is entitled to a new trial.ecolab paraclipse.whether a jury instruction is legally erroneous is a question of law,and thus is reviewed without deference to a trial court.id.
aradigm initially argues that the district court erred by not construing claim before sending the inventorship issue to the jury.it is true that the legal scope of a claim must be known before the contributions of an alleged can be compared to that claim to determine whether the correct inventors were named.see trovan,sokymat sa,irori,a n inventorship analysis,like an infringement or invalidity analysis,begins as a first step with a construction of each asserted claim to determine the subject matter encompassed thereby.the second step is then to compare the alleged contributions of each asserted with the subject matter of the properly construed claim to then determine whether the correct inventors were named.citation omitted.aradigm,however,never requested that the district court construe any terms in claim and never offered a construction of claim.only after the presentation of all of the evidence to the jury did aradigm even suggest that claim construction might be helpful to determine the proper scope of the claimed invention.we hold that aradigm has waived its right to request a construction of claim and that aradigm has thereby implicitly conceded that the meanings of the terms in claim are clear and not in need of construction.see united states surgical ethicon,holding that claim construction is required only when the meaning or scope of technical terms and words of art is unclear and in dispute and requires resolution to determine the issue before the court.
likely realizing the difficulties of requesting a claim construction at such an advanced stage of the proceedings,aradigm next falls back to argue that the jury instructions on inventorship of claim are error because the description in the instructions of the invention to which dimarchi was alleged to have contributed prejudicially paraphrased the actual language of claim.the jury was presented with descriptions of the invention of claim in two places.first,in final instruction number,the jury was told that the inventions at issue in this case include that aerosolized lispro produces a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of regular human insulin.second,as earlier described,the jury verdict form described the invention in claim as inhaling an aerosolized formulation of insulin lispro into the lungs,which produces a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of regular insulin.at trial,aradigm objected to the paraphrasing in jury instruction and the special verdict question,noting that the jury should be directed to the specific claims to which lilly claims to have made a contribution rather than these characterizations of the claims,that a characterization of the claims will confuse the jury,and that a characterization of the claims simply by pulling words out of them is not a complete description of what is claimed.
we hold that aradigm can not demonstrate error in the paraphrasing that merits a new trial for two reasons.first,aradigm objection was not sufficiently specific to preserve its prejudicial paraphrasing argument on appeal.it is black letter law that objections must state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.see also avern trust clarke,cir rule of the federal rules of civil procedure precludes the assignment of error when no specific objection to an instruction is made.as the supreme court has stated,the purpose of this rule is to ensure that objections point out to a district court its alleged error so that the district court has the first opportunity to correct the error.see palmer hoffman.in fairness to the trial court and to the parties,objections to a charge must be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.aradigm alleged that the jury would be confused by the paraphrase,but aradigm objection neither communicated to the district court why the paraphrase was prejudicial nor br ought into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.id.aradigm never indicated what aspect of the claim the paraphrase left out.generically alleging that the wording of a jury instruction is confusing,without suggesting the logical error the jury might make,does not give the district court the information that it requires to see the alleged error of its ways and to have a meaningful first opportunity to consider changing course.
second,addressing aradigm argument on the merits,we conclude that the jury instructions were not erroneous as a whole.read in conjunction with independent claim,dependent claim claims a method comprising the two steps of aerosolizing lispro and inhaling the aerosolized formulation of lispro into the lungs in a manner in which the lispro rapidly disassociates in a monomeric form producing a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of regular insulin.patent,ll.although it does not recite the aerosolizing of lispro as a distinct first step,the description of the invention on the verdict form does contain the requirement that the invention include inhaling an aerosolized formulation of lispro,necessarily encompassing the step of aerosolizing.thus we see little certainly not a prejudicial the language of the claim and the language of the verdict form.in fact,on appeal,aradigm does not allege error in the statement of the invention on the verdict form.
the statement of the invention in instruction,however,recites only one limitation on the method of aerosolizing lispro claimed in claim that aerosolized lispro satisfy the limitation.we conclude that this is not error prejudicial to aradigm.the seventh circuit look s to the instructions as a whole,in a common sense manner,avoiding fastidiousness,inquiring whether the correct message was conveyed to the jury reasonably well.c f packing,at quoting wilk,at.in light of the verdict form,any alleged error in instruction did not prevent the jury from reasonably discerning the correct message.additionally,the law of inventorship does not hinge status on whether a person contributed to the conception of all the limitations in any one claim of the patent.rather,the law requires only that a make a contribution to the conception of the subject matter of a claim.see inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent.ethicon,at granting status provided the person contributed to the invention defined by a claim or if the person contribution found its way into the defined invention in a claim.if dimarchi had in fact conceived of the limitation on the method of inhaling lispro and communicated this conception to aradigm,then dimarchi would on the record before us be a of claim as the invention in claim is nothing more than using lispro in the method of claim in a manner that meets the limitation.
finally,aradigm argues that the district court paraphrase of claim permitted the jury to find that dimarchi was a when dimarchi contributed only a mere realization about the chemical properties of lispro that were in the public domain.a contribution of information in the prior art can not give rise to joint inventorship because it is not a contribution to conception.see hess,at.aradigm argument,however,presumes that the limitation of aerosolized lispro producing a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of recombinant human insulin in claim merely recites a fact of nature.aradigm argues that the double bioavailability of aerosolized lispro aerosolized natural insulin is inherent in all uses of aerosolized lispro,and that the language is therefore not a limitation on the scope of claim at all.regardless of their veracity,we refuse to accept these presumptions as proven fact for the first time at this point in the proceedings.furthermore,aradigm argument is not an argument that the district court improperly paraphrased claim in the jury instructions,but is rather an argument that claim requires construction because it does not convey its scope through the plain and clear meaning of its language.if a litigant seeks to raise such an argument,it must press the district court to engage in claim construction early in the proceedings.as previously discussed,aradigm failed to make such a timely request.
next,we turn to aradigm argument that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury verdict,that is,to satisfy lilly burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that dimarchi was a joint inventor of claim of the patent.
inventorship is a mixed question of law and fact the overall inventorship determination is a question of law,but it is premised on underlying questions of fact.see of,am.cyanamid,ethicon,at.when we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law on a mixed question of law and fact given to a jury without a special verdict form detailing the underlying questions of fact,we must sustain the jury conclusion unless the jury was not presented with substantial evidence to support any set of implicit findings sufficient under the law to arrive at its conclusion.see applied med.res.united states surgical,stating that for the appellant to prevail it must demonstrate that the facts were not sufficient to support the conclusions necessarily drawn by the jury on the way to its verdict.
substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.substantial evidence is not a fixed quantum of evidence what is or is not substantial may only be determined with respect to the burden of proof that the litigant bore in the trial court.for example,in reviewing whether the evidence supports a finding of fact the decision might be affirmed if the standard of proof below were weight of evidence and might be reversed on the same record if the standard of proof were clear and convincing evidence.ssih equip.int l trade comm n,nies,additional comments see also,juicy whip,orange bang,reviewing a jury verdict for substantial evidence satisfying defendant clear and convincing burden of proof on an invalidity defense.
dimarchi claim to depends on the subject matter communicated during the and meetings between aradigm and lilly,and lilly can not demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that dimarchi communicated to aradigm scientists that aerosolized lispro might be used to produce a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after the inhalation of a similar amount of human insulin.dimarchi did not state that he communicated this conception to aradigm scientists.he only testified that he remembered talking about insulin at a meeting in july of,and that he never talks about insulin without discussing lispro and its properties 
q did you ever have occasion to discuss with aradigm directly your views on the characteristics of the lispro molecule and how it would be effective in an aerosolized delivery system 
a i f you mention human natural insulin,i thinking lispro.so if someone comes to me under a confidentiality agreement and starts to discuss insulin delivery by the pulmonary route,it is just inconceivable that i not going to think about lispro and begin to talk about its virtues.trial tr.
q do you remember discussing lispro during that meeting 
a i remember discussing insulin,and,as i have shared with you insulin and lispro are are synonymous.we talk about insulin,we are going to talk about lispro.trial tr.
wolff,another lilly scientist testified that at this meeting there was a question from aradigm as to whether there were other molecules that lilly might be interested in pursuing besides regular insulin,and then richard dimarchi said that lispro would be one that would be a candidate.trial tr.lilly also argues that an email written by hakes,a product development manager for lilly,demonstrates that dimarchi communicated his conception of the relevant invention.the email,however,only summarized a on the july meeting,not the july meeting itself,in which hakes stated that different molecules other than natural insulin may offer better treatment of diabetes than natural insulin and that lispro was just one such example.none of this testimony directly states that dimarchi communicated to aradigm that the bioavailability of aerosolized insulin could be increased twofold by using lispro rather than natural insulin.evidence that dimarchi merely suggested that aradigm try lispro in its aerosol delivery devices is insufficient to support the jury verdict on claim by clear and convincing evidence.
the testimony of lilly roeder,who met with aradigm scientists in june of,is no more helpful to lilly.at most,roeder testimony shows that he too viewed lispro as a candidate for aerosolization,but damning to lilly,roeder explicitly testified that he did not mention that aerosolized lispro should be used to produce a relative bioavailability greater than twice that seen after inhalation of human insulin.
without any direct evidence of communication of conception,lilly relies largely on circumstantial evidence.lilly argues that there is no evidence in the record that aradigm was considering using lispro in an aerosol device prior to the july meeting,that emails and notes demonstrate aradigm interest,and that the january application for the patent proves aradigm firm grasp of the concept shortly thereafter.lilly argues that the jury inference that dimarchi communicated the idea at the july meeting of aerosolizing lispro rather than insulin to increase bioavailability twofold is therefore a permissible inference.we disagree.while circumstantial evidence may in some cases be sufficient to surmount the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof,we conclude that the circumstantial evidence presented here is insufficient and that the jury verdict can not stand.
assuming we were to find,as we have,that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury finding of clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate dimarchi inventive contribution to claim,lilly,too,argues that the jury instructions contain prejudicial error.lilly argues that it need only demonstrate that dimarchi contributed to the conception of claim by a preponderance of the evidence.under this less demanding trial court burden of proof,lilly proposes that the circumstantial evidence in the record is sufficient to support a jury verdict in its favor and that we must therefore remand for a new trial.see price symsek,t he erroneous burden of proof utilized by the the tribunal below worked against appellant interest,it was more difficult to overcome than the proper burden of proof.such a situation can not ordinarily be classified as harmless.we reject lilly argument that a preponderance of the evidence burden is the correct burden in this case.
lilly does not contend that,as a general rule,the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof announced in hess,see at,is incorrect.rather,lilly argues that its inventorship claim falls into an exception to the hess rule to which the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof applies.as a legal proposition,lilly proposes that the hess rule does not apply when there are two patent applications claiming the same subject matter in front of the patent and trademark office pto,one of which issues as the patent allegedly omitting the inventor,and the other of which was filed by the allegedly omitted inventor.as a factual proposition,lilly points to a patent application that it filed prior to the issuance of aradigm patent and alleges that its application claims the same subject matter as the claims of the patent at issue in this inventorship dispute.
doctrinally,lilly argument borrows from the burden of proof used in interference proceedings in which multiple parties claim that they deserve exclusive rights to an invention because they were the first to invent it.see i an interference is a proceeding to determine any question of patentability and priority of invention between two or more parties claiming the same patentable invention.emphasis omitted.to succeed in an interference proceeding,regardless of whether it is conducted in the pto or a district court under,a party that does not have the earliest effective filing date needs only to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it was the first to invent if the two patents or applications at issue were before the pto.see slip track.the general presumption of patent validity does not pertain to patent applications before they issue,so there is no presumption that the inventors on a patent application are correct when two claims in patent applications assert inherently conflicting rights to the same invention.see apotex usa,merck.provided the applications were,the timing of the interference proceeding is immaterial the presumption of validity is nonexistent and the preponderance of the evidence burden is appropriate even if both of the patents have issued by the time a section interference proceeding is initiated in a district court.however,the presumption of validity may effectively be implicated in the case of a priority contest between an issued patent and an application that was filed after the issuance of the patent.in such a situation,the junior party must establish priority of invention by clear and convincing evidence.id.
to make its burden of proof argument,lilly does not ask us to make an unprecedented analogical leap directly from a priority claim in an interference proceeding to a joint inventorship claim under section.lilly argues that our decision in environ products,furon,has already taken that step,or at least that it strongly counsels us to take that step now.we disagree on both counts.we conclude that environ products has not established a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof in section joint inventorship disputes when the person allegedly omitted from an issued patent had a patent application claiming the same subject matter as the issued patent.furthermore,we decline to extend the holding of environ products to create such a rule.
our environ products opinion addressed a complicated,infringement action.environ accused advanced polymer and furon of infringing its patent.both advanced polymer and furon raised invalidity defenses based on prior invention.advanced polymer relied on a pending patent application to establish priority,and furon based its defense on its issued patent.in addition,furon raised a defense of invalidity alleging incorrect inventorship on environ patent and filed a separate infringement action against environ that was consolidated with environ infringement action against furon.thus,at the end of the day,environ products involved a priority contest between two issued patents and a patent of which were pending before the pto at the same time.the parties stipulated that environ patent,furon patent,and advanced polymer application all claimed the same subject matter,and they agreed on the description of the common subject matter that would serve as the basis for determining who was the original inventor.id.at.
the district court put the inventorship issue to a jury in the form of a special verdict form.because environ patent had the earliest filing date,id.at,the special verdict form required advanced polymer and furon to provide clear and convincing evidence of priority of invention to prevail but only required environ to provide preponderant evidence of priority to prevail,id.at.the jury found environ to be the original inventor of the common subject matter.id.at.
on appeal,the federal circuit held that all parties in the priority contest should only have had to prove their claim to original inventorship by a preponderance of the evidence.the court held that the priority contest was essentially the functional equivalent of the priority phase of an interference proceeding involving patents whose applications had been before the pto 
the challenge to inventorship was raised as an invalidity defense to environ charge of infringement on this basis the district court accorded environ patent the statutory presumption of validity which requires that invalidity be established by clear and convincing evidence 
the case at bar differs from those in which the presumption of validity accorded a higher burden of proof to the challenged patent,however,in that the three competing claimants all had patent applications that were h ad these applications been the subject of an interference proceeding in the pto or a proceeding in the district court,the burden of proof of prior invention would be with the junior applicants,but the standard of proof would be the preponderance of the evidence.the formality of invoking does not affect the standard of proof of priority of invention between interfering patents,whether the issue arises as a defense in an infringement suit or in an action designated as under.the correct standard of proof of priority of invention,as between interfering patents,is the preponderance of the evidence,the junior patentee bearing the burden of pleading and proving priority.
environ products does not bind us here it did not involve a section claim for,and it expressly limited its holding to priority contests.see id.at noting that the holding relates solely to that of priority of invention of common claimed subject matter in issued patents and that it does not affect the standard of proof as to any other question that may be in dispute.
nor should environ products be extended on policy grounds to apply in actions seeking to establish joint inventorship.there are differences between using a application to prove prior invention and using it to prove joint invention,and these differences counsel against permitting a application to reduce the burden of proof in an action seeking to correct of an inventor.as discussed above,a claim to joint inventorship requires proof of some element of joint behavior,such as collaboration or working under common direction,one inventor seeing a relevant report and building upon it or hearing another suggestion at a meeting,at.the existence of applications does throw into question the presumption of validity for the patent insofar as the presumption involves an issue of timing or priority,namely that the patentee was the first to invent.apotex,at.the existence of applications,however,does not undermine to the same degree the presumption that each of the groups of inventors listed on the patent applications acted independently.the clear and convincing burden of proof is applied to joint inventorship disputes because of a strong temptation for persons who consulted with the inventor and provided him with materials and advice,to reconstruct,so as to further their own position,the extent of their contribution to the conception of the invention.hess,at.proof of contribution to conception can not rely entirely on the timing of conception the burden of demonstrating the required element of joint behavior,at,should remain unaffected by an alleged joint inventor patent application.
furthermore,a party seeking to correct is not required to risk any rights to any invention of its own,and it should not receive the benefit of a lower standard of proof without the accompanying risk.in an interference proceeding,or in a priority contest that is its functional equivalent as in environ products,the junior party places its own patent claims on the line and may lose its rights to those claims if it does not successfully demonstrate priority.in a section action alleging,however,the plaintiff does not have to put its patent assets at risk.
lilly argument that environ products should have controlled in the district court proceedings below is also tenuous because in environ products all the parties contesting priority agreed that their patents claimed the same subject matter.the first step of an interference proceeding is to determine whether two patents can and do claim the same subject matter priority can be adjudicated only after the common subject matter has been identified.see i an interference may be declared when the applications contain claims for the same patentable invention.see also fujikawa wattanasin,affirming the pto denial of a motion to declare an interference or to consider priority concerning a particular invention because one of the patent applications at issue did not describe,and therefore could not claim,the invention.
thus,even in a case seeking to determine priority rather than joint inventorship,there can be no functional equivalent of the priority phase of an interference proceeding as there was in environ products unless the parties agree to bypass judicial delineation of the conflicting subject matter.if no such agreement exists,a junior party with an issued patent that was at the pto must either bring a formal claim under section to determine if there is conflicting subject matter prior to the priority determination,or it must surmount the clear and convincing burden of proof to demonstrate priority.lilly and aradigm never agreed to the fact that lilly patent application claimed some of the same subject matter as is claimed in the patent,let alone to the definition of the invention claimed by both.we can not,therefore,treat lilly inventorship claim as the functional equivalent of the priority determination in an interference proceeding 
there was another forum in which lilly could have tried a priority claim with a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof.lilly knew of the patent while its application was pending.lilly could have sought to provoke an interference proceeding in the pto based on the by relying on the existing claim language in its application or by copying the claims of the patent provided those claims were supported by the it chose not to do so.as lilly elected not to provoke an interference proceeding in the pto,it hardly seems unfair to lilly to deny it the advantages that it would have enjoyed in such a pto proceeding.
environ products prevents form from triumphing over substance in priority contests embedded in infringement proceedings,provided that the parties have stipulated to a definition of the interfering subject matter.the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof that environ products establishes,however,is not applicable to lilly joint inventorship claim under section because that claim involves neither priority per se nor subject matter that has been determined to be interfering.
finally,we turn to that part of lilly appeal addressing the district court judgments.lilly first argument addresses the district court judgment entered on a contract claim.in,lilly and aradigm entered into an insulin supply agreement.under this agreement,lilly supplied regular insulin for aradigm use in studies investigating the pulmonary delivery of regular insulin.in return,aradigm agreed,inter alia,that a ll information provided to aradigm by lilly will be kept in confidence for at least ten years after execution of this agreement,unless lilly gives aradigm written permission to disclose it sooner,that d ata emanating from the studies will not be released by aradigm without lilly review and comment,and that lilly w
