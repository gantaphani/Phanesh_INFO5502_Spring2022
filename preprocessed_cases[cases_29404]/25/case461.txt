we conclude that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that barr product would not infringe the asserted claims of the and patents and that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying barr motion to amend for jmol of noninfringement of the and patents.however,we conclude that the district court invalidity determinations as to the asserted claims of the and patents were not in accordance with law.accordingly,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
alcon owns the and patents,which are directed to methods for enhancing the stability of prostaglandin compositions,including alcon glaucoma and ocular hypertension drug travatan z,which contains travoprost,the synthetic prostaglandin fluprostenol isopropyl ester.claim of the patent depends from claim of that patent and reads as follows 
a method of enhancing the chemical stability of an aqueous composition comprising a amount of a prostaglandin,wherein the method comprises adding a chemicallystabilizing amount of a polyethoxylated castor oil peco to the composition.
the method of claim wherein the composition is a topically administrable ophthalmic composition.

barr submitted abbreviated new drug application anda to the food and drug administration the fda,seeking approval to manufacture,use,and sell an ophthalmic travoprost solution as a generic version of travatan z.barr anda filing was second to that of par pharmaceuticals.alcon,d at.although the and patents are not listed as referenced to travatan z in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations publication commonly known as the orange book maintained by the fda,alcon initiated suit,asserting that barr anda submission constituted an act of infringement of claim of the patent,claim of the patent,and claims from four other patents,including its orange and patents.however,alcon did not assert its and patents at trial and neither party adduced any evidence that specifically related to those patents.barr stipulated that its generic product infringed the remaining two patents that alcon had asserted,patents and,and that those patents were not invalid.id 
following a markman hearing,the district court construed the claimed phrase enhancing the chemical stability to mean to increase or increasing the ability of the prostaglandin to resist chemical change as distinguished from merely increasing the physical stability of the prostaglandin or composition,reducing or decreasing travoprost degradation.id.at see also alcon research barr labs,wl,at.the court distinguished physical stability as referring to physical phenomena such as absorption,adsorption,and precipitation.id.
the court also construed the claim term prostaglandin to correspond to the disclosure in the written description of the patents regarding the prostaglandins that may be used with the invention.alcon,wl,at.the court thus determined the term prostaglandin to mean the natural compounds pge,pge,pge,pgf,pgf,pgf,pgd,and pgi prostacyclin,as well as analogues and derivatives of such natural compounds including the pharmaceutically acceptable esters and salts of such natural compounds and their analogues and derivatives,which have similar biological activities of either greater or lesser potencies.id.at.travoprost is a type pgf prostaglandin analog.
after a bench trial,the court found that barr anda product did not infringe either claim of the patent or claim of the patent because alcon failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that barr manufactured its generic travatan z product by a method that comprised adding a amount of peco to its composition.alcon,d at.the court noted that alcon did not test barr product and determined that alcon only evidence was an accelerated stability study conducted by alcon during its development work that compared several travoprost compositions with different amounts of peco.id.at.
the court found that table of alcon development study recorded data showing that some amount of travoprost was lost over an eight week test period,but the parties disputed the reason for that loss,physical instability versus chemical instability.id.at.the court nevertheless found that the results could be attributed to a number of factors other than peco enhancing the chemical stability of the travoprost,experimental error or uncertainty,adsorption,precipitation,or other physical loss and that,in any event,the tested formulations differ ed significantly from barr anda product.id.at.accordingly,in finding noninfringement,the court ultimately concluded that because variables such as ph,buffer,buffer concentration,preservatives,chelating agents,and other excipients can affect the chemical stability of prostaglandins in opthalmic formulations,as alcon conceded,the compositional differences between alcon solubility study formulations and barr anda product preclude d relying on the solubility study data to draw any reliable inferences with respect to the stability of barr anda product.id.at.
the court also held claim of the patent and claim of the patent invalid under,for lack of enablement and lack of an adequate written description.id.at.the court concluded that barr proved by clear and convincing evidence that one skilled in the art could neither carry out the full scope of the asserted claims without undue experimentation nor would have recognized that the inventors were in possession of the claimed invention at the time the patent applications were filed because i the claims were too broad ii the patent disclosure was too limited and iii the art of chemically stabilizing prostaglandins was too unpredictable.id.however,the court rejected barr asserted defenses that alcon claims were invalid for anticipation,obviousness,and indefiniteness.id.at.
barr then moved for jmol of noninfringement of alcon and patents,which the court denied,declin ing to make any findings or draw any conclusions about the infringement or validity of those patents because neither party presented any evidence on them and thus they were not actually litigated and adjudicated or fairly placed at issue during trial.id.at.barr subsequently filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e to amend the district court judgment and to enter jmol of noninfringement of those two patents on the ground that the court resolution of the matter in the first instance constituted a clear error of law that required correction in order to prevent manifest injustice.alcon,wl,at.
the court again denied barr motion.id.at.the court reasoned that,because barr had never filed a counterclaim,barr had no basis to assert that it was entitled to a declaratory judgment of noninfringement given that alcon lacked fair notice of the risk of such an adverse determination.id.at.the court held that the parties joint pretrial submissions reflected the parties understanding that the unasserted claims were no longer a part of the case.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that the pleadings should be conformed to the judgment,not vice versa.id.at quoting tol omatic,proma produkt und mktg.

discussion 
infringement is a question of fact that we review for clear error.amgen hoechst marion roussel.a factual finding is clearly erroneous when,despite some supporting evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court was in error.alza mylan.
alcon argues that the district court erred in finding that barr anda product did not infringe the asserted claims of alcon and patents because its testing of travoprost formulations containing the same peco in the same concentration as barr proposed generic product demonstrated that the peco added to barr composition enhances the stability of the prostaglandin.alcon contends that the district court findings are undermined by its purportedly improper credibility determinations regarding alcon experts and its consequent rejection of their testimony.barr responds that it does not infringe because alcon presented no evidence directly relating to whether barr anda product infringed the and patents and no evidence directly relating to whether peco enhances the chemical stability of any prostaglandin.
we agree with barr that alcon failed to present evidence of infringement.unlike a classic patent infringement case in which infringement exists if at least one claim of an asserted patent reads on a product or process that the accused infringer has introduced into the marketplace,an infringement inquiry provoked by an anda filing under the hatch waxman system pursuant to e a is focused on a comparison of the asserted patent against the product that is likely to be sold following anda approval.abbott labs.torpharm.that determination is based on consideration of all of the relevant evidence and,b ecause drug manufacturers are bound by strict statutory provisions to sell only those products that comport with the anda description of the drug,an anda specification defining a proposed generic drug in a manner that directly addresses the issue of infringement will control the infringement inquiry.see also sunovion,teva pharm.usa,bayer ag elan pharm.research,glaxo,novopharm.
in its attempt to prove that the addition of peco in barr proposed generic product would chemically stabilize the prostaglandin travoprost and thus infringe the asserted claims of the and patents,alcon relied solely on a theory that the data reported in table of a stability study that alcon conducted during its development work could be extrapolated to infer that the addition of peco would chemically stabilize travoprost in barr anda composition.the data in table of alcon report,which was styled as a soaking study to evaluate the compatibility of travoprost with polypropylene packaging materials,were generated by subjecting travoprost compositions to elevated temperatures and then analyzing them at regular intervals to measure the amount of travoprost remaining in the composition.at trial,both parties agreed that the data showed that travoprost was lost over time that is,less travoprost was present in the tested compositions at the end of eight weeks than had been present when the test began and that more travoprost remained in the compositions with peco at the end of eight weeks than in the composition that did not contain any peco.
critically,however,the district court found,and the parties do not dispute on appeal,that the composition of the generic product proposed in barr anda is significantly different from the compositions tested in alcon study.alcon,d at.the test formulations used by alcon to compile the data in table were maintained at ph and contained,inter alia,weight by volume of travoprost,varying concentrations of peco,the antimicrobial preservative benzalkonium chloride,and a buffer solution comprising tromethamine,boric acid,and mannitol.id.in contrast,the generic product proposed in barr anda is maintained at a different ph,is composed of weight by volume of travoprost and a buffered preservative system comprising propylene glycol,sorbitol,and zinc chloride,but does not contain benzalkonium chloride or a buffer solution.id.alcon itself admitted that variation in parameters including ph,preservatives,and buffers can have a substantial impact on the chemical stability of a prostaglandin in an ophthalmic formulation.id.at appellant br.the data in table therefore were not evidence that barr product,if and when approved,would infringe the asserted claims.
we thus conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the data in alcon table had no bearing on whether barr proposed generic product infringed alcon patents.the formulations tested in alcon stability study were meaningfully different from the product described in barr anda and thus provided no basis from which to draw any reliable inferences regarding whether the peco in barr composition would chemically stabilize the prostaglandin.see lucent,gateway,recognizing that overly speculative circumstantial evidence will not suffice to prove infringement.
we have considered alcon remaining arguments regarding the district court infringement analysis and find them unpersuasive.accordingly,we affirm the district court holding that alcon failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the generic product described in barr anda infringes either claim of alcon patent or claim of alcon patent.
section of the patent statute describes what must be contained in a patent specification.among other requirements,it must contain a written description of the invention,and of the manner and process of making and using it such as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,to make and use the same.thus,this statutory language mandates satisfaction of two separate and independent requirements an applicant must both describe the claimed invention adequately and enable its production and use.ariad,eli lilly,fed.cir en banc vas cath mahurkar.
furthermore,patents are presumed to be valid and overcoming this presumption requires clear and convincing evidence.microsoft,ariad,at.
whether a claim satisfies the enablement requirement of is a question of law that we review without deference,although the determination may be based on underlying factual findings,which we review for clear error.sitrick dreamworks,llc.
alcon argues that the district court erred in holding the asserted claims of the and patents invalid for lack of enablement because it only weighed the breadth of the claims against the detail of the patent disclosures.alcon contends that barr presented no evidence that any experimentation would be required for a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention as claimed.
barr responds that the patents provide very little guidance to one skilled in the art in the form of only three working examples and do not disclose any data for chemical stability.barr contends that the reported data relate only to physical stability,not prostaglandin degradation,and that the patents do not disclose how pecos work to chemically stabilize prostaglandins.barr further asserts that the technology at issue is highly unpredictable,particularly with regard to choice of ph,buffer,buffer concentration,preservatives,chelating agents,and other excipients.
we agree with alcon that the district court erred in its enablement analysis.to prove that a claim is invalid for lack of enablement,a challenger must show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not be able to practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation.in re wands,see also johns hopkins cellpro,i t is imperative when attempting to prove lack of enablement to show that one of ordinary skill in the art would be unable to practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation.emphasis omitted.after the challenger has put forward evidence that some experimentation is needed to practice the patented claim,the factors set forth in wands then provide the factual considerations that a court may consider when determining whether the amount of that experimentation is either undue or sufficiently routine such that an ordinarily skilled artisan would reasonably be expected to carry it out.wands,at.
the district court erred here because its enablement analysis did not address that determinative question barr failed to make the threshold showing that any experimentation is necessary to practice the claimed methods,to use peco to enhance the stability of a prostaglandin given the disclosures of alcon and patents.instead,the district court holding rested on its finding that the full scope of the claims was not enabled after applying the wands factors as if they were a generalized test for deciding whether a patent disclosure is sufficiently detailed to support a broad claim.alcon,d at.
the claimed methods comprise only a single step adding a amount of peco to the prostaglandin composition that barr own expert testified was routine.the claims as a whole merely require that the addition of peco to the composition provide some increase in chemical stability,but do not require a particular level of stability or a particular magnitude of increase.moreover,the patents disclose exemplary compositions within the scope of the claims,detail how those example compositions are prepared from ingredients,and provide procedures for adding peco to a prostaglandin composition in a way that embodies the claimed invention.patent patent.the patents also identify the various prostaglandins and pecos that can be used and a range of suitable concentrations for both components,including narrow preferred embodiments.patent patent.
in light of those disclosures,the district court nonenablement ruling was premised on testimony that many variables including the number of prostaglandins and the range of pecos encompassed by the claims,as well as v arious parameters including ph,buffer,buffer concentration,preservatives,chelating agents,and other excipients may affect the chemical stability of prostaglandins in ophthalmic formulations.alcon,d at emphasis added.indeed,barr expert observed that when you have a lot of variables on top of one another,the experimentation gets out of control quickly.id.at citing.but such an unsubstantiated conclusory statement is not sufficient.cephalon,watson,fed.cir.barr adduced no evidence at trial that changing any of the variables or v arious parameters identified by the district court would render alcon claimed invention inoperable,nor was there any evidence that experimenting with those variables was required for an ordinarily skilled artisan to be capable of increasing the chemical stability of a prostaglandin by adding peco.adjusting variables may be relevant to optimizing the stability of a given prostaglandin composition,but barr proffered no evidence that any experimentation,let alone undue experimentation,with those variables would be necessary in order to practice the claimed invention.without that evidence,there is no foundation for the district court nonenablement ruling.
furthermore,a patent does not need to guarantee that the invention works for a claim to be enabled.it is well settled that an invention may be patented before it is actually reduced to practice.pfaff wells.similarly,a patentee is not required to provide actual working examples we have rejected enablement challenges based on the theory that there can be no guarantee that prophetic examples actually work,as t he burden is on one challenging validity to show by clear and convincing evidence that the prophetic examples together with other parts of the specification are not enabling.atlas powder du pont de nemours.nor is it a requirement of patentability that an inventor correctly set forth,or even know,how or why the invention works.newman quigg,citing diamond rubber consol.rubber tire.thus,it is likewise irrelevant here,as a legal matter,whether the and patents contain data proving that pecos enhance the chemical stability of prostaglandins.
accordingly,because barr did not show that any claimed embodiments would be inoperable and that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been unable to practice the asserted claims without resorting to any experimentation,let alone undue experimentation,we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that barr proved its invalidity case based on nonenablement by clear and convincing evidence.barr had the burden of proof to show that alcon patents lacked enabling disclosures,but failed to carry that burden.we therefore reverse the district court judgment that claim of the patent and claim of the patent are invalid for lack of enablement.
whether a claim satisfies the written description requirement is a question of fact that,on appeal from a bench trial,we review for clear error.ariad,at.however,the district court interpretation of precedent regarding the written description requirement is reviewed without deference.amgen,at.
alcon argues that the district court erred in holding the asserted claims of the and patents invalid for lack of an adequate written description because the patent specifications sufficiently describe the invention and a variety of the embodiments that the inventor envisaged.alcon contends that there was no evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have recognized or understood that the inventor possessed the claimed invention.
barr responds that the claims flunk the written description requirement because they encompass a method for enhancing the chemical stability of innumerable prostaglandins by adding to them peco in an endless number of combinations and concentrations and therefore are not precise and overreach the scope of the patent disclosures.appellant br.barr contends that the specifications only disclose physical data from one compound to support the proposition that peco enhances the chemical stability of all prostaglandins,but that they do not disclose any data on chemical stability,prostaglandin degradation products,or prostaglandin degradation pathways.
we agree with alcon that the specifications provide an adequate written description of the claimed invention.t he hallmark of written description is disclosure.ariad,at.the standard for satisfying the written description requirement is whether the disclosure allow s one skilled in the art to visualize or recognize the identity of the subject matter purportedly described.enzo biochem,gen probe.there is no requirement that the disclosure contain either examples or an actual reduction to practice rather,the critical inquiry is whether the patentee has provided a description that in a definite way identifies the claimed invention in sufficient detail that a person of ordinary skill would understand that the inventor was in possession of it at the time of filing.ariad,at,koito turn key,llc.that assessment requires an objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification.ariad,at.
the patent details the claimed invention and provides a description of how a person of ordinary skill in the art may use it.it discloses the unexpected discover y that the use of polyethoxylated castor oils in pharmaceutical compositions,especially those topically applied to the eye,enhances the chemical stability of prostaglandins.patent ll.it provides exemplary formulations that embody the claimed invention,reciting concentrations of every ingredient.id.ll.it also discloses data generated by the inventor from accelerated stability testing showing the effect of peco and prostaglandin concentration on stability and comparing the effect of peco to that of a more commonly used surfactant,polysorbate.id,ll,ll.the patent also describes various classes of prostaglandins to which the invention was understood to relate,which are covered by the term prostaglandin under the district court construction of that term,as well as preferred concentrations and specifically preferred examples of those prostaglandins.id.it describes various types of pecos that may be used in the invention,again with preferred types and concentrations.id.ll.and the patent describes the various formulation parameters,including osmolality and ph,that may be selected when practicing the invention.id.ll.
