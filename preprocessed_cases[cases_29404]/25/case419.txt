this appeal involves an action brought by amgen and amgen manufacturing limited collectively amgen against apotex and apotex collectively apotex under the biologics price competition and innovation act of biologics act or bpcia.apotex has an application pending with the food and drug administration,filed under the biologics act,that seeks permission to begin marketing a product allegedly biosimilar to amgen neulasta.for such an applicant,the biologics act lays out a process for exchanging information and channeling litigation about patents relevant to the application.apotex and amgen proceeded several steps into that process,leading to the present suit in which amgen alleges that apotex proposed marketing would infringe an amgen patent.
this appeal,however,does not involve the merits of the infringement allegations.rather,it involves amgen motion for a preliminary injunction concerning what will happen if and when the fda licenses apotex proposed biosimilar product.amgen sought a preliminary injunction to enforce a provision of the biologics act that requires a applicant to give notice days before commercially marketing its product,l a.we held in amgen sandoz,fed.cir,among other things,that the period runs from notice.here,the district court,agreeing with amgen,preliminarily enjoined apotex from entering the market unless it has given amgen notice after receiving the requested fda license and then waited days.
we affirm.in amgen sandoz,we held that the provision is mandatory,with the period beginning only upon notice,and that an injunction was proper to enforce the provision against sandoz,a applicant that had entirely skipped the statutory process of information exchange and channeling.apotex argues that a different result is required here that the provision is not mandatory and may not be enforced by an injunction because it,unlike sandoz,did launch the statutory process for exchanging patent information and channeling patent litigation.we reject the asserted distinction.we hold that the provision is mandatory and enforceable by injunction even for an applicant in apotex position.
background 
amgen markets neulasta,whose active ingredient is pegfilgrastim,a protein that,in patients undergoing chemotherapy,can stimulate the production of neutrophils a type of white blood cell and thereby decrease the incidence of infection.amgen received a biologics license from the fda for neulasta in pursuant to a.in,apotex filed an application for an fda license to market a biosimilar version of neulasta,invoking the abbreviated pathway for regulatory approval of biological products that are highly similar to a previously approved product reference product,as described in amgen sandoz,at.congress created that route to fda licensure in the biologics act in.pub,stat,codified as amended at,e,b,et.apotex application is pending.
when amgen obtained its license,it had to show that its biological product,neulasta,was safe,pure,and potent.a c i i.the biologics act authorizes enterprises like apotex to gain approval,after a time,for a product sufficiently similar to the reference product,without repeating all of the work of the pioneer,the reference product sponsor defined at id.l a.under k,an applicant may obtain a license by demonstrating,among other things,that its product is biosimilar to a reference product.in so doing,it may use publicly available information about the reference product safety,purity,and potency to support its application.id.k a i,iii.for the purpose of balancing innovation and consumer interests,pub,b,stat.at,congress prescribed that a application under k may not be submitted until four years after the reference product was first licensed under a and that a license may not be made effective until twelve years after the reference product was first licensed.k a,b.
of particular relevance here,the biologics act contains a detailed,subsection,l,that is focused in various ways on potential patent disputes between the reference product sponsor and applicant.that subsection by its terms provides for two stages of litigation one under paragraph,the other under paragraph.in this opinion,we will often refer to paragraphs and subparagraphs within that subsection without repeating the l unless otherwise made clear,any such references are to that subsection.we also will usually call the k applicant simply the applicant.
the l provisions of principal present significance are as follows.under a,within days after the fda notifies the applicant that its application has been accepted for review,the applicant is to give notice to the reference product sponsor by providing the application as well as information describing the manufacturing process.l a.under a,within days of receiving that notice,the reference product sponsor is to provide a list of patents that could reasonably be asserted against the applicant and specify which it would be prepared to license to the applicant.l a.under b,within days after receiving that list,the applicant is to respond with a detailed statement identifying why each patent on the reference product sponsor list is invalid,unenforceable,or not infringed,or declaring that it does not intend to commercially market the biosimilar product before a particular patent expires,and also addressing the reference product sponsor statement of readiness to license.l b ii,iii.the applicant,in its response,may also provide its own list of patents that it believes could reasonably be asserted against it.l b i.under c,then,within days of receiving the applicant b response,the reference product sponsor is to provide a detailed reply regarding those patents on its a list as to which the applicant has asserted,invalidity,or unenforceability.l c.
while the reference product sponsor may later supplement its a list under paragraph,it is the original lists under that form the basis of the next steps in the process leading to immediate litigation under paragraph.those steps begin with paragraph,which requires that the reference product sponsor and the applicant enter into negotiations over which of the patents listed under will be the subject of an immediate action.l a.if the parties reach agreement,a provides that the reference product sponsor must bring an action for infringement on all such patents within days.l a see e c i.the applicant must then notify the fda.l c.
if the parties do not reach agreement within days of starting their negotiation,b directs the parties to paragraph for the process that determines the scope of immediate litigation.l b.that process gives the applicant a ability,based on an exchange of lists of patents to be litigated.the applicant tells the reference product sponsor how many patents will be on the applicant list that number caps how many patents the reference product sponsor may list,except that if the applicant lists none,the reference product sponsor may list one and the two sides exchange lists.l.within days,under b,the reference product sponsor must sue for infringement on precisely those patents that appear on the combined lists.l b.and the applicant must notify the fda.l c.notably,the immediate litigation is limited to a single patent if the applicant lists no patents,no matter how many patents the reference product sponsor designated in a as reasonably assertable against the making,selling,of the proposed biosimilar product.l b ii ii.
given the deadlines set in l,and the time commonly taken for fda review,we may assume that the early litigation under paragraph will be initiated before the fda licenses the applicant biosimilar product.but the biologics act having provided for a narrowing of the scope of the paragraph litigation,including by allowing the applicant to exclude potentially meritorious patents from that litigation provides,in paragraph,for a second stage of patent litigation.
paragraph does so by first requiring,in a,that the applicant give the reference product sponsor notice at least days before commercially marketing its licensed product.l a.we held in amgen sandoz that the notice starting the clock must follow,not precede,the licensure.at.b then declares that,after receiving the a notice but before the applicant commercial marketing begins,the reference product sponsor may seek a preliminary injunction based on any patent within either of two classes.the first class,expressly described in b,consists of the patents that appeared on any of the original paragraph lists,minus patents that were the subject of paragraph litigation by agreement under or by the narrowing process under.l b.the second class consists of certain patents that were issued to or exclusively licensed by the reference product sponsor after it gave the applicant its a list.as to those patents,paragraph prescribes an information exchange and states that they shall be subject to paragraph,l which evidently means that patents within are to be treated as falling under b.for this litigation,c requires that the parties reasonably cooperate to expedite new discovery needed in connection with the motion.l c.
paragraph of l reinforces the channeling of litigation and provides incentives for the applicant to proceed in those channels.it does so by addressing when actions are or are not available in certain circumstances in c,as to applicants that simply bypass the process of information exchange that begins with a and in a and b,as to applicants that begin but do not complete the process.
c addresses an applicant that does not even provide the notice under a.for such an applicant,the reference product sponsor,but not the applicant,may bring an action under for a declaratory judgment of infringement,validity,or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.l c.the subject of such action is not limited by reference to any patent lists.
a and b together address an applicant that does provide the a notice.a protects the litigation scheme under paragraphs and it declares that neither side may bring a action relating to any patent described in b for the litigation until after the notice of commercial marketing under a is received.l a then,b reinforces the applicant incentives to complete the orderly process it specifies that the a bar on actions is lifted for the reference product sponsor,but not for the applicant,if an applicant that has given the a notice fails to complete an action required of the applicant at specified steps past the a step.the specified applicant duties are those prescribed by paragraph b ii responding to the reference product sponsor a list by paragraph furnishing lists defining the litigation in the absence of agreement by paragraph c i notifying the fda of the litigation by paragraph responding to the reference product sponsor update of its a list and by paragraph a providing a notice before commercial marketing of the licensed product.a failure of the applicant at any of those stages lifts the a bar on the reference product sponsor,allowing it to bring a action on any patent on its a list as supplemented under.l b.
besides setting out the foregoing regime,the biologics act amended the infringement provision of the patent act,in a way that is tied to that regime.see pub,c,stat.at.as amended,e provides that,in two circumstances,it is an act of infringement for a person to submit an application seeking approval of a biological product if the purpose is to obtain approval to engage in the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of a biological product claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.e c i,ii.the two circumstances involve,respectively,an applicant that has launched the biologics act process we have described and an applicant that has not.
specifically,one circumstance is when the patent is identified in the list of patents described in paragraph,including as provided under paragraph,of the biologics act patent provisions described above.e c i.filing the biosimilar application is an act of infringement of patents that the reference product sponsor has listed through the biologics act prescribed processes,which occurs only when the applicant has provided the a notice.the other circumstance involves an applicant that fails to provide the application and information required under a.in that case,filing the biosimilar application is an act of infringement as to a patent that could be identified pursuant to a,a patent that the reference product sponsor could identify as one it believes could reasonably be asserted with respect to the biosimilar product at issue.e c ii.
e addresses remedies for such infringements.subparagraphs b and c authorize injunctions and damages,and subparagraph d states that the court shall order a permanent injunction against infringement of a patent in certain cases decided in the biologics act paragraph litigation.e d.section e adds that those remedies are the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement described in paragraph,except for attorney fees.e.
e,however,then limits the remedies in two ways evidently designed to reinforce the reference product sponsor incentives to follow the distinctive biologics act patent process where the applicant has launched that process.first if the reference product sponsor is late in bringing the infringement action under l paragraph,does so more than days after the scope of that litigation has been determined under or,the only remedy the reference product sponsor can get in that action is a reasonable royalty.e a,b second if a patent that the reference product sponsor should have included on its a list or its supplement was not timely included,then the owner of that patent may not sue for infringement under with respect to the biological product at issue.e c.
in october,apotex filed a biologics license application with the fda under k,listing amgen neulasta as the reference product,and the fda accepted apotex application for review on december.on december,apotex provided amgen a copy of the application and information detailing apotex pegfilgrastim manufacturing process,complying with l paragraph a.amgen provided apotex its a list on february,identifying three patents,and apotex provided its b response on april.in that response,apotex certified that it did not intend to begin commercial marketing before two of the patents had expired and,as to the remaining patent,described bases for asserting and invalidity.the same day,apotex sent a letter to amgen stating that it was thereby providing notice of future commercial marketing pursuant to a,though apotex lacked as it still lacks an fda license.on june,amgen furnished apotex its c reply regarding validity and infringement.the parties then negotiated under and agreed to an immediate action under a for infringement of the two patents amgen filed that action on august,and when one of the patents expired in october,that action became about only one patent,patent.
just before that action was filed,this court decided amgen sandoz.the court held first that a applicant can not be compelled to provide notice of fda review under a and that an infringement suit under e is the reference product sponsor remedy if the applicant does not provide such notice.the court stressed that e c ii declares precisely that conduct filing an application and failing to give the a notice to constitute an infringement of a patent that could have been listed under a and that e declares the monetary and injunctive remedies in a suit for that infringement to be the exclusive remedies for that conduct.at.
the court next addressed the a requirement of a notice of commercial marketing.the court held that the a notice must be a notice given after fda licensure of the biosimilar product,not before,and that notices are of no legal effect for purposes of a.id.at.it explained that the statutory period runs from licensure,at which time the product,its therapeutic uses,and its manufacturing processes are fixed by licensure.id.the purpose,the court explained,is to provide a defined statutory window during which the court and the parties can fairly assess the parties rights prior to the launch of the biosimilar product,the alternative being a rush in about requesting or issuing a preliminary injunction.see id.at the purpose of a is clear requiring notice of commercial marketing be given to allow the reference product sponsor a period of time to assess and act upon its patent rights.
the court then concluded that a is mandatory a question exists concerning whether the shall provision in a is mandatory.we conclude that it is.id.at.the court added that a is a standalone notice provision,not dependent on the earlier provisions.id.at.and for the case before it,involving an applicant sandoz that did not provide notice of fda review under a,and hence did not come under b,there could be no basis for finding the action referred to in b to be the exclusive remedy for an a violation.id.on that basis,the court held it appropriate to enjoin commercial marketing until days after the notice.id.at.
in the present case,amgen filed a motion in october asking the district court to issue a preliminary injunction that would require apotex to provide an a notice if and when it receives a license and to delay any commercial marketing for days from that notice.the parties stipulated that amgen will be irreparably harmed if apotex enters the market without giving the requested days notice,the balance of the hardships favors amgen,and the public interest favors the issuance of an injunction.the decision whether to grant the motion,therefore,turned on amgen likelihood of success on the legal question presented whether the a notice requirement is a mandatory one enforceable by injunction as to an applicant such as apotex that,unlike sandoz in amgen sandoz,gave the a notice to launch the process leading to the paragraph infringement suit.notably,there is no dispute that apotex april notice is of no effect under a as construed in amgen sandoz.
the district court agreed with amgen and granted a preliminary injunction.the court noted that t he bpcia is intended to provide an orderly process for evaluating patent claims in the context of biosimilar products.in particular,the a requirement provides a defined statutory window during which the court and the parties can fairly assess the parties rights prior to the launch of the biosimilar product.id.quoting amgen sandoz,at.the court concluded that defined statutory window exists for all biosimilar products that obtain fda licenses,regardless of whether the subsection k applicant complies with l.id.the court disagreed with apotex contention that this conclusion should be rejected in order to avoid adding days to k exclusivity period for reference product sponsors.the court also disagreed with apotex contention that paragraph establishes that the exclusive remedy for failure to provide the a notice of commercial marketing is a declaratory judgment on the merits of the patents at issue,no matter how rushed the litigation of those issues might be without the days notice.id.
apotex appeals the district court grant of a preliminary injunction.we have jurisdiction under a and c.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,which may be established when a district court decision is based on an error of law.endo pharm.actavis,fed.cir.commodity futures trading comm hunter wise commodities,llc,cir.here,the district court grant of an injunction rested on its interpretation of a statute,a question of law we review de novo.apotex,fed.cir.we agree with the district court that apotex gave a a notice provides only a factual distinction,not a legally material distinction,between its situation and that of sandoz in amgen sandoz.the a requirement of days notice before commercial marketing,we conclude,is a mandatory one enforceable by injunction whether or not a a notice was given.
paragraph a provides that t he subsection k applicant shall provide notice to the reference product sponsor not later than days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsection k.l a emphasis added.the word shall generally indicates that the directive is mandatory.see ass of home builders defs.of wildlife,lopez davis,lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach.we ruled in amgen sandoz that this language is,indeed,mandatory,and we did not say that it was mandatory only in no a notice circumstances.at.
the language of a is categorical in the sense relevant here.it contains no words that make the applicability of its notice rule turn on whether the applicant took the earlier step of giving the a notice that begins the l process.and in amgen sandoz we stated that a was a standalone notice provision not dependent on the processes that begin with a.id.at.
there also is no other statutory language that effectively compels a treatment of a as,contrary to the usual meaning of its shall terms.in this respect,a differs materially from a.for a,as this court explained in amgen sandoz,the language of e forces a shall not to be a term of enforceable compulsory obligation.section e c ii declares to be an act of infringement the filing of a application coupled to a failure to give the a notice,and e declares that the infringement suit,with specified damages and injunctive relief,is the exclusive remedy for that combination.compelling the applicant to provide the a notice would go beyond that remedy,thus contradicting the congressional command that the infringement remedies of e are the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement described in e.amgen sandoz,at quoting e emphasis added by amgen sandoz.for a,in contrast,as amgen sandoz necessarily recognized in finding it mandatory,there is no comparable textual source of a contradiction that would be created by following the usual interpretation.
amgen sandoz likewise disposes of apotex argument that giving a its plain meaning would effectively extend,by six months,the exclusivity period given to a reference product sponsor by k.see at.notably,k by its terms establishes the date only as an earliest date,not a latest date,on which a biosimilar license can take effect.even when entry is delayed under a to what amounts to years plus days after the reference product sponsor licensure,the result is consistent with k.
moreover,it is implicit in the biologics act that any such delay beyond years should occur less and less as time goes by.doubtless,there will be some exclusivity periods beyond years in the early years of the biologics act,as biosimilars are introduced for reference products licensed well before the act was adopted in.but as time passes,more and more of the reference products will be newer,and a applicant,entitled to file an application a mere four years after licensure of the reference product,k b,can seek approval long before the exclusivity period is up.see amgen sandoz,at the extra days will not likely be the usual case,as applications will often be filed during the exclusivity period.in such circumstances,we have been pointed to no reason that the fda may not issue a license before the mark and deem the license to take effect on the date a possibility suggested by k a language about when the fda approval may be made effective.and we read a as allowing the notice of commercial marketing to be sent as soon as the license issues,even if it is not yet effective,because it is at the time of the license that the product,its therapeutic uses,and its manufacturing processes are fixed.id.at.
in any event,the established and evident purpose of a covers applicants that file a notices as well as those that do not.as this court explained in amgen sandoz,the purpose is to ensure that,starting from when the applicant product,uses,and processes are fixed by the license,the necessary regarding further patent litigation is not conducted under time pressure that will impair its fairness and accuracy.id.at.at the least,the reference product sponsor needs time to make a decision about seeking relief based on litigated patents,and a district court needs time for litigants to prepare their cases,in a complicated area,to provide a reliable basis for judgment.while that may not be true in every single case,congress clearly made a categorical judgment in a as it did elsewhere in the biologics act and we have explained that the statute must be interpreted as it is e
