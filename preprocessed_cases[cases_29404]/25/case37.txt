one unhappy named plaintiff appeals from an order approving a million class action settlement in one multidistrict litigation,in which class members allege that astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp astrazeneca published artificially inflated prescription drug prices.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,mdl,civ,wl,order approving final settlement in re pharm.final settlement approval.the settlement is between astrazeneca and a class of consumer plaintiffs who claimed they overpaid medicare because astrazeneca inflated the price of zoladex.
joyce howe,one of the class representatives for the astrazeneca consumer subclass,appeals.the other astrazeneca subclass representative,leroy townsend,asks us to uphold the settlement.howe argues that the settlement must be rejected on the grounds that it creates a cy pres fund of up to million rather than distributing all recovery to class members that the settlement is not fair,reasonable,and adequate because its method for calculating and distributing class members damages is flawed and that the parties allegedly improperly negotiated fees simultaneously with the settlement.howe failed to raise the last argument before final approval of the settlement.
howe also argues to us two procedural objections she did not make in the district court.howe contends the district court order approving the settlement,which expanded the settlement class,did not sufficiently define the new class and its claims as required by rule c b.howe also argues that the district court did not properly reappoint class counsel under rule g,see.g,when approving the expanded settlement class.
the cy pres and rule c b issues are ones of first impression for this court.we find howe challenges meritless and affirm the district court,which handled this matter with great sensitivity and care.
this appeal is in one case of a series of class actions alleging pharmaceutical companies fraudulently inflated a figure known as the average wholesale price awp between and to boost sales this court has already decided other appeals from these multidistrict litigations and related cases.see in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,cir in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,cir ass of chain drug stores new england carpenters benefits fund,cir ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir.
the healthcare industry treated the awp,which pharmaceutical companies,as the sticker price for drugs.insurers used awps to decide how much to reimburse providers when patients obtained drugs,which in turn affected patients.most of the drugs involved in these litigations are expensive drugs for serious illnesses,including cancer.the drug involved in this appeal,zoladex,is commonly used to treat prostate cancer.consequently,medicare,insurers,and patients allegedly overpaid by many millions of dollars for critical treatments based on manipulated awps.
a coalition of citizen,healthcare,senior citizen,and consumer advocacy groups sued dozens of drug manufacturers and companies in the district court for the district of massachusetts on december.similar lawsuits were filed across the country,and on april,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the lawsuits and assigned the case to the district court for the district of massachusetts.in re immunex.average wholesale price,d.
the district court ultimately divided the multidistrict litigation into two tracks,a fast track track one and a normal track track two.track one included three classes.one of the,called the medicare part b of patients covered by medicare part b who made for these drugs.a subclass of class,which sued astrazeneca for inflating the price of zoladex,is involved in this appeal.
the medicare part b class alleged that the defendants violated state consumer protection statutes by artificially inflating awps.between and,medicare part b reimbursements were based on published awps under federal law medicare covered percent of this cost,requiring patients to make a percent.
most patients had supplemental insurance that covered some but not all of this.those who had supplemental coverage for the full were excluded from the class.most class members had medigap insurance that covered percent of the percent leaving patients to pay percent of the percent medicare.thus patients in the class were differently affected depending on whether they had supplemental insurance and how much of the that insurance covered.
on august,the district court denied some proposed classes and deferred certifying the medicare part b class until the plaintiffs located individuals to act as class representatives.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,order partially denying and partially deferring class certification in re pharm.preliminary class certification the court issued the order after carefully analyzing whether the medicare part b class,as well as all proposed track one classes,met the requirements for class certification under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.id.at.the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in october that reflected the court instructions.
the district court certified the medicare part b class under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on january.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,order granting and denying class certification in re pharm.class certification.it defined the class as a ll natural persons nationwide who made,or who incurred an obligation enforceable at the time of judgment to make,a based on awp for a medicare part b covered subject drug that was manufactured by the defendants,including astrazeneca,between january,and january.id.at footnote omitted.the court excluded residents in nine states whose statutes did not create a cause of action,unlike the law in states whose residents were certified as class members.id.at.it certified class counsel under rule g.id.at.
the court divided the plaintiffs into four subclasses according to which defendant had distributed the subject drugs to them.id.at.the court certified howe and townsend as subclass representatives for the class members suing astrazeneca.id.
after months of intense litigation and negotiation,astrazeneca and the zoladex subclass reached a final settlement in may,on the eve of trial that settlement is at issue in this appeal.the plaintiffs expert had calculated the class damages were.in the settlement,astrazeneca agreed to pay million in total compensation to all class members or,for deceased class members,to their spouses or the legal representatives of their estates.in an effort to achieve a comprehensive settlement,the parties also agreed astrazeneca would pay the consumers from nine states who had previously been excluded from the class.if the amount of submitted claims exceeded million,class members recovery would be reduced proportionally.
astrazeneca also promised to pay all costs of distributing this money as well as million in attorneys fees and costs,representing about of the settlement amount.the parties agreed astrazeneca would pay fees and costs separately and not deduct that from the class members million recovery.
the parties expected a large portion of the total sum astrazeneca was willing to pay would go unclaimed.because zoladex is used to treat prostate cancer,many class members were elderly,had died,or could die soon,and not all of them could be found.the parties addressed this issue through two mechanisms.
first,rather than paying the money up front into a fund that would distribute money to class members,astrazeneca agreed to pay class members only on a comparatively easy basis.class members only had to submit relatively minimal proof of when they took zoladex.then,based on a formula created by the plaintiffs expert,class members would receive compensation for double their actual losses.because the formula tried to calculate actual losses,it calculated the damages of class members who had supplemental insurance were percent of their percent medicare,based on the average medigap coverage that class members had.
second,the parties agreed to create a fund,called a cy pres fund,that would pay any amount remaining after payout to the claimants of the million to mutually acceptable charitable organizations funding cancer research or patient care that the court would approve in the future.the parties capped the cy pres amount at million if not all of the million was paid out.
the parties submitted this agreement to the district court for preliminary approval on may.howe quickly objected to the proposed settlement.she then raised six concerns but did not repeat all of them later in the settlement process.those concerns were the settlement changed the composition of the class,the settlement compensated members on a basis rather than sending class members a check for their share of the class damages,the cy pres fund unfairly deprived class members of recovery,the loss formula should not have reduced payments to those with supplemental insurance and also failed to calculate different coverage levels among those with supplemental insurance,the settlement exposed class members to having other classes subrogate their claims,and the settlement was tainted because the parties negotiated it and attorneys fees simultaneously.
the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,d order preliminarily approving settlement in re pharm.preliminary settlement approval.in the preliminary approval the court certified an expanded class that included the residents in nine states who were previously excluded,finding the class satisfied all requirements in rules a and b.id.at.the court again certified class counsel under rule g.id.at.
in the parties sought final approval of the proposed settlement.the morning of the fairness hearing,may,howe filed a reply brief objecting to the settlement.she again argued that class members,not a cy pres fund,should receive the entire settlement amount the process and loss formula were flawed and the settlement risked subrogation of the plaintiffs claims.howe proposed adopting the settlement distribution method used in one track two settlement.she argued astrazeneca should use a center for medicare and medicaid services cms database containing information about medicare reimbursements to mail all class members a check for their equal share of the total amount class members overpaid,regardless of whether they had supplemental insurance.she also contended the attorneys fees were excessive.
although howe reply brief was tardy and its arguments were arguably waived,the district court considered each objection at the fairness hearing the court found million was a reasonable settlement.class counsel reported that they expected million of the million settlement to go unclaimed.under the proposed settlement,up to million of those leftover funds would be distributed through cy the district judge agreed with howe that more money should go to the plaintiffs rather than to the cy pres fund.she instructed the parties that the settlement should pay treble damages to those plaintiffs who had the strongest claims because they obtained zoladex in the heartland period and should correspondingly reduce the cy pres fund.
the court reserved deciding the attorneys fees issue and rejected howe other arguments.the district judge agreed with class counsel that no subrogation issue existed.the court additionally accepted class counsel justification for calculating damages for class members with supplemental insurance based on the average medigap coverage,even if some members insurance covered less than percent of the medicare.class counsel reported that howe attorney had identified no plaintiff other than howe who had different supplemental coverage,the plaintiffs expert had reaffirmed that percent coverage fairly approximated the class supplemental insurance,and those few with different coverage would still be compensated beyond their losses.
class counsel also explained,and the district court accepted,why howe proposal to mail equal checks to all class members was inappropriate.first,the cms database did not reveal whether individuals had supplemental insurance.because those with full supplemental insurance were excluded from the class,howe method would have the detriments of compensating members,overcompensating those with supplemental insurance,and undercompensating those without it.by failing to consider individual damages,howe approach actually would dramatically reduce individual payouts second,unlike in this track one case,it was prohibitively difficult for the parties in the track two settlement to calculate plaintiffs individual damages.those cases involved many drugs that people took at a variety of dosages over varying periods.zoladex,by contrast,is taken at regular dosages at regular intervals.with information about when a plaintiff started zoladex and whether the plaintiff had supplemental insurance,it was easy to calculate a zoladex plaintiff actual damages.
the parties amended the proposed settlement agreement to address the court instruction to increase the payout to class members.the amended agreement continued to provide that all class members would receive double their damages.but the new agreement no longer simply gave leftover money to charity.after all claimants were paid double damages,all heartland plaintiffs would receive treble damages pro rata.then leftover money would be paid to charity through cy like the original cy pres payout,the parties capped the additional treble damages and cy pres distribution at million.
on october,the district court approved the amended settlement,subject to two further qualifications.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,mdl,civ,order partially approving settlement in re pharm.partial settlement approval.first,the court instructed the parties to adjust the settlement to pay heartland plaintiffs treble damages,then,if money remained,to pay treble damages to all class members pro rata.if money was still left over,the parties agreed the remaining money would be distributed to charity through cy id.at.second,it reduced the attorneys fees to percent of the recovery.id.at.the district court discussed and rejected howe other concerns.id.at.
the parties once more amended the settlement agreement to reflect the court instructions.they again limited the total payout of treble damages to all class members and remaining money to charity through cy pres to million.the plaintiffs expert predicted in february that,even with treble damages,class members would claim only about million,leaving about million of the million settlement left over for charity.
it is this amended settlement that the district court approved on december,as a fair,adequate,and reasonable product of extensive arm length negotiations.in re pharm.final settlement approval,mdl,civ,at.incorporating its prior orders dated august,and january,the district court found the settlement class satisfied the requirements of rules a and b.id.at.
the court again addressed howe objections and rejected them.it found howe proposal that class members should all receive a check rather than submit a claim was unreasonable because that approach would ultimately reduce the amount all class members received.id.at.the court also rejected howe contention that the damages formula unfairly reduced recovery for class members with supplemental insurance.the reduction in the settlement better reflected class members real damages,and all members would receive more than their losses regardless.id.at.the court similarly held howe argument that the formula unfairly calculated all reductions based on the percent average supplemental coverage rather than based on individuals insurance policies was meritless because the number of affected class members was small and because those with less coverage would receive more than their damages.id.at.the district court rejected howe other objections.id.

on appeal howe argues the settlement is unreasonable because it creates a cy pres fund,the agreement claims process and formula for calculating loss are inappropriate,and the parties allegedly discussed settlement and attorneys fees together.howe also claims that the court final approval order did not satisfy the requirements of rule c b to define the expanded class and its claims and that the court did not properly certify class counsel under rule g when approving the settlement.the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting these arguments.
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding the settlement provision creating a cy pres fund was fair,adequate,and reasonable 
appellate courts review a district court conclusion that a settlement agreeing to a cy pres distribution is reasonable for abuse of discretion,in re airline ticket comm antitrust,cir wilson sw.airlines,cir.howe raises two challenges to the cy pres distribution in this settlement that the class members are entitled to any surplus settlement money and that class counsel had a conflict of interest when negotiating the cy pres distribution.we find no abuse of discretion.
the cy pres distribution 
this circuit has not had occasion to consider whether settlement agreements in class actions may establish cy pres funds.other circuits have approved agreements that provide for cy pres funds,particularly those negotiated at arm length by the parties.see conte newberg,newberg on class action,at ed.
a cy pres distribution results from application of a legal doctrine that courts have imported into class actions from trusts and estates law.in trusts and estates law,cy pres,taken from the norman french expression cy pres comme possible as near as possible,save s testamentary gifts that otherwise would fail because their intended use is no longer possible.in re airline ticket comm n,at.courts permit the gift to be used for another purpose as close as possible to the gift intended purpose.id.
in class actions,courts have approved creating cy pres funds,to be used for a charitable purpose related to the class plaintiffs injury,when it is difficult for all class members to receive individual shares of the recovery and,as a result,some or all of the recovery remains.conte newberg,supra.the use of a cy pres fund sometimes prevent s the defendant from walking away from the litigation without paying a full recovery because of practical obstacles to individual distribution.mirfasihi fleet mortgage,cir see also conte newberg,supra,at t he cy pres distributions serve the objectives of compensation for the class albeit in an indirect manner,access to judicial relief for small claims,and deterrence of illegal behavior.
cy pres distributions,as opposed to settlements using cy pres,are controversial.see democratic cent.comm.of washington metro.area transit comm n,conte newberg,supra,at id,at.but courts are not in disagreement that cy pres distributions are proper in connection with a class settlement,subject to court approval of the particular application of the funds.conte newberg,supra,at.because this case involves a settlement,we need not reach the questions raised by cy pres funds.
courts have approved cy pres funds in settlements in at least two circumstances.id.first,cy pres settlement funds have been approved when it is economically infeasible to distribute money to class members.see,mirfasihi,at rejecting a settlement because it was feasible to compensate class members individually molski gleich,cir same.distribution of all funds to the class can be infeasible,for example,when class members can not be identified,when the class changes constantly,or when class members individual substantial in the too small to justify the expense of sending recovery to individuals.mirfasihi,at powell,cir conte newberg,supra,at.in these cases,some courts have permitted the parties to create a cy pres fund in lieu of a class payout.see mirfasihi,at.that is not our situation.
second,courts have allowed parties to establish cy pres funds when money remained from the defendant payout after money for damages had been distributed to class members.in re airline ticket,at.this situation often arises because some class members never claimed their share.six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir.among other solutions,courts have approved giving money unclaimed after payout to class members to charities related to the plaintiffs injuries,in re simon ii,cir in re mexico money transfer,cir powell,at cir six mexican workers,at.this kind of cy pres fund is at issue in this case.
the settlement provision creating a cy pres fund here is somewhat unusual in its timing.under the final settlement,all class members will receive treble damages before any money goes to cy the parties already know that some original class members will not file claims because they are elderly or have died and their heirs will not stand in their shoes.they expect a significant amount of the million will go unclaimed,and that expectation is supported by expert evidence predicting that class members will claim only about million,leaving approximately million left over.the parties have agreed that any remainder will go,after distribution of treble damages to class members,to cancer or charities.
although unusually timed,the cy pres fund in this case,contrary to howe argument,is not taking damages away from the class members.the settlement permits all plaintiffs to claim and be paid their treble their any money is paid to charity through cy this process is like other,routinely approved cy pres distributions.see,powell,at refusing,after money in a settlement fund remained,to distribute the rest to class members because neither party ha d a legal right to the unclaimed funds in re folding carton antitrust,cir holding a cy pres distribution was appropriate when million remained in a fund created to pay costs and extra claims in a settlement because neither the plaintiff class nor the settling defendants ha d any right to the money.it would elevate form over substance to require the parties to wait until after all claims are paid before reaching an agreement as to how to distribute any remaining money to charity.
howe nevertheless insists that the class members are entitled to receive any remaining money.she argues that,when deciding how to allocate remaining money,the primary consideration is whether it is economically infeasible to distribute the remaining proceeds to all claimants.howe relies on and,in our view,howe misunderstands the american law institute ali recent draft of the principles of the law of aggregate litigation discussing the appropriateness of cy pres distributions in settlements.see american law institute,principles of the law of aggregate litigation,proposed final draft hereinafter ali aggregate litigation draft the question before us is not whether the settlement complies with the ali draft,but whether the district court abused its discretion in approving the cy pres part of the settlement.bobby van hook,d noting,in a criminal appeal arguing that the defendant counsel was ineffective,that american bar association standards and the like are only guides to what reasonableness means quoting strickland washington,d per curiam.
the district court actions in this case were entirely congruent with the proposed draft purposes.the ali proposed draft expresses a policy preference,when settlement money remains,for redistributing that money to class members to ensure they recover their losses.the ali was concerned that cy pres funds are often inappropriate because few settlements award percent of a class member losses,and thus it is unlikely in most cases that further distributions to class members would result in more than percent recovery.ali aggregate litigation draft cmt.b.the ali also believed that in most circumstances distributions to class members better approximate the goals of the substantive laws than distributions to third parties that were not directly injured by the defendant conduct.id.
the district court shared these concerns.the court ultimately insisted that the settlement pay class members treble damages before any money is distributed through cy this set the benchmark well above the ali hope that class members might receive percent recovery.
and the court recognized that the cy pres fund serves the goals of civil damages by ensuring astrazeneca fairly pays for the class alleged losses.we asked at oral argument why astrazeneca would be willing to pay a total sum more than the treble damages for each class member.counsel for plaintiff townsend replied that the plaintiffs had insisted on astrazeneca paying a larger sum to better represent the losses of the entire class,including those class members who would never claim their recovery.
the district court approval reflected another important concern facilitating a settlement in a,complex class action.see durrett housing,cir recognizing a policy encouraging class action settlements.achieving settlement in such cases is not easy.district judges must realistically evaluate settlements based on the circumstances of the case.t he ultimate decision by the judge involves balancing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed settlement as against the consequences of going to trial or other possible but perhaps unattainable variations on the proffered settlement.ass of chain drug stores,at.the court judgment here was not an abuse of discretion.
conflict of interest 
as we read her argument,howe also objects that the district court abused its discretion by finding the settlement was reasonable even though class counsel allegedly had a conflict of interest.we have not before considered what effect potential conflicts of interest by attorneys have on class settlements.although they have substantial discretion to approve settlements,district judges do have responsibility to monitor class counsel performance because class actions are rife with potential conflicts of interests between class counsel and class members,district judges are expected to give careful scrutiny to the terms of the proposed settlements in order to make sure that class counsel are behaving as honest fiduciaries for the class as a whole.mirfasihi,at citations omitted collecting cases.
howe alleges class counsel had a conflict of interest with the class because some attorneys had previously represented prescription action litigation pal,an organization dedicated to reducing costs of pharmaceuticals in part by bringing class actions challenging industry practices.howe argues that loyalty to the class obligated class counsel to demand the highest possible payout to class members.counsel affiliation with pal,she contends,instead caused the attorneys to push for a cy pres fund because pal express purpose is to create cy pres funds and because counsel intended to distribute the fund proceeds to pal.
we reject howe description of counsel obligations,pal purposes,and the settlement terms.as we have explained,there was nothing inherently wrong with class counsel advocating for a cy pres fund to benefit those class members whose recovery would go unclaimed after counsel ensured all claimants would receive more than their damages.howe presents no evidence that pal purpose is to promote cy pres distributions,and the record is otherwise.pal can not receive any cy pres funds from this settlement.the settlement provides the cy pres money will go to mutually acceptable charitable organizations funding cancer research or patient care,a description pal does not meet.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion by approving the settlement method for calculating class members damages and distributing the settlement amount 
howe raises three objections on appeal to the district court approval of the method for calculating and distributing class members individual recovery.first,howe argues in one sentence that the district court should not have approved the settlement because it reduced class members payments if they had supplemental insurance.this argument is waived because howe has failed to develop it on appeal.see united states decologero,cir.
even were it not waived,the argument has no merit.the settlement formula tailors class members recovery to their actual losses,since those who had supplemental insurance paid less out of pocket than those who did not as the district court found,this agreement therefore avoids undercompensating class members who lacked supplemental insurance.see in re pharm.final settlement approval,mdl,civ,at in re pharm.partial settlement approval,mdl,civ,at.and by limiting those with supplemental insurance to their actual,the settlement makes more money available to more class members.see in re pharm.final settlement approval,mdl,civ,at.
second,howe asserts that the settlement should pay class members with supplemental insurance according to their individual coverage.howe insurance covered percent of her medicare,not percent as the loss formula assumes,and she wants her share adjusted.the district court rejected this argument because howe and any similar class members,at double or treble damages,would still receive well above their damages.id.at.
that conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.howe was the only plaintiff known to counsel and the court who had different coverage.the plaintiffs expert had reaffirmed his formula was appropriate despite howe objection.and all class members,even if others existed who,like howe,had less supplemental coverage,would receive more than their actual damages 
third,howe again advocates a distribution system like the one in a track two settlement.she argues all class members should simply receive a check representing their share of the total losses reported in the cms database.
the district court could determine this plan was not more equitable than the distribution method in the settlement.because the cms database does not show who had supplemental insurance,this system would ultimately reduce class members payouts.it would compensate nonmembers and overcompensate class members who had supplemental insurance.the district court understood that,unlike in track two,it was possible to avoid this problem in this case because the parties could calculate zoladex patients losses.
howe objection to class counsel allegedly negotiating attorneys fees with the settlement is waived 
howe contends the settlement agreement is tainted because the parties negotiated the settlement and attorneys fees together.class counsel argue they did not.howe raised this objection when the district court was considering granting preliminary but not final approval to the settlement.she therefore waived it.see iverson city of boston,cir.
d.the district court satisfied the requirements of rule c b 
the meaning of rule c is a legal question we interpret de novo.see nepsk,town of houlton,cir interpreting a federal rule of procedure de novo.
howe objects to the court certification order under rule c b.she presents this argument for the first time on appeal,and it is therefore waived.see in re new motor vehicles canadian exp.antitrust,cir.nevertheless,we address this issue in order to provide guidance to courts interpreting and applying this rule.
rule c b,which was added in,requires orders certifying classes to define the class and the class claims,issues,or defenses.c b.the advisory notes do not clarify the rule further.this court has not before addressed the meaning of c b.only the third circuit has interpreted it.wachtel ex rel.jesse guardian life ins.of,cir.
howe arguments assume that rule c b applies to amended certification orders.as we read her brief,howe solely objects that the district court december,order did not meet her reading of rule c b.that order certified the final settlement class,which was expanded to include the residents from nine states who were previously excluded,and finally approved the settlement agreement.in re pharm.final settlement approval,mdl,civ.howe conten
