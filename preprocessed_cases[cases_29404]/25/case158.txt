opinion of the court 
this matter arises out of a consolidated class action suit seeking injunctive and monetary relief in connection with the sale of coumadin,the brand name for the prescription drug warfarin sodium manufactured and marketed by the dupont pharmaceuticals company dupont plaintiffs allege that dupont anticompetitive behavior and dissemination of false and misleading information about a,readily available generic competitor caused them to purchase the coumadin instead of the generic product.at issue in this appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in approving a million nationwide settlement agreement between dupont and the fixed consumers and consumers collectively,the consumers and third party payors tpps of coumadin,and awarding million in fees to class counsel several individual consumers and tpps challenge the district court certification of the class and approval of the settlement.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class or in approving the settlement,and accordingly we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual history 
warfarin sodium is a prescription oral anticoagulant medication sold in tablet form that is taken by more than million americans to treat disorders.dupont has been the dominant manufacturer and supplier of warfarin sodium under the brand name coumadin,recording sales of approximately million and million,respectively,in and.although dupont coumadin patent expired in,coumadin remained the only warfarin sodium product available until july,when a generic version of warfarin sodium was released onto the market following approval by the food and drug administration fda.class action plaintiffs have alleged that dupont,in response to the competition from generic warfarin sodium,disseminated false and misleading information to consumers,tpps,and others about the safety and equivalence of generic warfarin sodium.as a result,plaintiffs allege that dupont campaign of misrepresentations and omissions caused consumers and tpps to buy,brand name coumadin instead of the generic warfarin sodium.
dupont alleged violations are said to have begun when barr laboratories,barr filed a petition with the fda in may seeking approval to manufacture and distribute a generic warfarin sodium product.in response to barr petition,dupont filed a petition for stay with the fda in october requesting that the fda adopt stricter bioequivalence standards and postpone approval for all generic warfarin sodium products.the fda denied dupont petition,however,on the grounds that the methods in place for determining bioequivalence were sufficient.at the same time,dupont filed a petition with the pharmacopeial convention,usp requesting the adoption of coumadin content uniformity specifications as the industry standard for warfarin sodium drugs.the usp rejected this petition.
in march,the fda approved a generic warfarin sodium,finding that it was the bioequivalent and therapeutic equivalent to coumadin the generic product was released to the market on july,at prices substantially lower than coumadin.plaintiffs allege that dupont,in the period before and after barr introduction of generic warfarin sodium,published false and misleading statements concerning the bioequivalence,therapeutic safety,and efficacy of generic warfarin sodium.for instance,dupont allegedly issued a variety of false and misleading communications to convince health care professionals,government agencies,and the public that coumadin was safer and more effective than barr generic warfarin sodium product.in addition,dupont allegedly revised its promotional computer software system designed for health care practitioners monitoring patients using coumadin to include warnings about switching to generic substitutes,and created a slide presentation for health care professionals claiming that the generic drug may not be the equivalent to coumadin.
dupont also allegedly ran a publicity campaign claiming that coumadin had tighter than usp content uniformity standards.dupont issued a press release,which stated that patients should receive additional blood tests if switched to generic warfarin sodium and accused barr of focusing on producing a cheaper product to save money while dupont focused on patient safety and education.furthermore,dupont allegedly created an organization named the health alliance for nti patient safety for the purpose of lobbying state legislatures,formularies,and pharmacy boards to exclude nti drugs from state generic substitution laws 
plaintiffs assert that the misrepresentations led consumers,tpps,and others to believe that coumadin was superior to the generic equivalents,caused millions of prescriptions to be filled with coumadin that could have been filled with less expensive generic drugs,and allowed dupont to maintain supracompetitive prices for coumadin.as evidence that dupont misrepresentations and conduct had an anticompetitive effect,plaintiffs cited evidence of the weak market penetration of generic warfarin sodium as compared to coumadin.generally,about of prescriptions for drugs available from multiple sources are filled with less expensive generic products within one year of generic availability.however,more than of prescriptions for sodium warfarin were still filled with coumadin a year after barr introduced its generic version,and dupont continued to maintain a market share up until the date the complaints in this matter were filed.
procedural history 
beginning in,class action complaints were filed in several federal district courts and were consolidated for pretrial proceedings by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl panel before the district court for the district of delaware.the class actions sought treble damages and injunctive relief under federal antitrust laws on behalf of a nationwide class of consumer and tpp purchasers of coumadin who paid all or part of the purchase price.in an order dated december,the district court dismissed the claims on the grounds that consumer plaintiffs,as indirect purchasers of coumadin,lacked standing to seek injunctive relief and treble damages under the sherman act.see in re warfarin sodium antitrust,no.mdl,wl.this court reversed the district court decision with respect to injunctive relief,finding that consumer plaintiffs did have standing under federal antitrust laws.see in re warfarin sodium antitrust,cir.
following our decision,several additional class actions were filed in delaware district court as well as other federal courts by tpp plaintiffs and a state medicaid agency and were transferred to the delaware district court as actions pursuant to the order of the mdl panel.after discussions among counsel,the parties negotiated and drafted a pretrial case management order cmo,which the district court entered on february.the cmo established a plaintiffs executive committee,established procedures for conducting settlement discussions,and specified when and how to file a consolidated class action complaint.
a consolidated class action complaint was filed in the district court on march,by consumers and tpps on behalf of all similarly situated consumers who purchased coumadin at supracompetitive prices and all similarly situated tpps who paid for the fulfillment of coumadin prescriptions for their members or their insureds at supracompetitive prices beginning in july.plaintiffs sought an injunction and other equitable relief under of the clayton act,to remedy dupont violation of the federal antitrust laws,particularly of the sherman act,on behalf of all tpps,plaintiffs sought treble damages pursuant to of the clayton act,plaintiffs also alleged violations of the delaware consumer fraud act,the consumer fraud and deceptive acts and practices statutes of all fifty states and the district of columbia and the antitrust statutes of the indirect purchaser states.finally,plaintiffs alleged tortious interference with tpps contracts with health benefit plan members and pharmacies relating to the substitution of generic warfarin sodium and alleged unjust enrichment under the laws of all fifty states and the district of columbia.the state actions that are still pending are included in the proposed settlement.
settlement negotiations and agreement 
pursuant to the cmo,of the executive committee had primary responsibility for submitting motions to the district court,engaging in discovery,conducting negotiations with dupont,and acting as the spokesperson for the plaintiffs at pretrial conferences.any settlement discussions had to be attended by at least one of the,one consumer representative,and one tpp representative,and no settlement offer could be made or accepted without the prior consent of all consumer and tpp representatives on the committee.
settlement negotiations in the federal actions began in march and continued through the next year.the parties reached an oral agreement on the basic terms of the proposed settlement on april,executed a memorandum of understanding on may,and entered into a stipulation of settlement and compromise on july.
under the proposed settlement,dupont would pay,for settlement purposes only,million to settle the claims of the following proposed class 
all consumers or third party payors in the united states who purchased paid all or part of the purchase price of coumadin dispensed pursuant to prescriptions in the united states during the period march,through and including august,class period.excluded from the class are defendant and any of its officers and directors and any governmental entity.third party payor shall mean any entity that is i a party to a contract,issuer of a policy,or sponsor of a plan,which contract,policy or plan provides prescription drug coverage to natural persons,and is also ii at risk,pursuant to such contract,policy or plan,to provide prescription drug benefits or to pay or reimburse all or part of the cost of prescription drugs dispensed to natural persons covered by such contract policy or plan.
upon final approval of the settlement,all pending actions against dupont arising from its alleged unlawful marketing and sale of coumadin,both federal mdl proceedings and related state actions,would be dismissed.dupont has already paid the million into an escrow account which is earning interest for the benefit of the class.
under the allocation and distribution plan,the net settlement fund nsf is to be distributed to class members who filed a proof of claim on or before april,the recognized loss for each class member will be total payments made for coumadin less the amounts received for reimbursements,discounts,or rebates multiplied by.eighteen percent of the nsf is to be set aside for a preferential fund out of which the recognized losses of consumers will be paid first.if the recognized losses of consumer claimants are fully satisfied from the preferential fund,the unexpended portion will be added to the nsf for payment of the recognized losses of the tpps.if instead consumer losses are not fully satisfied,the unsatisfied amounts will be paid out of the remainder of the nsf on a basis with tpp claimants.
on august,the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and conditionally certified the settlement class.the order approved the plan for providing notice to class members about the settlement terms.in addition,the district court required any class member who wanted to of the class,or who wished to object to the proposed settlement but not of the class,to do so by december.
notice to class members and response to proposed settlement 
plaintiffs contracted with complete claim solutions,ccs,a nationally recognized settlement administrator,to prepare and implement a notice program.ccs published notices targeted at both tpp and consumer set up a to receive telephone inquiries prepared,printed,and distributed notice packets for consumers and tpps who responded to the notice and designed and developed a website for class members to review and access information about the settlement.summary notice of the proposed settlement was published over a period of three months beginning in august in selected publications across the country including usa today,usa weekend,and parade magazine,as well as modern maturity and readers digest,in an effort to reach users of coumadin who are generally over the age of.the publications had a combined circulation of approximately million people.the notice was also published in national underwriter and benefits and compensation solutions.
the summary notice informed class members that a settlement on behalf of the class had been proposed.to make a claim,consumers were required to submit a form,available on the website set up by ccs,containing certain identifying information and proof concerning their use of coumadin.by january,there had been over telephone inquiries made,over visits to the websites and forms viewed downloaded.an additional requests for printed notice packets were received via email.through june,the administrator had mailed claim forms to potential consumer class members and received and processed consumer claims and tpp claims.
the claims submitted by consumer class members who filed proof of claim on or before the april,deadline totaled million well within the set aside for them in the preferential fund.attorneys fees and expenses were awarded to counsel for the consumers and the tpps in the aggregate amount of million.approximately was spent on notice and administration.this left million in the fund for compensation of tpps.in addition,by the december,and objection deadline,a total of consumers and tpps had opted out of the proposed settlement while individual consumers and consumer groups and two tpps had filed objections.
oral arguments by plaintiffs and objectors counsel were presented at a fairness hearing held on january.on august,the district court issued an extensive and detailed memorandum opinion and order final approval order certifying the settlement class,approving the settlement,and dismissing the contentions made by the objectors.nine of the consumer objectors now appeal the final approval order.cleusman,shapiro,and eagel filed individual appeals,while hutchinson,palazzola,galperin,bruce,and mccarthy collectively,hutchinson filed a joint appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review the decision of the district court to certify the class and approve the settlement under an abuse of discretion standard.see in re cendant,cir cendant in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir prudential.an abuse of discretion may be found where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re motors.truck fuel tank prod.liab,cir general motors.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.
class certification 
to be certified,a class must satisfy the four threshold requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a numerosity a class so large that joinder of all members is impracticable commonality questions of law or fact common to the class typicality named parties claims or defenses are typical of the class and adequacy of representation representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.see also amchem,windsor,d.in addition to the threshold requirements of rule a,parties seeking class certification must show that the action is maintainable under rule b,or.rule b,the provision at issue in this case,provides for class actions suits.see amchem,at.under rule b,two additional requirements must be met in order for a class to be certified common questions must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members the predominance requirement,and class resolution must be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy the superiority requirement.
appellants allege several errors in the district court certification decision.first,appellants argue that the rule a commonality and rule b predominance requirements were not satisfied in this case because of variations in the claims and injuries of the plaintiffs,specifically between and among the consumers and tpps,as well as differences in the laws of the states which form the basis of several of the class claims.appellants also argue that the certified class does not satisfy the rule a requirement of adequacy of representation because of the existence of conflicts of interest,which rendered class counsel unable to represent the interests of a single class.after reviewing appellants arguments,and for the reasons discussed below,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying a single nationwide class of consumers and tpps 
commonality and predominance 
rule a commonality element requires that the proposed class members share at least one question of fact or law in common with each other.see baby neal ex.rel.kanter casey,cir.rule b predominance element in turn requires that common issues predominate over issues affecting only individual class members.see.b.we have previously noted that the rule b predominance requirement,which is far more demanding,incorporates the rule a commonality requirement.see in re lifeusa holding,cir see also amchem,at.accordingly,we analyze the two factors together,with particular focus on the predominance requirement.see in re lifeusa holding,at.the district court found that common questions of law and fact arose from plaintiffs complaint,and that such common questions predominated over any issues affecting only individual class members.we agree.
as the supreme court noted in amchem,p redominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer fraud or violations of the antitrust laws.amchem,at.this case falls squarely into that category plaintiffs have alleged that dupont engaged in a campaign,in violation of federal and state consumer fraud and antitrust laws,to deceive consumers,tpps,health care professionals,and regulatory bodies into believing that generic warfarin sodium was not an equivalent alternative to coumadin.these allegations naturally raise several questions of law and fact common to the entire class and which predominate over any issues related to individual class members,including the unlawfulness of dupont conduct under federal antitrust laws as well as state law,the causal linkage between dupont conduct and the injury suffered by the class members,and the nature of the relief to which class members are entitled.
moreover,proof of liability for dupont conduct under of the sherman act and the delaware consumer fraud statute depends on evidence which is common to the class members,such as evidence that dupont made misrepresentations about coumadin and generic warfarin sodium permitting dupont to monopolize the market for warfarin sodium and charge supracompetitive prices for coumadin,while discouraging class members to purchase the generic competitor in other words,while liability depends on the conduct of dupont,and whether it conducted a nationwide campaign of misrepresentation and deception,it does not depend on the conduct of individual class members.see in re flat glass antitrust,noting that the predominance test is met in an antitrust case because consideration of the conspiracy is sue would,of necessity,focus on defendants conduct,not the individual conduct of the putative class members.similarly,proof of liability does not depend on evidence that dupont made deceptive communications to individual class members or of class members reliance on those communications to the contrary,dupont alleged deceptive conduct arose from a,national campaign conducted by and directed from corporate headquarters,and individual reliance on the misrepresentations was irrelevant to liability.see in re lifeusa holding,at vacating class certification in part because plaintiffs claims of deceptive insurance sales practices arose from individual and nonstandardized presentations by numerous independent agents.finally,the fact that plaintiffs allege purely an economic injury as a result of dupont conduct,overpayment for warfarin sodium,and not any physical injury,further supports a finding of commonality and predominance because there are little or no individual proof problems in this case otherwise commonly associated with physical injury claims.see prudential,at noting that the complexity of a case alleging physical injury as a result of asbestos exposure differs greatly from a case alleging economic injury as a result of deceptive sales practices.
appellants raise several objections to the district court finding that the certified class satisfies the commonality and predominance requirements.we consider each in turn.
first,several appellants argue that the district court erred when it certified a single nationwide class of plaintiffs because variations in and inconsistencies between the state consumer fraud and antitrust laws of the fifty states defeat the commonality and predominance requirements of rule.appellants rely principally on the seventh circuit decision in in re,cir bridgestone,a case involving the certification of a nationwide class alleging tort claims arising under the laws of all fifty states.however,bridgestone is distinguishable from the instant matter because that case concerned certification of a class for purposes of litigation,not a class solely for purposes of settlement,which is at issue in this case.at.
the difference is key.in certification of litigation classes for claims arising under the laws of the fifty states,we have previously noted that the district court must determine whether variations in state laws present the types of insuperable obstacles which render class action litigation unmanageable.see prudential,at see also in re sch.asbestos,cir.thus,for instance,we have stated that a district court should examine whether varying state laws can be grouped by shared elements and applied as a unit in such a way that the litigation class is manageable.prudential,at in re sch.asbestos,at.however,when dealing with variations in state laws,the same concerns with regards to case manageability that arise with litigation classes are not present with settlement classes,and thus those variations are irrelevant to certification of a settlement class.see amchem,at.in a class certification,a district court need not inquire whether the case,if tried,would present intractable management problems for the proposal is that there be no trial.
nonetheless,we recognize that problems beyond those of just manageability may exist when a district court is asked to certify a single nationwide class action suit,even for settlement purposes,when claims arise under the substantive laws of the fifty states.although there may be situations where variations in state laws are so significant so as to defeat commonality and predominance even in a settlement class certification,this is not such a case.we agree with the district court that the fact that there may be variations in the rights and remedies available to injured class members under the various laws of the fifty states in this matter does not defeat commonality and predominance.in prudential,we noted that a finding of commonality does not require that all class members share identical claims,at,and we rejected an objector contention that predominance was defeated because claims were subject to the laws of fifty states,id.at.moreover,recent decisions elsewhere have certified nationwide or multistate classes under state laws in actions alleging overpayment for prescription drugs.see in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust,in re synthroid mktg.in certifying a nationwide settlement class,the district court was well within its discretion in determining that variations between the laws of different states were insufficient to defeat the requirements of rule.
turning to the next argument,several appellants object to the certification of a single,nationwide class because certain class members may be eligible for treble damages or punitive damages under their state antitrust laws,while other class members,such as those from tennessee,may be eligible for full consideration damages.under a full consideration statute,a consumer can recover the full purchase price paid,as opposed to receiving reimbursement of only the overcharges.as we explained above,however,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that such variations in state law rights and remedies were insufficient to defeat commonality and predominance in any event,we agree with the district court that any material variations could be considered in the context of calculating damages as well as in assessing the fairness of the settlement.
appellant hutchinson argues that the district court erred in when it certified a single class including both fixed consumers and consumers.according to hutchinson,because fixed consumers suffered no injury or did not suffer the same injury as consumers whose economic loss varied with the conduct of dupont,the district court should either have excluded fixed consumers from the class or otherwise created a separate for them.we disagree.as the district court noted,fixed consumers did possess viable equitable and common law claims for unjust enrichment as well as claims for injunctive relief against dupont.fixed consumers therefore suffered a cognizable injury as a result of dupont allegedly unlawful conduct and posed the same risk to dupont as did consumers.thus,the district court did not err when it included fixed consumers with consumers in the same class.
finally,several appellants object to the inclusion of tpps in the certified class on the grounds that tpps did not have standing to assert antitrust claims,or in the alternative that their claims were not as strong as those of the consumer plaintiffs.despite appellants objections,we find no error in the inclusion of tpps in the certified class.notably,tpps,like individual consumers,suffered direct economic harm when,as a result of dupont alleged misrepresentations,they paid supracompetitive prices for coumadin instead of purchasing generic warfarin sodium.thus,this case is distinguishable from other product liability class actions,such as steamfitters local union welfare fund philip morris,cir steamfitters,and a decision of the southern district of new york in in re rezulin products liability litigation,d rezulin,which were cited by appellants.see also allegheny hosp.philip morris,cir.
these cases,as with other similar product liability cases,involved class action claims by consumers who had suffered physical injuries from defective products,which in turn resulted in increased medical costs of covered insureds and increased payments by tpps.the injuries suffered by tpps in those cases,unlike the direct and independent harm suffered by tpps in this matter,were derivative of and dependent on the harm suffered by consumers.moreover,we note that the second circuit,in reversing the district court decision in rezulin,recently held that when insurance companies allege an injury directly to themselves and the excess money plaintiffs paid defendants for the rezulin that they claim they would not have purchased but for defendant in no way derivative of damages to a,the insurance companies have standing to directly sue defendants.see desiano,cir recognizing the right of health benefit providers to recover from drug companies the amounts that were overpaid due to illegal or deceptive marketing practices.therefore,appellants suggestion that tpps should have been excluded from the class or categorized in a separate subclass is without merit,as it well recognized that a purchaser in a market where competition has been wrongfully restrained has suffered an antitrust injury,and in this case,tpps are such purchasers.moreover,it should be noted that because tpps have litigable claims against dupont as injured purchasers,their inclusion was a necessary condition for dupont to enter into a settlement.accordingly,the inclusion of tpps in the settlement created a much larger settlement fund available to satisfy the claims of consumer class members.if tpps had not been included in the settlement with dupont,they could have held back and sued consumers in subrogation,thereby doubling the detriment to consumers resulting from the exclusion of tpps.see in re synthroid mktg,cir.
typicality 
the district court found that the proposed class satisfied the requirements of rule a,which requires that the claims of the named class representatives be typical of the claims of the class.a.the typicality requirement is designed to align the interests of the class and the class representatives so that the latter will work to benefit the entire class through the pursuit of their own goals.id.however,typicality,as with commonality,does not require that all putative class members share identical claims.id.
we find no error in the district court determination.notably,the claims of the representative plaintiffs arise from the same alleged wrongful conduct on the part of dupont,specifically the alleged misrepresentation and deception regarding the equivalence of generic warfarin sodium and coumadin.the claims also arise from the same general legal theories.as the district court noted,the one obvious difference among the various class members is that some are consumers and some are tpps.however,the named class representatives include members from each group.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that rule typicality requirement was satisfied.
adequacy of representation 
rule also requires that the representative class members fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.see.a.we have previously noted that the adequacy inquiry under rule has two components designed to ensure that absentees interests are fully pursued.see georgine amchem,cir,aff,amchem,at.first,the adequacy inquiry tests the qualifications of the counsel to represent the class.prudential,at internal citations omitted.second,it seeks to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.see id.several appellants argue that the interests of tpps,fixed consumers,and consumers were in conflict,and accordingly class counsel was not in a position to adequately represent the class in settlement negotiations.appellants therefore contend that the district court should have,at a minimum,certified separate subclasses for consumers and tpps,or otherwise not certified the class.
admittedly,as the district court noted,class counsel could have more skillfully defined the class to recognize the differences between the various groups included within the class.however,we reject appellants contention that the interests of the class members were in conflict in such a way that the district court abused its discretion in certifying a single class including several types of injured plaintiffs.as the district court found,the named parties,who included consumers and tpps,as well as consumers from the indirect purchaser states,all shared the same goal of establishing the liability of dupont,suffered the same injury resulting from the overpayment for warfarin sodium,and sought essentially the same damages by way of compensation for overpayment.more importantly,contrary to appellants suggestion,the inclusion of fixed consumers and tpps neither prejudiced consumers nor reduced their settlement fund recovery.all class members had the opportunity to recover of their recognized loss,and recovery did not change depending on the number of people in the class,thereby creating the problem of splitting the settlement.although some courts have created subclasses of class action plaintiffs where there are conflicts of interest among class members,see,davis weir,cir noting that subclasses are generally utilized to eliminate antagonistic interests within a class am.fin,harlow,encouraging combination of subclasses into one class where interests of class are not antagonistic,we do not believe that this was required in this case.appellants have only asserted,rather than established,an inherent conflict among consumers and between consumers and tpps 
moreover,we agree with the district court that any potential for conflicts of interest between and among consumers and tpps that may have arisen prior to and during the settlement negotiations were adequately represented by the presence of separate counsel for consumers and tpps.the existence of separate counsel,as well as the operation of the executive committee,provided adequate structural protections to assure that differently situated plaintiffs negotiate for their own unique interests.georgine,at finding inadequate representation of different groups of plaintiffs where no such structural protections existed see also amchem,at.accordingly,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the class satisfied the adequacy of representation requirement of rule.
superiority requirement 
rule b requires that a class action be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.the rule sets out several factors relevant to the superiority inquiry the superiority requirement asks the court to balance,in terms of fairness and efficiency,the merits of a class action against those of alternative available methods of adjudication.prudential,at internal citations and quotations omitted.the district court found that the class satisfied the superiority requirements of rule b,and we find no error in this determination.
notably,there are a potentially large number of class members in this matter,including some million consumers and potentially thousands of tpps.however,individual consumer class members have little interest in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions.b a,because each consumer has a very small claim in relation to the cost of prosecuting a lawsuit.thus,from the consumers standpoint,a class action facilitates spreading of the litigation costs among the numerous injured parties and encourages private enforcement of the statutes.see general motors,at.as the district court noted,this is less true for tpp members of the class,some of whom have significant individual claims.however,the tpps had the option to of the proposed settlement if it was in their interest to bring their claims separately.
moreover,there were a relatively small number of individual lawsuits pending against dupont in this matter,which indicated to the district court that there was a lack of interest in individual prosecution of claims.see prudential,at see also.b b.finally,the district court found that it was desirable to concentrate litigation in delaware,where dupont had its principal place of business and where several initial class action lawsuits had been filed.see prudential,at see also.b c.
fairness of the class action settlement 
a class action may not be settled under rule e without a determination by the district court that the proposed settlement is fair,reasonable and adequate.general motors,at citations and quotations omitted see also.e a.we have on several occasions stressed the importance of rule e,noting that the district court acts as a fiduciary who must serve as a guardian of the rights of absent class members.general motors,at citations and quotations omitted see also amchem,at.noting that the rule e inquiry protects unnamed class members from unjust or unfair settlements affecting their rights when the representatives become fainthearted before the action is adjudicated or are able to secure satisfaction of their individual claims by a compromise citations omitted.however,in cases such as this,where settlement negotiations precede class certification,and approval for settlement and certification are sought simultaneously,we require district courts to be even more scrupulous than usual when examining the fairness of the proposed settlement.see general motors,at.this heightened standard is intended to ensure that class counsel has engaged in sustained advocacy throughout the course of the proceedings,particularly in settlement negotiations,and has protected the interests of all class members.see prudential,at.
this court has identified nine factors to be considered when determining whether a proposed class action settlement is fair,reasonable and adequate.see girsh jepson,cir.these factors are 
the complexity,expense,and likely duration of the litigation the reaction of the class to the settlement the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed the risks of establishing liability the risks of establishing damages the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery and the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.
girsh,at.the decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion of the district court,and we accord great deference to the district court factual findings.girsh,at.additionally,there is an overriding public interest in settling class action litigation,and it should therefore be encouraged.see general motors,at the law favors settlement,particularly in class actions and other complex cases where substantial judicial resources can be conserved by avoiding formal litigation in re sch.asbestos,at noting that the court encourages settlement of complex litigation that otherwise could linger for years.
before turning to the district court application of the girsh factors,we resolve a challenge raised by appellants as to whether the proposed settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness.we have previously directed a district court to apply an initial presumption of fairness when reviewing a proposed settlement where the settlement negotiations occurred at arm length there was sufficient discovery the proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar litigation and only a small fraction of the class objected.cendant,at.based on the record before it,the district court determined that the presumption of fairness properly attached because the settlement resulted from intense negotiations between experienced counsel,came after over three years of active litigation and discovery,and was objected to by only a small fraction of the purported class.several appellants argue that even if the four factors were met,the district court was still not entitled to apply a presumption of fairness because the settlement negotiations preceded the actual certification of the class,and thus the district court could not assure itself that the negotiations proceeded at arm length or that class counsel vigorously protected the class interests.we disagree.as discussed above,we have satisfied ourselves that the rule e adequacy of representation requirement was met such that the consumer and tpp plaintiffs,their respective counsel,as well as the structure of the executive committee protected the class interests during the settlement negotiations.accordingly,we see no reason in this case to depart from the presumption of fairness that attached to the proposed settlement given that the district court found that the four factors were met.
we now turn to the girsh factors,keeping in mind the heightened standard we use when reviewing the fairness of a settlement that results from negotiations that preceded formal class certification,as well as the initial presumption of fairness that the district court found attached to the proposed settlement.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the settlement was fair.
complexity,expense,and likely duration of litigation 
the first factor captures the probable costs,in both time and money,of continued litigation.cendant,at citation omitted.we agree with the district court conclusion that this factor favors settlement because continuing litigation through trial would have required additional discovery,extensive pretrial motions addressing complex factual and legal questions,and ultimately a complicated,lengthy trial.moreover,it was inevitable that motions and appeals would not only further prolong the litigation but also reduce the value of any recovery to the class.in a class action of this magnitude,which seeks to provide recovery for coumadin consumers and tpps nationwide,the time and expense leading up to trial would have been significant.see prudential,at.
the reaction of the class to the settlement 
the second girsh factor attempts to gauge whether members of the class support the settlement.prudential,at.we agree with the district court that this factor also supports the proposed settlement.after preliminary approval of the settlement,individual notice was mailed to over potential tpp class members,and summary notice was published in newspapers and magazines likely to be read by potential class members and which had a combined circulation of million.of the million potential class members,consumers and ten tpp claimants opted out of the settlement,and consumers or groups of consumers and two tpp claimants objected to the proposed settlement.as of june,consumer and tpp claims had been received and processed by the administrator.the district court concluded that the insignificant number of objections filed weighed in favor of approving the settlement.although we have previously noted that the district court should be cautious about inferring support from a small number of objectors in a sophisticated settlement,general motors,at citations omitted,we agree with the district court that the small number of tpp objectors is particularly telling as they are sophisticated businesses with very large potential claims.
in addressing this second girsh factor,we consider a related argument raised by one of the appellants.hutchinson argues that the lack of consumer objectors resulted from inadequate notice to the consumers,as compared to the notice provided to tpps.rule c specifies that all members of the class should receive the best notice practicable under the circumstances,including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.the district court determined that this requirement was satisfied by publishing summary notice in publications likely to be read by consumer claimants along with a and a website with information and downloadable forms.hutchinson,however,argues that notice to consumer plaintiffs was inadequate in this case as compared to other large class action suits where individual direct mailing was used.see,in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust,cendant,at in re synthroid mktg,at.
however,even in the absence of any individual notice via direct mail in this matter,we are satisfied that the district court acted within its discretion in determining that reasonable effort was made here to provide the best notice practicable under the circumstances.see.c.in particular,we note that neither the plaintiffs nor dupont had access to the names and addresses of the multitude of people nationwide who purchased coumadin because the identity of pharmaceutical purchasers is confidential information that can not be disclosed without patient consent.in addition,we note that consumers in this case who contacted the administrator or visited the website could request a copy of the notice by direct mail.
stage of proceedings and amount of discovery completed 
the third girsh factor captures the degree of case development that class counsel had accomplished prior to settlement.through this lens,courts can determine whether counsel had an adequate appreciation of the merits of the case before negotiating.cendant,at quoting general motors,at.as the district court found,this litigation had been pursued by class counsel on several fronts for over three years before negotiation of the settlement.prior to consolidation by the order of the mdl panel,four separate federal actions had been filed by consumer plaintiffs,and consumers and tpps pursued state actions in illinois,california,tennessee,new york,alabama,and wisconsin.the settlement agreement was reached after a year of negotiations which included consultations with experts.contrary to hutchinson assertion that the district court had virtually nothing to aid its evaluation of the settlement terms,three years of litigation and discovery resulted in hundreds of thousands of documents produced by defendant,numerous depositions,and consultations with experts with which the district court was familiar.based on the type and amount of discovery undertaken by the parties,the district court concluded that class counsel adequately appreciated the merits of the case before negotiating,and we agree that this factor strongly favors approval of the settlement.see prudential,at.
risks of establishing liability and damages 
these factors survey the potential risks and rewards of proceeding to litigation in order to weigh the likelihood of success against the benefits of an immediate settlement.cendant,at prudential,at.after evaluating several possible bars to plaintiffs success at trial,the district court concluded that on balance,the fourth and fifth girsh factors favored settlement.we discern no error in that determination.
risks of maintaining class action status through trial 
because the prospects for obtaining certification have a great impact on the range of recovery one can expect to reap from the class action,general motors,at,this factor measures the likelihood of obtaining and keeping a class certification if the action were to proceed to trial.a district court retains the authority to decertify or modify a class at any time during the litigation if it proves to be unmanageable.prudential,at.although appellants concerns about the manageability of a multistate class of consumers and tpps,as we discussed above,did not pose a problem for the certification of a settlement class,there is a significant risk that such a class would create intractable management problems if it were to become a litigation class,and therefore be decertified.see in re lifeusa holding,at georgine,at.we agree with the district court that the significant risk that the class would be decertified if litigation proceeded weighs in favor of settlement.
ability to withstand greater judgment 
the seventh girsh factor considers whether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount significantly greater than the s ettlement.cendant,at.the district court found that this factor neither favored nor disfavored settlement because of a lack of evidence in the record about dupont ability to pay or whether such a consideration factored into the settlement negotiations.appellants cleusman and hutchinson contend that the district court should have inquired into dupont ability to pay a higher settlement amount in determining whether the settlement was adequate.although the plaintiffs do not dispute that dupont total resources far exceed the settlement amount,the fact that dupont could afford to pay more does not mean that it is obligated to pay any more than what the consumer and tpp class members are entitled to under the theories of liability that existed at the time the settlement was reached.here,the district court concluded that dupont ability to pay a higher amount was irrelevant to determining the fairness of the settlement.we see no error here.
the range of reasonableness of settlement in light of best possible recovery and all attendant risks of litigation 
the last two girsh factors evaluate whether the settlement represents a good value for a weak case or a poor value for a strong case.the factors test two sides of the same coin reasonableness in light of the best possible recovery and reasonableness in light of the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial.prudential,at.in order to assess the reasonableness of a settlement in cases seeking primarily monetary relief,the present value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if successful,appropriately discounted for the risk of not prevailing,should be compared with the amount of the proposed settlement.id.citing general motors,at.
plaintiff expert,french,estimated recoverable damages to be as low as million and as high as million.the district court described the methodology utilized by french to arrive at those figures and concluded his estimate was reasonable appellant hutchinson now claims,without the support of expert evaluation,citation,or discovery,that maximum damages in this case should have been estimated at million since dupont made billion in sales between and,and there was a difference in cost between generic warfarin sodium and coumadin.the district court,af
