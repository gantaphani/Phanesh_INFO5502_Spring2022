background 
the louisiana school employees retirement system and debra swiman the lead plaintiffs,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,filed a complaint against defendant ernst young for alleged violations of federal securities laws.each member of the plaintiff class purchased or otherwise acquired accredo securities during the class period.ernst young provided services to accredo during the class period until accredo terminated ernst young as its auditor because of alleged professional malpractice.
ernst young involvement began well before the class period.gentiva health services gentiva,a company accredo was interested in acquiring,retained cap young ernst young consulting arm between may and september.gentiva needed assistance in the collection of hundreds of millions of dollars of outstanding receivables owed to one of its divisions,the speciality pharmaceutical services division gentiva division.in september,cap young recommended that gentiva write off a substantial portion of its accounts receivable and redirect its focus on more current accounts receivable.as a result of cap young audits of gentiva financials,in gentiva wrote off approximately million in uncollectible accounts receivable attributable to the gentiva division.
in the summer of,accredo sought to expand its business through acquiring from gentiva substantially all of the assets of the gentiva division,which was composed of two kinds of pharmacies the acute and chronic health care products and services segments.in september,accredo senior officers and ernst young began conducting due diligence in connection with the potential acquisition.plaintiffs allege that between september and june,during its audit of the gentiva division,ernst young learned that nearly million of acute segment receivables were uncollectible.they further allege that ernst young recognized that the gentiva division allowance for doubtful accounts was understated,causing accredo net income and earnings per share to be materially overstated during the class period.despite ernst young knowledge of the uncollectible accounts on accredo balance sheet,ernst young issued an unqualified audit opinion on accredo fiscal year financial results and approved the quarterly reports in accredo for the first and second quarters of fiscal year.on january,gentiva and accredo entered into an asset purchase agreement.accredo then acquired the gentiva division on june.
plaintiffs further allege that following its june acquisition of the gentiva division,accredo tried to sell the acute segment of the gentiva division but was not able to do so because of the uncollectible receivables.accredo was forced to write off million in uncollectible receivables.
plaintiffs aver that ernst young was involved in the alleged accounting fraud from the beginning of the due diligence preceding the acquisition of the gentiva division and that ernst young knew of the uncollectible receivables as early as.plaintiffs allege that accredo acquisition of the gentiva division depended on ernst young issuance of unqualified audit opinions on the gentiva division financial statements,that accredo retained ernst young to analyze the adequacy of the allowance for the gentiva division doubtful accounts,and that accounts receivable comprised percent of the million purchase price.ernst young unqualified audit opinions were incorporated into the proxy statement filed with the securities exchange commission sec.
gentiva was intent on selling both the acute and chronic segments of the gentiva division to accredo accredo needed the chronic segment to enable accredo to become the company it aspired to be.plaintiffs allege that accredo and ernst young hid the acute segment accounts receivable problems from investors so that accredo could proceed with the transaction.accredo intended to rid itself of the acute segment soon after the transaction was completed.the proxy statement stated that accredo would sell the acute segment by december.
on april,william drummond,an ernst young partner and the lead auditor during the class period,admitted to joel kimbrough,accredo senior vice president and cfo,that there was a problem.a day later,an accredo press release disclosed that,due to the understated allowance for doubtful accounts,the gentiva division receivables had been overstated.this announcement caused a percent drop in accredo stock price.
on may,accredo consulted with ernst young about its intention to present information about the in an upcoming press release.three days later,accredo issued a press release,stating that it had taken a current period charge to earnings to write off million of acute accounts receivable that it had acquired from gentiva.on may,accredo issued its fiscal year third quarter form,which included a note to the consolidated financial statements that if the collection rates had been evaluated based on data as of january,a million charge would have been recorded as of that date.plaintiffs allege that this change in the language was made to avoid having to restate accredo class period financial statements.that same day,accredo terminated ernst young as its auditor and filed a civil suit against ernst young charging professional malpractice.no.
on september,plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against accredo and two of its executives in a related class action the accredo action,which settled four years later.in re accredo health.sec,civ.lead plaintiffs were also appointed as lead plaintiffs in the accredo action.on april,plaintiffs filed this separate lawsuit against ernst young,and in june,ernst young moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b and the pleading requirements of the pslra.the motion to dismiss the complaint was pending when the supreme court decided tellabs,resolving a circuit split regarding the relevance of competing inferences in evaluating whether a complaint satisfies the strong inference of scienter requirement of the pslra.
on august,the district court entered its order granting ernst young motion to dismiss.the district court held that ernst young is not liable under rule for statements that it did not make.with respect to ernst young audit report on accredo financial statements,which was included in accredo fiscal year form filed with the sec,the district court held that a review of the complaint as a whole shows that plaintiffs have failed to meet the pslra requirement of pleading with particularity facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter.the district court thus dismissed the complaint.in its discussion of scienter,the district court correctly paraphrased the tellabs standard but also repeated this court holding,which articulates a higher pleading standard 
p laintiffs are only entitled to the most plausible of competing inferences.helwig,at.the strong inference requirement means that a plaintiff is entitled only to the most plausible of competing potential inferences.id.at.
quoting helwig vencor,cir en banc.plaintiffs did not amend their complaint while the motion to dismiss was pending and did not seek leave to do so after the district court entered its order.however,a reference to amending was in a footnote on the last page of plaintiffs brief in response to ernst young motion to dismiss,stating,s hould the court grant any portion of e y motion to dismiss,lead plaintiffs respectfully request an opportunity to move to amend the pleadings and demonstrate that an amendment would cure any deficiencies.
based on the allegations in their complaint,plaintiffs contend that ernst young is liable as a primary participant in a fraudulent scheme and course of business that defrauded the plaintiffs,deceived the investing public about accredo financial results,artificially inflated the price of accredo publicly traded securities,caused plaintiffs to be damaged when accredo share price fell as a result of the revelations of accounting fraud,enabled ernst young to collect accounting fees from accredo,and allowed accredo to complete its acquisition of the gentiva division.plaintiffs contend that all of these actions were accomplished by disseminating false and misleading statements and concealing materially adverse facts on numerous occasions.
ernst young argues that it tested the substantial reserve for accounts receivable that accredo management had established and found that reserve to be reasonable.two other accounting firms,price waterhouse coopers llp and deloitte touche llp,issued unqualified audit opinions on financial statements that included the gentiva division.price waterhouse coopers audited gentiva financial statements including the gentiva division on february,and deloitte touche audited accredo financial statements for the year ending june,neither auditor found evidence of an inadequate allowance for doubtful accounts of the gentiva division.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting ernst young motion to dismiss the complaint because the complaint was pleaded with the requisite particularity,giving rise to a strong inference that ernst young acted with scienter when it allegedly issued a false or misleading audit opinion on accredo financial statements.specifically,plaintiffs argue that the district court utilized the improper evidentiary inferences in concluding that their allegations do not raise a strong inference of scienter.additionally,plaintiffs assert that the court erred in dismissing the complaint with prejudice rather than granting leave to amend.
ii.discussion 
dismissal in securities fraud cases 
we review the district court decision to dismiss the complaint de novo.ley visteon,cir.in doing so,we may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground supported by the record.hoffman comshare,in re comshare.sec.litig,cir citations omitted.we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all factual allegations as true,and determine whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts consistent with its allegations that would entitle it to relief.league of united latin am.citizens bredesen,cir.
section b of the securities exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder prohibit fraudulent,material misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.frank dana,cir citation omitted.to state a securities fraud claim under section b,a plaintiff must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the misstatement or omission of a material fact,made with scienter,upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied and which proximately caused the plaintiff injury.id.quoting comshare,at.scienter is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.pr diamonds,chandler,cir quoting ernst ernst hochfelder.
securities fraud claims arising under section b must satisfy the particularity pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.pr diamonds,at.a plaintiff complaint must specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent,identify the speaker,state where and when the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.frank,at citation omitted.in addition,the pslra imposes additional and more e xacting pleading requirements for pleading scienter in a securities fraud case.tellabs,at.under the pslra heightened pleading requirements,any private securities complaint alleging that the defendant made a false or misleading statement must 
specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed and 
state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
b,emphasis added.the pslra requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation,and the facts evidencing scienter,the defendant intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at quotation and citation omitted.the supreme court explained in tellabs that congress adopted the strong inference standard because it intended to raise the bar for pleading scienter,id.at,but the pslra did not change the state of mind required to prove securities fraud.comshare,at.
in the securities fraud context,we have long premised liability on at least reckless behavior.mansbach prescott,ball turben,cir.we have held that,following passage of the pslra,a plaintiff may plead scienter in a securities fraud complaint by alleging facts that give rise to a strong inference of recklessness.comshare,at.recklessness sufficient to satisfy is a mental state apart from negligence and akin to conscious disregard.id.at.it is highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.while the danger need not be known,it must at least be so obvious that any reasonable man would have known of it.pr diamonds,at citing mansbach,at.a plaintiff may survive a motion to dismiss only by pleading with particularity facts that give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with knowledge or conscious disregard of the fraud being committed.id.at citing comshare,at.
the standard of recklessness is more stringent when the defendant is an outside auditor.in that instance,recklessness requires a mental state so culpable that it approximate s an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.pr diamonds,at citations omitted.
scienter requires more than a misapplication of accounting principles.the plaintiff must prove that the accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all,or an egregious refusal to see the obvious,or to investigate the doubtful,or that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.
id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.to allege that an independent accountant or auditor acted with scienter,the complaint must identify specific,highly suspicious facts and circumstances available to the auditor at the time of the audit and allege that these facts were ignored,either deliberately or recklessly.id.at quotations and citations omitted.
the facts must give rise not merely to an inference of scienter,but to a strong inference of scienter.t he court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.tellabs,at.the district court must conduct a comparative inquiry and assess the possible competing inferences that could be drawn from the allegations,including plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant conduct,as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.id.at.a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.at emphasis added.when two equally compelling inferences can be drawn,one demonstrating scienter and the other supporting a nonculpable explanation,tellabs instructs that the complaint should be permitted to move forward.frank,at.this formulation rejects that previously used in the sixth circuit,when a plaintiff could survive a motion to dismiss only if the inference of scienter was the most plausible of competing inferences.helwig,at.
lastly,the sixth circuit subjects the scienter test to the totality of circumstances analysis,whereby the alleged facts collectively must give rise to a strong inference of actual knowledge or recklessness.see pr diamonds,at citation omitted.the court must consider the complaint in its entirety.tellabs,at.
tellabs standard analysis 
it is well established that we review the district court dismissal de novo,and we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record,even though they may be different from the grounds relied on by the district court.ley,at citation omitted.nonetheless,plaintiffs argue that the district court applied the incorrect standard,citing frank,at,which held that the pleading standard of helwig had been rejected by tellabs.
frank does not support plaintiffs argument.in frank,the district court incorrectly cited tellabs as requiring the court to accept plaintiff inferences of scienter only if those inferences are the most plausible of competing inferences.id.at.the most plausible standard comes from helwig,which plainly is at odds with the supreme court holding in tellabs.id.accordingly,this court vacated the district court order and remanded.
in this case,in articulating the controlling pleading standard,the district court parenthetical description of tellabs stated plaintiffs must plead facts rendering inference of scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.this statement correctly describes the tellabs standard.see tellabs,at.however,the district court also repeated this court holding,which enunciated the following standard 
p laintiffs are only entitled to the most plausible of competing inferences.helwig,at.the strong inference requirement means that a plaintiff is entitled only to the most plausible of competing potential inferences.id.at.
the district court correctly applied the law to the facts using the tellabs standard,and the helwig quote was dicta that had no impact on the district court analysis.see konkol diebold,cir stating that although the district court opinion contained scattered references to the most plausible standard,the court ultimately applied the correct standard.nonetheless,we review the district court dismissal de novo,using the correct tellabs standard.
pleading a strong inference of scienter 
plaintiffs allege that ernst young material misrepresentation,which subjected it to liability under section b and rule,was the accredo audit report dated august.the report,which contained ernst young unqualified opinion on accredo financial statements,was included in accredo fiscal year form that was filed with the sec on september.the district court held that the allegations contained in plaintiffs complaint do not raise a strong inference that ernst young acted with scienter with regard to the audit report.
on appeal,the class members rely on a number of allegations to establish that ernst young acted with scienter.they assert that ernst young knowingly used stale and incorrect data in preparing its audit opinion and that there were numerous red flags that should have placed ernst young on notice about financial improprieties.further,they contend that the magnitude of the accounting violations by ernst young creates the inference that ernst young acted knowingly or recklessly in ignoring the company financial misstatements.plaintiffs also argue that having ernst young in a position to have its fees increase tremendously if accredo acquired the gentiva division,ernst young period statements,and accredo firing of ernst young support the inference that ernst young acted with the requisite scienter.finally,the class members contend that even if the individual allegations in the complaint are by themselves insufficient,when viewed in their entirety they establish that ernst young acted with scienter.we accept the class allegations as true and address each of their arguments in turn.
plaintiffs argue that ernst young rendered audit opinions on accredo financial statements contrary to the requirements of generally accepted auditing standards and generally accepted accounting principles,approving reports that misstated accredo true financial condition by millions of dollars.more specifically,plaintiffs allege that accredo and gentiva estimates and methodologies were available to ernst young at the time of the audits and that ernst young deliberately or recklessly ignored and failed to investigate them.
as noted above,in the context of securities fraud,recklessness requires proof that the defendant conduct was highly unreasonable and involved an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,meaning that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that any reasonable person would have been aware of it.pr diamonds,at.the standard for proof of recklessness in securities fraud cases is especially stringent when the claim is brought against an outside auditor.id.at.
the pslra requires plaintiffs to plead the elements of fraud in detail.a complaint alleging accounting irregularities fails to raise a strong inference of scienter if it allege s no facts to show that defendants knew or could have known of the errors,or that their regular procedures should have alerted them to the errors sooner than they actually did.pr diamonds,at internal quotations omitted.general allegations regarding an auditor access to information do not raise an inference of fraud.see id.at kennilworth partners cendant,d,s tatement s that could be made in relation to the auditor of every corporation are not sufficient to raise the inference of scienter,because i f they were sufficient,it might make every auditor liable in cases of securities fraud.we have also held that a failure to follow generally accepted accounting principles is,by itself,insufficient to establish scienter for a securities fraud claim.comshare,at citations omitted.improper accounting alone does not establish scienter whereby mere allegations that statements in one report should have been made in earlier reports do not make out a claim of securities fraud.id.citation omitted.
the crux of plaintiffs complaint against the accounting firm is that ernst young failed to follow the professional standards that govern the auditor testing of management accounting estimates,such as the allowance for doubtful accounts.plaintiffs claim that ernst young testing of the allowance attributable to the gentiva division receivables was deficient because ernst young used old and stale data to test the reasonableness of the allowance.the old and stale data to which the plaintiffs refer is the model for determining the allowance as of june.plaintiffs cite a note written on an april fax from an ernst young partner to another outside auditor as circumstantial evidence of scienter.the fax includes two worksheets ernst young used to determine the gentiva division accounts receivable reserve requirement.plaintiffs point to a handwritten note on the first worksheet stating that the worksheet was in a file with the previous schedule.this was labeled as,which we assume was.i do not believe it was ever used even though the percentages are much higher.this amount more in line with reality.the previous schedule to which the worksheet is referring is the actual worksheet that ernst young used to determine the reserve requirement.it is the second worksheet included in the fax.on the second worksheet,a note states the amount appears low.
the district court noted that the first schedule bears a date after the events at issue and surmised that it had been misfiled.however,plaintiffs note that the two schedules were in the same file.they attach another copy of the second worksheet bearing a print date of,which shows that ernst young possessed the worksheet during the events at issue.given our standard of review,we must assume that the first and second worksheets were created in and that t
