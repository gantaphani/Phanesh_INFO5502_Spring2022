the false claims act fca was designed to encourage reporting of false or fraudulent claims that are submitted to the federal government for approval or payment.typically a employee,a business partner or suit for the benefit of the united states.mortgages,dist,cir per curiam.the government has discretion to intervene in the suit as a plaintiff.but what happens when a target defendant settles with the government and the relator and then seeks recovery against a third party for contractual indemnity and independent claims we have not previously had occasion to address this question.we conclude that the fca does not preclude such claims.
background 
a.the false claims act 
a brief review of the act structure is useful in putting the third party claim issue in context.the purpose of the fca is to discourage fraud against the government.robertson bell helicopter textron,cir.the fca imposes civil liability on any person who knowingly uses a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government,a,and any person who conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.id.a to encourage the disclosure of potential fraud,under the qui tam provisions of the fca,relators may bring a civil action for a violation of for the person and for the united states government.id.b united states ex rel.hall teledyne wah chang albany,cir.if the government does not intervene in the suit,the relator may proceed with the fca litigation.c.if the government elects to intervene,the relator remains part of the suit as a qui tam plaintiff,id.b,but the government may dismiss or settle the action over the relator objection.id.c a b.

in crafting protections,congress aimed to make employees feel more secure in reporting fraud to the united states.neal honeywell,cir,abrogated on other grounds by graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d.employees who investigate and supply information concerning the fraudulent practices of an employer are protected from retaliation,whether the employee or the government brings suit against the employer.h neal,at.
nothing in the text or the legislative history of the fca addresses the potential preclusive effect of a settlement among the government,a relator,and a qui tam defendant a subsequent claim by the qui tam defendant against a third party.as one treatise notes,t he legislative history of the amendments to the false claims act does not discuss the availability of indemnity or contribution,but does emphasize the strong public policy of encouraging to come forward.john boese,civil false claims and qui tam actions b at ed.congress did contemplate,however,that disputes would be resolved through settlement.see,d,specifying the proportion of the proceeds of an action or settlement a relator is entitled to receive.congress also specifically contemplated the potential preclusive effects those final judgments rendered in other proceedings would have on qui tam actions.section e of the current version of the act provides that 
a final judgment rendered in favor of the united states in any criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements,whether upon a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,shall estop the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under subsection a or b of section of the fca.
factual background 
cell therapeutics,cti developed a cancer drug called trisonex,which the food and drug administration fda approved in september for the treatment of a particularly virulent form of leukemia.this was the first time cti,a small and relatively young biotechnology company,had received fda approval,so it turned to documedics acquisition,documedics to handle medicare reimbursement and serve as a reimbursement consultant.
documedics billed itself as an expert in reimbursement protocol for oncology drugs,but made a serious error in advising cti.in addition to the approved use for trisonex,oncologists prescribed several uses to treat other for which the fda had not approved the documedics mistakenly advised cti,and in turn medicare carriers and medical providers,that the uses were reimbursable by medicare.because of these assurances,the carriers and providers submitted reimbursement claims to medicare.once cti understood that trisonex was already eligible for reimbursement for these uses,cti stopped pursuing further research and publications that would have supported medicare reimbursement.cti also alleges that it elected not to divest trisonex and made other business decisions based on documedics advice,which resulted in losses for cti.
the government began investigating cti and the lash group lash,documedics successor in interest,in the fall of.two years later,in,james marchese,a cti employee,filed a qui tam action against cti and lash.
in,the government intervened in the suit as to cti but not as to lash.specifically,the government alleged cti knowingly and willfully promoted the sale and use of trisonex for such indications as had not been approved as safe and effective by the fda and made false and misleading statements to treating doctors causing them to present false or fraudulent claims to medicare.in addition to the fca claims,the government alleged common law fraud,negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment.
cti immediately settled with marchese and the government for million,and the government and marchese stipulated to dismissal of their claims with prejudice.one day later,the district court dismissed the claims without making a finding of liability.lash settled with marchese for an undisclosed amount in.
while the qui tam suit was pending,cti sued lash in state court for declaratory relief that lash was contractually obligated to indemnify cti for damages related to the government investigation and any resulting judgment or settlement,breach of the service agreement,breach of a contractual indemnification clause,breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing,and of the duty of care in providing professional services.the action was removed to federal court and is the basis of the claims now on appeal.
the district court granted lash motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that cti claims are barred by our holding in mortgages,in which we directed dismissal of a qui tam defendant counterclaims for indemnification against the relator.at.
the district court concluded that qui tam defendants may not seek indemnification or contribution from in a scheme to defraud the government,and as a result found that cti claims against lash were barred because its damages were pleaded as incidental to and dependent upon its payments to settle the fca claims in the underlying qui tam action.
ii.analysis 
claims by qui tam defendants in the ninth circuit 
the bounty and provisions of the fca work together to not only encourage relators to come forward but also to protect them when they do.our case law has also fashioned a remedy designed to protect qui tam relators from retaliation by defendants.
we first addressed counterclaims by qui tam defendants in mortgages.mortgages,a mortgage lending company,accepted allegedly fraudulent loan applications filled out by defendants who applied for loans,transferred the property secured with the loans to,and then defaulted on the loans.the department of housing and urban development lost millions of dollars,and mortgages ultimately settled with the government for nearly half a million dollars.at.
mortgages later brought a qui tam suit against the defendants,offering the government information it acquired about the defendants false loan applications.the defendants,alleging that mortgages defrauded and misled them as to the nature of the investment scheme,brought counterclaims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and conspiracy.id.at.
mortgages moved to dismiss the counterclaims,taking the position that qui tam defendants could not file counterclaims against qui tam plaintiffs.mortgages referenced a senate report stating that a qui tam relator is afforded protection from retaliation for his actions,at,as reprinted in,hereinafter senate report.the district court denied mortgages motion to dismiss the counterclaims,finding the senate report more likely referred to the protection codified at h that same year.
upon considering a writ of mandamus filed by mortgages,we instructed the district court to vacate its order that mortgages respond to the counterclaims.mortgages,at.reasoning that t he fca is in no way intended to ameliorate the liability of wrongdoers by providing defendants with a remedy against a qui tam plaintiff with unclean hands,id.at,we concluded that there was no right of indemnity or contribution among participants in a scheme to defraud the government in violation of the fca.id.at.in the same vein,we also concluded that there can be no right to assert state law counterclaims that would,in effect,provide contribution.id.at.
three years later,we reconsidered the question of claims against a relator,holding that a qui tam defendant may bring independent claims against a relator.united states ex rel.madden dynamics,cir.in madden,former and current employees of general dynamics brought a qui tam action claiming the company defrauded the navy.the government chose not to intervene,and general dynamics brought multiple state law counterclaims,ranging from breach of the duty of loyalty and violations of the california labor code to misappropriation of trade secrets.id.at.
the district court dismissed general dynamics counterclaims for damages on the ground that the practical effect of those claims was to provide a defendant the opportunity to offset its liability by recovering from qui tam plaintiffs.although these claims were substantively similar to those raised in mortgages,we reversed the district court and held that rather than seeking indemnification contribution,general dynamics sought independent damages.id.at.claims for independent damages are distinguishable from claims for indemnification or contribution,which,by definition,only have the effect of offsetting liability.id.at.
in madden,we further resolved that even dependent counterclaims should not be foreclosed until the qui tam defendant liability is established,reasoning that denying a qui tam defendant recourse to damages offends procedural due process.id.at.to avoid a potential conflict with mortgages,we suggested adopting a resolution process for resolving liability in fca actions before adjudicating a counterclaim 
if a qui tam defendant is found liable,the counterclaims can then be dismissed on the ground that they will have the effect of providing for indemnification or contribution.on the other hand,if a qui tam defendant is found not liable,the counterclaims can be addressed on the merits.
id.citing burch ex rel.united states piqua eng g,
both mortgages and madden figured prominently in the district court dismissal of cti claims against lash.the district court concluded that madden is inapposite and that cti should not be allow to wriggle out of mortgages and into madden.we think that it is not mortgages that limits madden,but madden that circumscribes mortgages.
madden directly addresses two key questions that underlie our analysis in this case first,are any of cti claims appropriately considered independent claims second,has there been a finding of liability that would preclude dependent claims that might in effect give cti an indemnity that the qui tam claims here were resolved by settlement rather than a finding of liability adds a wrinkle not considered in madden.we examine these issues in light of mortgages and madden and conclude the district court grant of lash motion for judgment on the pleadings,which we review de novo must be reversed.
independent claims 
under madden,cti may advance independent claims without regard to an eventual finding of liability under the fca.at.it is incumbent on the district court to separate those claims for damages which only have the effect of offsetting liability from those that are not dependent on a qui tam defendant liability under the fca.id.
cti alleges that lash bad advice resulted in million in damages in addition to the million cti paid to settle the government claims.the district court parsed cti complaint as articulating claims related only to the settlement of the qui tam action,instead of dependent and independent claims.
in its second cause of action for breach of contract,its fourth cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing,and its fifth cause of action for of duty of care,cti alleged that 
lash groups breach was a direct and proximate cause of damage to cti in the form of investigation,litigation and settlement expenses,including attorneys fees and costs,in an amount to be proven at trial,lost opportunities to pursue other means of reimbursement,damage to reputation,and increased cost of capital.
in dissecting this claim,the district court found that the word including modified not only attorneys fees and costs,in an amount to be proven at trial,but also the remainder of the paragraph.as a result,the district court concluded that the claim for million in damages caused by lash unlawful actions and erroneous advice,which lead cti to miss opportunities to alter its sales and marketing plans,seek fda approval for trisonex,or divest itself of trisonex,was not an independent claim,but rode on the back of the claims for fca indemnification barred by mortgages.
while cti likely could have mitigated this erroneous construction through the judicious use of or separate sentences,a failure to include the grammatical fix is not sufficient to transform an independent claim into a claim that only has the effect of offsetting liability.the district court construction is peculiar.taken in light of the facts alleged in cti complaint,cti has alleged four types of damage,in the form of investigation,litigation and settlement expenses,including attorneys fees and costs,in an amount to be proven at trial lost opportunities to pursue other means of reimbursement damage to reputation and increased cost of capital.although these claims may follow from the alleged bad advice,only the first is arguably a claim for indemnification for the costs incurred in settling the qui tam action.
the district court also mistakenly inverted the madden standard,treating the marchese settlement agreement as if it depended entirely on the question of fraud liability under the fca because one of the government claims was for fraud under the fca.instead,madden defines claims that amount to indemnification or contribution as claims that only have the effect of offsetting liability in the qui tam action.id.the government claims against cti included claims that were not,and indeed could not have been,brought as part of the original qui tam action.in addition to its fraud claims,the government alleged that cti was unjustly enriched by the medicare payments,and that it negligently misrepresented trisonex status through its agents who professed to have special knowledge regarding medicare reimbursement.the fca requir
