the patent claims particular monoclonal antibodies.specifically,independent claim states a monoclonal antibody that binds to human antigen.
according to modern understanding,a monoclonal antibody is a composition with a homogeneous antibody population.an antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen.described in terms of its structure,an antibody is a protein consisting of four amino acid chains,two heavy and two light.in a simplified model sufficient for this appeal,each antibody has primarily two regions a variable region and a constant region.the variable region,located on the ends of the arms of the y,binds to and interacts with the target antigen.this variable region includes a complementary determining region cdr that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen.the constant region,located on the tail of the y,is recognized by and interacts with the immune system.
a target antigen generally has numerous binding sites,also called epitopes,recognized by cdrs on multiple antibodies.each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure.thus,one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody.in this case,claim of the patent reads on monoclonal antibodies that bind to human antigen also named an antigen associated with breast cancer cells.
there are various methods of producing monoclonal antibodies.one method uses hybridoma technology,which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody.the hybridoma method uses the cells of various species,including mice,hamsters,rats,and humans.murine from mouse particularly important for this invention.
another method uses genetic engineering including recombinant dna techniques.monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include,among others,chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies.a chimeric antibody combines dna encoding regions from more than one type of species.for example,a chimeric antibody may derive the variable region from a mouse and the constant region from a human.a humanized antibody comes predominantly from a human,even though it contains nonhuman portions.like a chimeric antibody,a humanized antibody may contain a completely human constant region.but unlike a chimeric antibody,the variable region may be partially derived from a human.the nonhuman,synthetic portions of a humanized antibody often come from cdrs in murine antibodies.in any event,these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific antigen.
as noted,murine antibodies play an important role in these technologies.while useful for diagnostics and therapies,murine antibodies can not be administered to people without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response.this response,called human antibody hama,occurs when a human immune system recognizes the murine antibody as foreign and attacks it.a hama response can cause toxic shock or even death.
chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a hama response by minimizing the nonhuman portions of administered antibodies.furthermore,chimeric and humanized antibodies have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses,such as antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity.
in the early,scientists at chiron predecessor corporation,cetus,collectively,chiron began investigating monoclonal antibodies that target human breast cancer antigens.as noted above,the antigen that facilitates diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer was eventually named.this investigational work led to a series of patent applications.the inventors filed their first application on february.within a year,on january,they filed a cip application claiming priority based on that first application.the inventors filed another cip application on may.eventually,the application that led to the patent was filed as another cip on june.this appeal focuses on the patent claims to priority based on the applications filed in,and.
the application discloses one monoclonal antibody that binds to.the is a murine antibody produced by the hybridoma method.while the application discloses the deposit of the hybridoma that produced the monoclonal antibody,the application does not identify the structure,function,or molecular weight of the antigen.because the first publication that disclosed chimeric antibody technology did not appear until four months after this filing,it is not surprising that the application does not disclose any chimeric antibodies.similarly,the first publication to disclose humanized antibodies appeared in may.thus,for good reason,this application also does not mention any humanized antibodies.
the application discloses six additional monoclonal antibodies that bind to,all of which are murine antibodies.the disclosure also refers to the deposit of an additional hybridoma for one of these monoclonal antibodies.while the application provides an approximate antigen molecular weight of kilodaltons the application does not describe the identity,structure,or function of the antigen.the application does,however,note that six of the seven antibodies likely bind to the same epitope.by the time of this application,chimeric antibody technology was known in this art field.although the application does not specifically disclose chimeric or humanized antibodies,it adds the following disclosure 
as used herein the term monoclonal antibody means an antibody composition having a homogeneous antibody population.it is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made.
the application discloses six additional murine antibodies that bind to and the deposit for three additional hybridomas.thus,this application discloses a total of thirteen murine antibodies and deposits for five of their corresponding hybridomas,including those corresponding to and.the application discloses that these antibodies likely bind to at least three different epitopes on.although still not identifying the antigen by name,the application discloses that its molecular weight is approximately kilodaltons.although the application makes no specific mention of chimeric or humanized antibodies,it quotes again the statement that the term monoclonal antibody is not intended to be limited as regards the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made.
when the patent issued,chiron sued genentech over sales of herceptin,a humanized antibody useful for the treatment of breast cancer.herceptin binds to the antigen and thus inhibits the growth of cancerous cells.because herceptin is a humanized antibody,it minimizes any hama response in patients.
before trial,the district court broadly construed the claims of the patent to embrace chimeric and humanized antibodies in addition to the murine antibodies that bind to.chiron genentech,d.accordingly,the district court subsequently granted chiron motion for partial summary judgment of infringement.chiron genentech,no.civ.wbs ggh,dist.lexis,wl.june.also before trial,the parties stipulated that the patent would be invalid under based on intervening prior art if the patent were not entitled to claim priority to the filing date of any one of the,and applications.thus,the jury trial adjudicated only whether any of the priority applications satisfy the written description and enablement requirements of,first paragraph.specifically the trial determined whether the applications adequately disclosed,and thus supported,the claim to chimeric and humanized antibodies claimed in the patent with its filing date in.the jury determined that genentech proved by clear and convincing evidence that none of the applications satisfy both the written description and the enablement requirement for the subject matter in the patent claims.the verdict form,however,did not require the jury to specify the particular requirement of left unfulfilled by each disclosure of the priority applications.after trial,the district court denied chiron motions for jmol and a new trial.
chiron appeals the denial of its motions,and genentech conditionally the district court claim construction.although styled as a,this court treats this claim construction issue as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment.a is only proper if a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment.bailey dart container of.this court has jurisdiction under.

section of title provides an application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section of this title in an application previously filed in the united states shall have the same effect,as to such invention,as though filed on the date of the prior application.accordingly,the patent may only claim priority to an earlier application if the earlier application fulfills the requirements of,first paragraph.in turn,that paragraph requires,in part,that the application shall contain a written description of the invention,and of the manner and process of making and using it,in such full,clear,concise,and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,or with which it is most nearly connected,to make and use the same.
this court has interpreted this passage as setting forth two requirements written description and enablement.amgen hoechst marion roussel.as explained further below,this court affirms because neither the nor the application enables the claims of the patent.the application does not support the new matter added to the patent and thus does not satisfy the written description requirement.
whether the earlier applications enable the claims of the patent is a question of law based on underlying facts.in re wands.this court reviews the underlying factual findings for clear error and the legal component of enablement without deference.plant genetic.dekalb genetics.because the patent is presumed valid,clear and convincing evidence must support a conclusion of invalidity.see hybritech monoclonal antibodies.
the applications in this case satisfy the enablement requirement only if one skilled in the art,after reading their disclosures,could practice the invention claimed in the patent without undue experimentation.wands,at.but the question of undue experimentation is a matter of degree.the fact that some experimentation is necessary does not preclude enablement what is required is that the amount of experimentation must not be unduly extensive.ppg,guardian,quoting atlas powder du pont de nemours.
moreover,the prior application must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the full scope of the claimed invention.in re wright.clarifying this principle,this court has explained that is not to say that the specification itself must necessarily describe how to make and use every possible variant of the claimed invention,for the artisan knowledge of the prior art and routine experimentation can often fill gaps,interpolate between embodiments,and perhaps even extrapolate beyond the disclosed embodiments,depending upon the predictability of the art.ak steel sollac.thus,t he enabling disclosure of the specification must be commensurate in scope with the claim under consideration.in re hyatt.
whether the earlier applications enable the claims of the patent is determined as of the filing date of each application.see plant genetic,at.as noted above,a patent disclosure need not enable information within the knowledge of an ordinarily skilled artisan.thus,a patentee preferably omits from the disclosure any routine technology that is well known at the time of application.see hybritech,at.at the other end of the knowledge continuum,a patent document can not enable technology that arises after the date of application.the law does not expect an applicant to disclose knowledge invented or developed after the filing date.such disclosure would be impossible.see in re hogan,ccpa.nascent technology,however,must be enabled with a specific and useful teaching.genentech,novo nordisk.the law requires an enabling disclosure for nascent technology because a person of ordinary skill in the art has little or no knowledge independent from the patentee instruction.thus,the public end of the bargain struck by the patent system is a full enabling disclosure of the claimed technology.see,ag supply,pioneer int l,d.
because a patent specification must enable the full scope of a claimed invention,an enablement inquiry typically begins with a construction of the claims.ak steel,at citation omitted.in this case,neither party challenges the district court claim construction in the first instance.as a precaution,genentech posits a on claim construction in the event this court reverses the denials of chiron motions.because genentech arguments regarding claim construction are alternative grounds for affirming the verdict,bailey,this court proceeds on the premise that the claim construction is correct.the district court claim construction reads the claims of the patent to embrace not only murine antibodies but also chimeric and humanized antibodies that bind to.
at the outset,this court focuses primarily on chimeric antibodies.if the applications in this case do not enable or provide new matter support for chimeric antibodies,this court need not proceed to examine humanized antibodies.the trial record shows that genetically engineered antibodies,specifically chimeric antibodies,first appeared as a successful technology in the literature of this art field in may,four months after the february filing date of the first application.because the first publication documenting the successful creation of chimeric antibodies occurred after the filing of the application,this sequence of events shows that this new technology arose after the filing date and thus was,by definition,outside the bounds of the enablement requirement.see hogan,at.
the district court in this case attempted to justify the jury enablement verdict on the basis that the applicants might have known about chimeric antibodies before the initial publication on that subject.the trial court cited speculative testimony in the trial about the hypothetical possibility that information may leak out in advance of an initial publication on an important academic topic.at no point did the record show that chiron scientists actually knew of chimeric antibodies before their filing,only that it was hypothetically possible for them to have acquired some advance knowledge.even if the record shows that scientists routinely discuss their work with others in the same art field before publication,ethics would suggest impropriety in publishing that information in advance of the actual originator of the ideas.in any event,as noted,the enablement requirement does not extend to technology that arises after the time of filing.plant genetic,at.in sum,the district court erred to the extent that it attempted to create an obligation for chiron scientists to enable nonexistent technology in the filing.
in the context of the application,the trial court and this court need not rely on enablement to support the jury verdict.the jury may have found that the application does not provide any support for the new matter,chimeric antibodies,claimed in the patent.because chimeric antibody technology did not even exist at the time of the filing,the record conclusively supports that the chiron scientists did not possess and disclose this technology in the february filing.see union oil of cal.atl.richfield,a jury determined that,as of the filing date,the inventor conveyed with reasonable clarity to those of skill in the art that he was in possession of the subject matter of the claims.thus,the patent can not claim priority based on the application because it fails to comply with the written description requirement.
the written description requirement prevents applicants from using the amendment process to update their disclosures claims or specifications during their pendency before the patent office.otherwise applicants could add new matter to their disclosures and date them back to their original filing date,thus defeating an accurate accounting of the priority of invention.see.priority is always a vital issue in patent prosecution determining entitlement to an invention.in,this courts predecessor began to enforce priority as a component of the,first paragraph,written description requirement.in re ruschig.in the context of a new claim added a bout a year after the present application was filed,the ruschig court sought to determine whether the new claim is supported by the disclosure of appellants application.id.at.as later explained,t he function of the description requirement is to ensure that the inventor had possession,as of the filing date of the application relied on,of the specific subject matter later claimed by him.in re wertheim,ccpa.in this case,the chiron scientists,by definition,could not have possession of,and disclose,the subject matter of chimeric antibodies that did not even exist at the time of the application.thus,axiomatically,chiron can not satisfy the written description requirement for the new matter appearing in the patent,namely chimeric antibodies.see,in re kaslow,the test for determining compliance with the written description requirement is whether the disclosure of the application as originally filed reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter,rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language.citation omitted.
turning next to the and applications,this court examines compliance with the enablement requirement.for these applications,the jury was entitled to determine as a matter of fact that chimeric antibodies were not future technology,but were nascent technology requiring a specific and useful teaching.genentech,at.this question,in turn,depends on evidence that undue experimentation would be required to make and use the chimeric antibodies claimed by the patent.of course,undue experimentation is not a single,simple factual determination,but rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations.wands,at.these factual considerations include the quantity of experimentation necessary,the amount of direction or guidance presented,the presence or absence of working examples,the nature of the invention,the state of the prior art,the relative skill of those in the art,the predictability or unpredictability of the art,and the breadth of the claims.id.
evidence presented to the jury showed that creation of genetically engineered antibodies,such as chimeric antibodies,required significant experimentation in and because those antibodies were unpredictable at that early stage of development.the record also shows that only a few laboratories contained the necessary equipment to make these new indication of the excessive experimentation necessary to make and use that technology at that time.the and applications provide no disclosure of either how to make and use chimeric antibodies or working examples of chimeric antibodies within the scope of the patent claims.
moreover,as mentioned above,t he enabling disclosure of the specification must be commensurate in scope with the claim under consideration.hyatt,at.here,the scope of the claim includes not only murine but also chimeric antibodies.while chiron applications certainly enable murine antibodies,they do not enable chimeric antibodies.although an aspect of the claimed invention included the binding of an antibody to a breast cancer antigen,chiron disclosure fell short of providing a specific and useful teaching,genentech,at,of all antibodies within the scope of the claim.
by the filing date of the application,chiron contends that chimeric antibodies were so well known that they had become routine technology.chiron particularly highlights a number of publications before the application that disclosed methods of making chimeric antibodies.accordingly,chiron argues that the application need not specifically enable chimeric antibodies,because technicians of ordinary skill in this art could make and use them by that time without undue experimentation.substantial evidence,however,supports the jury implicit finding that the technology was still nascent at the time of the application as well as,of course,at the time of the application and thus would have still required undue experimentation.
in particular,genentech expert,french,testified that making chimeric antibodies was not routine technology in or.french also testified that,by,only a few laboratories had the capacity and expertise necessary to make genetically engineered antibodies.larrick,another one of genentech experts,testified that polymerase chain reaction pcr,a technique that facilitated the manufacture of genetically engineered antibodies including chimeric antibodies,did not become widespread until sometime between and.although pcr is not necessary to make chimeric antibodies,pcr diminishes the difficulties associated with manufacturing genetically engineered antibodies.furthermore,by,an article authored by a pioneer in the field described techniques of chimeric antibodies as obviously those of a very young and very ambitious field.sherie morrison,genetically engineered chimeric antibodies,hosp.practice.the article further noted we are all new to the game.thus,substantial evidence supports the finding that chimeric antibodies were still a nascent technology at the time the and applications were filed.accordingly,the record amply supports the jury conclusion that the and applications do not enable the claims of the patent without undue experimentation.
while agreeing with the conclusion that the patent may not claim priority to the application,the concurrence reads hogan and plant genetic as allowing an inquiry into whether an application must enable future technology.this court can not avoid the precedent of hogan,which is binding unless overruled en banc,by virtue of the more recent plant genetic.see allergan,alcon.but even if earlier precedent could be disregarded,this court does not read plant genetic to hold that an application must enable unknown,future technology.plant genetic states 
we do not read hogan as allowing an inventor to claim what was specifically desired but difficult to obtain at the time the application was filed,unless the patent discloses how to make and use it.in hogan,amorphous propylene,on the record before the court,was not known or in existence when the application was filed.in the present case,however,monocots existed in and monocot cells were highly desirable.pgs indeed asserts that monocot cells were already being stably transformed.thus,monocots and stably transformed monocot cells were not an unknown concept that came into existence only after.but stably transformed monocot cells were difficult to produce,and the patent gave no instruction how.
at emphasis added.thus,plant genetic distinguishes hogan because stably transformed monocots were nascent technology when the application was filed,unlike the unknown and nonexistent amorphous propylene in the prior case.in the present case,chimeric antibodies,like the amorphous propylene in hogan,did not even appear for the first time until several months after the application.
because the patent is invalid for the reasons noted above,this court need not reach the question of claim construction.this case poses a particular challenge for accurate assessment of the meaning of the claim terms.in this case,the meaning of monoclonal antibody may not have been stagnant between the earlier applications and the patent.the ordinary usage of monoclonal antibody in the early was narrow.for example,one treatise defines monoclonal antibody in these narrow terms antibody secreted by a hybridoma clone.because each such clone is derived from a single b cell,all of the antibody molecules it makes are identical.bruce alberts et,molecular biology of the cell ed accord bruce alberts et,molecular biology of the cell.indeed,another textbook expressly equated monoclonal antibody with hybridoma antibody.leroy hood et,immunology.thus,the term monoclonal antibody in apparently referred to antibodies made with hybridoma and was not broad enough to encompass chimeric antibodies.see alan munro,uses of chimaeric antibodies,nature differentiating monoclonal antibodies from chimeric antibodies.accordingly,when the earliest priority application was filed,monoclonal antibody apparently referred only to a antibody.the application did not expressly redefine the term 
the patent,however,included a definition for monoclonal antibody 
the term antibody encompasses polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations,as well as preparations including hybrid antibodies,altered antibodies,chimeric antibodies and,sic humanized antibodies.
as used herein,the term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody composition having a homogeneous antibody population.the term is not limited regarding the species or source of the antibody,nor is it intended to be limited by the manner in which it is made.the term encompasses whole immunoglobulins.
patent,ll.thus,the patent defined monoclonal antibody to include chimeric and humanized antibodies.still only a portion of this updated meaning of monoclonal antibody can claim priority to the earliest application.if required to engage in claim construction,therefore,this court would face a dilemma either construe the term according to the meaning of the earliest application but contrary to the explicit definition in the patent or construe the term according to the explicit definition in the patent but broader than the disclosure of the earliest application.again,the latter alternative would run afoul of the prohibition against importing new matter into later patent documents.as noted,however,the record amply supports the jury verdict of invalidity without reaching this complex claim construction question.
a trial court should grant a motion for a new trial if the jury instructions were erroneous or inadequate,the court made incorrect and prejudicial admissibility rulings,or the verdict is contrary to the great weight of the evidence.murphy long beach,cir chalmers city of los angeles,cir.chiron asserts that it is entitled to a new trial based on the first and second avenues.this court reviews the denial of a new trial motion after a jury verdict for an abuse of discretion.advanced cardiovascular,medtronic,de saracho custom food,cir.
with respect to the jury instructions,chiron assigns error to four separate rulings.this court reviews jury instructions in their entirety and only orders a new trial when errors in the instructions as a whole clearly misled the jury.baker hughes prod.tools.furthermore,chiron must show both fatal flaws in the jury instructions and a request for alternative instructions which could have corrected the flaws.id.
first,chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on genentech burden of proof without also adding an instruction on the presumption of the patent validity.this court disagrees,because the presumption of validity and heightened burden of proving invalidity are static and in reality different expressions of the same single hurdle to be cleared.am.hoist derrick sowa sons,see also moba,diamond automation.moreover,this court has explained t he presumption is one of law,not fact,and does not constitute evidence to be weighed against the challenger evidence.avia group int l gear.therefore,the district court did not err in declining to include a jury instruction on the presumption of validity because the jury applied the correct clear and convincing evidence standard.
second,chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the law of written description.in particular,chiron complains that three first and third of which were not grouped with the written description may have directed the jury to find the patent invalid if the earlier applications did not describe every embodiment known to skilled artisans as of the filing dates.the first instruction set forth the construction of monoclonal antibody.the second instruction stated an application satisfies the written description requirement if persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the application was filed would recognize from the application that the inventor actually invented the full scope of the invention as finally claimed in the patent.the third instruction set forth that the jury would determine whether the forms referred to in the definition of monoclonal antibody were or were not known in the art at the time the,and applications were filed.this court rejects chiron challenge,because the district court instructed the jury on the proper standard for the written description requirement in the second instruction.even though the second instruction did not echo the precise language of this court cases,this court has stated that compliance with has always required sufficient information in the original disclosure to show that the inventor possessed the invention at the time of the original filing.moba,at.the district court instruction embodies the principle of this court statement in moba.the district court need not use identical language to this court opinions in its instructions.
separately,chiron challenges another instruction on written description,which the district court based on gentry gallery,berkline,and cooper cameron kvaerner oilfield products.in particular,the court instructed the jury 
one way genentech can meet its burden of proving that an earlier application fails to satisfy the written description requirement is to show,by clear and convincing evidence,that the entirety of the specification of an earlier application would clearly indicate to persons of ordinary skill in the art that the invention described in that application is of a much narrower scope than the invention ultimately claimed in the patent.
in considering this issue,the particular question you must decide is whether the,or applications clearly indicate to a person of ordinary skill in the art that the invention described is narrower in scope than the claims of the patent at issue.
chiron argues that this instruction invited the jury to apply a test that does not correspond to this court written description law.this court again rejects chiron argument.once again,though using different words,the district court instruction captures the essence of the written description doctrine that a patent can not claim priority to earlier applications if it includes new matter not present in those earlier disclosures.mahurkar.therefore,this court finds no error in the jury instructions on written description.
third,chiron argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the law of enablement.in particular,chiron complains that the district court erred in rejecting the following two proposed instructions 
the patent application need only enable what it is claimed.features or characteristics that are not claimed need not be enabled.in this case,the novel aspect of the invention claimed in the patent concerns monoclonal antibodies capable of binding to a specific breast cancer antigen.
to meet the enablement requirement,an application need not enable every way of making the claimed invention.an application meets the enablement requirement if it enables even one way of making the claimed invention.
this court rejects the notion that the district court erred by declining to include these instructions.the district court provided a succinct and correct summary of the law of enablement that chiron does not challenge.a trial court need n
