the late samuel pasquale invented a contraceptive regimen in which a woman takes small doses of unopposed estrogen during a portion of the initial phase of her menstrual cycle,beginning a few days after the onset of menses,and daily doses of progestin for the remainder of the cycle.the small amounts of estrogen taken during the initial phase are believed to prevent an egg from becoming available for fertilization by suppressing the development of the dominant ovarian follicle from which the next available egg would be released.compared with the prior art,pasquale regimen claims to enhance contraceptive efficacy and to minimize breakthrough bleeding.
pasquale invention was patented in as patent.in,his patent reissued as patent re.the patent,assigned to appellant bio technology general btg.the most important claims of the patent,for present purposes,are independent claims and,which provide 
a method of contraception comprising 
a administering orally to a human female of age,daily from day or day through day of her menstrual cycle,wherein day is the first day of menses,a first composition containing as sole contraceptively active ingredient an estrogenic compound at a daily dosage equivalent in estrogenic activity in the range of about to about milligrams of alpha ethinyl estradiol and thereafter 
b administering orally to said female,daily through day of her menstrual cycle,at least one composition containing a contraceptively effective daily dosage of a progestin.
a drug delivery system constituted by at least separate daily dosage units,adapted for oral administration and comprising 
at least four but not more than five initial dosage units each containing as the sole contraceptively active ingredient the same contraceptively effective daily dosage of an estrogenic compound 
followed by dosage units each containing a contraceptively effective daily dosage of a progestin.
btg asserts that its commercial embodiment of the patent is a licensed product with the name mircette.the mircette product is sold in the form of blister packs containing orally administered tablets.beginning on the first day of menses,a woman using the system is instructed to take one tablet each day,starting at the top of the blister pack.the pills in each blister pack have the following contents,arranged in the following order the first tablets contain a combination of progestin and estrogen the next two pills are placebos and the last five pills contain unopposed estrogen,estrogen alone,with no other hormone.after a woman takes the last unopposed estrogen tablet,she is instructed to continue the contraceptive regimen by taking the first tablet of a new blister pack,a tablet containing a combination of progestin and estrogen.
in august,appellee duramed pharmaceuticals,filed an abbreviated new drug application with the united states food and drug administration seeking approval to produce a generic version of the mircette system.duramed acknowledges that its generic product is identical to the mircette product in all material respects,but contends that neither its product nor mircette falls within the scope of the patent.
after duramed filed a certification asserting that its generic product did not infringe pasquale patent,btg sued duramed under the hatch waxman act,e,alleging that duramed product infringed claims,and of the patent.the district court subsequently granted duramed motion for summary judgment,ruling that duramed product did not infringe any of the asserted claims of btg patent.
the district court focused on the two independent claims set forth above,claim a method claim and claim a drug delivery system claim.in construing claim,the district court held that the claim language and the written description made clear that the claim was limited to a method of contraception in which designated compounds are taken in a designated sequence following the onset of menses.in particular,the court held that claim requires that an estrogenic compound be administered first,from about day or to day of the cycle,with the first one or two pills being placebos,and thereafter,the pills to be taken contain progestin,which the woman takes for the remaining days of her cycle.the court then ruled that because duramed product does not administer an estrogenic compound in the and progestin in the second stage,it does not contain all elements and limitations of the claim and,therefore,does not literally infringe claim.
in construing claim,the district court noted that the claim refers to a drug delivery system,which according to the court simply means the packaging or arrangement of the various pills.the court rejected btg argument that claim does not require a specific order of pills in a single package,such as a blister pack.rather,the court noted that in the prosecution history of the patent the inventor indicated that the ordering of the pills was a way of distinguishing the invention from the prior art,and held that claim contemplates the ingestion of pills over a period of days in a sequential order.in order for the accused drug delivery system to infringe,the court held,the four or five pills containing unopposed estrogen would have to be placed in the package ahead of the pills containing progestin,not the other way around.
the court held that duramed product does not infringe claim because the arrangement of pills in its package are reversed from that in the patented system that is,the duramed product contains progestin pills in the first three rows of the blister pack,followed by a fourth row of blisters containing two placebos and then five pills containing unopposed estrogen.the court noted btg argument that the drug delivery system of claim reads on duramed product because a woman taking the last five pills in one package of the duramed product and the first pills of the second package of the duramed product would be taking pills in the order recited in claim.the court rejected that argument,however,on the ground that under btg construction of the claim,one would need to have at least two packages of the accused product to complete the cycle which was invented,while in the court view the patent contemplates that its cycle be embodied within one package of pills.because the court concluded that the patent indicates that its system takes place within one,and only one,day time period,the court held that a system requiring consideration of more than one day package in order to find a set of four or five unopposed estrogen pills preceding progestin pills would not literally infringe claim and the asserted dependent claims.
with respect to the claim of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,the district court held that the patent contemplates a particular order of pill ingestion within one package,the first stage requires a ingestion of estrogen pills during four or five of the first seven days,while the second stage requires ingestion of a progestin compound for days.because the court concluded that the elements of the accused product are placed in a reverse order to achieve a different result than that obtained in the patented system,and that the change in sequence of ingestion of the pills affects the female user body in an entirely different manner than with the patented system,the court held that the accused product could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents.accordingly,the court entered final judgment in favor of duramed.
btg appeals,contending that the district court misconstrued both claim and claim and consequently erred in entering summary judgment of noninfringement.
claim of the patent recites a method of contraception comprising two steps.the two steps are distinguished by the identity of the compositions administered in each step and the timing of the two steps.the first step consists of administering a composition containing an unopposed estrogenic compound from day or day through day of the woman menstrual cycle,while the second step consists of thereafter administering a composition containing progestin through day of the woman menstrual cycle.the patent specification makes clear that the days of the menstrual cycle are measured from the
