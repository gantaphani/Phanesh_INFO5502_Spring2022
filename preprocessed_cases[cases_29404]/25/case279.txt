after a trial,a jury convicted iggy santisteban of conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of.the district court sentenced santisteban to a prison term of months.santisteban appeals several of the district court rulings at trial,and we affirm.
santisteban was involved in an international conspiracy to manufacture and distribute counterfeit prescription drugs.the conspiracy involved importing,manufacturing,and misbranding prescription drugs.santisteban printing business produced labels for the counterfeit drugs,and accepted payment from the other conspirators for the fraudulent labels.
santisteban defense at trial was that his participation was unwitting.the central figure of the conspiracy was julio cruz,a former cocaine dealer,whose cooperation with the government in an unrelated case had enabled him to leave prison early.after securing his release,cruz,with the assistance of two men he had met in prison,began smuggling prescription drugs into the united states from central and south america.the conspiracy also involved the theft and unauthorized manufacture of prescription drugs.
before meeting cruz,santisteban owned a struggling printing business in south florida,known as iggyprints.a mutual friend introduced cruz to santisteban,and at this meeting,cruz asked santisteban if he could reproduce a label for pfizer drug lipitor.after stating that he could the label,santisteban quoted a price for printing labels,at about above what he typically would have charged.cruz immediately agreed.cruz testified that santisteban requested a purchase order,or some other documentation,to authorize his reproduction of the labels.when fda agents initially questioned santisteban,he told them that he had received a letter on pfizer stationery authorizing him to go ahead with the print job,but he could not retrieve this document for the agents.later,he produced a letter written on pfizer letterhead,although the heading indicated that it was from pfizer in brazil,and the text of the letter merely requested a competitive quote,not the printing of labels.santisteban eventually printed over forty different drug labels at cruz direction,including labels for drugs.santisteban came to the attention of law enforcement during the course of an investigation into counterfeit lipitor and lipitor labels.
the jury convicted santisteban of conspiring to defraud the united states.the theory of the prosecution was that the conspiracy evaded the food and drug administration regulatory control and thus defrauded the united states.the district court sentenced santisteban to a term of months imprisonment,and ordered restitution of to pfizer.
santisteban first contention is that the government violated his rights under the due process clause by failing to disclose certain impeachment evidence.before trial,the government disclosed to the defense a prosecution memorandum,which outlined the government case.santisteban argues that the government violated his rights by refusing to disclose certain investigative reports that provided the basis for portions of the memorandum.
santisteban defense was that he believed cruz to be a legitimate businessman,and that he relied on the pfizer letter as authorization for the reproduction of labels for pfizer drugs.at trial,however,cruz testified that santisteban had requested the letter merely to cover his ass,and not because he believed it actually authorized the reproduction of labels.cruz testified that he gave santisteban the letterhead,which included a signature,but that the body of the letter was blank when he gave the letterhead to santisteban.on,cruz testified that santisteban had forged and backdated the body of the letter.
contrary to cruz testimony,however,the prosecution memorandum suggests that santisteban did not forge the body of the letter from pfizer.instead,it states that pablo fernandez,one of cruz associates,created a authorization letter and cruz furnished it to santisteban.when santisteban sought discovery of agent reports of cruz statements,believing that these would reveal the source of the apparent inconsistency,the government refused to provide them.the district court rejected santisteban claim that the prosecution memorandum provided a foundation for further discovery,concluding that there was no clear inconsistency between the prosecution memorandum and cruz testimony.cruz had testified that he had provided the letterhead,and that santisteban forged the body of the letter and backdated it.the court reasoned that the prosecution memorandum may have referred only to the creation of the letterhead,and not to the forgery of the body of the letter.
the due process clause of the fifth amendment requires the government to disclose to the accused favorable evidence that is material to guilt or punishment and not otherwise available to the defendant.see united states bagley,d brady maryland,d.to prove a violation,the defendant must show that the evidence was both favorable and material,and that the government suppressed the evidence.united states,cir.the government has suppressed evidence when it was otherwise unavailable to the defendant,and the prosecution failed to disclose the evidence in time for the defendant to use it.id.at.thus,t he government does not suppress evidence in violation of brady by failing to disclose evidence to which the defendant had access through other channels.united states zuazo,cir.
santisteban argues that the government violated the brady rule by refusing to provide him with the agent reports that were the basis for the memorandum assertion that fernandez,and not santisteban,forged the letter from pfizer.we agree with santisteban that the substance of the memorandum was inconsistent with cruz testimony on this point.nonetheless,we conclude that santisteban due process claim fails,because he has not demonstrated that the requested information was material to the defense or that it was unavailable to him through other channels.
we observe first that although counsel cruz regarding the authorship of the letter,he never confronted cruz with the reported inconsistent statement set forth in the prosecution memorandum.this is significant for two reasons.first,if cruz had been asked whether he told the government that fernandez created the letter,then cruz may have admitted the prior inconsistent statement,and the desired impeachment would have been accomplished.santisteban did not exhaust this readily available avenue to present evidence of the inconsistency.second,before santisteban could have offered extrinsic evidence of a prior statement by cruz presumably through the agent whose identity he sought,he was required by the rules of evidence to afford cruz an opportunity to explain or deny the statement.b.having failed to lay a proper foundation for admission of the extrinsic evidence,santisteban is hard pressed now to demonstrate that the unavailability of the extrinsic evidence was prejudicial to his defense.
santisteban also failed to pursue another readily available channel to determine the source of the information in the prosecution memorandum.the defense presented at trial a recording of fda agent spencer morrison questioning cruz about the pfizer letter.the of cruz revealed that he had spoken with morrison on multiple occasions during the course of his cooperation.later in the trial,the defense even called morrison as a witness,but failed to question him about cruz prior statements concerning the pfizer letter.we think it is highly likely that morrison,as an fda agent known to have discussed the letter with cruz and to have communicated with him several times during the investigation,was in a position either to confirm that he was the source of the information in the prosecution memorandum,or to identify another investigator who reported the statement.yet santisteban did not broach the topic with morrison.in view of the opportunity to examine this investigating agent on the topic,we do not believe the requested information about cruz prior statement to the government was unavailable to santisteban.see hoke netherland,cir while it can not be known with absolute certainty,it is quite
