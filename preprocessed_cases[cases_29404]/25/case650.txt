in this patent case concerning the prescription drug lipitor,which is used to reduce lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels,ranbaxy laboratories limited and ranbaxy pharmaceuticals,collectively ranbaxy appeal from a final judgment of the united states district court for the district of delaware.pfizer,pfizer ireland pharmaceuticals.llc,and export,collectively pfizer filed four complaints,later consolidated into a single action,alleging that the product described in ranbaxy abbreviated new drug application anda infringed united states patent and under e.ranbaxy appeals the following rulings by the district court that claim of the patent was infringed that the patent term extension was not proven invalid that claim of the patent was infringed that claim was not proven invalid for failure to comply with,as anticipated or obvious or for double patenting and that the patent was not proven unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
because we agree with the district court claim construction of claim of the patent,we affirm the finding of infringement.we also affirm the ruling that the patent term extension was not invalid.with respect to the patent,however,we reverse on the question of invalidity under,and find the other issues moot.
background 
stereochemistry is the study of the structure of molecules.stereoisomers have the same molecular formula or atomic composition,but different spatial arrangements.enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other and often have distinct physical properties in organic chemistry,enantiomeric pairs include compounds that have one or more chiral centers,carbon atoms with four substituent atoms or groups of atoms.for example,the enantiomers of bromochlorofluoromethane are displayed here.a solid wedge is used to indicate that the chlorine atom is projecting out of the page,while a hashed line indicates that the fluorine atom is behind the page.
to distinguish between different enantiomers of the same compound,chemists use various naming conventions.enantiomers are sometimes called optical isomers because a pure enantiomer rotates light in a particular direction.if the light rotates clockwise,then that enantiomer is labeled or d for dextrorotatory its counterpart will rotate the light counterclockwise and is labeled or i for levorotatory.a racemate or racemic mixture is an equal mixture of two enantiomers.a racemate is labeled because it is not optically active,will not rotate light in either direction since its constituent enantiomers cancel each other out.another system labels biochemical molecules d or l unrelated to the labels d and i,described above by reference to the isomers of glyceraldehyde.yet another nomenclature system labels each chiral center r or s according to priority rules racemates are designated rs because they are comprised of both and.
the terms cis and trans refer to the relative spatial arrangement of two particular substituents cis means they are on the same side of a plane,while trans means they are on opposite sides.in organic compounds,the plane is typically a central ring structure.if there are two chiral centers on the aromatic ring,then there are four possible isomers,and.an equal mixture of and enantiomers is called the.an equal mixture of and enantiomers is called the.
pfizer asserted claims,and of the patent.claim is the only independent claim.it recites a compound having structural formula i as shown,where there is a pyrrole ring on the left with four substituent groups labeled,and,a pyran or lactone ring on the right and an alkyl chain labeled x joining the two rings.claim expressly defines the possible substituent groups represented by x,and.claim also covers a hydroxyl acid or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,corresponding to the opened lactone ring of the compounds of structural formula i above.

a bench trial commenced on november.the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on december,concluding that both patents were infringed,not invalid and not unenforceable.pfizer ranbaxy,d.judgment was entered on january.the next day,ranbaxy filed its notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
following a bench trial,a district court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo while its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.allen eng g bartell.a factual finding is clearly erroneous if,despite some supporting evidence,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states gypsum.
correct claim construction.
claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo.cybor fas,en banc.we determine the ordinary and customary meaning of claim terms as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art,using the methodology first set forth in vitronics conceptronic,and reaffirmed in phillips awh,en banc.the subsequent infringement analysis is reviewed for clear error if performed by the court and for substantial evidence if performed by a jury.young dental special.
the parties agree that under the district court claim construction,ranbaxy anda product infringes claim.on appeal,ranbaxy argues that the district court erred in construing structural formula i to embrace all isomers,including enantiomeric atorvastatin calcium in lieu of accepting its proffered construction limiting claim to racemates.pfizer,d at.instead,ranbaxy contends that structural formula i is limited to racemates,because one skilled in the art would represent a racemate by depicting one of its constituent enantiomers the specification only discloses reaction sequences that produce racemates during prosecution of foreign counterparts to the patent,the patentee represented that its references to trans should be read as trans and during prosecution of the patent,the patentee argued that the patent was limited to mixtures of enantiomers rather than the.thus,ranbaxy argues,its anda product does not infringe claim of the patent because it is the of atorvastatin calcium.we disagree.
it is undisputed that the drawing in claim depicts an enantiomer.all four isomers of structural formula i are shown here.
these compounds are labeled r and s based on the stereochemistry of the chiral center at the top,position of the ring.the cis and trans designations refer to the spatial relationship between the hydroxyl group oh and the alkylpyrrole group relative to the plane of the ring.
the district court correctly observed that the patent consistently describes the invention as a class of trans compounds.the specification of the patent explains at,ll.
the compounds of structural formula i above possess two asymmetric carbon centers which gives rise to four possible isomers,two of which are the and and the other two of which are the.this invention contemplates only the of the compounds of formula i above.
we read this language to mean that the invention would otherwise encompass all four isomers of the compounds of structural formula i,but for the patentee express disclaimer of the and.there is no further disavowal of claim scope that would limit the patent to.indeed,as noted by the district court,the terms racemate or racemic mixture do not appear in the patent nor is claim,unlike claim,limited by a trans designation.in sum,the district court correctly found that no intrinsic evidence limits claim of the patent to,as opposed to an enantiomer,an enantiomer or any equal or unequal mixtures thereof.
we are not persuaded by ranbaxy arguments to the contrary.first,even accepting ranbaxy contention that a racemate is commonly represented by depicting one of its constituent enantiomers,it does not follow that the depiction of an always represents only a racemate.here,only an enantiomer is depicted in the patent,yet the specification expressly indicates that there are four possible isomers of the compounds of structural formula i and limits the invention to the transform.if one skilled in the art would have understood the drawing of structural formula i to limit the scope of claim to,then an express disclaimer of the cisform would not have been necessary.
second,while the examples do describe reaction sequences that produce racemates,restricting claim on this basis would improperly import limitations from the specification into the claims,which should be avoided unless the patentee clearly intends for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive.phillips,at.but here,the specification,at,ll,states that t hese examples are illustrative and are not to be read as limiting the scope of the invention as it is defined by the appended claims.
third,we agree with the district court conclusion that the statements made during prosecution of foreign counterparts to the patent are irrelevant to claim construction because they were made in response to patentability requirements unique to danish and european law.see ti group auto.am,vdo am.llc.likewise,statements made during prosecution of the later,unrelated patent can not be used to interpret claims of the patent.see goldenberg cytogen,finding statements in another patent or its prosecution history irrelevant to claim construction a bsent a formal relationship or incorporation during prosecution of the patent at issue abbott labs.dey,finding arguments made during prosecution of a but unrelated patent did not create prosecution history estoppel.finally,insofar as ranbaxy restates the same argument under the guise of judicial estoppel,we are not persuaded.
because claim was correctly construed to include the enantiomeric of the compounds of structural formula i,we affirm the finding of infringement.
term extension.
under the act,if a patented product has been subject to a regulatory review period before its commercial marketing or use,an extension of the patent term may be obtained.c.in applying for a patent extension,the patentee has a duty of candor and good faith towards the pto and must disclose any material information adverse to a determination of entitlement to the extension sought.a.the director of the pto is charged with deciding whether the patent is entitled to term extension,a decision which is given great deference.glaxo operations uk quigg.
on appeal,ranbaxy asserts that,when correctly construed,the patent does not cover enantiomeric atorvastatin calcium,the active ingredient in lipitor,so it was not eligible for a patent term extension under.in the alternative,ranbaxy argues that the term extension is invalid due to inequitable conduct because pfizer failed to disclose the statements made during prosecution of the patent and the foreign counterparts to the patent.
ranbaxy first argument depends on its proffered claim construction,which we have already rejected.as to its allegations of inequitable conduct,the district court found that the allegedly withheld information was not material,and consequently did not need to be disclosed to the pto,because those statements were irrelevant to a determination of the scope of the claims of the patent.pfizer,d at.this factual finding was not clearly erroneous.we thus agree that ranbaxy failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the term extension was invalid.
with respect to the patent,numerous issues have been raised on appeal.rather than considering them in the order presented by the appellants,we first direct our attention to the question of validity under,which provides 
subject to the following paragraph concerning multiple dependent claims,a claim in dependent form shall contain a reference to a claim previously set forth and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed.a claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.
as described above,pfizer only asserted dependent claim of the patent.this claim reads the hemicalcium salt of the compound of claim.claim,in turn,is dependent on claim,which recites the following compounds atorvastatin acid or atorvastatin lactone or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.claim itself,however,only recites atorvastatin acid.notably,it does not include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of atorvastatin acid ranbaxy asserts that the district court erred in refusing to invalidate claim,even though it does not incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter,as required by.in other words,claim does not narrow the scope of claim instead,the two claims deal with subject matter.
the district court explicitly recognized that there may be a technical problem in the drafting of claim.pfizer,d at.yet,it declined to find that this drafting problem is sufficient to render the claim invalid if the claim is read consistently with its meaning to those skilled in the art because it was unable to find any federal circuit precedent applying,to invalidate a patent.id.at.the district court understood,to be limited to matters of form,rather than matters of substance,noting that the pto treats a claim that fails to comply with this provision as a matter to be addressed through an objection rather than rejected as unpatentable.id.at.in any event,it emphasized that no objections were made to claim,or any of the other dependent claims,during prosecution.id.at.
it is true that at the time the district court wrote its opinion,there was no applicable federal circuit precedent.more recently,however,we have suggested that a violation of,renders a patent invalid just as violations of other paragraphs of would.flow control.in,the issue was one of claim differentiation.the court reasoned that reading an additional limitation from a dependent claim into an independent claim would not only make that additional limitation superfluous,it might render the dependent claim invalid for failing to add a limitation to those recited in the independent claim,as required by.id.indeed,i nvalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with any requirement of sections or of this title is expressly included among the available defenses to an infringement suit.emphasis added.
we recognize that the patentee was attempting to claim what might otherwise have been patentable subject matter indeed,claim could have been properly drafted either as dependent from claim or as an independent,the hemicalcium salt of atorvastatin acid.but,we should not rewrite claims to preserve validity.nazomi commc ns,arm holdings,plc,see also rhine casio,i f the only claim construction that is consistent with the claim language and the written description renders the claim invalid,then the claim is simply invalid.ranbaxy correctly argues that claim fails to specify a further limitation of the subject matter of the claim to which it refers because it is completely outside the scope of claim.we must therefore reverse the district court with respect to this issue and hold claim invalid for failure to comply with.
although the district court was reluctant to find the fourth paragraph of to be an invalidating provision,doing so does not exalt form over substance.rather,it is consistent with the overall statutory scheme that requires applicants to satisfy certain requirements before obtaining a patent,some of which are more procedural or technical than others.see,b d establishing statutory bars to patentability a c requiring submission of an oath by the applicant a requiring submission of a fee with the application requiring joint inventors to apply for a patent jointly.
