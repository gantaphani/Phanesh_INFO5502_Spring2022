opinion of the court 
in this appeal from the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under sections and of the sherman act under federal rule of civil procedure b,we are asked to determine whether ftc actavis,covers,in addition to reverse cash payments,a settlement in which the patentee drug manufacturer agrees to relinquish its right to produce an authorized generic of the drug agreement to compete with a generic drug during the generic statutorily guaranteed days of market exclusivity under the hatch waxman as against the rest of the world.
in actavis,the supreme court held that unexplained large payments from the holder of a patent on a drug to an alleged infringer to settle litigation of the validity or infringement of the patent reverse payment can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.id.at.the court rejected the presumption,known as the scope of the patent test,that a patentee can make such reverse payments so long as it is paying potential competitors not to challenge its patent within the patent lifetime.
plaintiffs here,direct purchasers of the drug lamictal,sued lamictal producer,smithkline beecham corporation,glaxosmithkline gsk,and teva pharmaceutical industries teva,a manufacturer of generic lamictal,for violation of sections and of the sherman act,in earlier litigation,teva had challenged the validity and enforceability of gsk patents on lamotrigine,lamictal active ingredient.teva was also first to file an application with the fda alleging patent invalidity or nonenforceability and seeking approval to produce generic lamotrigine tablets and chewable tablets for markets alleged to be annually worth billion and million,respectively.if the patent suit resulted in a judicial determination of invalidity or nonenforceability or a settlement incorporating such terms teva would be statutorily entitled to a valuable day period of market exclusivity,during which time only it and gsk could produce generic lamotrigine tablets.the relevant statute permits the brand to produce an authorized generic during the exclusivity period.mylan,fda,cir teva pharm.indus.crawford,see also sanofi aventis apotex.
after the judge presiding over the patent litigation ruled the patent main claim invalid,gsk and teva settled.they agreed teva would end its challenge to gsk patent in exchange for early entry into the million annual lamotrigine chewables market and gsk commitment not to produce its own,authorized generic version of lamictal tablets for the market alleged to be worth billion annually.plaintiffs contend that this agreement qualifies as a reverse payment under actavis because,like the cash reverse payments the court there warned could face antitrust scrutiny,gsk commitment was designed to induce teva to abandon the patent fight and thereby agree to eliminate the risk of competition in the billion lamotrigine tablet market for longer than the patent strength would otherwise permit.
we believe this agreement falls under actavis rule because it may represent an unusual,unexplained reverse transfer of considerable value from the patentee to the alleged infringer and may therefore give rise to the inference that it is a payment to eliminate the risk of competition.as the court noted,these kinds of settlements are subject to the rule of reason.
a patent is an exception to the general rule against monopolies and to the right to access to a free and open market.walker process,food mach.chem,quoting precision instrument auto.maint.mach.the constitution patent clause itself reflects a balance between the need to encourage innovation and the avoidance of monopolies which stifle competition without any concomitant advance in the progress of science and useful arts.bonito boats,thunder craft boats,quoting const.art.i,cl.in turn,f rom their inception,the federal patent laws have embodied a careful balance between the need to promote innovation and the recognition that imitation and refinement through imitation are both necessary to invention itself and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy.see x phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.patent law serves the interests of consumers by protecting invention against prompt imitation in order to encourage more innovation than would otherwise occur.a patent,consequently,is a special privilege designed to serve the public purpose of promoting the progress of science and useful arts.precision instrument,at.
with the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat,commonly known as the hatch waxman act,congress attempted to balance the goal of mak ing available more low cost generic drugs,pt,at,reprinted in,with the value of patent monopolies in incentivizing beneficial pharmaceutical advancement,see,pt,at,reprinted in.the act seeks to accomplish this purpose,in part,by encouraging manufacturers of generic drugs to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand name drugs so consumers can enjoy lower drug prices,at.the resulting regulatory framework has the following four relevant features identified by the supreme court in actavis.at.
first,a new drug that is,a pioneer,drug can not be introduced until it is approved by the food and drug administration fda.a.a new drug application nda requires the applicant to submit,among other things,full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,id.b a,as well as comprehensive information about the drug,id.b.this reporting requirement entails a long,comprehensive,and costly testing process.actavis.at.
second,the hatch waxman act facilitates the development of generic drugs by allowing an applicant to file,for new drugs shown to be bioequivalent to a drug previously approved by the fda,j a iv,a less onerous and less costly abbreviated new drug application anda in lieu of an nda.see id.j actavis.at.the anda process allow s the generic to on the pioneer approval efforts,thereby furthering drug competition.actavis.at citing caraco pharm,novo nordisk,
third,hatch waxman sets forth special procedures for identifying,and resolving,related patent disputes.id.a new drug applicant must list information on any patents issued on the drug composition or methods of use.see b caraco.at.if the fda approves the new drug,it publishes this information,without verification,in its orange book caraco.at.in turn,any manufacturer filing an anda to produce a generic version of that pioneer drug must consult the orange book and assure the fda that the proposed generic drug will not infringe the brand patents.id as relevant here,the manufacturer may tender that assurance with a paragraph iv certification that the relevant listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the generic drug.j a vii iv.but f iling a paragraph iv certification means provoking litigation,caraco.at,because the patent statute treats paragraph iv certification as a per se act of infringement,see e a the patentee then has an incentive to sue within days in order to trigger a month stay of the fda potential approval of the generic while the parties litigate patent validity or infringement in court.if the courts decide the matter within that period,the fda follows that determination if they do not,the fda may go forward and give approval to market the generic product.actavis.at citing j b iii 
fourth,hatch waxman provides a special incentive for a generic to be the first to file an abbreviated new drug application taking the paragraph iv route.id.at.from when it first begins marketing its drug or when a court enters judgment finding the challenged patent invalid or unenforceable,the generic enjoys a day period of exclusivity during which no other generic manufacturer can enter the market.see j b iii,iv this exclusivity period belongs to anda alone and is nontransferable.see id.j d actavis.at.the period does not,however,prevent the from marketing its own authorized generic.mylan,at teva pharm,at see also sanofi aventis,at.
plaintiffs,a putative class represented by king drug company of florence,and louisiana wholesale drug,are direct purchasers of lamictal from defendant gsk.gsk pioneered lamictal,a drug used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder,and secured patent the patent on lamotrigine,lamictal active ingredient.the patent expired on july.gsk sells both lamictal tablets and lamictal chewable tablets,although most lamictal prescriptions are for the nonchewable tablets most relevant here.lamictal tablet sales exceeded billion between march and,while chewable sales measured about million over a yearlong span around.
in april,defendant teva filed the first paragraph iv andas to market generic lamotrigine tablets and chewables.teva certified that its proposed generics did not infringe the patent that the patent was unenforceable.gsk soon sued in federal court,see complaint,smithkline beecham teva pharm.usa,ecf,staying the fda approval of teva andas for months.in late january,the parties tried the patent case before judge bissell,who ruled that the patent main claim,for the invention of lamotrigine,was invalid.plaintiffs allege that it was highly likely that teva would prevail with respect to the remaining patent claims,which were extremely weak in view of judge bissell ruling that claim was invalid.
in february,the parties settled their dispute before judge bissell could rule on the validity of the patent remaining claims.gsk agreed to allow teva to market generic lamotrigine chewables by no later than june,or months before the patent was to expire on july,gsk further agreed to permit teva to sell generic lamotrigine tablets on july,if gsk received a pediatric exclusivity extension or march,if gsk did not.with a pediatric exclusivity extension,the patent would still have expired on july,but the fda would have been foreclosed from approving andas filed by competing generics until january.see generally astrazeneca ab apotex.
most relevant here,gsk also agreed not to market an authorized generic until january,after teva day market exclusivity period was to expire the agreement component of the settlement.in fact,plaintiffs allege,teva had an interest in delaying a final court decision finding the patent invalid because the fda had not yet approved teva andas,and teva therefore wanted time to secure fda approval so it could take advantage of its valuable day period,which would have begun to run with a final judgment finding the patent invalid or noninfringed.
in exchange,teva agreed to drop its litigation challenging gsk patent and,plaintiffs allege,delay its entry into the lamotrigine tablet market.if not for the consideration it received,plaintiffs allege,teva would have launched its generic lamotrigine tablet at risk after receiving fda approval which occurred later,in august,even if judge bissell had not yet ruled the patent invalid as,they allege,he was likely to do.indeed,teva was later to assert,in other litigation against gsk,that gsk agreement was an important component of the settlement between the parties and formed part of the inducement to teva to relinquish the rights and defenses it was asserting against gsk in the patent litigation.ja alteration and emphases omitted judge bissell approved the parties settlement and dismissed the case on april.
plaintiffs here,direct purchasers of lamictal from gsk,sued gsk and teva in federal court in february and filed their consolidated amended class action complaint the following june.they allege that defendants,by their agreement in effect,a reverse payment from gsk to teva violated section of the sherman act by conspiring to delay generic competition for lamictal tablets and section by conspiring to monopolize the lamotrigine tablet market.gsk and teva moved to dismiss,countering that,under our decision in in re k dur antitrust litigation,cir only cash payments constitute actionable reverse payments.
in k dur,we charted a course different from that set by several other courts of appeals by rejecting the scope of the patent test,under which a reverse payment settlement is immune from antitrust attack so long as its anticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent,actavis.at citation omitted.we reasoned that the test is contrary to the policies underlying the hatch waxman act and a long line of supreme court precedent on patent litigation and competition.k dur,at.patents,we noted,are simply legal conclusions of the patent office.they should not be irrebuttably presumed valid,we said,especially given the public interest support ing judicial testing and elimination of weak patents,id.at,and t he line that congress drew in hatch waxman specifically between the competing objectives of promoting innovation and advancing the public interest,id.at.for these reasons,we held that rule of reason scrutiny is proper for reverse payment settlements.id.at 
the district court here focused on our limitation of k dur to the pharmaceutical context,see id.at,and statements approving settlements based on a negotiated entry date for marketing of the generic drug,id.at,to restrict k dur reach to settlements when a generic manufacturer is paid off with money,which is not the case here,in re lamictal direct purchaser antitrust,wl,at.the court observed that teva surely received consideration,or otherwise would have had no incentive to settle,but it viewed the parties settlement as based on negotiated entry dates rather than money.id.concluding the settlement was not subject to antitrust scrutiny under k dur,and that,from a policy perspective,this settlement did introduce generic products onto the market sooner than what would have occurred had gsk patent not been challenged,id.at,the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
plaintiffs appealed and we stayed proceedings pending the supreme court decision in actavis.after the court decision,we remanded for further consideration in light of actavis.in january,the district court affirm ed its order of dismissal.in re lamictal direct purchaser antitrust,d.although conceding that there is some very broad language in the actavis opinion regarding patent settlements of all kinds,id.at,the court read actavis,as it had k dur before,as requiring antitrust scrutiny only of reverse payment patent settlements that involve an exchange of money rather than some other type of valuable consideration,id.at.in the alternative,the court stated,it considered the settlement under the five considerations of actavis rule of reason and concluded that the settlement would survive.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that under actavis antitrust scrutiny is not limited to reverse payments of cash.they assert the antitrust laws may be violated when a drug manufacturer induces a generic competitor to delay market entry by agreeing not to launch an authorized generic to compete with the generic.further,they argue,the district court usurped the jury role in purporting to conduct a rule of reason analysis by applying the five considerations the actavis court discussed to justify,not redefine,use of the already rule of reason analysis.we will vacate and remand.
as noted,in actavis,the supreme court rejected the scope of the patent test,a categorical rule that reverse payment patent settlements in the hatch waxman context were immune from antitrust scrutiny so long as the asserted anticompetitive effects fell within the scope of the patent.the court held that reverse payment settlements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws,actavis.at,because a n unexplained large reverse payment itself would normally suggest that the patentee has serious doubts about the patent survival,thereby suggest ing that the payment objective is to maintain supracompetitive prices to be shared among the patentee and the challenger rather than face what might have been a competitive market,id.at.consequently,the court held,plaintiffs should be able to prove t he existence and degree of any anticompetitive consequence of such an agreement under the traditional test.id.at.
justice breyer framed the issue of reverse payments then before the court as follows 
company a sues company b for patent infringement.the two companies settle under terms that require company b,the claimed infringer,not to produce the patented product until the patent term expires,and company a,the patentee,to pay b many millions of dollars.because the settlement requires the patentee to pay the alleged infringer,rather than the other way around,this kind of settlement agreement is often called a reverse payment settlement agreement.and the basic question here is whether such an agreement can sometimes unreasonably diminish competition in violation of the antitrust laws.see,sherman act prohibition of restraint s of trade or commerce.palmer brg of,per curiam invalidating agreement not to compete.
actavis.at.
the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit had applied its test to the following facts.see id.at ftc watson,cir,rev sub nom.actavis.solvay pharmaceuticals developed a drug called androgel in and obtained a relevant patent in.later in,three generic androgel manufacturers,actavis first soon followed by paddock laboratories and par pharmaceutical,filed andas with paragraph iv certifications.solvay sued.thirty months into the litigation,the fda approved actavis anda.actavis.at.
the parties settled in.under the terms of the settlement,
actavis agreed that it would not bring its generic to market until august,months before solvay patent expired unless someone else marketed a generic sooner.actavis also agreed to promote androgel to urologists.the other generic manufacturers made roughly similar promises.and solvay agreed to pay millions of dollars to each generic million in total to paddock million in total to par and an estimated million annually,for nine years,to actavis.the companies described these payments as compensation for other services the generics promised to perform,but the ftc contends the other services had little value.
id.citations omitted.
the ftc sued the settling manufacturers for violating the antitrust laws by agreeing to share solvay monopoly profits.id.at.the ftc contended solvay reverse payments to the generic manufacturers were compensation for the generics agreements not to compete with androgel.id.at.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit disagreed,and affirmed the dismissal of the ftc complaint,on the ground that,absent sham litigation or fraud in obtaining the patent,a reverse payment settlement is immune from antitrust attack so long as its anticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent.watson,at.in its view,patent holder s had a lawful right to exclude others from the market.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.even though a patent might be found invalid if litigated,the court thought the ftc approach would put that burden back on the parties and the court,undo much of the benefit of settling patent litigation,and discourage settlements,in derogation of the important public policy interests served by settlement.id.at.
the supreme court disagreed.it began with the premise that an asserted patent may or may not be valid,and may or may not be infringed.actavis.at.although a valid patent gives its holder the right to exclude all from the use of the protected process or product and charge prices of its choosing,including supracompetitive prices,an invalidated patent carries with it no such right.and even a valid patent confers no right to exclude products or processes that do not actually infringe.id.emphasis in original quoting united states line material.and from the time of their paragraph iv certification,the generics in actavis had challenged both the validity and the scope of the androgel patent.id.the court observed that,as alleged by the ftc,solvay had agreed to pay the generics many millions of dollars to stay out of its market,even though the generics did not have any claim that solvay was liable to them for damages.id.the court was concerned that this unusual form of settlement could have significant adverse effects on competition and thought,accordingly,that patent and antitrust policies are both relevant in determining the scope of the patent monopoly and consequently antitrust law immunity that is conferred by a patent.id.
the court cited several of its earlier cases for this proposition that courts must balance the lawful restraint on trade of the patent monopoly and the illegal restraint prohibited broadly by the sherman act.id.quoting line material,at see also united states gypsum.the antitrust question,it reasoned,must be answered by considering traditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive effects,redeeming virtues,market power,and potentially offsetting legal considerations present in the circumstances,such as here those related to patents.actavis.at.only then can a court conclude w hether a particular restraint lies beyond the limits of the patent monopoly.id.at quoting id.at roberts,dissenting.by contrast,chief justice roberts,joined in dissent by justices scalia and thomas,would have held that the scope of the patent,the rights conferred by the patent forms the zone within which the patent holder may operate without facing antitrust liability.id.at roberts,dissenting.in the dissenters view,a patent holder acting within the scope of its patent does not engage in any unlawful anticompetitive behavior it is simply exercising the monopoly rights granted to it by the government.id.at.and,they maintained,the patent scope should be determined by reference to patent law.id.emphasis in original.
as noted,the court explained that its precedents make clear that settlement agreements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.id.at majority opinion citing united states singer,line material,at united states new wrinkle.the court viewed these prior cases as seek ing to accommodate patent and antitrust policies,finding challenged terms and conditions unlawful unless patent law policy offsets the antitrust law policy strongly favoring competition,notwithstanding the possible validity or infringement of the patent in question.id.at see id.at roberts,dissenting the majority seems to think that even if the patent is valid,a patent holder violates the antitrust laws merely because the settlement took away some chance that his patent would be declared invalid by a court.emphasis in original.rejecting the dissent view that a patent holder may simply pa y a competitor to respect its patent and quit its patent invalidity or noninfringement claim without any antitrust scrutiny whatever,id.at majority opinion alteration in original quoting id.at roberts,dissenting,the court reasoned that t he dissent does not identify any patent statute that it understands to grant such a right to a patentee,whether expressly or by fair implication,id.such a right,the court thought,would be difficult to reconcile with the policy of eliminating unwarranted patent grants so the public will not continually be required to pay tribute to monopolists without need or justification.id.quoting lear,adkins,
the court further explained that its holding should not be read to subject to antitrust scrutiny commonplace forms of settlement,such as tender by an infringer of less than the patentee full demand.see id.but reverse payments,it said,are not such familiar settlement forms.id.in a reverse payment settlement,the patentee pays money purely so the alleged infringer will give up the patent fight.id.these payments are said to flow in reverse because a party with no claim for damages something that is usually true of a paragraph iv litigation defendant walks away with money simply so it will stay away from the patentee market.that,the court thought,is something quite different,and something that falls outside accepted traditional examples of settlement.id.
notwithstanding the potential concern that antitrust scrutiny of a reverse payment agreement would require the parties to litigate the validity of the patent in order to demonstrate what would have happened to competition in the absence of the settlement,the court identified five sets of considerations militating in favor of permitting antitrust scrutiny.id.at.first,the court saw in reverse payments the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.id.quoting ftc.fed of dentists.the inference may be drawn from a reverse payment that the patent holder is paying the alleged infringer to defend a right it already claims but would lose if the patent litigation were to continue and the patent were held invalid or not infringed by the generic product.id.even though other settlement terms might allow a generic challenger to enter the market prior to patent expiration,and thus permit some competition benefiting consumers,a reverse payment inducing delay,a payment in return for staying out of the market simply keeps prices at supracompetitive levels while dividing that return between the challenged patentee and the patent challenger.id.at.
second,the court thought these anticompetitive consequences will at least sometimes prove unjustified.id.at.although a payment may be justified if,for example,it approximates litigation expenses saved by the settlement or is true compensation for other services that the generic has promised to perform,it may not be justified when used to prevent the risk of competition by eliminating the risk of patent invalidation or a finding of noninfringement.id.at see also,id.noting that the antitrust harm occurs when the payment objective is to maintain supracompetitive prices to be shared among the patentee and the challenger rather than face what might have been a competitive market the very anticompetitive consequence that underlies the claim of antitrust unlawfulness.at the same time,the court did not rule out other justifications.
third,the court reasoned,in reverse payment situations the patentee likely possesses the power to bring about this anticompetitive harm.id.not only does a patent protect such market power,but the size of a reverse payment may serve as a proxy for this power because a firm without such power and the supracompetitive profits that power enables is unlikely to buy off potential competitors.id.
fourth,the size of the unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable surrogate for a patent weakness,all without forcing a court to conduct a detailed exploration of the validity of the patent itself.id.at.instead,the anticompetitive harm from such a payment appears not to be that the patentee is reaping supracompetitive monopoly profits from a decidedly invalid or noninfringed patent,but rather that there is a risk that the monopoly is unwarranted,and foreclosing such a challenge harms consumers.see id.at t he payment if otherwise unexplained likely seeks to prevent the risk of competition.and,as we have said,that consequence constitutes the relevant anticompetitive harm.
fifth,parties may still find other ways to settle,such as by allowing the generic manufacturer to enter the patentee market prior to the patent expiration,without the patentee paying the challenger to stay out prior to that point.id.at.the court emphasized,however,that i f the basic reason for the reverse payment is a desire to maintain and to share monopoly profits,then,in the absence of some other justification,the antitrust laws are likely to forbid the arrangement.id.
the court concluded that,because of the nature and the complexity of reverse payment agreements,courts should apply the traditional analysis.see id.at.
we do not believe actavis holding can be limited to reverse payments of cash.for the following reasons,we think that a agreement,when it represents an unexplained large transfer of value from the patent holder to the alleged infringer,may be subject to antitrust scrutiny under the rule of reason.we find the allegations here sufficient to state such a claim under the sherman act 
in the actavis court view,reverse payments are problematic because of their potential to negatively impact consumer welfare by preventing the risk of competition,which arises from expected litigation outcomes.see actavis.at.the court reasoning was not that reverse payments per se violate the antitrust laws,or are per se anticompetitive.to the contrary,the court declined to abandon the rule of reason in favor of presumptive rules or a approach,which are appropriate only where an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the court focused on whether a reverse payment could have an anticompetitive effect or,alternatively,whether it was reasonable compensation for litigation costs or the value of services.in other words,the court reasoned that even a small risk of invalidity may not justify a large payment presumably enabled by monopoly profits that likely seeks to prevent the risk of competition.id.at.and,the court reiterated,it is the prevention of that risk of competition eliminating the risk of patent invalidation or a finding of noninfringement by paying the challenger to stay out of the market for longer than the patent strength would otherwise allow that constitutes the relevant anticompetitive harm,which must then be analyzed under the rule of reason.id.at.
it seems to us that agreements are likely to present the same types of problems as reverse payments of cash.the agreement here may be of great monetary value to teva as the generic.in actavis,the supreme court recognized generally that the day exclusivity period is possibly worth several hundred million dollars,and may be where the bulk of the profits lie.id.at quoting scott hemphill,paying for delay pharmaceutical patent settlement as a regulatory design problem,there are also plausible indicia that this pattern held true here the amici states point out that p ublic records show that generic sales of lamictal in were some million dollars,so the agreement was clearly worth millions of dollars,if not hundreds of millions of dollars,to the generic.amici states br.and the ftc suggests,using sales of the drug paxil as a yardstick,that gsk agreement would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars to teva.appellants br.
at the same time,a brand commitment not to produce an authorized generic means that it must give up the valuable right to capture profits in the new market.the agreement transfers the profits the patentee would have made from its authorized generic to the settling generic plus potentially more,in the form of higher prices,because there will now be a generic monopoly instead of a generic duopoly.thus,the source of the benefit to the claimed infringer is something costly to the patentee.aaron edlin et,activating actavis,antitrust,fall,at.absent a promise,launching an authorized generic would seem to be economically rational for the brand.for this reason,the fact that the brand promises not to launch an authorized generic thereby giving up considerable value to the settling generic makes the settlement something more than just an early entry it may instead provide strong evidence that the patentee seeks to induce the generic challenger to abandon its claim with a share of its monopoly profits that would otherwise be lost in the competitive market.actavis.at.
the anticompetitive consequences of this may be as harmful as those resulting from reverse payments of cash.if the brand uses a agreement to induce the generic to abandon the patent fight,the chance of dissolving a questionable patent vanishes and along with it,the prospects of a more competitive market.as with a reverse payment of cash,a brand agreeing not to produce an authorized generic may thereby have avoid ed the risk of patent invalidation or a finding of noninfringement.id.at.in addition,when the parties settlement includes a agreement,the generic also presumably agrees to an early entry date that is later than it would have otherwise accepted and during this time,the brand monopoly remains in force.once the generic enters,moreover,it faces no competition with other generics at all.
antitrust law is designed to protect consumers from arrangements that prevent competition in the marketplace.see,actavis.at id.at roberts,dissenting accord xii areeda hovenkamp,supra,supp.the district court here held that the supreme court considered a reverse payment to involve an exchange of money because when the supreme court said payment it meant a payment of money.lamictal,d at.but,we think,a agreement could likewise prevent the risk of competition.actavis.at xii areeda hovenkamp,supra,supp.explaining that under a settlement consumer welfare remains the same as it would be under continued monopoly production by a single firm ftc amicus br.it is not the transfer of cash or the form of reverse payment that triggers antitrust concern it is the impact of that payment on consumer welfare.we do not believe the court intended to draw such a formal line nor did the actavis court limit its reasoning or holding to cash payments only 
defendants contend that agreements are distinguishable from reverse payments because they are in essence exclusive licenses and patent law expressly contemplates exclusive licenses they argue the actavis court rejected the dissent arguments in part because the dissent could not identify any patent statute that it understands to grant such a right to a patentee,whether expressly or by fair implication.actavis.at see gsk br,teva br.they suggest that if the patent statute specifically gives a right to restrain competition in the manner challenged,actavis.at internal quotation marks omitted,such conduct is immune from antitrust scrutiny.see gsk br.teva br.in short,defendants argue gsk concession not to produce an authorized generic during teva day exclusivity period is an exclusive license exempt from antitrust scrutiny.
but the right defendants seek is not in fact a patentee right to grant licenses,exclusive or otherwise instead,it is a right to use valuable licensing in such a way as to induce a patent challenger delay.the actavis court rejected the latter.the thrust of the court reasoning is not that it is problematic that money is used to effect an end to the patent challenge,but rather that the patentee leverages some part of its patent power in actavis,its supracompetitive profits to cause anticompetitive harm namely,elimination of the risk of competition.there,the patentee gave the challenger a license to enter months before patent expiration,plus a reverse payment of millions of dollars.actavis.at.this reverse payment was not immunized,of course,simply because of that license.similarly,the fact that a patent holder may generally have the right to grant licenses,exclusive or otherwise,does not mean it also has the right to give a challenger a license along with a promise not to produce an authorized generic,a promise not to compete in order to induce the challenger to respect its patent and quit the competitor patent invalidity or noninfringement claim without any antitrust scrutiny.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in the actavis court view,the question is not one of patent law,but of antitrust law,the latter of which invalidates the improper use of a patent monopoly.id.at alteration in original quoting line material,at.but see id.at roberts,dissenting.and as we read the court opinion,even exclusive licenses can not avoid antitrust scrutiny where they are used in anticompetitive ways.see id.at citing palmer,palmer,at holding an agreement not to compete based on an exclusive copyright unlawful on its face.we make no statement about patent licensing more generally.but in this context we believe the fact that the patent act expressly authorizes licensing does not necessarily mean it also authorizes reverse payments to prevent generic competition 
we also disagree with defendants attempt to recharacterize teva gain as resulting from its early entry alone.first,that characterization is inaccurate as a descriptive matter what gsk gave teva was a day monopoly over the generic market.the generic can not capture this value by early entry alone.it can only hope to obtain this value with the brand,and here,without gsk commitment,gsk allegedly would have introduced an ag.second,although we agree that the actavis court expressly identified licensing as a traditional form of settlement whose legality the opinion took pains not to disturb,teva br.a agreement is no more solely an licensing agreement than the settlement in actavis itself,where entry was permitted months before patent expiration.actavis.at.notwithstanding such early entry,the antitrust problem was that,as the court inferred,entry might have been earlier,the risk of competition not eliminated,had the reverse payment not been tendered.see actavis.at they may,as in other industries,settle in other ways,for example,by allowing the generic manufacturer to enter the patentee market prior to the patent expiration,without the patentee paying the challenger to stay out prior to that point.see also ftc amicus br.c ompetitors do not normally raise antitrust concerns if they agree on a date for generic entry but do not simultaneously agree that the manufacturer will compensate the generic company for staying out of the market until that date,thereby sharing while enlarging their aggregate pool of monopoly profits.
defendants present additional arguments as to why agreements,as exclusive licenses,should not be subjected to antitrust scrutiny.noting that public policy favors settlements,they contend that subjecting such agreements to scrutiny will discourage settlements.gsk br.furthermore,they contend that courts should not review conduct to determine whether an even more transaction exists.gsk br.citing verizon commc ns law offices of curtis trinko,llp,the sherman act does not give judges carte blanche to insist that a monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some other approach might yield greater competition.citation omitted see teva br.
but actavis addressed and rejected these arguments.first,the court thought the possible discouragement of settlements was outweigh ed by other considerations and stated that parties may well find ways to settle patent disputes without the use of reverse payments.actavis.at but whatever the effect on settlements,we do not perceive how the noncash nature of agreements alters that balance.second,we think trinko inapposite.actavis does not stand for the proposition that parties must reach the most procompetitive settlements possible.instead,we read actavis to hold that antitrust law may prohibit settlements that are anticompetitive because,without justification,they delay competition for longer than the patent strength would otherwise permit 
for the reasons we have explained,we think this agreement,because it may represent an unusual,unexplained transfer of value from the patent holder to the alleged infringer that can not be adequately justified whether as compensation for litigation expenses or services,or is subject to antitrust scrutiny under the rule of reason.but even if that is the rule,defendants contend,plaintiffs fail to state a claim under bell atlantic twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,because their allegations are far too speculative to satisfy their burden of plausibly alleging that the settlement was anticompetitive.see gsk br.in particular,defendants argue that p laintiffs fail to plausibly allege that in this world,the parties would have successfully negotiated an alternative,agreement,teva br.that continued litigation in favor of settlement would have yielded a more competitive result,teva br.or that teva would have launched their generics at risk,teva br.
we believe plaintiffs allegations,and the plausible inferences that can be drawn from them,are sufficient to state a claim under twombly and iqbal for violation of the sherman act on the ground that gsk sought to induce teva to delay its entry into the lamotrigine tablet market by way of an unjustified agreement.as recited earlier,plaintiffs alleged that gsk agreed not to launch a competing authorized generic during teva day exclusivity period,which was to begin near the expiration of the patent that such promises can be worth many millions of dollars of additional revenue that gsk had an incentive to launch its own authorized generic versions of tablets that teva had a history of launching at risk and that the patent was likely to be invalidated as,in fact,its main claim had been.because marketing an authorized generic was allegedly in gsk economic interest,its agreement not to launch an authorized generic was an inducement valuable to both it and teva to ensure a longer period of supracompetitive monopoly profits based on a patent at risk of being found invalid or not infringed.indeed,teva asserted in other litigation that the agreement formed part of the inducement to teva to relinquish the rights and defenses it was asserting against gsk in the patent litigation.ja alteration and emphases omitted.and although plaintiffs concede that teva entered the lamotrigine chewables market about months early,see,gsk br,the chewables market,allegedly worth only million annually,was orders of magnitude smaller than the alleged billion tablet market the agreement is said to have protected.accordingly,at the pleading stage plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that any procompetitive aspects of the chewables arrangement were outweighed by the anticompetitive harm from the agreement 
moreover,we do not read actavis to require allegations that defendants could in fact have reached another,more competitive settlement.actavis embraces the concept that a patent may or may not be valid,and may or may not be infringed.at,and holds that the anticompetitive harm is not certain consumer loss through higher prices,but rather the patentee avoid ance of the risk of patent invalidation or a finding of noninfringement that is,prevent ion of the risk of competition,id.at,beyond what the patent strength would otherwise allow and,thus,consumer harm.in other words,under the substantive standard,the question is not whether the defendants have only possibly acted unlawfully,but see teva br,but whether they have acted unlawfully by seeking to prevent competition.plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded as much 
in the alternative,the district court stated that i t finds that the settlement would survive actavis scrutiny and is reasonable.d at.this was error.as explained above,plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded violation of the antitrust laws so as to overcome defendants motion to dismiss.if genuine issues of material fact remain after discovery,the analysis is for the finder of fact,not the court as a matter of law 
in addition,the district court mistook the five sets of considerations that persuaded the actavis court to conclude that the ftc should have been given the opportunity to prove its antitrust claim under the rule of reason.at,as a redefinition of the rule of reason itself.but the general contours of the rule of reason are.see generally,id.at citing.fed of dentists,at deutscher tennis bund atp tour,cir.we recognize the actavis court le ft to the lower courts the structuring of this type of antitrust litigation.at,and that there may be some uncertainty as to how,exactly,a defendant may show in the antitrust proceeding that legitimate justifications are present,thereby explaining the presence of the challenged term and showing the lawfulness of that term under the rule of reason,id.at citing.fed of dentists,at.but the court noted that justifications might include litigation expenses saved through the settlement or compensation for other services that the generic has promised to perform.id.and although the court left such details of how to apply the proper antitrust theories to the basic question that of the presence of significant unjustified anticompetitive consequences,id.at it suggested the antitrust laws are likely to forbid payment for delay or,that is,to eliminate risk of patent invalidity or noninfringement,id.at.
here,the district court thought the agreement was justified because,although the settlement amount was likely greater than litigation costs,the consideration which the parties exchanged in the settlement wa s reasonably related to the removal of the uncertainty created by the dispute.lamictal,d at.that conclusion is in tension with actavis in that,without proper justification,the brand can not pay the generic simply to eliminate the risk of competition.nor did the court properly conclude that the potential for adverse effects on competition wa s minimal,or that the settlement was reasonable,because the duration of the no ag agreement was a relatively brief six months.id.the anticompetitive harm plaintiffs allege consistent with actavis is that the promise of no competition during those six months induced teva to quit its patent challenge.as discussed above,plaintiffs plausibly allege this promise was of considerable value and thus designed to protect gsk patents against the risk of invalidation or noninfringement,rather than reimburse litigation costs or compensate for services.accordingly,the district court should have permitted the litigation to proceed under the traditional approach.
under the traditional analysis,the factfinder must 
weigh all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.the plaintiff bears an initial burden under the rule of reason of showing that the alleged combination or agreement produced adverse,effects within the relevant product and geographic markets.the plaintiff may satisfy this burden by proving the existence of actual anticompetitive effects,such as reduction of output,increase in price,or deterioration in quality of goods or services.such proof is often impossible to make,however,due to the difficulty of isolating the market effects of challenged conduct.accordingly,courts typically allow proof of the defendant market power instead.market power,the ability to raise prices above those that would prevail in a competitive market,is essentially a surrogate for detrimental effects.
if a plaintiff meets his initial burden of adducing adequate evidence of market power or actual effects,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the challenged conduct promotes a sufficiently objective to rebut,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the restraint is not reasonably necessary to achieve the stated objective.

the actavis court provided initial guidance on how to structure litigation in the reverse payment context.the court explained that such antitrust questions must be answered by considering traditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive effects,redeeming virtues,market power,and potentially offsetting legal considerations present in the circumstances,such as here those related to patents.actavis.at.
first,to prove anticompetitive effects,the plaintiff must prove payment for delay,or,in other words,payment to prevent the risk of competition.see id.at.t he likelihood of a reverse payment bringing about anticompetitive effects depends upon its size,its scale in relation to the payor anticipated future litigation costs,its independence from other services for which it might represent payment,and the lack of any other convincing justification.id.at.
second,the burden then shifts to the defendant to show that legitimate justifications are present,thereby explaining the presence of the challenged term and showing the lawfulness of that term under the rule of reason.id.at.
the reverse payment,for example,may amount to no more than a rough approximation of the litigation expenses saved through the settlement.that payment may reflect compensation for other services that the generic has promised to perform such as distributing the patented item or helping to develop a market for that item.there may be other justifications.
id.at.the court does not foreclose other justifications,and we need not decide today what those other justifications might be.
finally,the plaintiff will have the opportunity to rebut the defendant explanation 
on remand,we invite the district court to proceed with the litigation under the traditional rule of reason,tailored,as necessary,to the circumstances of this case 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

when parties compromise on an date alone rather than an date plus valuable consideration it is possible that they may compromise on an date reflecting their assessment of the strength of the patent.the concern with combining an date with the valuable consideration of a agreement is that the generic manufacturer may be willing to accept a later date without any corresponding benefit to consumers.
