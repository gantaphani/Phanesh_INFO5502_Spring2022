the food and drug administration fda regulates the manufacture,sale,and labeling of prescription drugs.a drug manufacturer seeking fda approval for a drug submits a new drug application nda containing,among other things,a statement of the drug components and proposed labeling describing the uses for which the drug may be marketed.see b,d.once the fda has approved a brand manufacturer drug,another company may seek permission to market a generic version by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda.see j a ii,iv.but the fda can not authorize a generic drug that would infringe a brand manufacturer patent.to facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as patents allow,the amendments require a brand manufacturer to submit its patent numbers and expiration dates,b and fda regulations require a description of any patent,known as a use code,see cfr c ii p,e.the fda does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply.instead,it simply publishes the codes,patent numbers,and expiration dates in a large volume known as the orange book.
after consulting the orange book,an anda applicant enters one of several certifications to assure the fda that its generic drug will not infringe the brand patent.if the patent has not expired,an applicant may fulfill this requirement in one of two ways.first,it may submit a section viii statement asserting that it will market the drug for only those methods of use not covered by the brand patent,see j a viii,and proposing a label that carves out the method s of use,see cfr a iv.the fda will not approve an anda with a section viii statement if the proposed label overlaps at all with the brand use code.second,the anda applicant may file a paragraph iv certification stating that the brand patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic drug manufacture,use,or sale.j a vii iv.such filing is treated as an act of infringement,giving the brand an immediate right to sue and resulting in a delay in the generic drug approval.
in,the federal trade commission ftc issued a study detailing evidence that brands were submitting inaccurate patent information to the fda in order to prevent or delay the marketing of generic drugs.in response,congress created a statutory counterclaim available to generic manufacturers sued for patent infringement.the provision allows a generic manufacturer to assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the brand to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the brand under subsection b or c of on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug.j c ii i.this case concerns the scope of the counterclaim provision.
respondents collectively novo manufacture the version of the diabetes drug repaglinide.the fda has approved three uses of the drug,but novo patent claims only one.petitioners collectively caraco wish to market a generic version of the drug for the other two approved methods of use.caraco initially filed a paragraph iv certification and,considering this an act of infringement,novo brought suit.caraco then submitted a section viii statement and a proposed label carving out novo patented therapy.but before the fda could approve caraco anda,novo changed its use code to indicate that it held a patent on all three approved methods of using repaglinide.because caraco proposed label now overlapped with novo use code,the fda would not permit caraco to employ section viii to bring its drug to market.
caraco filed a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement action,seeking an order requiring novo to correct its use code because the patent did not claim two of the three approved methods of using repaglinide.the district court granted caraco summary judgment,but the federal circuit reversed.it read the counterclaim phrase the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug as requiring caraco to demonstrate that novo patent does not claim any approved method of use because the patent covers one approved method,the counterclaim was unavailable.the court also ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use codes because they are not patent information submitted by the brand under subsection b or c of.that information,the court concluded,consists only of the patent number and expiration date expressly required by the statutory provisions.
held a generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the brand patent as covering a particular method of using a drug.
a the parties first dispute the meaning of not an in the phrase the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug.novo contends that the counterclaim is available only if the patent claims no approved method of use,but caraco reads this language to permit a counterclaim whenever a patent does not claim the particular method that the anda applicant seeks to market.in isolation,either of these readings is plausible,so the meaning of the phrase not an turns on statutory context,see johnson united states.this context favors caraco congress understood that a drug may have multiple methods of use,not all of which a patent covers and a section viii statement allows the fda to approve a generic drug for unpatented uses so that it can quickly come to market.the statute thus contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones.within this scheme,the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brand assertion of rights over whichever discrete uses the generic company wishes to pursue the counterclaim availability matches the availability of fda approval under the statute.
b the parties further dispute whether use codes qualify as patent information submitted by the brand under subsection b or c of.a use code,which is a description of the patent,surely qualifies as patent information.novo nonetheless contends that use codes are not submitted under subsections b and c because those provisions expressly require an nda applicant to provide only the patent number and the expiration date of any patent claiming the drug or a method of its use.but b and c also govern the regulatory process by which brands provide additional patent information to the fda.the term under is broad enough to include patent information,like use codes,that brands submit as required by this scheme.this reading draws support from the court prior decisions in,eli lilly medtronic,and ardestani ins,and it is bolstered by congress use of the narrower phrases described in and prescribed by in neighboring provisions.see c,d.again,the conclusion that use codes are submitted under b and c fits the broader statutory context.use codes are pivotal to the fda implementation of the amendments,and so it is unsurprising that the counterclaim provision language sweeps widely enough to embrace them.
c the counterclaim provision description of available remedies dispatches whatever remains of novo arguments.the court reading gives content to both remedies it delete s a listing from the orange book when the brand holds no relevant patent and correct s the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patent scope.by contrast,novo interpretation would all but read correct out of the statute.if,as novo contends,the counterclaim is available only where the patent claims no approved method of use,the remedy will always be to delete the patent information.and if the counterclaim reaches only patent numbers and expiration dates,the orange book will include few if any mistakes in need of correction.
d novo advances two arguments relating to the counterclaim drafting history,but neither overcomes the statutory text and context.the company first points out that congress failed to pass an earlier bill that would have required brands to file descriptions of patents and would have allowed generic companies to bring civil actions to delete or correct the information filed.because that bill would have allowed a generic applicant to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent,novo contends that this court can not read the statute that was eventually enacted as doing the same.but the earlier bill contained numerous items that may have caused its failure.and the limited criticism of its mechanism for challenging brands descriptions of their patents focused on the creation of an independent cause of action stronger medicine than the counterclaim at issue here.finally,between that bill demise and the counterclaim enactment,the fda issued a rule requiring brands to supply use codes.the counterclaim provision drafters thus had no need to require this information.
novo next contends that congress established the counterclaim only to address the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the orange book a problem that had come to light when the federal circuit held in mylan pharmaceuticals,thompson,that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent.novo thus contends that the counterclaim is a mere delisting provision.but this court thinks mylan alerted congress to a broader problem that generic companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands patent listings,and that the fda therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to market.again,the proof of that lies in the statute itself its text and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only as in mylan when the patent listing is baseless,but also as here when it is overbroad.moreover,congress equation of the two situations makes perfect sense.in either case,the brand submits misleading patent information to the fda,delaying or blocking approval of a generic drug that infringes no patent and thus,under the statute,should go to market.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
when the food and drug administration fda evaluates an application to market a generic drug,it considers whether the proposed drug would infringe a patent held by the manufacturer of the version.to assess that matter,the fda requires brand manufacturers to submit descriptions of the scope of their patents,known as use codes.the fda does not attempt to determine if that information is accurate.rather,the fda assumes that it is so and decides whether to approve a generic drug on that basis.as a result,the breadth of the use code may make the difference between approval and denial of a generic company application.
in this case,we consider whether congress has authorized a generic company to challenge a use code accuracy by bringing a counterclaim against the brand manufacturer in a patent infringement suit.the relevant statute provides that a generic company may assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the brand manufacturer to correct or delete the patent information it submitted under two statutory subsections on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug.stat,j c ii i.we hold that a generic manufacturer may employ this provision to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the brand patent as covering a particular method of using the drug in question.
the fda regulates the manufacture,sale,and labeling of prescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme.to begin at the beginning when a brand manufacturer wishes to market a novel drug,it must submit a new drug application nda to the fda for approval.the nda must include,among other things,a statement of the drug components,scientific data showing that the drug is safe and effective,and proposed labeling describing the uses for which the drug may be marketed.see b,d.the fda may approve a drug for multiple methods of use either to treat different conditions or to treat the same condition in different ways.
once the fda has approved a brand manufacturer drug,another company may seek permission to market a generic version pursuant to legislation known as the amendments.see drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat.those amendments allow a generic competitor to file an abbreviated new drug application anda on the brand nda.rather than providing independent evidence of safety and efficacy,the typical anda shows that the generic drug has the same active ingredients as,and is biologically equivalent to,the drug.see j a ii,iv.as we have previously recognized,this process is designed to speed the introduction of generic drugs to market.see eli lilly medtronic.
because the fda can not authorize a generic drug that would infringe a patent,the timing of an anda approval depends on the scope and duration of the patents covering the drug.those patents come in different varieties.one type protects the drug compound itself.another kind the one at issue here gives the brand manufacturer exclusive rights over a particular method of using the drug.in some circumstances,a brand manufacturer may hold such a patent even after its patent on the drug compound has expired.
to facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as patents allow,the amendments and fda regulations direct brand manufacturers to file information about their patents.the statute mandates that a brand submit in its nda the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the brand submitted the nda or which claims a method of using such drug.b.and the regulations issued under that statute require that,once an nda is approved,the brand provide a description of any patent it holds.see cfr c ii p,e.that description is known as a use code,and the brand submits it on fda form.as later discussed,the fda does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply.it simply publishes the codes,along with the corresponding patent numbers and expiration dates,in a fat,brightly hued volume called the orange book less colorfully but more officially denominated approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations.
after consulting the orange book,a company filing an anda must assure the fda that its proposed generic drug will not infringe the brand patents.when no patents are listed in the orange book or all listed patents have expired or will expire prior to the anda approval,the generic manufacturer simply certifies to that effect.see j a vii i iii.otherwise,the applicant has two possible ways to obtain approval.
one option is to submit a section viii statement,which asserts that the generic manufacturer will market the drug for one or more methods of use not covered by the brand patents.see j a viii.a section viii statement is typically used when the brand patent on the drug compound has expired and the brand holds patents on only some approved methods of using the drug.if the anda applicant follows this route,it will propose labeling for the generic drug that carves out from the brand approved label the methods of use.see cfr a iv.the fda may approve such a modified label,see a,as an exception to the usual rule that a generic drug must bear the same label as the product,see j a v,j g.fda acceptance of the label allows the generic company to place its drug on the market assuming the anda meets other requirements,but only for a subset of approved uses,those not covered by the brand patents.
of particular relevance here,the fda will not approve such an anda if the generic proposed label overlaps at all with the brand use code.see fed.reg.the fda takes that code as a given it does not independently assess the patent scope or otherwise look behind the description authored by the brand.according to the agency,it lacks both the expertise and the authority to review patent claims although it will forward questions about the accuracy of a use code to the brand its own role with respect to patent listing is ministerial.at see ibid.a fundamental assumption of the amendments is that the courts are the appropriate mechanism for the resolution of disputes about the scope and validity of patents thus,whether section viii is available to a generic manufacturer depends on how the brand describes its patent.only if the use code provides sufficient space for the generic proposed label will the fda approve an anda with a section viii statement.
the generic manufacturer second option is to file a paragraph iv certification,which states that a listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the generic drug.j a vii iv.a generic manufacturer will typically take this path in either of two situations if it wants to market the drug for all uses,rather than carving out those still allegedly under patent or if it discovers,as described above,that any label it is willing to adopt can not avoid the brand use code.filing a paragraph iv certification means provoking litigation.the patent statute treats such a filing as itself an act of infringement,which gives the brand an immediate right to sue.see e a.assuming the brand does so,the fda generally may not approve the anda until months pass or the court finds the patent invalid or not infringed.see j b iii.accordingly,the paragraph iv process is likely to keep the generic drug off the market for a lengthy period,but may eventually enable the generic company to market its drug for all approved uses.
in the late,evidence mounted that some brands were exploiting this statutory scheme to prevent or delay the marketing of generic drugs,and the federal trade commission ftc soon issued a study detailing these anticompetitive practices.see ftc,generic drug entry prior to patent expiration an ftc study,pp.july hereinafter ftc study.that report focused attention on brands submission of inaccurate patent information to the fda.in one case cited by the ftc,mylan pharmaceuticals,thompson,ca fed,a brand whose original patent on a drug was set to expire listed a new patent ostensibly extending its rights over the drug,but in fact covering neither the compound nor any method of using it.the fda,as was and is its wont,accepted the listing at its word and accordingly declined to approve a generic product.the generic manufacturer sued to delete the improper listing from the orange book,but the federal circuit held that the amendments did not allow such a right of action.see,at.as the ftc noted,that ruling meant that the only option for generic manufacturers in mylan situation was to file a paragraph iv certification triggering an infringement suit and then wait out the usual period before the fda could approve an anda.see ftc study.
congress responded to these abuses by creating a mechanism,in the form of a legal counterclaim,for generic manufacturers to challenge patent information a brand has submitted to the fda.see medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,stat.the provision authorizes an anda applicant sued for patent infringement to 
assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the brand to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the brand under subsection b or c of on the ground that the patent does not claim either 
aa the drug for which the brand nda was approved or 
bb an approved method of using the drug.j c ii i.
the counterclaim thus enables a generic competitor to obtain a judgment directing a brand to correct or delete certain patent information that is blocking the fda approval of a generic product.this case raises the question whether the counterclaim is available to fix a brand use code.
the parties to this case sell or seek to sell the diabetes drug repaglinide.respondents collectively novo manufacture prandin,the version of the drug.the fda has approved three uses of prandin to treat diabetes repaglinide by itself repaglinide in combination with metformin and repaglinide in combination with thiazolidinediones tzds.petitioners collectively caraco wish to market a generic version of the drug for two of those uses.
novo originally owned a patent for the repaglinide compound,known as the patent,but it expired in.in,novo also acquired a patent for the drug,called the patent,which does not expire until.that patent the one at issue here claims a method for treating diabetes by administering repaglinide in combination with metformin.ca fed.thus,novo currently holds a patent for one of the three uses of repaglinide its use with metformin.but novo holds no patent for the use of repaglinide with tzds or its use alone.
in,caraco filed an anda seeking to market a generic version of repaglinide.at that time,the orange book entry for prandin listed both the patent the drug compound and the patent the use of the drug with metformin.caraco assured the fda that it would not market its generic drug until the patent expired,thus making that patent irrelevant to the fda review of the anda.caraco filed a paragraph iv certification for the remaining,patent,stating that it was invalid or would not be infringed.j a vii iv see supra,at.in accord with the patent statute,novo treated this filing as an act of infringement and brought suit.
when caraco filed its anda,novo use code for the patent represented that the patent covered u se of repaglinide in combination with metformin to lower blood glucose.at.the fda therefore advised caraco that if it did not seek to market repaglinide for use with metformin,it could submit a section viii statement.that would allow caraco,assuming its anda was otherwise in order,to market its generic drug for the other two uses.caraco took the fda cue and in submitted a section viii statement,with proposed labeling carving out novo patented metformin therapy.see app.
before the fda took further action,however,novo changed its use code for the patent.the new use code describes a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type diabetes.at.because that code indicates that the patent protects all three approved methods of using repaglinide to treat diabetes,caraco proposed of metformin therapy was no longer sufficient even with that exclusion,caraco label now overlapped with novo use code on the other two uses.and caraco could not carve out those uses as well,because at that point nothing would be left for it to market.the fda has approved repaglinide for only three uses,and novo use code encompassed them all.the fda accordingly informed caraco that it could no longer employ section viii to bring its drug to market.
caraco responded to novo new,preclusive use code by filing a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement suit.the counterclaim sought an order requiring novo to correct its use code on the ground that the patent does not claim two approved methods of using repaglinide alone and in combination with tzds.j c ii i see supra,at.that order would permit the fda to accept caraco proposed label and approve the company anda.the district court granted summary judgment to caraco,enjoining novo to correct its inaccurate description of the patent by submitting a new form to the fda that would reinstat e its former use code.app.to pet.for cert.
the court of appeals reversed,holding that caraco lacked a statutory basis to assert a counterclaim.at.the court first read the statutory phrase the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug to require caraco to demonstrate that the patent does not claim any approved method of use.see,at a n approved method means any approved method because the patent covers one approved method of use repaglinide in combination with metformin the counterclaim was unavailable.the court further ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use codes because they are not patent information submitted by the brand under subsection b or c.on the federal circuit view,that information consists only of the patent number and expiration date.see,at.judge dyk dissented.he would have read the phrase the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug to include situations where,as here,the use code wrongly indicates that the patent covers one or more particular approved methods of use.see,at.and he would have construed patent information submitted under subsection b or c to include use codes.see,at 
we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
we begin where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair enterprises.this case requires us to construe two statutory phrases.first,we must decide when a patent does not claim an approved method of using a drug.second,we must determine the content of patent information submitted under subsection b or c of.we consider both of those questions against the backdrop of yet a third statutory phrase,providing that the remedy for a prevailing counterclaimant is an order requiring the brand to correct or delete that patent information.and we consider each question in the context of the entire statute.see robinson shell oil,statutory interpretation focuses on the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole we can not say that the counterclaim clause is altogether free of ambiguity.but when we consider statutory text and context together,we conclude that a generic manufacturer in caraco position can use the counterclaim 
an anda applicant sued for patent infringement may bring a counterclaim on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug.j c ii i.the parties debate the meaning of this language.novo like the federal circuit reads not an to mean not any,contending that the counterclaim is available only if the listed patent does not claim any or,equivalently,claims no approved method of using the drug.brief for respondents internal quotation marks omitted.by that measure,caraco may not bring a counterclaim because novo patent claims the use of repaglinide with metformin.in contrast,caraco reads not an to mean not a particular one,so that the statute permits a counterclaim whenever the patent does not claim a method of use for which the anda applicant seeks to market the drug.on that view,the counterclaim is available here indeed,is available twice over because the patent does not claim the use of repaglinide with tzds or its use alone.
truth be told,the answer to the general question what does not an mean is it depends the meaning of the phrase turns on its context.see johnson united states,slip,at ultimately,context determines meaning not an sometimes means not any,in the way novo claims.if your spouse tells you he is late because he did not take a cab,you will infer that he took no cab at all but took the bus instead.if your child admits that she did not read a book all summer,you will surmise that she did not read any book but went to the movies a lot.and if a friend bemoans that the new york mets do not have a chance of winning the world series,you will gather that the team has no chance whatsoever because they have no hitting.but now stop a moment.suppose your spouse tells you that he got lost because he did not make a turn.you would understand that he failed to make a particular turn,not that he drove from the outset in a straight line.suppose your child explains her mediocre grade on a college exam by saying that she did not read an assigned text.you would infer that she failed to read a specific book,not that she read nothing at all on the syllabus.and suppose a lawyer friend laments that in her last trial,she did not prove an element of the offense.you would grasp that she is speaking not of all the elements,but of a particular one.the examples could go on and on,but the point is simple enough when it comes to the meaning of not an,context matters 
and the statutory context here supports caraco position.as described earlier and as congress understood,a single drug may have multiple methods of use,only one or some of which a patent covers.see,b requiring that an nda applicant file information about any patent which claims the drug or which claims a method of using such drug emphasis added.the amendments authorize the fda to approve the marketing of a generic drug for particular unpatented uses and section viii provides the mechanism for a generic company to identify those uses,so that a product with a label matching them can quickly come to market.the statutory scheme,in other words,contemplates that one patented use will not foreclose marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones.within that framework,the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brand assertion of rights over whichever discrete use or uses the generic company wishes to pursue.that assertion,after all,is the thing blocking the generic drug entry on the market.the availability of the counterclaim thus matches the availability of fda approval under the statute a company may bring a counterclaim to show that a method of use is unpatented because establishing that fact allows the fda to authorize a generic drug via section viii.
consider the point as applied to this case.caraco wishes to market a generic version of repaglinide for two and only two uses.under the statute,the fda could approve caraco application so long as no patent covers those uses,regardless whether a patent protects yet a third method of using the drug.novo agrees that caraco could bring a counterclaim if novo assertion of patent protection for repaglinide lacked any basis for example,if novo held no patent,yet claimed rights to the pair of uses for which caraco seeks to market its drug.but because novo has a valid patent on a different use,novo argues that caraco counterclaim evaporates.and that is so even though,once again,caraco has no wish to market its product for that patented use and the fda stands ready,pursuant to the statute,to approve caraco product for the other two.to put the matter simply,novo thinks the counterclaim disappears because it has a patent for a method of use in which neither caraco nor the fda is interested at all.it would take strong evidence to persuade us that this is what congress wrought.eli lilly,at.that not an sometimes but sometimes not means not any is not enough.
novo argues that our reading must be wrong because congress could have expressly impose d additional qualifications on the term an approved method of us e and indeed did so in another place in the statute.brief for respondents j c ii i.novo points here to section viii itself,which applies when the brand patent does not claim a use for which the anda applicant is seeking approval.j a viii emphasis added.but the mere possibility of clearer phrasing can not defeat the most natural reading of a statute if it could with all due respect to congress,we would interpret a great many statutes differently than we do.nor does congress use of more detailed language in another provision,enacted years earlier,persuade us to put the counterclaim clause at odds with its statutory context.that is especially so because we can turn this form of argument back around on novo.congress,after all,could have more clearly expressed novo proposed meaning in the easiest of ways by adding a single letter to make clear that not an really means not any.and indeed,congress used a not any construction in the very next subclause,enacted at the very same time.see j c ii ii subclause i does not authorize the assertion of a claim in any other civil action so if we needed any proof that congress knew how to say not any when it meant not any,here we find it.we think that sees,raises,and bests novo argument.
our more essential point,though,has less gamesmanship about it we think that the not any construction does not appear in the relevant counterclaim provision because congress did not mean what novo wishes it had.and we think that is so because congress meant as it usually does for the provision it enacted to fit within the statutory scheme here,by facilitating the approval of generic drugs under section viii.
novo contends that caraco counterclaim must fail for another,independent reason on its view as on the federal circuit,the counterclaim does not provide a way to correct use codes because they are not patent information submitted by the brand under subsection b or c of.once again,we disagree.
the statute does not define patent information,but a use code must qualify.it describes the method of use claimed in a patent.see cfr c ii p,e.that fits under any ordinary understanding of the language 
the more difficult question arises from the submitted under phrase.the subsections mentioned there b and c of require an nda applicant to submit specified information the patent number and the expiration date of any patent claiming the drug or a method of its use.b,c.according to novo,only that information comes within the counterclaim provision.but subsections b and c as well govern the regulatory process by which brands provide additional patent information to the fda,both before and after an nda is approved.in particular,those subsections provide the basis for the regulation requiring brands to submit use codes,see cfr in issuing that regulation,the fda noted that o ur principal legal authority is section of the act codified at,in conjunction with our general rulemaking authority.fed.reg.specifically referring to subsections b and c.and the form form on which brands submit their use codes states that the information appearing there is provided in accordance with section b and c.app.so use codes fall within the counterclaim ambit if the phrase submitted under reaches filings that not only subsections b and c themselves,but also their implementing regulations require.
several of our cases support giving under this broad meaning.for example,in eli lilly,at,we examined a similar statutory reference to the submission of information under a federal law which regulates the manufacture,use,or sale of drugs,e.we noted there that submitting information under a federal law suggests doing so in furtherance of or compliance with a comprehensive scheme of regulation.at.likewise,in ardestani ins,we held that a regulatory proceeding under section,b c i,meant any proceeding subject to,governed by,or conducted by reason of the authority of that statutory provision.
so too here.patent information submitted under subsection b or c most naturally refers to patent information provided as part of the comprehensive scheme of regulation premised on those subsections.eli lilly,at.it includes everything about patents that the fda requires brands to furnish in the proceedings subject to,governed by,or conducted by reason of the authority of b and c.ardestani,at.the breadth of the term under becomes particularly clear when compared with other phrases described in and prescribed by appearing in neighboring provisions.see,c patent information described in subsection b d patent information prescribed by subsection b those phrases denote a patent number and expiration date and nothing more.in contrast,the word under naturally reaches beyond that most barebones information to other patent materials the fda demands in the regulatory process.
once again,that congressional choice fits the broader statutory context.use codes are pivotal to the fda implementation of the amendments and no less so because a regulation,rather than the statute itself,requires their submission.recall that those amendments instruct the fda assuming other requirements are met to approve an anda filed with a section viii statement when it proposes to market a drug for only unpatented methods of use.to fulfill that charge,the fda must determine whether any patent covers a particular method of use and to do that,the agency which views itself as lacking expertise in patent matters,see supra,at,and relies on the use codes submitted in the regulatory process.see fed.reg.an overbroad use code therefore throws a wrench into the fda ability to approve generic drugs as the statute contemplates.so it is not surprising that the language congress used in the counterclaim provision sweeps widely enough to embrace that filing.
another aspect of the counterclaim provision its description of available remedies dispatches whatever remains of novo arguments.according to the statute,a successful claimant may obtain an order requiring the brand to correct or delete its patent information.j c ii i.our interpretation of the statute gives content to both those remedies it deletes a listing from the orange book when the brand holds no relevant patent and corrects the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patent scope.by contrast,novo two arguments would all but read the term correct out of the statute.
consider first how novo contention would accomplish that result.recall that on novo view,a counterclaim can succeed only if the patent challenged does not claim either the drug or any approved method of using it.see supra,at.but when a generic manufacturer makes that showing,the remedy must be to delete the listing no correction would be enough.novo agrees with that proposition a t bottom,novo avers,the counterclaim is a delisting provision.brief for respondents.but that raises the obvious question why did congress also include the term correct in the statute 
novo can come up with just one answer the counterclaim,it proposes,can correct erroneous patent numbers.imagine,for example,that novo mistakenly entered the number,instead of,when submitting information about its repaglinide patent for publication in the orange book.then,novo suggests,caraco could bring a counterclaim to challenge the inaccurate listing on the ground that does not claim any method of use,and the remedy would be correct ion substituting an for a.but we think novo admission that this scenario would be unusual,tr.of oral arg,considerably understates the matter.as novo concedes,brands have every incentive to provide the right patent number in the first place,and to immediately rectify any error brought to their attention.see,at.by doing so,they place both generic companies and the fda on notice of their patents and thereby prevent infringement.and conversely,generics have little or no incentive to bring a counterclaim that will merely replace one digit in the orange book with another.so we doubt congress created a legal action to correct patent information just to fix such scrivener errors.see,trw andrews,refusing to adopt an interpretation of a statute that would render a piece of it insignificant,if not wholly superfluous internal quotation marks omitted.that would have been,in the most literal sense,to make a federal case out of nothing.
the same problem afflicts novo alternative contention that patent information submitted under subsection b or c includes only numbers and expiration dates and not use codes.once again,we can not think congress included the remedy of correct ion so that courts could expunge typos in patent numbers.and not even novo has proffered a way for the counterclaim to correct an erroneous expiration date.suppose,for example,that a brand incorrectly lists the expiration date of a valid patent as rather than.the counterclaim would be useless it authorizes a remedy only on the ground that the listed patent does not claim the drug or an approved method of using it and notwithstanding the wrong expiration date,this patent does so.alternatively,suppose the brand lists a patent as having a expiration date when in fact the patent has already lapsed.then,a generic manufacturer could bring a counterclaim alleging that the patent no longer claims the drug or a method of using it but the appropriate remedy would be deletion,not correction,of the brand listing.novo reading of patent information,like its reading of not an,effectively deletes the term correct from the statute.
novo finally advances two arguments relating to the counterclaim drafting history.neither contention,however,overcomes the statutory text and context.indeed,consideration of the provision background only strengthens our view of its meaning.
novo first contends that our interpretation of the statute effectively resurrect s the scheme rejected by congress.brief for respondents quoting smith united states.in,novo notes,congress failed to pass a bill that would have required brands to file specified patent information,including,for patents,a description of the approved use covered by the patent claim.a,engrossed bill.that bill would have allowed a generic company to bring its own civil action not merely a counterclaim in ongoing litigation to delete or correct the information filed,at.the senate approved the bill,but the house of representatives took no action on it.novo argues that because this failed legislation would have allowed a generic company to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent,we can not read the statute congress eventually enacted as doing so.
we disagree.we see no reason to assume,as novo does,that congress rejected because it required brands to submit patent information beyond a number and expiration date.indeed,novo argument highlights the perils of relying on the fate of prior bills to divine the meaning of enacted legislation.a bill can be proposed for any number of reasons,and it can be rejected for just as many others.solid waste agency of northern cook cty.army corps of engineers.contained numerous items,including a title on importing prescription drugs no controversy there,that may have caused its failure.see,tit.ii.moreover,what criticism there was of the bill mechanism for challenging brands patent claims focused not on the specification of patent information,but instead on the creation of an independent cause of action stronger medicine than the counterclaim congress ultimately adopted and finally,novo ignores a likely cause for the redrafting of the provision on submitting information.between demise and the counterclaim enactment,the fda issued a rule requiring brands to supply material concerning patents,including use codes.the drafters of the counterclaim provision knew about that rule and had no need to duplicate its list of mandated filings.so the drafting history does not support novo conclusion.if anything,the statute evolution indicates that congress determined to enforce the fda new listing provisions,including its requirement,through the new counterclaim.
novo next argues that congress established the counterclaim only to solve the problem raised by the federal circuit decision in mylan,the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the orange book.in mylan,as earlier described,a generic company alleged that a brand had listed a patent that covered neither the approved drug nor any method of using it,and brought an action seeking delisting.see supra,at.the federal circuit held that no such action was available,even assuming the allegation was true.because several legislators saw mylan as exemplif ying brands perceived abuse of the fda patent listing practices,brief for respondents,novo contends that we should construe the counterclaim provision to aid only a generic company that finds itself in the same position as mylan was in mylan,supp.brief in opposition.
once again,we think not.maybe mylan triggered the legislative effort to enact a counterclaim,or maybe it did by the time congress acted,it also had at hand an ftc study broadly criticizing brands patent listings and an fda rule designed to address the very same issue.see supra,at.but even assuming mylan prompted the proposal of the counterclaim,whether that alone accounted for its enactment is quite a different question.eli lilly,at,emphasis deleted.here,we think mylan alerted congress to a broader problem that generic companies generally had no avenue to challenge the accuracy of brands patent listings,and that the fda therefore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs to market.the proof of that lies in the statute itself where the best proof of what congress means to address almost always resides.as we have described,the statute text and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only as in mylan when the patent listing is baseless,but also as here when it is overbroad.see supra,at.in particular,congress decision to allow a counterclaimant to seek correct ion of patent information explodes novo theory,because the remedy for a impropriety is complete delisting.
and to make matters still easier,congress equation of the two situations the one in mylan and the one here makes perfect sense.whether a brand lists a patent that covers no use or describes a patent on one use as extending to others,the brand submits misleading patent information to the fda.in doing so,the brand equally exploits the fda determination that it can not police patent claims.and the brand action may in either case delay or block approval of a generic drug that infringes no patent and that under the statute should go to market.see su pra,at.that is the danger caraco faces here,as much as it was the threat in mylan novo seeks to preclude caraco from selling repaglinide for unpatented uses until,when novo patent on a different use expires.
indeed,the need for the counterclaim is greater here than in mylan.when a brand lists a patent that covers no use,a generic company has a pathway aside from the counterclaim to challenge the listing.as described earlier,the company may make a paragraph iv certification stating that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic drug.j a vii iv see supra,at.if the brand sues,the generic company can argue that its product would not infringe the patent.using the counterclaim may enable a generic manufacturer to obtain delisting more quickly,see tr.of oral arg.but even without it,the company can eventually get a judgment of enabling the fda to approve its anda.in contrast,where as here a brand files an overbroad use code,a generic company can not use paragraph iv litigation to that end.a paragraph iv certification unlike a section viii statement requires the generic company to propose labeling identical to the brand it can not carve out any uses.see supra,at.and that proposed label will necessarily infringe because it will include the use s on which the brand does have a patent.so here,a paragraph iv suit can not lead to a judgment enabling fda approval the counterclaim offers the only route to bring the generic drug to market for uses.novo view eliminates the counterclaim where it has the greatest value.
the statutory counterclaim we have considered enables courts to resolve patent disputes so that the fda can fulfill its statutory duty to approve generic drugs that do not infringe patent rights.the text and context of the provision demonstrate that a generic company can employ the counterclaim to challenge a brand overbroad use code.we accordingly hold that caraco may bring a counterclaim seeking to correct novo use code on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug indeed,does not claim two.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice sotomayor,concurring.
the court today interprets the counterclaim set forth in j c ii i to permit generic manufacturers to force brand manufacturers to correct inaccurate use codes.while i too find the counterclaim not free of ambiguity,ante,at,i join the court opinion because i agree this is the most sensible reading in light of the existing regulatory scheme.i write separately to add the following observations.
i first underscore that the counterclaim can only lessen the difficulties created by an overly broad use code it can not fix them.the statutory scheme is designed to speed the introduction of generic drugs to market.see ante,at citing eli lilly medtronic.to that end,the statute provides for the rapid approval of a drug that a generic manufacturer seeks to market for unpatented methods of use.the manufacturer need only submit an abbreviated new drug application anda with a section viii statement and a proposed label that carves out from the brand manufacturer label any patented methods of use.see ante,at.so long as the use code is not overly broad and all else is in order,fda may approve the application without requiring any further steps relating to the patent,and the generic drug may reach the public without undue delay
