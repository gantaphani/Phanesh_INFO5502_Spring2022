opinion of the court 
appellant james fallon was convicted by a jury of one count of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.this is an appeal of the district court judgment of conviction and sentence entered on october,
fallon was the president of derma genesis,a company which manufactured and distributed microdermabradors under the name derma peel.dermabradors are classified by the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca as class i medical devices a device which carries the lowest amount of medical risk.see generally a.prior to february,manufacturers who wished to market a class i device were required to first obtain a k letter from the food and drug administration,indicating that the device was substantially equivalent to an existing device previously approved for distribution.see generally k 
in november,the fda received notice that fallon was marketing derma peel without obtaining the requisite clearance from the fda.by letter dated november,a representative of the fda informed fallon that this practice was prohibited fallon acknowledged receipt of the letter and filed a formal clearance application on november.on that date,the fda assigned a unique number to his application,and sent fallon a letter instructing him to use the number on all future correspondence.
in january,prior to obtaining k approval from the fda,fallon met with a group of salesman in an effort to promote the derma peel.in attendance was michael coffelt,director of medical sales for a company in the process of merging with american business leasing abl.coffelt was impressed with fallon presentation and recommended to abl that it enter into a vendor agreement with derma genesis,whereby abl would buy derma peel devices and lease them to interested doctors.
abl credit personnel were reluctant to do business with derma genesis because fallon had previously filed for bankruptcy protection,derma genesis was a company with an unproven track record and unproven equipment,and because fallon failed to provide certain requested tax and social security information.coffelt,however,lobbied abl to reconsider its decision.
on february,fallon faxed to abl,among other things,a purported k clearance letter on fda letterhead.the government evidence at trial demonstrated definitively that the letter was a fabrication.the november,date stamp of the letter was lifted from an earlier fda correspondence to fallon,which cautioned him not to market derma peel until he had obtained prior fda clearance.further,although the letter was purportedly signed by consumer safety officer margaret shuppers,fda records reveal that there has never been an fda employee by that name.finally,the letter bore fallon unique k application number,even though that number was not assigned to him until november,two weeks after the november date stamp 
in february of,alan frankel,president of abl,authorized the company to enter into a relationship with fallon over the next several months,abl purchased microdermabradors from derma genesis which it planned to lease to physicians.abl relationship with derma genesis ended in october,after abl determined that the value of the devices had dropped significantly over the course of the year and that an abnormally high percentage of doctors were behind on their lease payments.
on june,fallon was indicted by a grand jury and charged with one count of wire fraud,in violation of,and four counts of mail fraud,in violation of.a superseding indictment was returned on october,adding one count of witness tampering in violation of.the basis for the fraud charges was the fabricated fda clearance letter.
at trial,frankel testified that abl had a policy of requiring fda clearance from medical device manufacturers which he claimed he had brought with him from his prior employer,capelco leasing.he further testified that he explicitly required fallon to produce a k clearance letter as a condition to doing business with derma genesis.he stated that documentary proof of this statement was lost at the time of trial.
fallon attempted to rebut frankel testimony through the testimony of michael coffelt and joseph nachbin.coffelt testified that in his fifteen years experience in the medical leasing business,he had never requested nor seen an fda clearance letter prior to this case.
nachbin,a former vice president and chief operating officer at capelco,was proffered as a fact witness to testify to the customs and practices of the medical leasing industry and to rebut frankel assertion that capelco had a policy of requiring fda clearance before entering into leasing relationships with medical device suppliers.before allowing nachbin to testify at trial,the district court made an in limine inquiry into his testimony outside the jury presence.
although the court allowed nachbin to testify to his personal experience at capelco,it prohibited him from offering testimony on the custom and practice of the medical leasing industry,stating that 
i will not permit him to testify as to the industry,because he does not speak for an d can not speak for the entire industry.and,beyond that,he can not say that a particular company could not have,for a particular product or particular circumstances presented by the manufacturer,required a k clearance letter.and,he ca say what was,in fact,done by this particular leasing company.
at the conclusion of trial the district court dismissed count six witness tampering for insufficient evidence.the jury then returned a verdict of guilty on count one wire fraud and on counts two through four mail fraud.fallon was found not guilty on count five mail fraud.on october,fallon was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months and one day to be followed by a month term of supervised release,a fine of,and restitution in the amount of.
fallon filed a timely notice of appeal.
fallon argues that the district court committed reversible error by precluding him from eliciting nachbin testimony regarding the custom and practice of the medical leasing industry and the court erred with respect to its order of restitution by adopting an unlimited theory of but for causation 
exclusion of nachbin custom and practice testimony 
we review a district court decision to admit or exclude testimony for abuse of discretion.see united states pelullo,cir.to the extent that these rulings are based on an interpretation of the federal rules of evidence,however,our review is plenary.id.
the critical issue at fallon trial was the materiality of the fabricated k letter.the jury was instructed,as part of the mail fraud counts,that 
t he government has to prove that the scheme to defraud employed false material misrepresentations.false embraces the concept that there was a fake fda letter.material means that the statement would have a natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision of a person or entity to which it is addressed.that it would have the tendency and is capable of influencing or causing another person to rely upon it,to act because of it.

fallon sought to introduce nachbin testimony regarding the custom and practice of the industry to rebut frankel assertions that abl had a policy of requiring fda clearance from device manufacturers which he had brought from capelco,and that he himself relied upon the fabricated k letter in entering into the business relationship with derma genesis.
