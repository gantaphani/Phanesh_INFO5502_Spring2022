steven and marcia thom the thoms appeal from an order granting squibb motion for summary judgment.we have jurisdiction over this products liability action pursuant to,and we reverse.
background 
the thoms allege that thom suffered personal injuries as a result of his use of serzone nefazodone,a prescription antidepressant medication manufactured by squibb bms.according to the thoms,thom use of serzone caused him to develop priapism,a p ersistent erection of the penis,accompanied by pain and tenderness,resulting from a pathologic condition rather than sexual desire.stedman medical dictionary ed.as a result of his priapism,thom has permanent penile injury.
thom was prescribed serzone in august by his physician,mark schueler,to treat his sleep problems and depression.this was the first time that schueler had prescribed serzone.schueler learned of serzone at a hospital presentation that he believes was given by a representative of bms.at.however,he did not stay for the entire presentation.id.at.
serzone contains an package insert,which was reproduced in the physician desk reference pdr,that discusses the possible complications of serzone use,including priapism.at the time serzone was prescribed to plaintiff,the package insert read 
precautions 
while priapism did not occur during premarketing experience with nefazodone,rare reports of priapism have been received since market introduction.a causal relationship to nefazodone has not been established see adverse reactions section.if patients present with prolonged or inappropriate erections,they should discontinue therapy immediately and consult their physicians.if the condition persists for more than hours,a urologist should be consulted to determine appropriate management.
adverse reactions 
postintroduction clinical experience 
post marketing experience with serzone has shown an adverse experience profile similar to that seen during the premarketing evaluation of nefazodone.voluntary reports of adverse events temporally associated with serzone have been received since market introduction that are not listed above and for which a causal relationship has not been established.these include 
rare occurrences of priapism see precautions section.
as discussed in more detail below,the record is unclear as to whether schueler read this package insert prior to prescribing serzone to thom.however,it is uncontested that schueler did not discuss the possibility of priapism with thom prior to prescribing it.at.
bms argued it was entitled to summary judgment because the thoms could not establish that bms failed to adequately warn that priapism was associated with serzone use and the thoms could not establish that any failure to warn was the proximate cause of their injuries.
discussion 
summary judgment standard 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court under federal rule of civil procedure c.ashley creek phosphate chevron,usa,cir.
summary judgment is proper if the movant demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in applying this standard,we view the factual record and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d west communications,cir.an issue is genuine if there is sufficient evidence on each side so that a rational trier of fact could resolve the issue either way.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue of fact is material if under the substantive law it is essential to the proper disposition of the claim.id.in this diversity matter,we must apply the substantive law of the forum state.erie tompkins.
the movant bears the initial burden of making a prima facie demonstration of the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.see celotex catrett,d.in so doing,a movant that will not bear the burden of persuasion at trial need not negate the nonmovant claim.id.at.such a movant may make its prima facie demonstration simply by pointing out to the court a lack of evidence for the nonmovant on an essential element of the nonmovant claim.id.
if the movant carries this initial burden,the nonmovant that would bear the burden of persuasion at trial may not simply rest upon its pleadings the burden shifts to the nonmovant to go beyond the pleadings and set forth specific facts that would be admissible in evidence in the event of trial from which a rational trier of fact could find for the nonmovant.e.
b.the learned intermediary doctrine in wyoming 
bms contends,and the district court agreed,that as a drug manufacturer and distributor,its duty to warn extends only to physicians.in turn,physicians,based upon knowledge of their own patients,bear the final responsibility for the decision to prescribe medications and to warn the patient of possible side effects.known as the learned intermediary doctrine,this doctrine shields manufacturers of prescription drugs from liability where the manufacturer adequately warns a patient prescribing physician of the potential risks inherent in the use of the product.edwards basel.the district court predicted that the wyoming supreme court would adopt the learned intermediary doctrine.
the learned intermediary doctrine derives from of the restatement second of torts,see,edwards,at,which the wyoming supreme court has adopted in its entirety.ogle caterpillar tractor.section provides that a seller of a defective,unreasonably dangerous product is strictly liable for physical harm to a consumer.comment k to establishes that this rule does not apply to unavoidably unsafe products.these are 
products which,in the present state of human knowledge,are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.these are especially common in the field of drugs such a product,properly prepared,and accompanied by proper directions and warning,is not defective,nor is it unreasonably dangerous.
restatement second of torts cmt.
other jurisdictions have adopted the learned intermediary doctrine in prescription medicine cases,see vitanza upjohn,collecting cases,and the district of wyoming has predicted that wyoming would follow suit.see jacobs dista products,the drug manufacturer liability to plaintiff ended when it imparted adequate warnings to the physician.in addition,the tenth circuit has implied in an analogous case that wyoming would adopt the doctrine.see haste am.home products,cir t he defendant discharged its duty to plaintiffs by the warnings to the veterinarians.
the thoms main arguments against application of the learned intermediary doctrine are the wyoming supreme court and legislature have not specifically adopted the doctrine,despite a wyoming district court prediction fourteen years ago that it would bms provision of a patient information sheet to the plaintiff via schueler constitutes a gratuitous undertaking,subjecting bms to liability and the policy of wyoming,in light of the wyoming comparative fault statute.stat.ann,would not immunize drug manufacturers.
first,silence on the part of the state means only that it has not had occasion to review the matter,not that it disagrees with the federal court interpretation of state law.although the wyoming supreme court has not to date acknowledged the learned intermediary doctrine,neither has it denied the doctrine it simply has not ruled on the issue.we can and must safely assume that the delay,in the grandest traditions of all courts,is due to the absence of a well presented and soundly argued case,rather than indicative of some invented implication that the doctrine does not exist.rawson sears,roebuck,cir mckay,dissenting.
second,the voluntary duty doctrine is exactly what the learned intermediary doctrine seeks to avoid.thus,even if a drug manufacturer provides pamphlets for distribution to the ultimate drug user,t he patient is expected to place primary reliance on the physician judgment,and to follow his advice and instructions as to use of the drug.seley searle,ohio,see also spychala searle,labs.medrano,presto sandoz pharms.
