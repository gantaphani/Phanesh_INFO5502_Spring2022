on summary judgment,the united states district court for the southern district of new york found in favor of plaintiffs eisai,and eisai,collectively eisai with respect to the validity and enforceability of patent patent.eisai teva pharms.usa,d sj validity order eisai reddy,civ,sj enforceability order.after a bench trial,the district court found that reddy laboratories,and reddy laboratories,collectively reddy and teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva had failed to prove the remaining allegations of inequitable conduct,and that eisai had established that reddy and teva infringed eisai patent.eisai reddy,civ,wl may,trial order.because the district court correctly determined that the patent is over the proffered prior art and that eisai alleged acts during prosecution did not rise to the level of inequitable conduct,this court affirms.
the patent claims rabeprazole and its salts.rabeprazole is part of a class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors,which suppress gastric acid production by inhibiting action of the enzyme h ase.the distinctions between rabeprazole and its salts are not relevant for this appeal.therefore this court refers to rabeprazole and its salts collectively as rabeprazole.rabeprazole sodium salt is the active ingredient in aciphex,a pharmaceutical approved in by the fda for the treatment of duodenal ulcers,heartburn,and associated disorders.aciphex has been a commercial success,garnering over billion in worldwide yearly sales.
reddy and teva each filed abbreviated new drug applications andas under the act,and e,seeking to manufacture a generic version of aciphex before the expiration of the patent.because filing an anda is an artificial,but legally cognizable,act of patent infringement,see glaxo group apotex,eisai filed suit against reddy and teva.eisai also sued mylan laboratories and mylan pharmaceuticals collectively mylan,another anda filer,but that proceeding was stayed pending the outcome of these actions.mylan agreed to be bound by the final judgments and any appeals in these cases.eisai,mylan,civ.both reddy and teva conceded infringement of claims of the patent,but asserted that the patent is unenforceable for inequitable conduct.trial order at.reddy stipulated to the validity of all six of the patent claims,id.at,but teva argued before the district court and maintains on appeal that the patent is invalid for obviousness.both reddy and teva appeal the trial court judgments of enforceability.neither reddy nor teva appeals the trial court judgment of infringement.this court has jurisdiction under a.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment without deference.dayco,total containment.obviousness under a is ultimately a legal question,based on underlying factual determinations.see upjohn.the factual determinations underpinning the legal conclusion of obviousness include the scope and content of the prior art,the level of ordinary skill in the art,the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art,and evidence of secondary factors,also known as objective indicia of.graham john deere,d.thus,in reviewing a district court summary judgment of,this court reviews the record for genuine issues of material fact without deference,bearing in mind the movant burden to prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.see monarch knitting mach.sulzer morat gmbh.
where,as here,the patent at issue claims a chemical compound,the analysis of the third graham factor the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art often turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior art compounds.see eli lilly zenith goldline,noting that,for a chemical compound,a prima facie case of obviousness requires structural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions quoting in re dillon,en banc.obviousness based on structural similarity thus can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound a lead compound in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound.see takeda chem.indus.alphapharm.in keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry,ksr int l teleflex,d,the requisite motivation can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the art.see aventis pharma deutschland gmbh lupin.rather it is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior art compounds possess a sufficiently close relationship to create an expectation,in light of the totality of the prior art,that the new compound will have similar properties to the old.id.quoting dillon,at.
teva asserts that a combination of three prior art references renders the patent obvious european patent owned by takeda,claiming lansoprazole ep united states patent to junggren,claiming omeprazole patent and an article by brändström,et,entitled structure activity relationships of substituted benzimidazoles brändström.ep teaches,inter alia,the ulcer treatment compound lansoprazole.lansoprazole differs structurally from rabeprazole at the on the pyridine ring,as indicated in the diagram below.lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy substituent,whereas rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy substituent.
appellant teva br.at.otherwise,the two compounds are identical.see sj validity order at.both rabeprazole and lansoprazole are asymmetrically substituted with respect to the on the pyridine ring because the substituent at the a methyl group in both compounds is not the same as the substituent at the a hydrogen in both compounds.
the patent discloses a broad class of gastric acid inhibiting compounds,including omeprazole,the first commercial proton pump inhibitor,sold as prilosec.although sharing the same basic structure,omeprazole is structurally farther afield from rabeprazole than is lansoprazole.for instance,omeprazole pyridine ring is symmetrically substituted and has a methoxy group at the.
finally,brändström describes a class of compounds having a core the brändström core structure 
rabeprazole,lansoprazole,and omeprazole are all brändström core structure compounds.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to teva,this court assumes that as per ep,lansoprazole is twenty times superior to omeprazole for action,as measured by an gastric lesion assay in rats.this court also assumes that lansoprazole has certain traits,including lipophilicity the ability of a compound to cross lipid membranes and low molecular weight,that would have made it desirable to a skilled artisan.
under these assumptions,one of skill in this art may have considered it a candidate for a lead compound in the search for compounds.to the contrary,the district court emphasized the differences between action and gastric acid inhibition.the trial court specifically noted that teva expert testified with respect to the ep data that t he level of acid secretion from these data can not be determined.sj validity order at.in this context,this court consults the counsel of ksr that any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed.at.thus lansoprazole candidacy as a starting point to develop new compounds versus new gastric acid inhibitors does not resolve the lead compound analysis,at least not in the absence of any contrary indications.takeda,at negative side effects could dissuade one of skill from using a particular compound as a starting point.
nonetheless,as the district court noted,the ep reference teaches at best that the fluorinated substituent of lansoprazole provides a special path to achieving lipophilicity.sj validity order at emphasis in original.and teva expert identified a separate reference teaching that groups increase lipophilicity.id.the record,however,shows no discernible reason for a skilled artisan to begin with lansoprazole only to drop the very feature,the fluorinated substituent,that gave this advantageous property.indeed,teva pharmacology expert,john forte,declined to opine on lansoprazole relevance to an examiner assessing the patentability of rabeprazole.at.and reddy pharmacology expert,simmy bank,testified in deposition that i thought lansoprazole had nothing to do with this trial.at.
this court notes that the district court did not rigidly limit teva obviousness arguments by forcing teva to select a single lead compound.rather teva alone selected lansoprazole as the anchor for its obviousness theory,not the district court.in ksr,the supreme court noted that an invention may have been obvious w hen there was a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there were a finite number of identified,predictable solutions.at tense changes supplied to clarify,as the court stated and as per,that the obviousness inquiry must rely on evidence available at the time of the invention,see takeda,at.the supreme court analysis in ksr thus relies on several assumptions about the prior art landscape.first,ksr assumes a starting reference point or points in the art,prior to the time of invention,from which a skilled artisan might identify a problem and pursue potential solutions.second,ksr presupposes that the record up to the time of invention would give some reasons,available within the knowledge of one of skill in the art,to make particular modifications to achieve the claimed compound.see takeda,at thus,in cases involving new chemical compounds,it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound.third,the supreme court analysis in ksr presumes that the record before the time of invention would supply some reasons for narrowing the prior art universe to a finite number of identified,predictable solutions.at.in pharmaceutical,mylan laboratories,this court further explained that this easily traversed,small and finite number of alternatives might support an inference of obviousness.to the extent an art is unpredictable,as the chemical arts often are,ksr focus on these identified,predictable solutions may present a difficult hurdle because potential solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable.
in other words,a prima facie case of obviousness for a chemical compound still,in general,begins with the reasoned identification of a lead compound.teva can not create a genuine issue of material fact on obviousness through the unsupported assertion that compounds other than lansoprazole might have served as lead compounds.further,the record contains no reasons a skilled artisan would have considered modification of lansoprazole by removing the fluorinated substituent as an identifiable,predictable solution.in sum,the district court properly concluded that the record did not support a case of obviousness of the patent as a matter of law.
as with other summary judgment issues,this court reviews a district court summary judgment on inequitable conduct without deference.innogenetics,abbott.in contrast,where a judgment regarding inequitable conduct follows a bench trial,this court reviews the district court findings of materiality and intent for clear error and its ultimate conclusion for an abuse of discretion.acco brands,aba locks mfrs.
inequitable conduct in prosecuting a patent application before the united states patent trademark office may take the form of an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact,a failure to disclose material information,or the submission of false material information,but in every case this false or misleading material communication or failure to communicate must be coupled with an intent to deceive.innogenetics,at citations omitted.materiality,defined as what a reasonable examiner would have considered important in deciding whether to allow a patent application,and intent are both questions of fact,and require proof by clear and convincing evidence.id.to satisfy the intent prong for unenforceability,the involved conduct,viewed in light of all the evidence,including evidence indicative of good faith,must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive.kingsdown med.consultants,hollister,en banc citing norton curtiss.gross negligence is not sufficient.id.this is a high bar.
on appeal,teva and reddy allege that eisai misled the patent office in five ways failing to disclose eisai own application,which claimed the ethyl homolog of rabeprazole compound shka withholding rejections from the application prosecution that also would have been applicable to the patent prosecution failing to disclose the prior art byk gulden patent wo submitting a misleading declaration the fujisaki declaration to the examiner of the patent and concealing lansoprazole from the examiner.the district court rejected the fifth assertion on summary judgment,sj enforceability order at,and the other four after a bench trial,trial order.
teva and reddy first and second allegations rely on eisai failure to disclose the fact of,and rejections contained in,eisai patent application claiming the ethyl homolog of rabeprazole.known to eisai scientists as compound shka,the ethyl homolog differs from rabeprazole as its name suggests.shka has one fewer methylene unit at the of the pyridine ring,giving shka an ethoxy group rather than a propoxy group at this position.the district court correctly pointed out that calling shka the ethyl homolog of rabeprazole in this case could carry a misleading implication with respect to inequitable conduct.the record supplies no evidence to suggest that eisai scientists ever referred to shka by this name,or thought of shka and rabeprazole primarily in relation to each other.trial order at.rather,the district court found credible the testimony that eisai scientists considered shka separately patentable,even though eisai ultimately did not pursue that course.id.at.furthermore,even if a provisional rejection might have issued in the prosecution of the patent due to the shka application,the district court found the materiality of this potential situation low,because applicants routinely overcome this type of rejection,id.at,by amending claims or filing a terminal disclaimer.nonetheless,the district court did not hold that the fact of the copendency of these two applications to be totally immaterial,accurately noting that applicants should be encouraged to disclose closely related applications.id.at.
while disclosure of the shka application to the patent office during the prosecution of the patent would have been prudent,eisai failure to do so is by no means fatal,for two reasons.first,the district court had ample evidence from which to conclude that the materiality of the shka application was low,as outlined above.second,the record is devoid of any real suggestion of intent to deceive the patent office,much less the clear and convincing evidence required to support a finding of inequitable conduct.
as for the rejections of the application that would have been relevant to the prosecution of the patent,the district court did not reach materiality because it discerned insufficient proof of intent to deceive.the district court found the documentary evidence faxed exchange between eisai employees shuhei miyazawa,one of the inventors of the patent,and mitsuo taniguchi,eisai patent agent,regarding miyazawa presentation to a pharmaceutical trade industry group to supply no compelling evidence of intent,based on testimony from both parties to the fax.witness credibility determinations lie squarely within the district court discretion.see medichem,rolabo.the district court was ultimately undisturbed by the communication based on its evaluation of the witness testimony presented,and this court sees no abuse of discretion.these facts certainly do not rise to the level of culpability this court required in kingsdown,at,to establish intent to deceive,or even gross negligence.
finally,the district court found that teva theory that eisai deliberately hid the ball from the patent office by separately filing the and prosecutions to be implausibly risky,given that such similar applications would usually be assigned to the same examiner in the same art unit.trial order at.the district court thus h
