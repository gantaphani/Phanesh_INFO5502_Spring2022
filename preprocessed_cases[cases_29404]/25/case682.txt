james crish and robert eckert collectively,crish appeal from the decision of the united states patent and trademark office pto board of patent appeals and interferences affirming the rejection of claims of united states patent application as unpatentable on the ground of anticipation under b.ex parte crish,appeal bd.pat.apps.interfs.july.we affirm.
background 
the claimed invention relates to purified dna molecules having promoter activity for the human involucrin gene hinv.the outermost layers of the skin and other stratifying squamous epithelia are composed of dead cells densely packed with a fibrous protein called keratin.involucrin is a protein that interacts with keratin and other intracellular proteins to form a envelope within the dead cells to strengthen the plasma membrane of the cells.
as the name indicates,the involucrin gene contains the dna sequence that codes for involucrin.crish application discloses that crish has isolated and sequenced the promoter sequence of hinv from plasmid using standard molecular biology techniques crish determined that the hinv promoter sequence was approximately kb kilobases in size.crish application also identified and numbered each nucleotide in the hinv promoter sequence and designated it as seq id no.
claims on appeal are all independent and read as follows 
a purified oligonucleotide comprising at least a portion of the nucleotide sequence of seq id no,wherein said portion consists of the nucleotide sequence from to of seq id no,and wherein said portion of the nucleotide sequence of seq id no has promoter activity.
a purified oligonucleotide comprising at least a portion of the nucleotide sequence of seq id no,wherein said portion consists of the nucleotide sequence from to of seq id no,and wherein said portion of the nucleotide sequence of seq id no has promoter activity.
a purified oligonucleotide comprising at least a portion of the nucleotide sequence of seq id no,wherein said portion consists of the nucleotide sequence from to of seq id no,and wherein said portion of the nucleotide sequence of seq id no has promoter activity.
during prosecution,the examiner rejected claims under b as being anticipated by a crish publication and a welter publication the crish publication lists james crish,coinventor on the application,as a coauthor.the crish publication analyzed the phenotype physical appearance of mice pups that had hinv including the promoter region microinjected into them at the embryonic stage.the microinjected hinv was isolated from the same plasmid referenced in crish patent application.the crish publication also disclosed the complete structure of hinv the promoter region of hinv used in the crish publication,however,was not sequenced,including the approximate size kb of the promoter region,and referenced an earlier publication disclosing how the plasmid was obtained.
the welter publication,which also lists james crish as a coauthor,identified five sites on the promoter region of hinv.the publication also confirmed that protein binding on two of those sites was necessary for the cell to begin transcribing the dna coding region.the hinv that was used for this study was from plasmid.although plasmids and are not identical,the pto contends that the promoter regions of hinv contained in both plasmids are identical.
in reply to the examiner rejection,crish argued,inter alia,that even if the crish and welter publications used the same plasmid as crish application,other workers have sequenced plasmid and have obtained promoter sequences different from seq id no.crish relies primarily on a publication that sequenced the hinv promoter sequence using the plasmid.in a declaration submitted to the pto,crish noted that sequenced a promoter region having nucleotides different from seq id no and that the promoter region was nucleotides longer than seq id no.accordingly,crish asserted that the same starting plasmid does not necessarily possess the same dna sequence.crish also argued that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have recognized seq id no in view of differing promoter sequences obtained by other workers.finally,crish contended that claims used the transition phrase consists and were,therefore,limited to only the recited numbered nucleotide sequences of seq id no.because neither the crish nor the welter publication specifically disclosed the nucleotide sequence of seq id no,according to crish,those publications could not be anticipatory.
the board affirmed the examiner final rejection.the board first rejected crish argument that the claims were limited to only the portions of seq id no specified in the claims and not the entire sequence.the board held that the transition language comprising allowed the claims to cover the entire involucrin gene plus the other portions of the plasmid,as long as the gene contained the specific portions of seq id no recited by the claim.the board also agreed with the examiner b rejection based on the crish and welter publications.crish application disclosed that seq id no was obtained by sequencing the same plasmid disclosed in the cited prior art references.although the plasmids used in the prior art were not sequenced,the board found that the plasmids used in the prior art would have necessarily possessed the same dna sequence as crish claimed oligonucleotides.although obtained a promoter sequence different from what crish claims,the board found that crish failed to demonstrate that the plasmids used in the crish and welter publications had a nucleotide sequence different from that in the plasmid used in his application.moreover,crish did not provide any evidence demonstrating that the dna sequence differences found in promoter sequence were not the result of mere experimental error.
crish now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.
discussion 
a determination that a claim is anticipated under b involves two analytical steps first,the board must interpret the claim language,where necessary.because the pto is entitled to give claims their broadest reasonable interpretation,our review of the board claim construction is limited to determining whether it was reasonable.in re morris.secondly,the board must compare the construed claim to a prior art reference and make factual findings that each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in that single prior art reference.celeritas techs.rockwell int l.we review those factual findings for substantial evidence.in re gartside,holding that factual determinations underlying an obviousness rejection under are reviewed for substantial evidence.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,id.at quoting consol.edison nlrb,and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence,id.quoting consolo fed.comm n,d.we agree with the pto that the claimed nucleotides were anticipated by the crish publication.
claim construction 
at the outset,crish challenges the board decision affirming the pto construction of the pending claims as expanding the scope of the claims to allow nucleotides in addition to the specified portions of seq id no.crish alleges that in affirming the pto construction,the board ignored the claims second transition term,consists.crish argues that during prosecution,the term consists was added to limit the claimed oligonucleotide to a specific dna sequence in the promoter region,as opposed to the entire seq id no.the parties do not otherwise dispute the construction of any terms of the pending claims.
we affirm the pto claim construction.during prosecution,as indicated above,the pto gives claims their broadest reasonable meaning in light of the specification.morris,at.moreover,it is that c omprising is a term of art used in claim language which means that the named elements are essential,but other elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim.genentech,chiron.following these principles,the board construction that does not limit the pending claims to the re
