before discovery of olanzapine,lilly discovered other drugs in the same family of compounds thienobenzodiazepines,namely clozapine,flumezapine,ethyl flumezapine and ethyl olanzapine compound.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.these compounds share a common structural nucleus as thienobenzodiazepines,namely a piperazine ring r,a benzene ring,and a thiophene ring.
lilly used clozapine to treat some forms of schizophrenia in the late and early.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.clozapine was thus the first atypical antipsychotic drug.structurally,olanzapine differs from clozapine in that olanzapine has a thiophene ring in place of the benzene ring in clozapine.id.at.olanzapine also has hydrogen in place of the chlorine on its benzene ring.id.at.
despite its advantages,researchers discovered in that clozapine caused an often fatal blood disorder agranulocytosis in one percent of patients.for that reason,lilly withdrew clozapine from the market.id.nevertheless,after a general failure to replace clozapine,reflected by many documented reports of promising compounds that failed either for lack of efficacy or toxic,the fda,in late,approved clozapine with careful.id.at.
until discovery of olanzapine,researchers attributed the efficacy of clozapine and typical antipsychotics to their neuroleptic substituent an group considered important to the antipsychotic activity of the compounds.id.fluorine f or chlorine cl such an electron withdrawing group.id.at.
olanzapine does not have a halogen atom,a fluorine f or chlorine cl atom.instead,it has a hydrogen atom h,which is not an electron withdrawing or electronegative group.id.at.
the prior art to olanzapine includes ethyl flumezapine and flumezapine,both disclosed in patent patent that issued in.the prior art also includes ethyl olanzapine compound.ethyl flumezapine caused widespread blood problems in dogs.id.at.flumezapine caused symptoms eps and an increase in liver enzymes and a muscle enzyme called creatine phosphokinase cpk.ethyl olanzapine caused a significant increase in cholesterol in female beagle dogs.id.thus,the prior art to olanzapine had significant detrimental side effects.
olanzapine differs structurally from flumezapine,by substitution of a hydrogen atom h for the fluorine atom f in flumezapine at the of the benzene ring.id.
olanzapine differs structurally from ethyl flumezapine by replacement of the fluorine atom f and ethyl group in ethyl flumezapine with a hydrogen atom h and methyl group respectively.id.
olanzapine differs structurally from its ethyl analog,compound ethyl olanzapine,by replacement of the ethyl group with a methyl group at the of the thiophene ring.id.
the trial court found that the defendants did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that claims,and of the patent were invalid as anticipated under.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.the primary reference the defendants cited for anticipation of these claims is an article entitled benzodiazepines as potential neuroleptics from the journal of medicinal chemistry in chakrabarti.jiban chakrabarti,linda horsman,et,benzodiazepines as potential neuroleptics,med.chem.
anticipation is a question of fact,including whether or not an element is inherent in the prior art.see in re schreiber.therefore,this court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly erroneous standard.atlas powder ireco.to anticipate,a prior art reference must place the inventive compound or composition in the possession of the public.in re brown.thus,the prior art reference must disclose each and every feature of the claimed invention,either explicitly or inherently.glaxo novopharm.
pointing to in re petering,and in re schaumann,ivax asserts that chakrabarti anticipated claim of the patent because it identified compounds from the same family of compounds thienobenzodiazepines.indeed,in petering,the board of patent appeals affirmed the examiner rejection of claims,and of the patent applicant application on isoalloxazines.at.however,in contrast to this case,the prior art in petering did more than make a broad generic disclosure.in petering,the prior art disclosed a limited number of specific preferences from a specifically defined group of isoalloxazines.id.as a result,petering actually disclosed to one skilled in the art a limited class of only some compounds,including,bmonohydroxyethyl isoalloxazine.schaumann,at citing petering,at.
similarly,the prior art in schaumann disclosed compounds,later further narrowed to,considering express preferences.additionally,the structural formula of this prior art contained but a single variable.at.thus,in schaumann,the prior art patent embraced a very limited number of closely related compounds and specifically described the claimed compound.at.thus,unlike this case,the prior art in both petering and schaumann expressly spelled out a definite and limited class of compounds that enabled a person of ordinary skill in the art to at once envisage each member of this limited class.schaumann,at petering,at.
by contrast,the number of compounds actually disclosed by chakrabarti numbers in the millions including all proposed alternative substituents.chakrabarti examined specific compounds as opposed to a genus of compounds in the benzodiazepine family and fourteen analogous benzodiazepines,which were created to compare activity.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.indeed,chakrabarti listed several preferred compounds and substituents,none of which resemble olanzapine 
for methyl,hydroxyethyl,or hydroxypropyl 
for fluorine,chlorine,or,no hydrogen and 
for methyl,or group.
id.at.five of the preferred individual compounds,and are more potent than clozapine scoring a car or higher and have effect.for those five preferred compounds,the chakrabarti authors expressed a preference for specific,complete compounds without any variation of the individual substituents on those molecules.chakrabarti also always expressed a preference for compounds fluorine or chlorine,not hydrogen.id.at.furthermore,compounds,and all have fluorine at the of the benzene ring.and though compound does have hydrogen at the of the benzene ring,it has a hydroxyethyl on its piperazine ring,unlike olanzapine.id.in sum,chakrabarti discloses nothing close to the claimed invention.
chakrabarti does provide a general structural formula with possible substituents of r,and,but it does not define them at all.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.no possible combination of those preferred substituents would lead to the components that make up olanzapine,because each would contain a fluorine or a chlorine.to make olanzapine from chakrabarti,one would have to depart from the teaching of the article and recombine the components of the specific illustrative compounds with hindsight.thus,chakrabarti does not anticipate because the article prefers complete compounds,not individual substituents,the article discloses no generic disclosure encompassing olanzapine or even stating that substituents on different compounds were interchangeable,and the article does not suggest transforming unpreferred compound into a preferred compound.thus,chakrabarti did not place olanzapine in the possession of the public.therefore,this court detects no clear error in the trial court finding of no anticipation.
the trial court found that the defendants did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that claims,and of the patent were invalid as obvious under.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.on appeal,ivax argues that the district court erred by erecting a threshold requirement that defendants establish a teaching or incentive to treat the closest prior art,compound as a lead compound.ivax also charges that the district court disregarded the structural characteristic of olanzapine as the adjacent homolog of compound,the suggestions to delete fluorine from the prior art compound flumezapine,and the observation that compound and flumezapine bracket olanzapine.
this court reviews obviousness without deference as a legal conclusion with underlying factual determinations which are reviewed for clear error.medichem,rolabo.the factual underpinnings are the scope and content of the prior art,the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention at the time of invention,the level of ordinary skill in the art,and the objective indicia of nonobviousness.see graham john deere,d panduit dennison.for a chemical compound,a prima facie case of obviousness requires structural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions.in re dillon,en banc.a reasonable expectation of success,not absolute predictability supports a conclusion of obviousness.in re longi.
for the following reasons,the district court did not err in reaching its conclusion.as succinctly stated by the district court 
in light of the general state of the art,including the teachings of the patent and chakrabarti,chakrabarti,and chakrabarti,one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected that replacing the fluorine atom with a hydrogen atom would produce a compound without sufficient antipsychotic activity.nichols tr.
while chakrabarti suggests that a chlorine atom in place of the fluorine atom would also enhance the compound activity,it does not specifically suggest that the same result could be obtained with a hydrogen atom.nichols tr.tx at.nor does anything in sullivan and franklin suggest the desirability of using a hydrogen atom at this position.nichols tx findings of fact iv.lf one were looking to replace the fluorine,one would replace the fluorine with other electronegative groups,not hydrogen.tx at lavoie tr.indeed,the art as a whole teaches directly away from using hydrogen because it is not an substituent.
findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at emphases added.though the patent disclosed compound,the patent expressed a preference for halogen containing compounds and specifically those with a halogenated substituent on the benzene ring in a location analogous to the chlorine in clozapine.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.these teachings do not suggest or make obvious,among other things,olanzapine hydrogen component.the prior art references at the time of this invention taught away from using a compound as a substituent in the benzene ring,exactly where olanzapine has a hydrogen atom.
furthermore,the trial court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have chosen compound as the beginning compound because it contained a hydrogen atom instead of a halogen atom,which again is not a preferred substituent.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.in addition,the prior art supplied no motivation to change the in compound to a.the prior art would have instead suggested modification by adding a halogen atom to supply the neuroleptic substituent as a trigger for antipsychotic activity.id.the district court found that,at the relevant time,a person with ordinary skill in the art would not have expected any reasonable chance of success with other compounds.id.at.
and though olanzapine is also the adjacent homolog of compound,patentability for a chemical compound does not depend only on structural similarity.comm r of patents deutsche vormals roessler.this court will not ignore a relevant property of a compound in the obviousness calculus.in re lalu.when claimed properties differ from the prior art,those differences,if unexpected and significant,may lead to nonobviousness.in re mehta,in re grabiak.in this case,the trial court noted some structural similarity of olanzapine and the prior art,but also accounted for the unexpected beneficial properties in olanzapine.
this case is similar in many respects to yamanouchi pharm,danbury pharmacal.in yamanouchi,this court held that the anda filer did not show obviousness of the famotidine compound 
the anda filer did not show sufficient motivation for one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention to take any one of the following steps,let alone the entire complex combination selecting example as a lead compound,combining the polar tail from example with the substituted heterocycle from tiotidine,and substituting the carbamoyl group in the intermediate compound with a sulfamoyl group to create famotidine.
id.likewise,in this case,the defendants have not shown that a person ordinarily skilled in this art would have selected compound as a lead compound because it contained hydrogen rather than fluorine or chlorine.at the time of invention,the state of the art would have directed the person of ordinary skill in the art away from unfluorinated compounds like compound.after all,the primary example of the state of the art at that time,the patent,did not provide any biological data for compound,suggested a preference for compounds,and identified a compound,ethyl flumezapine,as particularly active.findings of fact and conclusions of law,d at.moreover,as the trial court detailed,chakrabarti expressly taught that the addition of a fluorine or chlorine enhanced activity.it also taught that the unfluorinated compound was less active than the benchmark compound,clozapine.id.thus,rather than providing the requisite motivation,the prior art taught away from selecting compound as a lead compound for further development.
nevertheless,citing to an article entitled in vitro thiomethylation studies with flumezapine,written by sullivan and franklin s f article,ivax argues that removal of fluorine from flumezapine would have resulted in a default to a hydrogen atom.sullivan and franklin,in vitro thiomethylation studies with flumezapine,drug metabolism disposition.to the contrary,however,the s f article says nothing whatsoever about removal of fluorine.specifically,the article discusses the metabolism of flumezapine in dogs that produces methylthio metabolit
