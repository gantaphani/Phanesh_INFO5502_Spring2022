the fair labor standards act flsa requires employers to pay employees overtime wages,see a,but this requirement does not apply with respect to workers employed in the capacity of outside salesman,a.congress did not elaborate on the meaning of outside salesman,but it delegated authority to the department of labor dol to issue regulations to define the term.three of the dol regulations are relevant to this case.first,cfr defines outside salesman to mean any employee w hose primary duty is making sales within the meaning of k.a.section k,in turn,states that s ale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.second,clarifies that s ales within the meaning of k include the transfer of title to tangible property.b.third,provides that promotion work that is performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work,whereas promotion work that is incidental to sales made,or to be made,by someone else is not.a.the dol provided additional guidance in connection with its promulgation of these regulations,stressing that an employee is an outside salesman when the employee in some sense,has made sales.fed.reg.
the prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation,including the requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physician prescription.in light of this requirement,pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct marketing efforts on physicians.pharmaceutical companies promote their products to physicians through a process called detailing,whereby employees known as detailers or pharmaceutical sales representatives try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.
petitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales representatives for roughly four years,and during that time their primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from physicians to prescribe respondent products in appropriate cases.each week,petitioners spent about hours in the field calling on physicians during normal business hours and an additional to hours attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks.petitioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours,and they were subject to only minimal supervision.petitioners were well compensated for their efforts,and their gross pay included both a base salary and incentive pay.the amount of incentive pay was determined based on the performance of petitioners assigned portfolio of drugs in their assigned sales territories.it is undisputed that petitioners were not paid wages when they worked more than hours per week.
petitioners filed suit,alleging that respondent violated the flsa by failing to compensate them for overtime.respondent moved for summary judgment,arguing that petitioners were employed in the capacity of outside salesman,a,and therefore were exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirement.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent.petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,contending that the district court had erred in failing to accord controlling deference to the dol interpretation of the pertinent regulations,which the dol had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.the district court rejected this argument and denied the motion.the ninth circuit,agreeing that the dol interpretation was not entitled to controlling deference,affirmed.
held petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the dol regulations.
a the dol filed amicus briefs in the second circuit and the ninth circuit in which it took the view that a sale for the purposes of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.brief for secretary of labor as amicus curiae in in re novartis wage and hour litigation.the dol changed course after the court granted certiorari in this case,however,and now maintains that a n employee does not make a sale unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.brief for united states as amicus curiae.the dol current interpretation of its regulations is not entitled to deference under auer robbins.although auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation,even when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief,see,at,this general rule does not apply in all cases.deference is inappropriate,for example,when the agency interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,at,or when there is reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter,at.there are strong reasons for withholding auer deference in this case.petitioners invoke the dol interpretation to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the interpretation was announced.to defer to the dol interpretation would result in precisely the kind of unfair surprise against which this court has long warned.see,long island care at home,coke.until,the pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the flsa.the statute and regulations do not provide clear notice.even more important,despite the industry practice,the dol never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting unlawfully.the only plausible explanation for the dol inaction is acquiescence.whatever the general merits of auer deference,it is unwarranted here.the dol interpretation should instead be given a measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade.see united states mead.
b the dol current interpretation that a sale demands a transfer of title is quite unpersuasive.it plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.because the dol first announced its view that pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen in a series of amicus briefs,there was no opportunity for public comment,and the interpretation that initially emerged from the dol internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable.the interpretation is also flatly inconsistent with the flsa.the statute defines sale to mean,inter alia,a consignment for sale,and a consignment for sale does not involve the transfer of title.the dol relies heavily on cfr,which provides that s ales include the transfer of title to tangible property,b,but it is apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title,only that transactions involving a transfer of title are included within the term sale.the dol explanation that obtaining a commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion,and not sales,reply brief for petitioners,is also unconvincing.since promotion work that is performed incidental to an employee own sales is exempt,the dol conclusion that detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not make sales.
c because the dol interpretation is neither entitled to auer deference nor persuasive in its own right,traditional tools of interpretation must be employed to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside salesmen.
the flsa does not furnish a clear answer to this question,but it provides at least one interpretive clue by exempting anyone employed in the capacity of an outside salesman.a.the statute emphasis on capacity counsels in favor of a functional,rather than a formal,inquiry,one that views an employee responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in which the employee works.the dol regulations provide additional guidance.section defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is making sales and adopts the statutory definition of sale.this statutory definition contains at least three important textual clues.first,the definition is introduced with the verb includes,which indicates that the examples enumerated in the text are illustrative,not exhaustive.see burgess united states.second,the list of transactions included in the statutory definition is modified by any,which,in the context of k,is best read to mean one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,united states gonzales.third,the definition includes the broad catchall phrase other disposition.under the rule of ejusdem generis,the catchall phrase is most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that are tantamount,in a particular industry,to a paradigmatic sale of a commodity.nothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrower construction.
given this interpretation of other disposition,it follows that petitioners made sales under the flsa and thus are exempt outside salesmen within the meaning of the dol regulations.petitioners obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe respondent drugs.this kind of arrangement,in the unique regulatory environment within which pharmaceutical companies operate,comfortably falls within the catchall category of other disposition.that petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides further support for this conclusion.and this holding also comports with the apparent purpose of the flsa exemption.the exemption is premised on the belief that exempt employees normally earn salaries well above the minimum wage and perform a kind of work that is difficult to standardize to a particular time frame and that can not easily be spread to other workers.petitioners each of whom earned an average of more than per year and spent to hours outside normal business hours each week performing work related to his assigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory are hardly the kind of employees that the flsa was intended to protect.
petitioners remaining arguments are also unavailing.

justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
the fair labor standards act flsa imposes minimum wage and maximum hours requirements on employers,see ed.and supp.iv,but those requirements do not apply to workers employed in the capacity of outside salesman,a.this case requires us to decide whether the term outside salesman,as defined by department of labor dol or department regulations,encompasses pharmaceutical sales representatives whose primary duty is to obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe their employer prescription drugs in appropriate cases.we conclude that these employees qualify as outside salesm e 
congress enacted the flsa in with the goal of protect ing all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours.barrentine freight system,see also a.among other requirements,the flsa obligates employers to compensate employees for hours in excess of per week at a rate of times the employees regular wages.see a.the overtime compensation requirement,however,does not apply with respect to all employees.see.as relevant here,the statute exempts workers employed in the capacity of outside salesman.a 
congress did not define the term outside salesman,but it delegated authority to the dol to issue regulations from time to time to defin e and delimi t the term.ibid.the dol promulgated such regulations in,and.in,following procedures,the dol reissued the regulations with minor amendments.see fed.reg.the current regulations are nearly identical in substance to the regulations issued in the years immediately following the flsa enactment.see cfr.
three of the dol regulations are directly relevant to this case,and.we refer to these three regulations as the general regulation,the sales regulation,and the regulation,respectively.
the general regulation sets out the definition of the statutory term employee employed in the capacity of outside salesman.it defines the term to mean any employee w hose primary duty is making sales within the meaning of k and w ho is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer place or places of business in performing such primary duty.a.the referenced statutory provision,k,states that s ale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.thus,under the general regulation,an outside salesman is any employee whose primary duty is making any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.
the sales regulation restates the statutory definition of sale discussed above and clarifies that s ales within the meaning of k include the transfer of title to tangible property,and in certain cases,of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property.cfr b.
finally,the regulation identifies p romotion work as one type of activity often performed by persons who make sales,which may or may not be exempt outside sales work,depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed.a.promotion work that is performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work,whereas promotion work that is incidental to sales made,or to be made,by someone else is not exempt outside sales work.ibid.
additional guidance concerning the scope of the outside salesman exemption can be gleaned from reports issued in connection with the dol promulgation of regulations in and,and from the preamble to the regulations.see of labor,wage and hour division,report and recommendations of the presiding officer at hearings preliminary to redefinition hereinafter report of labor,wage and hour division,report and recommendations on proposed revisions of regulations,part hereinafter report fed.reg.hereinafter preamble.although the dol has rejected proposals to eliminate or dilute the requirement that outside salesmen make their own sales,the department has stressed that this requirement is met whenever an employee in some sense make s a sale.report see also preamble reiterating that the exemption applies only to an employee who in some sense,has made sales and the dol has made it clear that e xempt status should not depend on technicalities,such as whether it is the sales employee or the customer who types the order into a computer system and hits the return button,preamble,or whether the order is filled by a jobber rather than directly by the employee own employer,report.
respondent smithkline beecham corporation is in the business of developing,manufacturing,and selling prescription drugs.the prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation,including the requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physician prescription in light of this requirement,pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct marketing efforts,not on the retail pharmacies that dispense prescription drugs,but rather on the medical practitioners who possess the authority to prescribe the drugs in the first place.pharmaceutical companies promote their prescription drugs to physicians through a process called detailing,whereby employees known as detailers or pharmaceutical sales representatives provide information to physicians about the company products in hopes of persuading them to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.see sorrell ims health,slip,at describing the process of detailing the position of detailer has existed in the pharmaceutical industry in substantially its current form since at least the,and in recent years the industry has employed more than detailers nationwide.see,and.
respondent hired petitioners michael christopher and frank buchanan as pharmaceutical sales representatives in.during the roughly four years when petitioners were employed in that capacity they were responsible for calling on physicians in an assigned sales territory to discuss the features,benefits,and risks of an assigned portfolio of respondent prescription drugs.petitioners primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding from the physician to prescribe those drugs in appropriate cases,and the training that petitioners received underscored the importance of that objective.
petitioners spent about hours each week in the field calling on physicians.these visits occurred during normal business hours,from about to outside of normal business hours,petitioners spent an additional to hours each week attending events,reviewing product information,returning phone calls,responding to,and performing other miscellaneous tasks.petitioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours,and they were subject to only minimal supervision.
petitioners were well compensated for their efforts.on average,christopher annual gross pay was just over,and buchanan was just over petitioners gross pay included both a base salary and incentive pay.the amount of petitioners incentive pay was based on the sales volume or market share of their assigned drugs in their assigned sales territories and this amount was uncapped.christopher incentive pay exceeded percent of his gross pay during each of his years of employment buchanan exceeded percent.it is undisputed that respondent did not pay petitioners wages when they worked in excess of hours per week.
petitioners brought this action in the united states district court for the district of arizona under b.petitioners alleged that respondent violated the flsa by failing to compensate them for overtime,and they sought both backpay and liquidated damages as relief.respondent moved for summary judgment,arguing that petitioners were employed in the capacity of outside salesman,a,and therefore were exempt from the flsa overtime compensation requirement the district court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent.see app.to pet.for cert.
after the district court issued its order,petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,contending that the district court had erred in failing to accord controlling deference to the dol interpretation of the pertinent regulations.that interpretation had been announced in an uninvited amicus brief filed by the dol in a similar action then pending in the second circuit.see brief for secretary of labor as amicus curiae in in re novartis wage and hour litigation,hereinafter secretary novartis brief.the district court rejected this argument and denied the motion.see app.to pet.for cert.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.see.the court of appeals agreed that the dol was not entitled to controlling deference.see,at.it held that,because the commitment that petitioners obtained from physicians was the maximum possible under the rules applicable to the pharmaceutical industry,petitioners made sales within the meaning of the regulations.see,at.the court found it significant,moreover,that the dol had previously interpreted the regulations as requiring only that an employee in some sense make a sale,see,at emphasis deleted,and had acquiesce d in the sales practices of the drug industry for over seventy years,at.
the ninth circuit decision conflicts with the second circuit decision in in re novartis wage and hour litigation,holding that the dol interpretation is entitled to controlling deference.we granted certiorari to resolve this split,and we now affirm the judgment of the ninth circuit.
we must determine whether pharmaceutical detailers are outside salesmen as the dol has defined that term in its regulations.the parties agree that the regulations themselves were validly promulgated and are therefore entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council.but the parties disagree sharply about whether the dol interpretation of the regulations is owed deference under auer robbins.it is to that question that we now turn.
the dol first announced its view that pharmaceutical detailers are not exempt outside salesmen in an amicus brief filed in the second circuit in,and the department has subsequently filed similar amicus briefs in other cases,including the case now before us while the dol ultimate conclusion that detailers are not exempt has remained unchanged since,the same can not be said of its reasoning.in both the second circuit and the ninth circuit,the dol took the view that a sale for the purposes of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.secretary novartis brief see also brief for secretary of labor as amicus curiae in.perhaps because of the nebulous nature of this consummated transaction test the department changed course after we granted certiorari in this case.the department now takes the position that a n employee does not make a sale for purposes of the outside salesman exemption unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief petitioners and the dol assert that this new interpretation of the regulations is entitled to controlling deference.see brief for petitioners brief 
although auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation,even when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief,see chase bank usa,mccoy,slip,at auer,at,this general rule does not apply in all cases.deference is undoubtedly inappropriate,for example,when the agency interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.at quoting robertson methow valley citizens council.and deference is likewise unwarranted when there is reason to suspect that the agency interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.auer,supra,at see also,chase bank,supra,at slip,at.this might occur when the agency interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation,see,thomas jefferson shalala,or when it appears that the interpretation is nothing more than a convenient litigating position,bowen georgetown.hospital,or a post hoc rationalizatio n advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack,auer,supra,at quoting bowen,supra,at alteration in original.
in this case,there are strong reasons for withholding the deference that auer generally requires.petitioners invoke the dol interpretation of ambiguous regulations to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before that interpretation was announced.to defer to the agency interpretation in this circumstance would seriously undermine the principle that agencies should provide regulated parties fair warning of the conduct a regulation prohibits or requires.gates fox occupational safety and health review comm n,cadc scalia,indeed,it would result in precisely the kind of unfair surprise against which our cases have long warned.see long island care at home,coke,deferring to new interpretation that create d no unfair surprise because agency had proceeded through rulemaking martin occupational safety and health review comm n,identifying adequacy of notice to regulated parties as one factor relevant to the reasonableness of the agency interpretation nlrb bell aerospace,suggesting that an agency should not change an interpretation in an adjudicative proceeding where doing so would impose new liability on individuals for past actions which were taken in reliance on agency pronouncements or in a case involving fines or damages 
this case well illustrates the point.until,the pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the flsa.the statute and regulations certainly do not provide clear notice of this.the general regulation adopts the broad statutory definition of sale,and that definition,in turn,employs the broad catchall phrase other disposition.see cfr a.this catchall phrase could reasonably be construed to encompass a nonbinding commitment from a physician to prescribe a particular drug,and nothing in the statutory or regulatory text or the dol prior guidance plainly requires a contrary reading.see preamble explaining that an employee must in some sense make a sale report same.
even more important,despite the industry practice of classifying pharmaceutical detailers as exempt employees,the dol never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting unlawfully we acknowledge that an agency enforcement decisions are informed by a host of factors,some bearing no relation to the agency views regarding whether a violation has occurred.see,heckler chaney,noting that an agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise but where,as here,an agency announcement of its interpretation is preceded by a very lengthy period of conspicuous inaction,the potential for unfair surprise is acute.as the seventh circuit has noted,while it may be possible for an entire industry to be in violation of the flsa for a long time without the labor department noticing,the more plausible hypothesis is that the department did not think the industry practice was unlawful.yi sterling collision centers.there are now approximately pharmaceutical sales representatives the nature of their work has not materially changed for decades and is well known these employees are well paid and like quintessential outside salesmen,they do not punch a clock and often work more than hours per week.other than acquiescence,no explanation for the dol inaction is plausible.
our practice of deferring to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulations undoubtedly has important advantages but this practice also creates a risk that agencies will promulgate vague and regulations that they can later interpret as they see fit,thereby frustrat ing the notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking.talk america,michigan bell telephone,scalia,concurring slip,at see also stephenson pogoriler,seminole rock domain,geo,manning,constitutional structure and judicial deference to agency interpretations of agency rules,colum.it is one thing to expect regulated parties to conform their conduct to an agency interpretations once the agency announces them it is quite another to require regulated parties to divine the agency interpretations in advance or else be held liable when the agency announces its interpretations for the first time in an enforcement proceeding and demands deference.
accordingly,whatever the general merits of auer deference,it is unwarranted here.we instead accord the department interpretation a measure of deference proportional to the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.united states mead,quoting skidmore swift.
we find the dol interpretation of its regulations quite unpersuasive.the interpretation to which we are now asked to defer that a sale demands a transfer of title plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.because the dol first announced its view that pharmaceutical sales representatives do not qualify as outside salesmen in a series of amicus briefs,there was no opportunity for public comment,and the interpretation that initially emerged from the department internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable.after arguing successfully in the second circuit and then unsucessfully in the ninth circuit that a sale for present purposes simply requires a consummated transaction,the dol advanced a different interpretation in this court.here,the dol brief states unequivocally that a n employee does not make a sale for purposes of the outside salesman exemption unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.brief.
this new interpretation is flatly inconsistent with the flsa,which defines sale to mean,inter alia,a consignment for sale.a consignment for sale does not involve the transfer of title.see,sturm boker,the agency to sell and return the proceeds,or the specific goods if not sold does not involve a change of title hawkland,consignment selling under the uniform commercial code,com,explaining that a consignment of goods for sale does not pass the title at any time,nor does it contemplate that it should be passed quoting rio grande oil miller rubber of.
the dol can not salvage its interpretation by arguing that a consignment for sale may eventually result in the transfer of title from the consignor to the ultimate purchaser if the consignee in fact sells the good.much the same may be said about a physician nonbinding commitment to prescribe a particular product in an appropriate case.in that situation,too,agreement may eventually result in the transfer of title from the manufacturer to a pharmacy and ultimately to the patient for whom the drug is prescribed.
in support of its new interpretation,the dol relies heavily on its sales regulation,which states in part that s ales for present purposes include the transfer of title to tangible property,cfr b emphasis added.this regulation,however,provides little support for the dol position.the dol reads the sales regulation to mean that a sale necessarily includes the transfer of title,but that is not what the regulation says.and it seems clear that that is not what the regulation means.the sentence just subsequent to the one on which the dol relies,echoing the terms of the flsa,makes clear that a consignment for sale qualifies as a sale.since a consignment for sale does not involve a transfer of title,it is apparent that the sales regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title,only that transactions involving a transfer of title are included within the term sale.
petitioners invite us to look past the dol determination that a sale must involve the transfer of title and instead defer to the department explanation that obtaining a commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion,and not sales.reply brief for petitioners.the problem with the dol interpretation of the regulation,however,is that it depends almost entirely on the dol flawed interpretation.the regulation does not distinguish between promotion work and sales rather,it distinguishes between exempt promotion work and nonexempt promotion work.since promotion work that is performed incidental to an employee own sales is exempt,the dol conclusion that pharmaceutical detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not make sales.for the reasons already discussed,we find this reasoning wholly unpersuasive.
in light of our conclusion that the dol interpretation is neither entitled to auer deference nor persuasive in its own right,we must employ traditional tools of interpretation to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside salesmen.
we begin with the text of the flsa.although the provision that establishes the overtime salesman exemption does not furnish a clear answer to the question before us,it provides at least one interpretive clue it exempts anyone employed in the capacity of an outside salesman.a emphasis added.capacity,used in this sense,means o utward condition or circumstances relation character position.webster new international dictionary ed.see also oxford english dictionary def.position,condition,character,relation the statute emphasis on the capacity of the employee counsels in favor of a functional,rather than a formal,inquiry,one that views an employee responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in which the employee works.
the dol regulations provide additional guidance.the general regulation defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is making sales,and it adopts the statutory definition of sale.cfr a i.this definition contains at least three important textual clues.first,the definition is introduced with the verb includes instead of means.this word choice is significant because it makes clear that the examples enumerated in the text are intended to be illustrative,not exhaustive.see burgess united states,explaining that a term whose statutory definition declares what it includes is more susceptible to extension of meaning than where the definition declares what a term means alteration in original some internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,congress used the narrower word means in other provisions of the flsa when it wanted to cabin a definition to a specific list of enumerated items.see,a person means an individual,partnership,association,corporation,business trust,legal representative,or any organized group of persons emphasis added.
second,the list of transactions included in the statutory definition of sale is modified by the word any.we have recognized that the modifier any can mean different things depending upon the setting,nixon missouri municipal league,but in the context of k,it is best read to mean one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,united states gonzales,quoting webster third new international dictionary.that is so because congress defined sale to include both the unmodified word sale and transactions that might not be considered sales in a technical sense,including exchanges and consignments for sale 
third,congress also included a broad catchall phrase other disposition.neither the statute nor the regulations define disposition,but dictionary definitions of the term range from relinquishment or alienation to arrangement.see webster new international dictionary def.b t he getting rid,or making over,of anything relinquishment or alienation ibid.def.a t he ordering,regulating,or administering of anything oxford english dictionary,supra,at def.t he action of disposing of,putting away,getting rid of,making over.ibid.def.t he action of setting in order,or condition of being set in order arrangement,order we agree with the dol that the rule of ejusdem generis should guide our interpretation of the catchall phrase,since it follows a list of specific items but the limit the dol posits,one that would confine the phrase to dispositions involving contract s for the exchange of goods or services in return for value,see brief,is much too narrow,as is petitioners view that a sale requires a firm agreement or firm commitment to buy,see tr.of oral arg.these interpretations would defeat congress intent to define sale in a broad manner and render the general statutory language meaningless.see united states alpers,instructing that rule of ejusdem generis can not be employed to obscure and defeat the intent and purpose of congress or render general words meaningless indeed,we are hard pressed to think of any contract for the exchange of goods or services in return for value or any firm agreement to buy that would not also fall within one of the specifically enumerated categories 
the specific list of transactions that precedes the phrase other disposition seems to us to represent an attempt to accommodate variations in methods of selling commodities.consequently,we think that the catchall phrase other disposition is most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that are tantamount,in a particular industry,to a paradigmatic sale of a commodity.
nothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrower construction as discussed above,the sales regulation instructs that sales within the meaning of k include the transfer of title to tangible property,cfr b emphasis added,but this regulation in no way limits the broad statutory definition of sale.and although the regulation distinguishes between promotion work that is incidental to an employee own sales and work that is incidental to sales made by someone else,see a,this distinction tells us nothing about the meaning of sale.
given our interpretation of other disposition,it follows that petitioners made sales for purposes of the flsa and therefore are exempt outside salesmen within the meaning of the dol regulations.obtaining a nonbinding commitment from a physician to prescribe one of respondent drugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to ensure the eventual disposition of the products that respondent sells this kind of arrangement,in the unique regulatory environment within which pharmaceutical companies must operate,comfortably falls within the catchall category of other disposition.
that petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides further support for our conclusion.petitioners were hired for their sales experience.they were trained to close each sales call by obtaining the maximum commitment possible from the physician.they worked away from the office,with minimal supervision,and they were rewarded for their efforts with incentive compensation.it would be anomalous to require respondent to compensate petitioners for overtime,while at the same time exempting employees who function identically to petitioners in every respect except that they sell drugs,such as vaccines and other injectable pharmaceuticals,that are ordered by the physician directly rather than purchased by the end user at a pharmacy with a prescription from the physician.
our holding also comports with the apparent purpose of the flsa exemption for outside salesmen.the exemption is premised on the belief that exempt employees typically earned salaries well above the minimum wage and enjoyed other benefits that se t them apart from the nonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.preamble.it was also thought that exempt employees performed a kind of work that was difficult to standardize to any time frame and could not be easily spread to other workers after hours in a week,making compliance with the overtime provisions difficult and generally precluding the potential job expansion intended by the flsa overtime premium.ibid.petitioners each of whom earned an average of more than per year and spent between and hours outside normal business hours each week performing work related to his assigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory are hardly the kind of employees that the flsa was intended to protect.and it would be challenging,to say the least,for pharmaceutical companies to compensate detailers for overtime going forward without significantly changing the nature of that position.see,brief for phrma as amicus curiae explaining that key aspects of detailers jobs as they are currently structured are fundamentally incompatible with treating detailers as hourly employees 
the remaining arguments advanced by petitioners and the dissent are unavailing.petitioners contend that detailers are more naturally classified as nonexempt promotional employees who merely stimulate sales made by others than as exempt outside salesmen.they point out that respondent prescription drugs are not actually sold until distributors and retail pharmacies order the drugs from other employees.see reply brief for petitioners.those employees they reason,are the true salesmen in the industry,not detailers.this formalistic argument is inconsistent with the realistic approach that the outside salesman exemption is meant to reflect.
petitioners theory seems to be that an employee is properly classified as a nonexempt promotional employee whenever there is another employee who actually makes the sale in a technical sense.but,taken to its extreme,petitioners theory would require that we treat as a nonexempt promotional employee a manufacturer representative who takes an order from a retailer but then transfers the order to a jobber employee to be filled,or a car salesman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks his or her assistant to enter the order into the computer.this formalistic approach would be difficult to reconcile with the broad language of the regulations and the statutory definition of sale,and it is in significant tension with the dol past practice.see report explaining that the manufacturer representative was clearly performing sales work regardless of the fact that the order is filled by the jobber rather than directly by his own employer preamble noting that technological changes in how orders are taken and processed should not preclude the exemption for employees who in some sense make the sales 
petitioners additionally argue that detailers are the functional equivalent of employees who sell a concept,and they point to wage and hour division opinion letters,as well as lower court decisions,deeming such employees nonexempt.see brief for petitioners.two of these opinions,however,concerned employees who were more analogous to buyers than to sellers.see clements serco,explaining that,although military recruiters i n a loose sense were selling the army services,it was the army that would pa y for the services of the recruits who enlist opinion letter from of labor,wage and hour division,wl explaining that selling the concept of organ donation is similar to that of outside buyers who in a very loose sense are sometimes described as selling their employer service to the person for whom they obtain their goods and the other two opinions are likewise inapposite.one concerned employees who were not selling a good or service at all,see opinion letter from of labor,wage and hour division may,wl concluding that employees who solicit charitable contributions are not exempt,and the other concerned employees who were incapable of selling any good or service because their employer had yet to extend an offer,see opinion letter from of labor,wage and hour division,wl concluding that college recruiters are not exempt because they merely induce qualified customers to apply to the college,and the college in turn decides whether to make a contractual offer of its educational services to the applicant 
finally,the dissent posits that the primary duty of a pharmaceutical detailer is not to obtain a promise to prescribe a particular drug,but rather to provid e information so that the doctor will keep the drug in mind with an eye toward using it when appropriate.post,at.but the record in this case belies that contention.petitioners end goal was not merely to make physicians aware of the medically appropriate uses of a particular drug.rather,it was to convince physicians actually to prescribe the drug in appropriate cases.see app.to pet.for cert.finding that petitioners primary objective was convincing physicians to prescribe respondent products to their patients 
for these reasons,we conclude that petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the dol regulations.the judgment of the court of appeals is

the court describes the essential aspects of the detailer job as follows first,the detailer provide s information to physicians about the company products in hopes of persuading them to write prescriptions for the products in appropriate cases.ante,at.second,the detailers cal l on physicians in an assigned sales to discuss the features,benefits,and risks of an assigned portfolio of respondent prescription drugs,and they seek a nonbinding commitment from the physician to prescribe those drugs in appropriate cases ibid.footnote omitted.third,the detailers compensation includes an incentive element based on the sales volume or market share of their assigned drugs in their assigned sales territories.ante,at.the court adds that the detailers work with only minimal supervision and beyond normal business hours attending events,reviewing product information,returning phone calls,responding to,and performing other miscellaneous tasks.ante,at.
as summarized,i agree with the court description of the job.in light of important,differences in the justice department views as to the meaning of relevant labor department regulations,see ante,at,i also agree that we should not give the solicitor general current interpretive view any especially favorable weight.ante,at.thus,i am willing to assume,with the court,that we should determine whether the statutory term covers the detailer job as here described through our independent examination of the statute language and the related labor department regulations.but,i conclude on that basis that a detailer is not an outside salesman.
the flsa does not itself define the term outside salesman.rather,it exempts from wage and hour requirements any employee employed in the capacity of outside salesman as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary.a emphasis added.thus,we must look to relevant labor department regulations to answer the question.see chevron natural resources defense council,see also long island care at home,coke,explaining that the flsa explicitly leaves gaps to be filled by regulations.
there are three relevant regulations.the first is entitled general rule for outside sales employees,cfr the second is entitled making sales or obtaining orders,and the third is entitled promotion work,the relevant language of the first two regulations is similar.the first says that the term ployee employed in the capacity of outside salesman shall mean any employee w hose duty is i making sales within the meaning of k of the act,or ii obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities a.the second regulation tells us that the first regulation requires that the employee be engaged in making sales within the meaning of section k of the act,or obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.a.
the second part of these quoted passages is irrelevant here,for it concerns matters not at issue,namely orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.the remaining parts of the two regulations are similarly irrelevant.see appendix,infra.thus,the relevant portions of the first two regulations say simply that the employee primary duty must be making sales within the meaning of section k of the act.and k of the act says that the word sale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.k.
unless we give the words of the statute and regulations some special meaning,a detailer primary duty is not that of making sales or the equivalent.a detailer might convince a doctor to prescribe a drug for a particular kind of patient.if the doctor encounters such a patient,he might prescribe the drug.the doctor client,the patient,might take the prescription to a pharmacist and ask the pharmacist to fill the prescription.if so,the pharmacist might sell the manufacturer drug to the patient,or might substitute a generic version.but it is the pharmacist,not the detailer,who will have sold the drug.
to put the same fairly obvious point in the language of the regulations and of k of the flsa,see k,the detailer does not sell anything to the doctor.see black law dictionary ed.defining sale as t he transfer of property or title for a price nor does he,during the course of that visit or thereafter,exchange the manufacturer product for money or for anything else.he enters into no contract to sell on behalf of anyone.he consigns nothing for sale.he ships nothing for sale.he does not dispose of any product at all.
what the detailer does is inform the doctor about the nature of the manufacturer drugs and explain their uses,their virtues,their drawbacks,and their limitations.the detailer may well try to convince the doctor to prescribe the manufacturer drugs for patients.and if the detailer is successful,the doctor will make a nonbinding commitment to write prescriptions using one or more of those drugs where appropriate.if followed,that nonbinding commitment is,at most,a nonbinding promise to consider advising a patient to use a drug where medical indications so indicate if the doctor encounters such a patient,and to write a prescription that will likely but may not lead that person to order that drug under its brand name from the pharmacy.i say may not because of patients in a period have not filled a prescription given to them by a doctor.see usa today,kaiser family foundation,harvard school of public health,the public on prescription drugs and pharmaceutical companies,available at all internet materials as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file.and when patients do fill prescriptions,are filled with generic drugs.see of health and human services,office of science data policy,expanding the use of generic drugs.
where in this process does the detailer sell the product at most he obtains from the doctor a nonbinding commitment to advise his patient to take the drug or perhaps a generic equivalent as well as to write any necessary prescription.i put to the side the fact that neither the court nor the record explains exactly what a nonbinding commitment is.like a definite maybe,an solution,or a theoretical experience,a nonbinding commitment seems to claim more than it can deliver.regardless,other than in colloquial speech,to obtain a commitment to advise a client to buy a product is not to obtain a commitment to sell that product,no matter how often the client takes the advice or the patient does what the doctor recommends.
the third regulation,entitled promotion work,lends support to this view.that is because the detailer work as described above is best viewed as promotion work.the regulation makes clear that promotion work falls within the statutory exemption only when the promotion work is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee own outside sales or solicitations.cfr a emphasis added.but it is not exempt if it is incidental to sales made,or to be made,by someone else.ibid.
the detailer work,in my view,is more naturally characterized as involving p romotional activities designed to stimulate sales made by someone else,the pharmacist or the wholesaler,than as involving p romotional activities designed to stimulate the detailer own sales.
three other relevant documents support this reading.first,the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma,of which respondent is a member,publishes a code on interactions with healthcare.see phrma,code on interactions with healthcare professionals phrma code july,available at.the phrma code a detailer job in some depth.it consistently refers to detailers as delivering accurate,information to healthcare professionals,at,and it stresses the importance of a doctor treatment decision being based solely on each patient medical needs and the doctor medical knowledge and experience,at.the phrma code also forbids the offering or providing of anything in a manner or on conditions that would interfere with the independence of a healthcare professional prescribing practices.at.but the phrma code nowhere refers to detailers as if they were salesmen,rather than providers of information,nor does it refer to any kind of commitment.
to the contrary,the document makes clear that the pharmaceutical industry itself understands that it can not be a detailer primary duty to obtain a nonbinding commitment,for,in respect to many doctors,such a commitment taken alone is unlikely to make a significant difference to their doctor use of a particular drug.when a particular drug,say drug d,constitutes the best treatment for a particular patient,a knowledgeable doctor should hence likely will prescribe it irrespective of any nonbinding commitment to do so.where some other drug,however,is likely to prove more beneficial for a particular patient,that doctor should not hence likely will not prescribe drug d irrespective of any nonbinding commitment to the contrary.
at a minimum,the document explains why a detailer should not hence likely does not see himself as seeking primarily to obtain a promise to prescribe a particular drug,as opposed to providing information so that the doctor will keep the drug in mind with an eye toward using it when appropriate.and because the detailer primary duty is informational,as opposed to,he fails to qualify as an outside salesman.see a i restricting the outside salesman exemption to employees w hose primary duty is making sales emphasis added.a detailer operating in accord with the phrma code sells the product only in the way advertisers particularly very low key advertisers sell a product by creating demand for the product,not by taking orders.
second,a labor department wage and hour division report written in further describes the work of sales promotion men.see of labor,wage and hour division,report and recommendations of the presiding officer at hearings preliminary to redefinition report.the report says that such individuals pav e the way for sales by others,at.frequently,they deal with the retailers who are not customers of their own employer but of their employer customer.ibid.and they are primarily interested in sales by the retailer,not to the retailer.ibid.t hey do not make actual sales,and they are admittedly not outside salesmen.ibid.
like the sales promotion men,the detailers before us deal with individuals,namely doctors,who are not customers of their own employer.and the detailers are primarily interested in sales authorized by the doctor,not to the doctor.according to the report,sales promotion men are not outside salesmen,primarily because they seek to bring about,not their own sales,but sales by others.thus,the detailers in this case are not outside salesmen.
third,a wage and hour division report written in notes that where work is promotional in nature it is sometimes difficult to determine whether it is incidental to the employee own sales work.see of labor,wage and hour division,report and recommendations on proposed revisions of regulations,part,report.it adds that in borderline cases 
the test is whether the person is actually engaged in activities directed toward the consummation of his own sales,at least to the extent of obtaining a commitment to buy from the person to whom he is selling.if his efforts are directed toward stimulating the sales of his company generally rather than the consummation of his own specific sales his activities are not exempt.at emphasis added.
the report also refers to a 
company representative who visits chain stores,arranges the merchandise on shelves,replenishes stock,consults with the manager as to the requirements of the store,fills out a requisition for the quantity wanted and leaves it with the store manager to be transmitted to the central warehouse of the company which later ships the quantity.at.
it says this company representative is not an outside salesman because he 
does not consummate the sale nor direct his efforts toward the consummation of a sale the store manager often has no authority to buy.ibid.
see also cfr c explaining that if an does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts the consummation of a sale,the work is not exempt outside sales work 
a detailer does not take orders,he does not consummate a sale,and he does not direct his efforts towards the consummation of any eventual sale by the pharmacist any more than does the company representative in the report example.the doctor whom the detailer visits,like the example store manager,has no authority to buy.
taken together,the statute,regulations,ethical codes,and labor department reports indicate that the drug detailers do not promote their own sales,but rather sales made,or to be made,by someone else.therefore,detailers are not outside salesmen.
the court different conclusion rests primarily upon its interpretation of the statutory words other disposition as including those arrangements that are tantamount,in a particular industry,to a paradigmatic sale of a.ante,at.given the fact that the doctor buys,the fact that the detailer sells nothing to the doctor,and the fact that any nonbinding commitment by the doctor must,of ethical necessity,be of secondary importance,there is nothing about the detailer visit with the doctor that makes the visit or what occurs during the visit tantamount to a paradigmatic sale.ibid.see part i,supra.
the court adds that o btaining a nonbinding commitment from a physician to prescribe one of respondent drugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to ensure the eventual disposition of the products that respondent sells.ante,at.and that may be so.but there is no most they are able to do test.after all,the most a california firm marketing employee may be able to do to secure orders from new york customers is to post an advertisement on the internet,but that fact does not help qualify the posting employee as a salesman.the court adds that it means to apply this test only when the law precludes an entire industry from selling its products in the ordinary manner.ante,at.but the law might preclude an industry from selling its products through an outside salesman without thereby leading the legal term outside salesman to apply to whatever is the next best thing.in any event,the court would be wrong to assume,if it does assume,that there is in nearly every industry an outside salesman lurking somewhere if only we can find him.an industry might,after all,sell its goods through wholesalers or retailers,while using its own outside employees to encourage sales only by providing third parties with critically important information.
the court expresses concern lest a holding that detailers are not salesmen lead to holdings that the statute forbids treating as a salesman an employee who takes an order from a retailer but then transfers the order to a jobber employee to be filled,ante,at,or a car salesman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks his or her assistant to enter the order into the computer,ibid.but there is no need for any such fear.both these examples involve employees who are salesmen because they obtain a firm commitment to buy the product.see report as to the first example,such an employee has obtained a commitment from the customer fed.reg.as to the second example,explaining that e xempt status should not depend on who types the order into a computer,but maintaining requirement that a salesman obtai n a commitment to buy from the person to whom he is selling the problem facing the detailer is that he does not obtain any such commitment.
finally,the court points to the detailers relatively high pay,their uncertain hours,the location of their work,their independence,and the fact that they frequently work overtime,all as showing that detailers fall within the basic purposes of the statutory provision that creates exceptions from wage and hour requirements.ante,at.the problem for the detailers,however,is that the statute seeks to achieve its general objectives by creating certain categories of exempt employees,one of which is the category of outside salesman.it places into that category only those who satisfy the definition of outside salesman as defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary.a emphasis added.and the detailers do not fall within that category as defined by those regulations.
for these reasons,with respect,i dissent.
cfr provides 
general rule for outside sales employees.
a the term ployee employed in the capacity of outside salesman in section a of the act shall mean any employee 
whose primary duty is 
i making sales within the meaning of section k of the act,or 
ii obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer and 
who is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer place or places of business in performing such primary duty.
b the term primary duty is defined at.in determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee,work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee own outside sales or solicitations,including incidental deliveries and collections,shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work.other work that furthers the employee sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt work including,for example,writing sales reports,updating or revising the employee sales or display catalogue,planning itineraries and attending sales conferences.
c the requirements of subpart g salary requirements of this part do not apply to the outside sales employees described in this section.
cfr provides 
making sales or obtaining orders.
a section requires that the employee be engaged in 
making sales within the meaning of section k of the act,or 
obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.
b sales within the meaning of section k of the act include the transfer of title to tangible property,and in certain cases,of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property.section k of the act states that sale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.
c exempt outside sales work includes not only the sales of commodities,but also obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer.obtaining orders for the use of facilities includes the selling of time on radio or television,the solicitation of advertising for newspapers and other periodicals,and the solicitation of freight for railroads and other transportation agencies.
d the word services extends the outside sales exemption to employees who sell or take orders for a service,which may be performed for the customer by someone other than the person taking the order.
cfr provides 
promotion work.
a promotion work is one type of activity often performed by persons who make sales,which may or may not be exempt outside sales work,depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed.promotional work that is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work.on the other hand,promotional work that is incidental to sales made,or to be made,by someone else is not exempt outside sales work.an employee who does not satisfy the requirements of this subpart may still qualify as an exempt employee under other subparts of this rule.
b a manufacturer representative,for example,may perform various types of promotional activities such as putting up displays and posters,removing damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant shelves or rearranging the merchandise.such an employee can be considered an exempt outside sales employee if the employee primary duty is making sales or contracts.promotion activities directed toward consummation of the employee own sales are exempt.promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that will be made by someone else are not exempt outside sales work.
c another example is a company representative who visits chain stores,arranges the merchandise on shelves,replenishes stock by replacing old with new merchandise,sets up displays and consults with the store manager when inventory runs low,but does not obtain a commitment for additional purchases.the arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction with the employee own outside sales.because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale,the work is not exempt outside sales work.
this provision also exempts workers employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity.a.
the definition also includes any employee w hose primary duty is obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer.cfr a ii.that portion of the definition is not at issue in this case.
it is undisputed that petitioners were customarily and regularly engaged away from respondent place of business in performing their responsibilities.
congress imposed this requirement in when it amended the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca to provide that drugs that are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner may be dispensed only upon a prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug.amendment of,ch,stat.codified at b.as originally enacted in,the fdca allow
