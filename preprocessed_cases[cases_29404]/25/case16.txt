during the course of clinical trials for an experimental drug combination intended to treat a fatal lung disease,vertex pharmaceuticals,vertex announced interim results that overstated the improvement in lung function exhibited in a group of patients receiving the combination treatment.following this announcement,vertex stock price rose from per share to close at three weeks later.it then lost some of its gain,dropping to,after vertex corrected the initial release overstatement.acting on behalf of all those who acquired vertex stock during the period in which the overstatement stood uncorrected,local ibew retirement plan trust local filed this securities fraud class action complaint against vertex and six past and current vertex employees.the district court dismissed the complaint,finding that it failed to create a strong inference that the defendants had acted with scienter,the requisite mental state.see local ibew ret.plan vertex,supp.we agree and so affirm.
background 
as one of the world largest biotechnology companies,vertex researches,develops,and sells treatments for a variety of ailments.in,vertex began working on drugs to combat cystic fibrosis,a fatal and as yet incurable lung disease.in early it gained food and drug administration fda approval to market a drug,kalydeco,to treat patients with a rare form of the disease.this approval,along with a contemporaneous drop in the value of vertex stock due to vertex diminishing returns from another product line,prompted vertex to focus its energies on developing a more broadly marketable cystic fibrosis treatment.
in pursuit of this aim,vertex explored a combination therapy,in which a cystic fibrosis patient first undergoes a course of treatment with an experimental drug called vx and only then begins taking kalydeco.hoping that this combination would be effective against the most common form of cystic fibrosis,vertex began a clinical investigation required for fda approval.see carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.describing the fda approval process describing the three phases of clinical investigation.on may,while the second phase of this process was ongoing,vertex issued a press release announcing interim results drawn from roughly half of the enrolled patients the press release focused in particular on one of the principal markers used to evaluate the effectiveness of a cystic fibrosis treatment lung function,as measured by the amount of air a patient is capable of exhaling in one second.according to the press release,
o f those who received the combination therapy,approximately percent experienced an absolute improvement from baseline to day of the trial period in lung function of percentage points or more,and approximately percent experienced an absolute improvement from baseline to day of percentage points or more.none of the patients treated with placebo achieved a point or more improvement from baseline to day in lung function.
the press release described these results as exceed ing vertex expectations,although it cautioned that complete data were not yet available and that the final outcomes of this clinical trial or future clinical trials may be less favorable than the interim analysis reported today,or may not be favorable at all.
the same day,vertex held a conference call for media and investors.on the call,vertex executive vice president and chief scientific officer,peter mueller mueller,described the interim results as really,really fantastic and went on to say,i have never seen anything like this.vertex chief executive officer ceo,jeffrey leiden leiden,also expressed confidence in the results,saying that they were driving us to plan for potential market entries sooner than we had previously planned and that,p ending final data this summer and discussions with regulators,we look forward to accelerating the development of our cystic fibrosis combination regimen.nancy wysenski wysenski,at that time vertex chief commercial officer and executive vice president,further noted that the number of patients who stood to benefit from the combination treatment under review exceeded a market that could translate into billions of dollars in potential sales 
vertex stock price swiftly responded to the announcement of the promising interim results.on may,the day of the announcement,vertex stock closed at per share up from the prior close of,with a trading volume forty times higher than average.by may,the closing price had risen to per share.meanwhile,five vertex employees named as defendants in this suit joshua boger boger,then vertex director paul silva silva,who had formerly served as vertex vice president and corporate controller elaine ullian ullian,vertex independent director mueller and wysenski sold a total of shares of vertex stock,collecting almost million in all.
on may,vertex announced in a press release that the interim results that had so energized its market prospects had overstated the improvement in lung function exhibited among the phase patients receiving the combination treatment.the error,as vertex acknowledged that day in a conference call,stemmed from a misinterpretation as to whether the results vertex had received from the statistical analysis vendor reflected the absolute improvement in the patients lung function or,rather,the improvement relative to the patients baseline levels of lung function when evaluated properly,vertex press release explained,the data showed that percent of the patients taking the combination treatment rather than percent,as had initially been reported experienced an absolute improvement of percent or more,and that percent rather than percent,as had initially been reported experienced an absolute improvement of percent or more.immediately following the announcement of the corrected results,the closing price of vertex stock experienced its greatest decline in three years,dropping to per share,down from per share on may,yet still well up from the may close of.
just short of two years later,local filed a complaint against vertex as well as boger,leiden,mueller,silva,ullian,and wysenski on behalf of all those who,like local,had acquired vertex stock between the announcement of the overstated interim results on may,and the announcement of the corrected results on may.the complaint charged all defendants with securities fraud under section b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,and the securities and exchange commission rule,b.it also charged the six individual defendants with joint and several liability under section a of the exchange act,a,for the alleged securities fraud,on the theory that these defendants controlled vertex,controlled other individual defendants and charged boger,mueller,silva,ullian,and wysenski with insider trading under section of the exchange act,id.a.the gravamen of the alleged fraud,according to the complaint,is that,w hen faced with study results that seemed too good to be true,defendants,rather than checking the results,turned a blind eye,accepting and promoting unlikely data that offered them a windfall on the sale of their stock.
the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim,see fed.civ.b,arguing that the facts alleged in the complaint fail to generate a strong inference that the defendants acted with the mental state required to render them liable under section b and rule.the district court agreed.it found as well that local section a and section claims could not survive in the absence of a proper section b and rule claim,and dismissed the complaint.see local,supp.at.this timely appeal ensued.

we review de novo the district court grant of the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.aldridge cross,cir.
section b and rule 
to successfully state a securities fraud claim under section b and rule,a plaintiff must adequately allege,among other things,scienter.scienter is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.id.at quoting ernst ernst hochfelder.a plaintiff can establish scienter by showing that defendants either consciously intended to defraud,or acted with a high degree of recklessness.pub.emps.ret.bos.sci.boston i,cir.quoting aldridge,at.recklessness in this context is a highly unreasonable omission,involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.in re smith wesson holding.sec,cir.quoting.pub.emps.ret.bos.sci.boston ii,cir.the omission must present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious the actor must have been aware of it.id.quoting boston ii,at.this form of recklessness is closer to a lesser form of intent than it is to ordinary negligence.greebel ftp software,cir.
to determine whether the complaint here adequately alleges that the defendants acted with this culpable mental state,we eschew the ordinary standards of federal rule of civil procedure a,which require only that the plaintiff plead factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant s are liable for the misconduct alleged,ashcroft iqbal.instead,congress has directed us to evaluate section b and rule claims of this type under the heightened pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,pub,stat.see aldridge,at.as is relevant here,the pslra provides that a complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant s acted with scienter.b a.under this standard,a complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,makor issues rights.
local argues on appeal that the complaint adequately alleges facts making it as likely as not that the defendants recklessly turned a blind eye to an obvious danger that the announced interpretation of the initial results was wrong to support this argument,local points to the cumulative probative force of seven facts alleged in the complaint.we are mindful that e ach individual fact about scienter may provide only a brushstroke,but it is our obligation to consider the resulting portrait.in re cabletron,cir.accordingly,we examine each alleged fact in turn,and then conclude by assessing them cumulatively.
first,vertex itself described the results as unexpected,or as exceed ing expectations.the results were unexpected because,the complaint alleges,it was known within vertex that vx caused kalydeco to work less well.the fact remains,though,that vertex made the investment necessary to design and perform a study testing the two drugs in combination.so,its puffing professions of surprise notwithstanding,vertex must have thought that positive results were possible,even if not probable.we suspect,too,that many studies of new pharmaceutical products result in surprises,both good and bad.
this moves us to local second and related point,which arises from the complaint allegations concerning the science of cystic fibrosis research.local alleges that cystic fibrosis research focuses on both lung function and sweat chloride.because cystic fibrosis progressively and eventually fatally obstructs the lungs,pulmonary function is an important marker of cystic fibrosis lung disease severity.as a measure of pulmonary function,scientists test the patient for forced expired volume fev.local alleges that scientists studying cystic fibrosis also measure sweat chloride levels because cystic fibrosis impairs the tissues of the sweat glands,thereby elevating the concentration of chloride in the patient sweat.
the interim results reported to and by vertex showed increased fev measurements,but no material drop in sweat chloride levels.local argues that some people have described sweat chloride levels to be the gold standard in cystic fibrosis research,and that individuals at the company were highly skeptical of the study results because of the lack of sweat chloride improvements.therefore,reasons local,it was obvious that there was something wrong with the results.
missing from the allegations is any contention that any defendant viewed the sweat chloride levels as incompatible with the fev measurements,or that any of the unnamed individuals conveyed any such skepticism to any defendant.greebel,at auto.indus.pension trust fund textron,cir.inference that defendants suspected a statement was misleading is weaker where warnings by subordinates or expressions of concern by executives are notably absent.the complaint does not even allege that scientists in general,much less those at vertex,regarded the reported results as implausible.and given that the final results reflected the same phenomenon improved fev and steady sweat chloride levels,there is no reason given here to presume that scientists in general must view the possibility of such results as obviously wrong.notably,too,vertex reported the sweat chloride levels in the same press release in which it reported the positive fev results.so it would seem most likely that vertex itself did not view the former as belying the latter,and neither apparently did the market 
third,local alleges that the study was very important to vertex,and that it would therefore be absurd to suggest that defendants were not aware of the suspect nature of the results.it is true that the importance of a particular item to a defendant can support an inference that the defendant is paying close attention to that item.institutional inv rs grp.avaya,cir.such an inference,however,is only helpful in establishing scienter if that close attention would have revealed an incongruity so glaring as to make the need for further inquiry obvious.see id.at noting that a steep decline in operating margins creates inference that chief financial officer,who was paying close attention to these numbers,would investigate the cause.we have already discussed why the complaint fails to establish that the announced results,on their face,contained such an obvious incongruity.
similarly,some cases have recognized that certain key facts known to company managers concerning a company flagship product,such as whether a million contract has been signed to sell the product,or that sales are falling fast rather than rising,are very likely known to senior management who made repeated public announcements concerning sales of the product.see,makor issues rights,tellabs,cir.but the complaint here does not allege that anybody at vertex responsible for receiving,reviewing,and reporting the results had actually spotted the error in the interpretation of the results before the discovery that led to the second announcement.
fourth,local points to its allegation that the specific error in the publicly reported results namely,the substitution of relative improvement for absolute improvement in lung function was so fundamental that it should have been apparent to the vertex pulmonologist responsible for receiving the raw data from the vendor regardless of how the data w ere presented by the vendor.the pulmonologist is not a defendant,however,and there is no allegation that any party responsible for the decision to announce the interim results received the raw data.the fact that a vertex pulmonologist was the one who received the raw data actually cuts sharply against local because there is no allegation that even this pulmonologist noticed or suspected that vertex reported interpretation of the results was incorrect,or told anyone of any skepticism.the complaint does assert in conclusory fashion that the pulmonologist should have known of the error.yet,the complaint tells us nothing about the precise form of the information conveyed by the vendor,or the vendor reliability.negligence by the pulmonologist,too,hardly gets local anywhere.rather,it adds a concrete reason why the erroneous interpretation of the study results would not have been obvious to the executives to whom the pulmonologist reported the results.
even making the reasonable inference,as local urges,that the defendants had access to the raw data review of which would allegedly have rendered the error obvious through simple math we have already determined that the complaint allegations are insufficient to establish that the erroneously interpreted end results which are all the indiv
