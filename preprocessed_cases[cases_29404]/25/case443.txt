this patent infringement case concerns a drug for the treatment of hepatitis b.after a bench trial,the united states district court for the district of delaware found claim of patent patent invalid as obvious.we affirm the district court invalidity judgment for the reasons that follow.
appellant bristol myers squibb bms owns the patent.claim of the patent is directed to a nucleoside analog composed of two regions a carbocyclic ring and a guanine base.nucleoside analogs are manmade compounds designed to mimic the activity of natural nucleosides,the building blocks of dna and rna.these compounds are modified slightly from their natural counterparts to interfere with the replication of viral dna which means that they can serve as possible antiviral compounds.claim covers one such compound,entecavir.bms markets entecavir as a treatment for hepatitis b under the trade name baraclude.
entecavir is a modified version of the natural nucleoside deoxyguanosine deoxyguanosine.entecavir is structurally identical to deoxyguanosine except for one difference it has a double bond also known as an exocyclic methylene group at the position of the carbocyclic ring where deoxyguanosine has an oxygen atom.
the chemical structures of entecavir and deoxyguanosine are illustrated below 
appellant br.see also.
the structures referenced throughout this opinion include a carbocyclic ring of carbon atoms,which is illustrated above as the pentagonal structure at the left of each diagram,and a nucleoside base,which is illustrated above as the double ring structure to the right.in both figures above,the nucleoside base is guanine.
entecavir is an effective treatment for hepatitis b.the drug is generally accepted as a safe drug,with a broad therapeutic window for treatment,providing for a wide gap between low doses of the drug that are effective against disease and the high doses that could cause unwanted toxicity.it also has a high genetic barrier to resistance such that,if they have not previously received a treatment,few patients treated with entecavir develop drug resistance to it.
the appellee,teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic version of entecavir.in support of its anda,teva filed paragraph iv certifications,alleging that its generic products would not infringe the patent,that the patent was invalid or unenforceable.see j a vii iv.
bms sued teva for patent infringement,claiming that teva anda filing infringed the patent.see e.at trial,the parties narrowed the issues to obviousness and inequitable conduct teva obviousness argument focused on the selection of cdg as a lead compound from the prior art.
cdg is a potent antiviral carbocyclic nucleoside analog that is structurally similar to the natural nucleoside deoxyguanosine,differing only in that it replaces an oxygen atom with a carbon atom at the position.the following illustrations compare the chemical structures of cdg and deoxyguanosine.

the earliest priority date for the patent is the date that bms filed the application,october.cdg synthesis was first published in the journal of medicinal chemistry in by fulmer shealy the shealy reference of the southern research institute the sri.the shealy reference taught that cdg exhibited better in vitro antiviral activity against the herpes virus than the drug at the time,ara shealy obtained a patent for cdg and other related compounds,stating that they were useful in the treatment of viral infections.subsequent research on cdg by shealy showed in vivo activity against herpes viruses.
after the shealy reference was published,other researchers soon began working with cdg as an antiviral,including scientists at sri,mount sinai school of medicine,glaxosmithkline glaxo,and other institutions.in,montgomery of sri published an article summarizing the state of antiviral research at the time and reported that cdg was b y far the most promising antiviral against herpes.the montgomery reference also taught that cdg was five to six times more potent than one of the leading drugs on the market,acyclovir.teva expert,heathcock,stated that the montgomery reference was a lamp post that really illuminate d cdg as a very exciting lead compound to work from,and other chemists,during the relevant time period,were using cdg as a lead compound.bms expert,schneller,conceded that he did not completely disagree with heathcock opinion.in fact,schneller himself published research investigating antiviral activity of carbocyclics,including cdg,and cited to shealy article,noting the significant antiviral activity of cdg.
also in,peter price and other researchers with the mount sinai school of medicine published the results of testing cdg against hepatitis the price reference.the price reference disclosed that cdg showed excellent activity against the hepatitis b virus with as little as ng of cdg per ml resulting in the almost complete disappearance of replicating hepatitis b virus.the price reference also taught that cdg was nontoxic in concentrations up to times the minimum effective inhibitory concentration.id.according to teva expert,heathcock,the price reference demonstrated that cdg had a very good therapeutic window because i t was effective at a level,much lower than its toxic level.
while shealy,montgomery,price,and others studied cdg,a group of medicinal chemists at syntex published antiviral studies on another nucleoside analog composed of a carbocyclic ring and adenosine base.the madhavan reference disclosed that the substitution of an exocyclic methylene double bond for the oxygen atom at the position on the carbocyclic ring on nucleoside aristeroinycin led to a nucleoside analog madhavan with significantly superior antiviral properties.this exocyclic methylene substitution is the same modification at the same location made to cdg to form entecavir.the following illustrations compare the chemical structures of cdg,entecavir,and madhavan.
appellant br.
according to bms inventor,zahler,he was aware of the madhavan reference before conceiving entecavir and testified that bms submitted it to the uspto as the most relevant piece of prior art in the patent application.but bms did not submit cdg as prior art to the uspto.
after a bench trial,the district court found that at the time of bms invention,cdg was a lead compound for the development of antiviral drugs.bristol myers squibb teva pharms.usa,d.based on the structural similarity between entecavir and cdg,the teachings of the madhavan reference,the finding that the exocyclic methylene substitution would be a small,conservative change and the totality of the prior art on cdg,the district court found that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to substitute an exocyclic methylene group at the position of cdg,with a reasonable expectation of success of creating a compound with beneficial antiviral properties.id.at.
the district court also analyzed secondary considerations of nonobviousness.although the court found that some of these considerations commercial success,need,and evidence of unexpected properties cut in favor of,the court ultimately concluded that teva proved by clear and convincing evidence that claim would have been obvious.id.at.as a result,the district court entered judgment in favor of teva.id.bms appeals the district court invalidity finding.we have jurisdiction under a.
the only issue for our review is the district court obviousness ruling.obviousness is a question of law with underlying factual findings.honeywell int l,united states.we review the conclusion of obviousness de novo,and the trial court factual findings for clear error.id.
obviousness requires assessing the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art,the scope and content of the prior art.the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue,and secondary considerations of such as commercial success,but unsolved needs,failure of others,ksr int l teleflex,quoting graham john deere.
a party seeking to invalidate a patent as obvious must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention,and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success from doing so.proctor gamble teva pharms.usa,quoting pfizer,apotex.
to establish obviousness in cases involving new chemical compounds,the accused infringer must identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound.takeda chem,alphapharm.generally,an obviousness inquiry concerning such known compounds focuses on the identity of a lead compound.eisai reddy.
a lead compound is a compound in the prior art that would be a natural choice for further development efforts.altana pharma ag teva pharms.usa.the motivation to modify that lead compound can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the art.i t is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior art compounds possess a sufficiently close relationship to create an expectation,in light of the totality of the prior art,that the new compound will have similar properties to the old.otsuka pharm,sandoz,quoting in re dillon,en banc.whether a lead compound and a claimed compound have a sufficiently close relationship frequently turns on their structural similarities and differences.daiichi sankyo matrix.
based on the prior art and testimony,the district court properly found strong evidence of obviousness,because the record shows that a skilled artisan would have selected cdg as a lead compound and made the minor modification to arrive at entecavir.moreover,we see no clear error in the district court fact findings regarding evidence of secondary considerations of.
bms attacks the lower court obviousness determination by contending that a skilled artisan would have had to make too many decisions to arrive at entecavir.those decisions include selecting the class of nucleoside analog compounds,cdg as a lead compound from the class of carbocyclics,the carbocyclic ring or guanine base of cdg for modification,the or position on the carbocyclic ring,the specific chemical element on the position carbon,and the type of carbon to carbon bond single or double.we conclude that the district court analysis is well supported.
during the relevant time period in the late,carbocyclic analogs were generating a great deal of interest among researchers searching for compounds with antiviral activity.both parties experts agree on that point.several research institutions including glaxo,syntex,abbott laboratories,and sri investigated and published on antiviral activity of carbocyclic nucleosides.thus,the district court had sufficient evidence to conclude that one of ordinary skill in the art during the relevant time period would have studied carbocyclic analogs as a promising area for antiviral drug discovery.
of the carbocyclic analogs on which researchers focused in the late,cdg was a natural choice for further development.altana,at.the district court observed,based on bms expert own testimony,that medicinal chemists during the relevant time frame were actually treating and using cdg as a lead compound in the search for new antivirals at the time.emphasis in original.the shealy,montgomery,and price references collectively reinforce that understanding of cdg.
bms challenges the selection of cdg as a lead compound because it was discovered to be toxic in the.however,at the time of entecavir invention,the price reference showed that cdg was generally understood to be safe and nontoxic,and other researchers were already using it as a lead compound.as the district court points out,in october,cdg was not yet known to have high toxicity,and bms expert,schneller,agreed that researchers at the time treated cdg as a promising compound,emphasis in original.therefore,we see no error in the selection of cdg as the lead compound here.see velander garner,fed.cir obviousness,and expectation of success,are evaluated from the perspective of a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention.emphasis added citation omitted see also eisai,at.
accordingly,we therefore agree with the district court that those of ordinary skill in the art would have selected cdg,a carbocyclic analog,as a lead compound for further development efforts before bms applied for the patent in october.see daiichi,at explaining that more than mere structural similarity must be identified as a reason to select a compound as a lead compound knowledge in the art of the functional properties and limitations of the prior art compounds are also important to the analysis 
after selecting a lead compound,both experts schneller and heathcock agreed that a chemist in drug development would seek to make small,conservative changes to that structure.in drug development,it is common to modify a lead compound in an effort to obtain a compound with better activity.otsuka,at quotation omitted.
with cdg as a lead compound,the record here amply supports the conclusion that one of ordinary skill in the art would have had a motivation to modify cdg carbocyclic ring by substituting an exocyclic methylene group at the position to make the patented compound,entecavir.see otsuka,at see also takeda,at.
in choosing whether to modify cdg carbocyclic ring or its guanine base,bms expert,schneller,initially testified that he would retain the carbocyclic portion,but he acknowledged on that other chemists were making changes to the carbocyclic portion.ja.teva expert,heathcock,also testified that changing the carbocyclic portion resulted in greater activity than changes to the guanine ring.accordingly,this was a natural decision because the goal was to develop antivirals with improved activity.
unrefuted expert testimony also explained how the next obvious choice for modification would have been either the or position on the carbocyclic ring,because only at these locations could small changes easily be made to the molecule.both experts agreed that a skilled artisan would focus on the smallest elements on the top row of the periodic table,including carbon and fluorine.for a specific element,bms expert,schneller,testified in his deposition that he would rule out everything but the carbon and that carbon was the only one that sticks out.teva expert,heathcock,also explained that the choice to have an exocyclic methylene double bond over a methyl group single bond would be a more conservative choice,because a methyl group is bigger and longer than an exocyclic methylene group,and the easiest way to synthesize a methyl group would be to make methylene first.
futhermore,the madhavan reference demonstrated that adding an exocyclic methylene group to a carbocyclic nucleoside analog can result in a lead compound with improved antiviral activity.specifically,it teaches that aristeromycin and madhavan were two compounds that differed only in the presence of an exocyclic methylene substitution at the position that modification resulted in the formation of a much more potent antiviral.
teva expert,heathcock,testified that the substitution was an obvious modification in light of the prior art because there were other antiviral compounds like that that had already been made and a chemist would expect the nucleoside analog to have similar biological properties of cdg itself,which were good properties.during prosecution of the patent,bms presented the madhavan reference as containing the closest piece of prior art to entecavir.bms expert,schneller,does not directly state that entecavir was obvious.but,on cross examination,schneller stated that the madhavan reference would not dissuade a chemist from adding the exocyclic methylene to form an antiviral drug.and even though the madhavan compound was more toxic than the underlying lead compound,aristeromycin,which itself was cytotoxic,schneller admitted that the combination of features reported in the madhavan and shealy references could have led a person of skill in the art to seek new antivirals.
based on the record,we see no clear error in the district court finding that the modification required to transform cdg into the structurally similar entecavir is a minor one the addition of a single carbon atom to form an exocyclic methylene with the carbon atom at the position of t
