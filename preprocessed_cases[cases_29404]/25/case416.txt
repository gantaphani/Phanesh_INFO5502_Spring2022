appellants seek review of the district court summary judgment determination that patent patent is invalid under.the district court concluded that the patent is directed to a law of nature that hepatocytes are capable of surviving multiple cycles and that the patented process lacks the requisite inventive concept.celsis in vitro,cellzdirect,supp,supplemented,supp.because the patent claims are not directed to a concept,we vacate and remand.
hepatocytes are a type of liver cell that have a number of attributes useful for testing,diagnostic,and treatment purposes.for example,hepatocytes can be used to investigate how drugs under development may be metabolized by the liver or can be used to measure a drug toxicity or other effects on liver biology.certain factors,however,limit their use fresh hepatocytes can only be obtained from liver resections or livers of organ donors,and their lifespan is short.patent ll.supply is thus erratic,making availability limited and unpredictable.id.at ll.
prior to the invention of the patent,scientists developed cryopreservation techniques to preserve hepatocytes for later use.id.at ll.these methods generally comprised freezing hepatocytes at frigid temperatures then,when needed,thawing them and recovering the viable cells using density gradient fractionation.id.at,ll.
the prior art cryopreservation method had its problems,however.it was understood that the process could damage the hepatocytes,leading to poor recovery numbers of viable cells.id.at ll.furthermore,these prior methods were unsuitable for preparing hepatocyte pools.id.at ll.because hepatocytes from different donors generally have different metabolic properties,researchers desired to pool hepatocytes from various source livers to create a hepatocyte preparation approximating average liver cells.id.at ll.such pools are useful research tools to study a drug impact on a representative population.but because of the limited availability of donor livers and hepatocytes short lifespan,pooled samples from multiple donors could only be created by first accumulating and freezing enough hepatocytes from single donors,then thawing and combining them for immediate use.id.at ll.given the understanding that cryopreservation could damage cells,prevailing wisdom was that hepatocytes could be frozen only once and then had to be either used or discarded.celsis,supp.at.this severely limited the creation of pooled hepatocyte products.id.
the inventors of the patent discovered that some fraction of hepatocytes are capable of surviving multiple cycles.as inventor hardy testified,initially we just proved that you could twice freeze the cells and still have viable cells.t he unexpected outcome was that cells twice frozen behaved like cells that were once frozen.id.at quoting.
armed with this discovery,the inventors developed an improved process of preserving hepatocytes,claimed in the patent.in general,the improved process comprises a subjecting previously frozen and thawed cells to density gradient fractionation to separate viable cells from ones b recovering the viable cells and c refreezing the viable cells.patent.the claims specify that the resulting hepatocyte preparation can be thawed and used immediately,exhibiting viability after the second thaw.id.
the patented process has a number of advantages over the prior art.by separating out and refreezing only the viable cells,the preserved hepatocyte preparations can be thawed and used later without unacceptable loss of viability.id.at ll.pooled hepatocyte preparations are also much more easily made hepatocyte samples from single donors can be pooled together to create a composite preparation that can be refrozen for later use.id.at.this was not possible with the prior art cryopreservation techniques.appellant employs the improved process in its liverpool tm product,which comprises,pooled hepatocyte preparations useful for a wide variety of research purposes.
claim is representative of the patent.it recites 
a method of producing a desired preparation of hepatocytes,said hepatocytes being capable of being frozen and thawed at least two times,and in which greater than of the hepatocytes of said preparation are viable after the final thaw,said method comprising 
a subjecting hepatocytes that have been frozen and thawed to density gradient fractionation to separate viable hepatocytes from nonviable hepatocytes,
b recovering the separated viable hepatocytes,and 
c cryopreserving the recovered viable hepatocytes to thereby form said desired preparation of hepatocytes without requiring a density gradient step after thawing the hepatocytes for the second time,wherein the hepatocytes are not plated between the first and second cryopreservations,and wherein greater than of the hepatocytes of said preparation are viable after the final thaw.
additional dependent claims are directed to the type of density gradient fractionation,the type of hepatocytes,viability,and pooling.for example,with respect to pooling,claim recites 
the method of claim,wherein said preparation comprises a pooled preparation of hepatocytes of multiple sources.
ivt sued ltc for infringing the patent in response,ltc filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity under and.the district court granted the motion,finding the patent invalid under and dismissing the action with prejudice without reaching the issues.celsis,supp.at.in finding the patent invalid under,the court applied the supreme court framework for determining patent eligibility.see alice cls bank int l,citing mayo collaborative servs.prometheus.at step one,the court concluded that the patent is directed to an ineligible law of nature the discovery that hepatocytes are capable of surviving multiple cycles.celsis,supp.at.at step two,the court determined that the patented process lacks the requisite inventive concept,observing that,upon discovering the cells capability of surviving multiple cycles,the inventors simply reapplied a freezing process.id.at.

section permits the patenting of any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof,subject to other requirements of the title.the supreme court has interpreted and its predecessors for more than years to contain an important implicit exception laws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas are not patentable.alice,at quoting ass for molecular pathology myriad genetics.the concern underlying these judicial exclusions is that patent law not inhibit further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of these building blocks of human ingenuity.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting mayo,at.
the supreme court has recently articulated a test for distinguishing patents that claim one of the exceptions from those that claim applications of those concepts.id.citing mayo,at.step one asks whether the claim is directed to one of the concepts.id.if the answer is no,the inquiry is over the claim falls within the ambit of.if the answer is yes,the inquiry moves to step two,which asks whether,considered both individually and as an ordered combination,the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a application.id.quoting mayo,at.step two is described as a search for an inventive concept.id.quoting mayo,at.at step two,more is required than,routine,conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community,which fails to transform the claim into significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.mayo,at.
we begin with step one whether the claims here are directed to a concept.the district court concluded that they were that the patent is directed to an ineligible law of nature the discovery that hepatocytes are capable of surviving multiple cycles.celsis,supp.at.we disagree.
