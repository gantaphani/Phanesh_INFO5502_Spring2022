kenneth alonso appeals a decision of the united states patent and trademark office board of patent appeals and interferences board sustaining in part the examiner final rejection of claim of patent application application.in its decision,the board reversed the examiner rejection of claim for lack of enablement and sustained the rejection as invalid for lack of adequate written description.ex parte alonso,july,decision.we affirm.
background 
an arsenal of antibodies generated by the immune system defends the human body against illnesses caused by bacteria and cancerous cells and other invasive agents.antibodies are large,molecules secreted by white blood cells known as b lymphocytes,or.antibodies are capable of binding to the surfaces of foreign cells or other substances known as antigens.the specific location on the surface of the antigen where the antibody attaches is termed the epitope.the arms of the molecule bind to the epitope with specificity.antibodies that bind to the same epitope are said to have the same idiotype.monoclonal antibodies mabs are derived from a single precursor and have a single idiotype.they are produced using hybridoma fusion technology.a hybridoma is created by fusing a human tumor cell to an human,resulting in secretion by the of monoclonal antibodies with identical affinity and specificity to a given epitope on the surface of the tumor cell.
on june,alonso filed the application entitled,method of producing hybridomas,the production of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies therefrom,and therapeutic use thereof.the claimed invention recites a method for treating neurofibrosarcoma,a rare cancer of the sheath of a peripheral nerve,that uses human monoclonal antibodies targeted at a patient tumor.claim of the application discloses 
a method of treating neurofibrosarcoma in a human by administering an effective amount of a monoclonal antibody idiotypic to the neurofibrosarcoma of said human,wherein said monoclonal antibody is secreted from a hybridoma derived from the neurofibrosarcoma cells.
in example of the specification,alonso described the preparation of a tumor cell suspension from the sample of a tumor and the subsequent sensitization of human spleen cells.the sensitized spleen cells are fused with an immortalized cell line,a fetal marrow line,a lymphoblastoid line,or a plasma cell line from myeloma.the resulting cells are screened for hybridomas that secrete antibodies specifically reactive with the sensitizing tumor cells and with a range of other tissues and cell types.example disclosed the results of an experiment conducted by alonso in treating melanie brown,a patient with neurofibrosarcoma.adult spleen cells were sensitized with cells from brown tumor.the resulting hybridoma secreted monoclonal antibodies,which reacted with a kilodalton tumor surface antigen.the spleen line,the lymphoblast fusion line,and the hybridoma were deposited with the american type culture collection in september of.the antibody from the hybridoma line was deposited with the food and drug administration 
the examiner rejected claim as lacking adequate written descriptive support for the broad genus of antibodies encompassed by the claim language.
applicant is reminded that the disclosure only describes the preparation of a single mab produced by the hybridoma cell line.however,the claims are directed toward a much larger genus of molecules,mabs that bind to a neurofibrosarcoma,not a specific mab identified by the deposited hybridoma the crux of the rejection is whether or not applicant has provided sufficient support for the broadly claimed genus of therapeutic antibodies.as set forth in the rejection,the skilled artisan would reasonably conclude that applicant was clearly not in possession of the claimed genus of compounds.applicant should direct the claim language toward the only described embodiment,a mab produced by hybridoma.
the board affirmed the rejection,agreeing that alonso had not adequately described the claimed invention because the single antibody described in the specification is insufficiently representative to provide adequate written descriptive support for the genus of antibodies required to practice the claimed invention.decision,slip op.at.
ii.discussion 
whether an applicant has complied with the written description requirement is a finding of fact,to be analyzed from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art as of the date of the filing of the application.regents of the of cal.eli lilly,mahurkar.this court reviews the board factual determinations under a substantial evidence standard.in re gartside.substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.at citation omitted.in making the assessment,we examine the record as a whole,taking into account evidence that both justifies and detracts from an agency decision.id.that a fact finder could draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.id.citation omitted.rather,the board decision must be affirmed if any reasonable fact finder could have arrived at the same decision.id.
the written description requirement of,is straightforward the specification shall contain a written description of the invention to satisfy this requirement,the specification must describe the invention in sufficient detail so that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented the claimed invention as of the filing date sought.lockwood am.airlines,see also lizardtech,earth res.mapping,eiselstein frank.
the requirement serves a teaching function,as a quid pro quo in which the public is given meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded from practicing the invention for a limited period of time.of rochester searle,quoting enzo biochem,the board framed the issue raised by the application as follows.
w hether the single monoclonal antibody described in the specification is representative of the genus of monoclonal antibodies required to practice the claimed treatment method.that,in turn,depends on whether or not the antibodies and the antigens they bind would have been expected to vary substantially within the genus.the greater the variation in the genus,the less representative any particular antibody would be.
decision,slip op.at.
the board properly characterized the relevant genus as the genus of antibodies specific to neurofibrosarcoma cells.id.a genus can be described by disclosing a representative number of species in that genus or its relevant identifying characteristics,such as complete or partial structure,other physical chemical properties,functional characteristics when coupled with a known or disclosed correlation between function and structure,or some combination of such characteristics.enzo,at.
relying principally on two scientific articles,including one authored by alonso himself,the board determined that 
t here is ample evidence of record that the specificities of antibodies falling within the scope of the genus and the structures of the antigens they bind would be expected to vary substantially.for example,osband provides evidence of a recognition in the art that considerable antigenic heterogeneity of tumors both between patients and metastatic sites within a single patient is to be expected.in addition,an article authored by alonso acknowledges that t he efficacy of antibody therapy is thought to be related to tumor burden as well as to idiotypic change in the original tumor.this acknowledged heterogeneity is reflected in the goal of the claimed raise customized antibodies to possibly unique antigens on a particular patient tumor.
finally,as discussed above,for purposes of satisfying the written description requirement,it is not enough merely to disclose a method of making and identifying compounds capable of being used to practice the claimed invention.that is,it is not enough to describe the procedure for making a hybridoma from neurofibrosarcoma,and teach how to determine whether a given antibody,specific to a patient neurofibrosarcoma,will function in the claimed metho
