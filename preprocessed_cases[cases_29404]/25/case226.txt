joseph graham and roy lee lundy,along with several members of their families,challenge the district court order granting summary judgment to american cyanamid company on a series of fraud and product liability claims.american cyanamid manufactures orimune,which is an oral polio vaccine.plaintiffs allege that the use of orimune in one instance and the exposure to it in another caused a family member to contract polio.
seeking compensation for these injuries,both sets of plaintiffs filed fraud claims against american cyanamid,asserting that the company publicly represented orimune as licensed,manufactured,tested and released in accordance with fda regulations,when in fact the orimune vaccines at issue according to plaintiffs did not comply with fda standards.the graham plaintiffs separately brought strict liability and negligent claims against american cyanamid.both sets of plaintiffs also filed derivative claims for loss of consortium and punitive damages.the district court granted american cyanamid motion for summary judgment on all claims.we affirm.
background 
polio and the orimune vaccine.
poliomyelitis or polio is a disease of the central nervous system that causes illness,paralysis and in some instances death.it affected thousands of individuals in this country during the first half of the twentieth century.see dorothy horstmann,poliovirus poliomyelitis,in textbook of pediatric infectious diseases,ralph feigin james cherry.at its height between and,polio led to cases of paralysis per year in the united states.see id.
that this scourge did not continue through the second half of the twentieth century is a credit to the work of several scientists.in,jonas salk developed the first widely successful vaccine against polio.derived from a dead polio virus,the salk vaccine is known as an inactivated polio vaccine ipv and was licensed for production and use in the united states in.see in re sabin oral polio vaccine prods.liab,sabin i.the vaccine decreased the incidence of polio but did not eradicate it.between and,for example,nearly cases of the disease were still reported in the united states.id.thirteen thousand people became paralyzed by the disease,and more than people died from it during this period.id.
at the same time that salk was developing his vaccine,albert sabin began working on an oral polio vaccine opv made from attenuated strains of the polio virus.the sabin opv,unlike the salk ipv,is produced from a live polio virus that has been weakened but not killed.like all vaccines cultivated from live viruses,such as those used for smallpox and yellow fever,opv creates immunity by inducing a mild infection in the recipient.united states louis,cir quoting stuart am.cyanamid,cir.
opv has several advantages over ipv.opv is less expensive and requires only a single dosage,while ipv requires three inoculations and a booster shot.opv is administered orally,commonly on a sugar cube,while ipv must be injected by a hypodermic needle.the interaction of the live virus in opv with the immune system confers lifetime immunity,while ipv requires periodic.see generally sabin i.at.and opv creates herd immunity,because an individual who has not received the vaccine can obtain immunity by contact with someone who has been vaccinated.id.individuals who have been immunized with ipv,by contrast,may still serve as carriers of the wild polio virus and may pass it on to others even though they themselves have been immunized.id.
opv,however,also has several inherent risks in view of the way all vaccines developed from live.the live but weakened viruses of opv grow in the intestinal tract of the vaccinated individual.they eventually trigger the production of antibodies,which in turn make the individual immune to the disease after thirty days.on rare occasions,however,the virus reproduced in the vaccinee intestinal tract reverts to the virulent form.when this occurs,vaccinated individuals or persons coming in close contact with them during the period may contract polio.unvaccinated adults may take two precautions to avoid the risk of contracting polio alternative vaccination with ipv prior to contact with the vaccinee or avoidance of contact with the vaccinee for one month,during which time live polio viruses are being shed from the intestinal tract of the vaccinee.
in and,epidemiologists conducted a series of field trials on the use of opv.see sabin i.at.on the basis of these tests,the surgeon general in determined that opv was suitable for use in the united states,and it soon became the most widely used of the polio vaccines.id.
the federal government granted licenses to three manufacturers to make live polio vaccines from the strains developed by sabin.american cyanamid purchased strain material that sabin had developed,and its lederle laboratories division received one of the three authorized licenses from the division of biologic standards dbs of the national institutes of health to manufacture and sell opv.
the polio virus has three i,ii and different vaccines address each of them.some vaccines address just one type of polio,and one vaccine is designed to prevent all three types of polio.american cyanamid first produced monovalent vaccines,which contain just one of the three types of polio virus vaccine.in,however,the federal government granted american cyanamid a license to make and distribute a trivalent vaccine,which contains all three types of polio virus vaccine.since then,american cyanamid has distributed a trivalent opv product under the name orimune.
the production of orimune proceeds in several stages.manufacturers initially obtain wild polio virus and attenuate its neurovirulent properties by passing it through animal hosts.what results is a strain,which in small portions is then injected into monkey kidney cell cultures.this process,known as a tissue culture passage,leads to the growth of more virus and the creation of vaccine seeds.small portions of this seed material are frozen periodically and again injected into monkey kidney cell cultures to create pools of vaccine for each of the three types of polio manufactured.each monopool contains a single type of vaccine and is given a designation indicating the type of vaccine and the number of the pool,is a type iii vaccine from monopool.monopools for each of the vaccine types are then blended together to make a trivalent bulk lot that is used to fill vials.the trivalent bulk lot is given a number and letter,such as.the prefix designates orimune dosage,and the suffix represents the sequential number for the trivalent bulk of that dose.the final letter a designates the particular filling of the final product from its trivalent bulk lot.after packaging,the manufacturer gives each lot of final containers a control number,then ships the lots to physicians,pharmacies,hospitals and clinics for use.the product is not sold directly to patients.
in the late,american cyanamid explored the possibility of obtaining a new type iii seed to replace the seed it had been using to make most of the type iii component of orimune since the.at the time,another manufacturer,pfizer,had taken one of the sabin original strains and cloned it to create a seed known as sabin original rederived.in,american cyanamid obtained some of the sabin original rederived type iii seed and started using it in orimune production.
since,american cyanamid has been the sole supplier of opv in the united states.the annual number of cases of polio in this country has steadily declined since the widespread use of opv.by the,fewer than cases of paralytic polio in the united states were being reported yearly,a number that dropped to an average of ten per year in the.the figure represents one case for every million doses of vaccine distributed.sabin i.at.
federal regulation of polio vaccine production and testing in the united states.
in view of the health and safety risks of polio vaccines,the federal government regulates the manufacture and distribution of them in a variety of ways.in,the dbs adopted regulations governing the issuance of manufacturing licenses and the approval and release of opv.see formerly codified at supp.to obtain a license authorizing manufacture from the secretary of the department of health,education and welfare under these regulations,drug manufacturers must prove that their product conforms to regulations covering all phases of the manufacturing with the original sabin strains of vaccine the only strains approved in the united states and ending with the doses administered to patients.see generally.
under these regulations,tests must be performed on the vaccine during various stages of production as a condition not only for licensing but also for the release of each monopool and the filling of the product.see federal food,drug and cosmetic act,et et public health act.certain regulations are addressed solely to manufacturers of opv.see berkovitz ex rel.berkovitz united states,d.others are addressed specifically to the federal government.see,et,e.to distribute any dose of orimune,american cyanamid thus had to obtain a license from the government and allow the government to test each batch of vaccine before releasing it for use.
the regulations in effect in the required that vaccine monopools be tested in monkeys for neurovirulence before they could be used for production of vaccine.see b i iii.neurovirulence is the capacity of an infectious agent to produce pathologic effects on the central nervous system.berkovitz,at.in performing tests for neurovirulence,samples of each monopool are injected at different dilutions into the brain stems of thirty monkeys and into the spinal cords of at least fifteen other monkeys.after these injections,the monkeys are sacrificed and their spinal and brain tissues are microscopically examined by qualified pathologists who conduct a comparative evaluation of the monopool being tested relative to identical tests performed on samples of a reference attenuated poliovirus provided by the fda.see b iii.the evaluation examines 
a the number of animals showing lesions characteristic of poliovirus infection,b the number of animals showing lesions other than those characteristic of poliovirus infection,c the severity of the lesions,d the degree of dissemination of the lesions,and e the rate of occurrence of paralysis not attributable to the mechanical injury resulting from inoculation trauma.
id.a given monopool passes the neurovirulence test if a comparative analysis of the test results demonstrates that the neurovirulence of the test virus pool does not exceed that of the reference attenuated poliovirus.id.
among the fda regulations governing these neurovirulence tests at this time were a consistency of manufacture regulation and a tissue culture passage regulation.the consistency of manufacture regulation required that no lot of vaccine be released unless each monovalent pool contained therein is one of a series of five consecutive pools of the same type,each having been manufactured by the same procedures,and each having met the criteria of neurovirulence for monkeys prescribed in b id.b.the tissue culture passage regulation required that all polio v irus in the final vaccine shall represent no more than five tissue culture passages from the original strain id.a.
over time,the fda modified its regulations governing the manufacture,testing and release of opv,prompting disagreements over how the regulations should be interpreted.some of these disagreements resulted in lawsuits under the federal tort claims act ftca between the federal government and individuals allegedly injured by the vaccine.in,the fda bureau of biologics assured american cyanamid that the vaccine produced from the pfizer seed,though rederived from the sabin original,did not violate the tissue culture passage regulation.however,several ftca plaintiffs argued generally that the federal government had failed to interpret its regulations correctly and as a result had released an excessively neurovirulent orimune vaccine,which violated the tissue culture passage regulation.see sabin i.at in re sabin oral polio vaccine prods.liab,aff,cir sabin ii griffin united states,cir.similar claims were brought against vaccine manufacturers.see jones am.cyanamid,wl cir,am.cyanamid louis,cir.
in,a federal district court judge in maryland ruled that vaccine from seed was,in fact,more than five tissue culture passages beyond the sabin original strain and that the fda had violated a by approving that seed for use.see sabin ii.at.the same district court,however,expressly found that orimune made from this seed was both safe and effective 
m y finding that regulatory violations occurred does not imply that the public health is or has been endangered in any respect.according to the undisputed record,the opv used in the united states has always been state of the art vaccine and the opv program has resulted in the virtual eradication of wild poliovirus in the western hemisphere.
id.after characterizing the country opv program as perhaps the most successful public health program in history,the court held that the fda only error with respect to seed was in not amend ing the regulations to allow the pfizer seed to be the starting point for counting tissue culture that would clearly be proper and in the public interest.id.at.the fourth circuit affirmed this judgment.see in re sabin oral polio vaccine prods.liab,cir.
as a result of the sabin decisions,the fda amended its polio vaccine regulations.see additional standards for viral vaccines poliovirus vaccine live oral,may.it amended a to provide that v irus in the final vaccine shall represent no more than five tissue culture passages from the original strain or no more than five tissue culture passages from a virus clone derived from one of the first five tissue culture passages of the original strain.id.at.at the same time,the agency repealed and amended several other regulations,including the consistency of manufacture regulation.in doing so,the fda determined that,based on extensive experience with the vaccine in the field,the repealed regulations did not impact vaccine safety.see id.at.
graham american cyanamid.
zachary graham was born on may.on july,his mother,lisa graham,took him to one of the offices of delaware family practice,to receive an orimune polio vaccine.the vaccine dose came from lot,which was derived from seed.the type iii component of this lot was manufactured from monopool.
the dose of orimune that zachary graham received contained the following warning from american cyanamid 
adverse reactions 
paralytic disease following the ingesting of live poliovirus vaccines has been,on rare occasion,reported in individuals receiving the vaccine and in persons who were in close contact with vaccinees.the vaccine viruses are shed in the vaccinee stools for at least to weeks as well as via the pharyngeal route.most reports of paralytic disease following ingestion of the vaccine or contact with a recent vaccinee are based on epidemiological analysis and temporal association between vaccination or contact and the onset of symptoms.most authorities believe that a causal relationship exists.
the risk of paralysis is extremely small for vaccinees,susceptible family members and other close personal contacts.however,prior to administration of the vaccine,the attending physician should warn or specifically direct personnel acting under his authority to convey the warnings to the vaccinee,parent,guardian,or other responsible person of the possibility of paralysis.the centers for disease control report that during the years through approximately million doses of opv were distributed in the united states.in the same years,and contact paralytic cases were reported.twelve other cases have been reported in persons recipients and contacts with immune deficiency conditions.these statistics do not provide a satisfactory basis for estimating these risks on a per person basis.
when the attenuated vaccine strains are to be introduced into a household with adults who have not been adequately vaccinated or whose immune status can not be determined,the risk of paralysis can be minimized by giving these adults three doses of ipv a month apart before the children receive orimune.the cdc reports that no paralytic reactions to ipv are known to have occurred since the cluster of poliomyelitis cases caused by vaccine that contained live polioviruses that had escaped inactivation.
the immunization practices advisory committee of the public health service states because of the overriding importance of ensuring prompt and complete immunization of the child and the extreme rarity of disease in contacts,the committee recommends the administration of opv to a child regardless of the status of adult household contacts.this is the usual practice in the united states.the responsible adult should be informed of the small risk involved.an acceptable alternative,if there is strong assurance that ultimate,full immunization of the child will not be jeopardized or unduly delayed,is to immunize adults according to the schedule outlined above before giving opv to the child.
in addition to this warning,lisa graham signed an important information consent form provided by the ohio department of health.it stated that she understood the risks and benefits associated with opv and had been given an opportunity to ask questions about opv that were answered to her satisfaction.the form also stated o nce in about every million vaccinations,persons who have been vaccinated or who come in close contact with those who have recently been vaccinated are permanently crippled and may die.even though these risks are low,they should be recognized.and the form made known the availability of ipv as an alternative polio vaccine with no known risk of causing paralysis.
on july,zachary graham began experiencing fever,irritability,lethargy and general weakness.he was admitted to grady memorial hospital in delaware,ohio,where he remained until july.the centers for disease control in atlanta diagnosed zachary with type iii poliomyelitis caused by the orimune vaccine that he had received earlier in the month.as a result of the illness,zachary graham became permanently disabled in his lower extremities.
the grahams initially filed a petition in the united states court of federal claims on september,seeking compensation under the no fault provisions of the national vaccine injury compensation act,et supp.because his paralysis occurred before the act effective date of october,however,it limited the amount of compensation zachary could receive for his injuries to.b.graham family thereafter filed a motion to dismiss their petition voluntarily,which the united states court of federal claims granted on december.
on may,zachary parents,joseph and lisa graham,filed this action against american cyanamid in the southern district of ohio eastern division on behalf of zachary,who was then a minor.their complaint sought compensatory and punitive relief under a variety of theories strict products liability fraud negligence breach of implied warranty of merchantability breach of implied warranty of fitness and breach of express warranty.
lundy american cyanamid.
on march,janet lundy took her young son,jason,to an office of the jackson county combined general health district for a routine.there,carl greever gave jason a dosage of orimune for immunization from polio.on april,jason father,roy lee lundy,began experiencing fever,headaches,diarrhea,myalgia,malaise and general weakness.after a brief stay at mercy hospital in portsmouth,ohio,roy doctors transferred him to the ohio state university hospital in columbus.about a week later,he was diagnosed with type iii poliomyelitis,which led to permanent paralysis.
roy doctors advised him that the probable source of the disease was the orimune vaccine given to jason,which likely had been transmitted to him through close contact with his son.jason lundy vaccine came from lot or lot.the type iii component of orimune in lot was manufactured from a mixture of monopools and.the type iii component in lot was manufactured from a single.the evidence does not establish which lot was responsible for the orimune vaccine that jason ingested.
the lundys allege that they did not suspect that american cyanamid had acted wrongfully until they saw a television program on cases of polio on september.after viewing this program,the family initially attempted to recover for their injuries in state court.
state court action 
on march,lisa and roy lee lundy filed an action in the franklin county court of common pleas against lederle laboratories,a division of american cyanamid,the board of health of the jackson combined general health district and carl greever.see lundy lederle laboratories,div.of am.cyanamid,ohio app d.roy lee lundy sought compensatory and punitive relief under a variety of theories negligence failure to obtain informed consent from the plaintiffs failure to warn breach of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness strict liability and breach of express warranties.janet lundy separately filed a claim for loss of consortium.
the franklin county court of common pleas eventually granted motions to dismiss on behalf of all defendants.the ohio court of appeals for the tenth district affirmed these decisions.
in november,the lundy plaintiffs filed a petition in the united states court of federal claims seeking compensation under the national vaccine injury compensation act,et.on march,the lundys voluntarily withdrew their petition in view of the limited size of the award authorized by the act.see b.
federal court action 
on may,roy,janet and jason lundy filed this action in federal court in the southern district of ohio eastern division,naming american cyanamid as the only defendant.they sought compensatory and punitive relief under the following theories of liability strict products liability fraud negligence breach of implied warranty of merchantability breach of implied warranty of fitness and breach of express warranty.janet and jason lundy each filed independent claims.american cyanamid filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that all of the claims were barred by res judicata due to the prior action and the statute of limitations.with the exception of roy fraud claim and jason claim,the district court dismissed each of the other claims as barred by res judicata on september.
the two remaining lundy claims were consolidated with the graham plaintiffs claims.on july,after considerable discovery,american cyanamid filed separate motions for summary judgment against the lundy plaintiffs and the graham plaintiffs.
e.the district court decision 
on december,the district court granted american cyanamid motions for summary judgment against the grahams and lundys.as to the lundys,the court held that they had failed to submit sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue that the alleged fraudulent representations made by american cyanamid in the package insert regarding compliance were in fact false.it further concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to submit any admissible evidence that the alleged violations had any impact on the safety of the orimune dose that jason lundy received.
as to the grahams,the court concluded that they had abandoned their fraud claim by failing to respond to american cyanamid summary judgment motion on the claim.it dismissed the grahams strict liability claim,concluding that orimune was unavoidably unsafe.and it dismissed the grahams negligent claim,concluding that the orimune warnings and important information sheet provided to zachary graham and his mother were adequate and reasonable as a matter of law.on the basis of these rulings,the court held that the derivative nature of jason lundy consortium claim and each claim for punitive damages required these claims to be dismissed as a matter of law as well.while the district court labeled the entry disposing of all of these claims a final judgment,neither the record nor the docket sheet reveals what happened to the three warranty claims filed by the graham plaintiffs in their complaint.because the grahams do not address these claims on appeal and because the district court purported to dismiss all claims,we do not address them here.the district court denied the graham and lundy plaintiffs motions for reconsideration,and these consolidated appeals followed.
ii.discussion 
the customary rules for reviewing a decision apply.we give de novo review to the district court decision.sperle.dep t of,cir.a decision granting summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.and in considering such motions,we give all reasonable factual inferences to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
our jurisdiction over these claims rests on the diversity of citizenship of the parties.all of the graham and lundy plaintiffs are residents of ohio.american cyanamid,incorporated in maine,maintains its principal place of business in new jersey.see.in this setting,we sit in effect as another court of the forum state,in this case ohio,and therefore must apply its rules.see muncie power,united tech,cir.in this instance,the parties agree that those rules indicate that ohio substantive law governs this claim.
all three of the tort claims in this case represent a variation on a common theme.whether labeled fraud,strict liability,or negligent failure to warn,all three claims turn on the theory that there is a proximate connection between the alleged violations of the fda neurovirulence rules and the safety of the orimune vaccine.because we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to establish a triable issue of fact on this central point and because we conclude that each of these tort claims otherwise fails as a matter of law,we agree with the district court that the claims must be summarily dismissed.
we begin by addressing the one claim common to both sets of plaintiffs.the grahams and lundys each allege that american cyanamid acted fraudulently by representing that orimune was licensed,manufactured,tested and released in accordance with fda regulations when in fact it did not comply with fda standards.to establish a cognizable claim of fraud under ohio law,a claimant must prove the following six elements a a representation or,where there is a duty to disclose,a concealment of fact,b which is material to the transaction at hand,c made falsely,with knowledge of its falsity,or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred,d with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it,e justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment,and f an injury proximately caused by the reliance.russ trw,ohio.the elements of the claim are conjunctive,and accordingly all of them must be shown.see schwartz capital sav.loan,ohio app d.
both in the district court and here,the parties have vigorously contested many of these elements.did the company in fact violate certain fda regulations in manufacturing,the tissue culture passage and consistency of manufacture regulations were american cyanamid regulatory representations inaccurate did plaintiffs justifiably rely upon any of these representations were the representations material to product safety and,even if all of plaintiffs allegations are true,did the alleged regulatory violations proximately cause these injuries because we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed as a matter of law to present admissible evidence of proximate cause,we address this issue and this issue with one minor exception alone.
under ohio law,plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that american cyanamid alleged misrepresentation of orimune regulatory compliance proximately caused their injuries.see burr bd.of county comm rs,ohio,cohen lamko,ohio.see also picklesimer baltimore,ohio,noting that ordinary element of proximate cause applies where plaintiff has alleged fraud restatement second of torts cmt.a noting that ordinary rules of legal cause govern fraudulent misrepresentation cases involving physical harm.to show proximate cause,the grahams and lundys must demonstrate that the fact allegedly with the fda their harm.see gaines,ohio,holding that misstatement by doctor could have caused plaintiff physical injuries in action for fraud.that is to say,was the plaintiffs contraction of polio a natural and probable reasonably foreseeable consequence of the alleged noncompliance with the regulations see strother hutchinson,ohio,ohio pfirsch baking,ohio app d.in view of the technical and scientifically complex nature of this inquiry,only expert testimony may satisfy it.see daubert merrell dow,d berdyck shinde,ohio.
the fourth circuit recently addressed the issue of proximate cause in a similar context in american cyanamid louis university,cir.in that case,louis university sued american cyanamid,seeking contribution for a judgment arising from injuries suffered by one of its patients.louis university claimed that the orimune vaccine violated the fda tissue culture passage and consistency of manufacture neurovirulence regulations.in doing so,however,the university failed to produce expert testimony establishing that a polio vaccine violating these fda regulations was any more likely to cause injury than a fully compliant vaccine.i n analyzing the element of proximate cause in claims against cyanamid,the district court initially explained,the focus must be on whether the plaintiff can prove that it was a defect in the opv that resulted in his injury,not simply whether he had been exposed to opv derived from a seed that had been improperly approved in violation of the regulatory process.louis united states,d.applying missouri law,the district court held that a violation of the opv regulations is not sufficient to prove the element of proximate cause in a context where a plaintiff must prove that it is more likely than not that it was excessive neurovirulence in a dose of vaccine that caused him to contract polio.id.at.the fourth circuit affirmed,holding that louis university presented no expert testimony showing that the patient would not have contracted polio or would have contracted a less severe case of polio had he been given a vaccine complying with the neurovirulence regulations.at.
today case parallels louis university in many ways.it involves the same defendant,the same orimune vaccine,the same fda regulations,the same allegations of and the testimony of two of the same.almond and steinman.a different state law applies,to be ohio law,there missouri law.louis university of course comes from a different circuit.and some differences in the evidence and apparently in the nature of the tort claims exist as well.but in the end we see the issue in much the same way louis university did.under ohio law,as under missouri law,plaintiffs must show that american cyanamid alleged misrepresentation of orimune regulatory compliance proximately caused their injuries.because the grahams and lundys have not made out a tenable claim of proximate cause in this respect and more specifically because they have not produced expert testimony that supports this claim,their claims must be dismissed as a matter of law.
as in louis university,almond and steinman did not satisfy the proximate cause requirement in either a general or a specific manner.they did not show as a general matter that american cyanamid alleged regulatory noncompliance increased the risk that the orimune vaccine would cause polio in recipients or those in close contact with recipients,beyond the inherent risk long known to be associated with opv.plaintiffs statistician,krieger,attempted to perform a statistical analysis to determine if one could predict based on the neurovirulence test results of the lot whether somebody i s more likely or less likely to get polio from that particular lot,if it were released.krieger dep.at testifying in campagna am.cyanamid.but he did not find a correlation or any study supporting the existence of such a correlation.id.
plaintiffs and their experts do not fare any better in discussing the alleged violation of specific neurovirulence regulations.they initially claim,for example,that the vaccines at issue violate the tissue culture passage regulation.at the time of manufacture,this regulation required the vaccines to be no more than five tissue culture passages from the sabin original strain,see a,on the theory that more than five tissue culture passages would increase monkey neurovirulence.the lundys cite a single article,published in,to support their claim of a causal connection between monkey neurovirulence and the likelihood of paralytic polio.see murray,standardization,licensing,and availability of live polio vaccine.while the article states that n eurovirulence for monkeys has some correlation with safety in man,it equivocates on the extent of that relationship,noting that many strains exist which,while causing evidence of infection in monkeys,apparently cause no discernible disease in man.id.at.in the end,the article fails to address whether a causal connection between monkey neurovirulence and paralytic polio exists and indeed never references tissue culture passage.no less importantly,the lundys offer no studies,data or expert testimony establishing any such connection.
when questioned about compliance with the tissue culture passage regulation,it is true,almond opined that orimune exceeded the permissible tissue culture passage limits.at the same time,however,he called the regulation daft and in need of change,and did not opine that failure to comply with the regulation would lead to a more dangerous vaccine.more specifically,almond testified as follows about the regulation 
t he move to pfizer seed was a sensible development and a desirable development.but in light of that development and in light of the decision to do it,the maintaining of a regulation which said you could be more than five passages away from the original strain was daft.it should have been changed.
q.they should have amended the regulation 
a.they should have amended the regulation.
now,if they had amended the regulation 
before giving it to zachary 
a.that would have been fine.
almond,june,at.
some seven months after this deposition and six months after american cyanamid filed its motion for summary judgment,almond executed a new affidavit to explain his previous references to the daft regulation.almond.in that affidavit,he claims that american cyanamid was daft in not seeking to have the regulation amended before producing orimune from the pfizer seed.id.as the district court noted,however,a party can not create a factual issue by filing an affidavit which contradicts earlier deposition testimony after a motion for summary judgment has been made.if an affidavit is untimely and inconsistent with prior discovery responses,it is inadmissible and should not be considered.graham am.cyanamid,wl,slip op.at.see hughes vanderbilt,cir.no less importantly,almond affidavit never contradicts his deposition testimony that the fda should have changed its regulation.
in,when the fda did amend this regulation,it expressly recognized the absence of any correlation between observed monkey neurovirulence and the risk of paralytic polio.
no single vaccine lot has been associated with an increased incidence of poliomyelitis.the lots that have been identified as associated with a case of paralytic poliomyelitis have had typically low scores when tested by fda and the manufacturer for neurovirulence in monkeys.
at.with respect to the tissue culture passage regulation,in short,plaintiffs have not established that this alleged regulatory noncompliance increased the risk that the orimune vaccine would cause polio in recipients or those in close contact with recipients.
plaintiffs also contend that the vaccines at issue,and more specifically the relevant monopools comprising orimune type iii component of the vaccine,did not meet the consistency of manufacture regulation.as noted,this regulation required manufacturers at the time of production to demonstrate the genetic stability of the seed and the regularity of its manufacturing processes through the production of five consecutively and properly manufactured monovalent pools.see b each monovalent pool must be one of a series of five consecutive pools of the same type,each pool having been manufactured by the same procedures,and each having met the criteria of neurovirulence for monkeys.
again,however,plaintiffs have not produced evidence showing that a monopool that failed to satisfy the consistency of manufacture regulation would be more likely to cause polio than one that satisfied the requirement.when asked whether there was a scientific basis for concluding that the consistency of manufacture requirement was linked with product safety,almond testified that there is a scientific argument that you can make which would support such a conclusion i am not saying that is the right conclusion.almond,april,at.almond added that he was not aware of any study supporting this theory.id.this testimony does not suffice to create a material dispute of fact.an admissible expert opinion,it is clear,must be supported by more than subjective belief and unsupported speculation mclean ontario,cir quotations and citations omitted.
nor did steinman fill this gap.he testified that he was not aware of any data one way or the other showing that a violation of this regulation poses a higher risk of causing paralytic polio than one satisfying the requirement.he testified 
donovan q you understand and acknowledge that live oral polio vaccine poses a risk of polio 
kops objection.
the witness yes.
donovan q whether it complies with the regulations in your view or it does not comply 
the witness a absolutely,yes.
steinman,june,at.the fda view of the former consistency of manufacture regulation echoes this view.in,it amended and expanded the regulation in an attempt to make it more applicable to product safety.
the former consistency requirements were based on the premise that the failure of a monovalent virus pool to meet neurovirulence requirements could be the result of a manufacturing deficiency n o criteria were provided to link the history of performance of monovalent virus pools with the continued qualification of the seed virus.long experience has shown that the failure of a monovalent virus pool,produced from an acceptable seed virus,is usually unrelated to deficiencies in the manufacturing process,but is usually due instead to test variability the revised methodology is at least as stringent as the former consistency requirements in detecting neurovirulence problems related to manufacturing defects,while having the added benefit of providing a statistical means for monitoring the continued qualification of a seed virus by evaluating its ability to consistently produce monovalent pools of acceptable neurovirulence t hese requirements provide assurances of consistency while actually reducing the likelihood that a seed virus will be rejected on the basis of test variability unrelated to genetic stability.
at.on this record,plaintiffs have not shown a connection between this regulation and product safety.
attempting to fill this evidentiary gap,the grahams and lundys make a series of arguments to the effect that the alleged violations of these regulations establish negligence per se and to the apparent effect that proximate cause on this fraud claim accordingly need not be shown.but the invocation of this tort doctrine by itself,whether in the context of a negligence claim or a fraud claim,does not excuse the claimant from showing that the regulation at issue has a tenable and provable connection to public safety.see,merchants mutual ins.baker,ohio,negligence per se does not equal liability per se.simply because the law may presume negligence from a person violation of a statute or rule does not mean that the law presumes that such negligence was the proximate cause of the harm inflicted.see also chambers mary school,ohio,noting that negligence per se requires a showing of proximate cause.in this instance,the alleged violations relate to regulations that no longer are in existence,that the fda believes did not affect public safety and that plaintiffs experts have not been able to show affected public safety.plaintiffs offer no example of a court in ohio or elsewhere that has concluded that the invocation of negligence per se may fill this evidentiary gap.we doubt such a case exists,and at all events reject this argument as a matter of law.
plaintiffs do not gain any more traction by turning to the sabin case and other cases arising from challenges to the neurovirulence regulations.these decis
