background 
erisa litigation and the settlement agreementa.litigation history 
plaintiffs are the trustees and beneficiaries of employee welfare benefit plans the plans that directly or indirectly contracted with medco to receive pharmacy benefit management services.as a pharmaceutical benefits manager pbm,medco was endowed with discretionary authority to manage certain aspects of the plans for the primary purpose of containing pharmaceutical costs.by way of an indirect contract,insured plans paid set premiums to their insurance companies in exchange for full payment of their beneficiaries prescription drugs,and the insurance companies in turn contracted with medco for plan management services.by contrast,capitated plans paid set premiums directly to medco in exchange for full payment of their beneficiaries drugs.in the case of both the insured and capitated plans,respectively,the insurer or medco bore the risk of higher drug cost in paying each beneficiary claims for prescription medications.plans that were,however,did not pay set premiums to either an insurer or to medco and instead paid the entire cost of the prescription drugs directly to medco as pbm or through a administrator for a fee.accordingly,plans alone carried the direct risk of higher drug cost.
plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that medco breached its fiduciary duties to their plans under erisa in its capacity as pbm by i managing of preferred prescription favor the products of its parent company,merck,merck,over competing drugs ii implementing programs tending to increase the sales of merck drugs,including by interchanging lower cost competing drugs with relatively higher cost merck drugs iii entering into drug purchase contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers,including merck,that included price,rebate,and discount terms that were favorable to medco but more costly to the plans iv engaging in practices prohibited under erisa,including the effective transfer of plan assets to merck through drug purchase agreements with merck negotiated by medco and v generally failing to disclose to the plans that it was not acting in their best interest but in the interests of merck.medco motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint was deferred pending discovery and later withdrawn due to settlement negotiations that culminated in the settlement agreement.
on july,the same day that it preliminarily approved the settlement agreement,the district court preliminarily granted plaintiffs motion for certification of the class,which included all employee welfare benefit plans that contracted with medco,whether they were,insured,or capitated.the named plaintiffs in four of the consolidated class action cases,genia gruer,walter green,mildred bellow,and elizabeth collectively,the individual plaintiffs,are individual plan beneficiaries seeking derivative relief for each of their plans and their members,as well as for all similarly situated plans that contracted directly with medco on a capitated basis or with insurers that contracted with medco.the fifth named plaintiff,marissa janazzo now marissa salsbury janazzo,is a plan trustee purporting to sue on behalf of the county line buick nissan employee welfare benefit plan the county line plan and all similarly situated plan trustees whose plans contracted directly with medco or with administrators or insurers that contracted with medco.harry blumenthal and alan horwitz,the named plaintiffs in a sixth case,are plan trustees suing on behalf of their plan the blumenthal plan and on behalf of all other similarly situated plan trustees whose plans contracted directly with medco 
provisions of the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement defined the class to include all employee welfare benefits plans that had either direct contracts with medco or indirect contracts with medco through insurance companies,administrators,hmos,blue cross blue shield entities,or any other intermediaries collectively,administrators or tpas,where the contracts were in force at any time between december,and the date of the final approval of the settlement and were subject to erisa.under the settlement agreement,medco agreed,among other things,to pay million into a settlement fund to be paid to class members.attorneys fees,not to exceed,together with expenses,also would come from the fund.in exchange,plaintiffs agreed to release all claims of the class insofar as they arose under erisa or were in any way connected to the actions that were the subject of the complaint against medco.plaintiffs further agreed to release those claims against tpas,as well as plan sponsors that contracted with tpas,that were connected to medco alleged conduct.plaintiffs did not,however,release antitrust claims or any contract claims not arising under erisa.
the settlement fund allocates an amount to the settling class members that is based primarily on the amount of each settling plan proportionate share of the total drug spend of all settling plans for the class period.accordingly,each plan proportionate share of the total drug spend varies depending on the nature of the plan relationship with medco.insured or capitated plans,which paid set premiums to an insurance company or medco in exchange for full payment of their members drug prescriptions,receive an allocation that is reduced by to reflect the fact that they were more insulated from the conduct alleged in the complaint.said differently,if a plan pays for prescription drug benefits on an insured or capitated basis,a fixed premium or,sum or if the plan does not participate in any therapeutic interchange program administered by medco,its proportionate share of the total drug spend will be reduced by percent to reflect the fact that the plan could not have been damaged directly by certain of the conduct that plaintiffs allege increase d costs to plans.by contrast,plans that were and assumed the financial risk of paying for their members prescriptions in their entirety receive a proportionate share of the total drug spend without any reduction.
ii.objections to the settlement agreement by the plans 
after the district court preliminarily granted plaintiffs motion for class certification and approval of the settlement agreement,the class notice issued notifying class members of the proposed settlement agreement and informing them that they could opt out of the class.at the ensuing hearing to determine the fairness of the settlement agreement,approximately individual plans exercised their right to opt out of the settlement.in addition,several plans asserted that their interests were not adequately protected by the settling plaintiffs.central states,iron workers,and sweetheart collectively,the plans objected both to the certification of the class and to the terms of the settlement agreement and sought leave to intervene in the class action to represent all of the plans,which they argued should be a certified subclass.the plans first asserted that there was a conflict of interest in the representation of the class and that only a plan or sponsor could adequately represent their interests,because the plans that paid set premiums to medco or insurers to avoid the risk of paying claims would share in the settlement fund notwithstanding the fact that they suffered no damages.following the fairness hearing,the district court rejected these claims and held that 
i n practical reality no such conflict of interest exists.the same legal theory underlies all c lass m embers claims,that medco violated erisa in exercising its discretionary authority to negotiate with drug manufacturers on behalf of its p lan sponsors,and in its control over the formularies and therapeutic drug interchange program.although the negative drug interchange claim directly affected the p lans as opposed to the insured p lans,this is insufficient to find a conflict of interest exists.class c ounsel determined that medco failure to pass through rebates may have increased or failed to reduce the costs of the members of the insured p lans in addition to those of the p lans.accordingly,the reduction applying to the insured p lans was determined to be a reasonable discount of their claims.even where there are some individualized damages issues,common issues may predominate when liability can be determined on a basis.in re visa antitrust,cir.
in re medco health solutions,pharmacy benefits mgmt,mdl clb,wl,at may.
the plans next claimed that the allocation of settlement funds between the plans and the insured or capitated plans was unfair,inadequate,and unreasonable,because the settling plaintiffs did not submit proof as to how,during their negotiations,they calculated the reduction in recovery for p lans.id.at.the district court also rejected this contention and held simply that the reduction balances the equities among and insured plans.id.in upholding the figure,the court deferred to class counsel who negotiated the settlement agreement 
t he allocation is reasonable the insured or capitated fund s were not directly financially damaged by the actions of medco on the negative interchange claim because the plans paid a flat capitation for every person regardless of the type of drug prescribed.through the negotiation process,relying on advice from experts of their own choosing and assistance by the special maser,and in light of the important benefits of the settlement,class counsel determined to discount the allocation of the s ettlement f und to insured p lans relative to the p lans as provided in the settlement agreement.
in addition,the plans claimed that the settlement agreement inadequately described the distribution of the settlement funds.specifically,they contended that the language in the class notice and the settlement agreement providing that the allocation of funds shall be made primarily on the basis of each settling plan proportionate share of the total drug spend of all settling plans did not sufficiently i explain the meaning of primarily ii disclose the bases for determining allocation or iii indicate the total drug spend of the proposed class during the class period.id.at.the plans also contended that there was no basis to determine whether the million settlement amount was reasonable.id.the district court rejected these contentions and concluded that the plan of allocation was reasonable and fair.id.
finally,the plans argued that the class notice and paragraph seventeen of the settlement agreement were unclear as to which claims would be retained by the class members.paragraph seventeen of the settlement agreement provides 
nothing in the release is intended to release or to be construed to release medco from contract claims asserted by parties with which medco has contracted to provide services,including where permitted by applicable state law contract claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,provided,however,that claims not based on contract are released to the extent provided for in the release.nothing in paragraph sixteen is intended to release or to be construed to release tpas from contract claims asserted by parties with which any tpa has contracted to provide services,including where permitted by applicable state law contract claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,provided,however,that claims not based on contract are released as provided for in the release.
in interpreting the agreement,the district court held that the language was unambiguous with respect to which claims would be released and reasoned as follows the amended settlement agreement is clear and it speaks for itself.further,it was admitted by medco during the december,conference that the contract claims are carved out and not released medco agrees with settling counsel that none of the contract claims will be released for any of medco clients and no contract claims are preempted by erisa.id.at.
iii.carefirst motion to intervene in the class action 
subsequently,carefirst,a tpa that provides insurance and administrative services to insured and plans governed by erisa,opposed certification of the settling class and filed a motion to intervene in order to argue that the provisions of the class notice should include the right of a health benefit payor to opt out of the settlement class,and to challenge certification of the class in the event that its were deemed ineffective.carefirst sought to exclude itself from the class action settlement both as the insurer and the tpa of the erisa plans it administered.
as a tpa,carefirst claimed that it is bound by contract and course of dealing to act on behalf of its plan customers to pursue overpayment of benefits and that i nsurers and tpas were specifically carved from the class,yet the plans they insured and administered were included in the class.carefirst thus argued that its claims against medco,some of which are being litigated in another action in new jersey,see group hospitalization med,carefirst blue cross blue shield managed care,no,could be improperly released by the settlement agreement if carefirst were denied an opportunity to opt out the claims of its insured and plans.
the district court denied carefirst motion to intervene,concluding that the right to accept or reject the proposed settlement belonged to the plan fiduciaries and not to tpas such as carefirst.the district court determined that b ecause care f irst is not a member of the c lass,and its rights will not be affected by the approval of the settlement,care f irst lacks standing to object on its own behalf and has failed to demonstrate that it has authority to act for a p lan in opting out.in re medco health solutions,wl,at.with respect to carefirst concerns that its claims in the new jersey action could be released as a result of the settlement agreement,the district court concluded that the agreement did not release any contract or other direct claims that tpas may assert against medco and that,in any event,a tpa was free to demand that its plan opt out of the settlement.id.
the district court thereafter certified the instant action as a class action,pursuant to.a and b,and approved the settlement agreement,concluding that it was within the range of fair,reasonable,and adequate settlement of the claims of the c lass.id.at.the district court also awarded legal fees and disbursements and held that t hose consolidated cases in which the plans have opted out of the settlement are hereby severed.id.
iv.attorneys fees and disbursements to class counsel and linda cahn 
the settling plaintiffs counsel,abbey gardy llp and boies,schiller flexner llp,requested that the district court approve their application for attorneys fees in the amount of million,or of the settlement multiple of their for disbursements in the amount of.from their fee award,plaintiffs counsel agreed to absorb payment of a reasonable fee to lowey dannenberg bemporad selinger and rawlings associates collectively the lowey firm,which had requested a fee award in the amount of multiplier of its lodestar of disbursements in the amount of.the district court determined that counsel requests were reasonable and approved their applications 
t he present fee application for of the s ettlement f und made by abbey gardy and boies,schiller flexner and including the services of the lowey firm is reasonable.it is clear by s ettling plaintiffs submissions that c ounsel expended a substantial amount of time and effort in this litigation.the total combined lodestar for s ettling plaintiffs c ounsel and the lowey firm is,representing almost hours spent litigating this case.settlement negotiations began almost three years ago,and were completed only by the tremendous effort of counsel.
the litigation occurred over a period of six years,and was performed on a purely contingent basis,with c lass c ounsel advancing the many thousands of dollars of necessary disbursements.if,after trial,c lass plaintiffs were unsuccessful,due to the contingent nature of the lawsuit,s ettling plaintiffs c ounsel would have received no compensation.c ontingency risk and quality of representation must be considered in setting a reasonable fee.goldberger integrated,cir.
settling plaintiffs c ounsels request of of the s ettlement f und,applies a multiplier of to the submitted lodestar.this multiplier is reasonable and fair 
the c ourt awards s ettling plaintiffs c ounsel including the lowey firm a fee award of of the s ettlement f und,calculated as million,less the award of legal fees to linda cahn,and disbursements in the amount of for s ettling plaintiffs c ounsel and disbursements for the lowey firm in the amount of.under the class notice,total fees may not exceed.
in addition,linda cahn,attorney for the blumenthal plan,moved for an award of legal fees and disbursements to be paid out of the common fund that resulted from the settlement agreement.cahn sought reimbursement for a lodestar of hours,together with in expenses,as well as an award of of the total attorneys fees awarded to class counsel of record.with respect to cahn application for fees,the district court concluded that,although the settlement agreement had been agreed upon in principle by class counsel and without any input from cahn,her participation was an important part in the finalization of its terms and that her efforts benefitted the class as to support a reasonable legal fee out of the fund in the nature of quantum meruit.id.at.the district court determined,however,that there was no basis to award a percentage fee of the recovery to cahn.she neither created the class action settlement nor did she induce acceptance of it by the defendants.her assistance was limited to fine tuning of provisions and documents after the s ettlement had been agreed to in principle.id.ultimately,the district court awarded cahn attorneys fees and disbursements in the amount of,to be deducted from the award to class counsel in light of the cap on total fees.id.at.
appeals to this court 
carefirst appealed from the district court denial of its motion to intervene in the class action,contending that the court erred in determining that it was not a member of the class and therefore lacked standing to object to,or opt out of,the settlement agreement.all appealed from the same judgment incorporating orders i certifying the instant action as a class action,pursuant to.a and b ii approving the amended settlement agreement iii awarding legal fees and disbursements and iv severing cases in which the erisa plans opted out of the settlement.
on appeal,we did not reach the merits of the case because we concluded that the threshold question of article iii standing of the settling class plaintiffs was insufficiently established.cent.states,at.we determined that the district court had failed to rule on the objections to plaintiffs standing raised by the parties and observed that we do not have the benefit of the district judge views as to whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated the requisite for supporting a finding of constitutional standing.id.at.with respect to the individual plaintiffs,we held that 
s erious questions remain as to whether the individual plaintiffs have demonstrated how medco alleged wrongdoings caused any injury to any individual or entity other than the plans that medco contracted with,and provided prescription benefit coverage to,during the class period.it is especially unclear whether any evidence supports the claim that medco programs and formulary caused the individual opposed to the plans to which they injury either by paying more for prescription drugs or by having to take different prescription drugs,given that plan participants generally pay a flat for a drug regardless of the cost of the drug.seemingly,only plan participants who paid percentage coinsurance would incur injury if medco favored the drugs similarly,the individual plaintiffs appear to have failed to demonstrate i that they incurred an injury resulting from medco failure to pass along formulary rebates to the plans or ii that they have been impacted by defendants allegedly wrongful disclosures or misstatements.
id.at footnote omitted.
with respect to janazzo and the county line plan,we determined that 
the parties also have raised a considerable question regarding whether the fifth settling plaintiff,janazzo,a plan trustee,represents a plan with article iii standing,given that janazzo failed to produce a signed,executed contract between the plan and either medco or a tpa that contracted with medco.moreover,counsel for medco also stated before the district court that it could not find any record of medco sending a bill to county line buick janazzo plan for drugs.medco does not believe that janazzo plan is a client of medco.in the absence of evidence of a contractual relationship with medco,janazzo is precluded from demonstrating any injury resulting from medco alleged wrongdoings.
id.at alterations in original.accordingly,we remanded to the district court to resolve the standing issue in any way it deemed proper and retained jurisdiction pursuant to united states jacobson,cir.cent.states,at.
vi.district court decision on remand 
on remand,the district court permitted the parties to submit additional discovery,including document and deposition discovery,to further develop the record as to the issue of plaintiffs standing.by order dated august,the district court determined that i janazzo,as plan trustee for county line,established that her plan had a contractual relationship with medco and likely suffered an injury as a result of its conduct ii the individual plaintiffs green and bellow suffered and therefore had article iii standing and iii all of the individual plaintiffs had representational and statutory standing under erisa sufficient to satisfy article iii standing.subsequently,plaintiffs,carefirst,and the plans restored jurisdiction to this court,and the parties filed supplemental letter briefs and appendices in accordance with this court previous decision.the district court having issued its opinion on remand,our jurisdiction having been restored,and the standing issue having been fully briefed,we now resume jurisdiction over this case.
article iii standinga.standard of review 
whether a plaintiff has constitutional standing is a question of law that we review de novo.field day,llc county of suffolk,cir citing shain ellison,cir.
janazzo standing 
as a threshold matter,we note that only one of the named plaintiffs is required to establish standing in order to seek relief on behalf of the entire class.see alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions ed.to establish article iii standing in a class action,it is not required that each named plaintiff must have a claim against each named defendant.rather,for every named defendant there must be at least one named plaintiff who can assert a claim directly against that defendant,and at that point standing is satisfied and only then will the inquiry shift to a class action analysis see also comer cisneros,cir.plaintiffs contend that janazzo represents a plan with constitutional standing because the county line plan was involved in a contractual relationship with medco during the class period.they assert that,during the first part of the class period,the county line plan operated as a plan with health plan acting as its administrator,and that,during the later part of the class period,the county line plan was fully insured through health plan.plaintiffs further allege that health plan used medco to manage its pharmaceutical benefits over the entire class period.
based upon the record before us,we are satisfied that janazzo has constitutional standing because the county line plan was medco client during the class period.plaintiffs produced competent proof in support of county line contract with health plan,including a third party administrative service agreement with health plan signed by a county line representative a form letter from health plan apparently produced from county line files advising clients that it would consolidate its pharmaceutical services under medco a letter from health plan to county line consultant,brian lynch,summarizing the plan transfer from to status a group administration agreement signed by a representative of health plan identifying lynch as the agent of record a third party administrative services agreement signed by a representative of health plan and sent to lynch janazzo applications for group insurance coverage on behalf of county line listing health plan as plan supervisor copies of janazzo and her beneficiary father drug prescriptions indicating group prescription coverage through health plan and a subsidiary of medco invoices showing county line payment of premiums to health plan and lynch sworn statement that county line contracted with health plan with respect to its employee benefits,that he regularly dealt with health plan in assisting county line,and that health plan in turn used managed care,medco for its pharmaceutical services for countyline motors.although each of the formal written agreements between county line and health plan appears to be signed by only one party,the evidence,viewed in its totality,demonstrates at least an implied contract between the parties since they agreed,either by words or actions or conduct,to undertake some form of actual contract commitment.cweklinsky mobil chem,cir applying connecticut law as the district court correctly held on remand,these documents still ha ve evidentiary value of both an intent to execute the a greement,and progress toward such execution.
the record also establishes a contract for plan management services between health plan and medco during the time that health plan was involved with the county line plan.significantly,it was medco that produced documents showing that county line employees filled drug prescriptions through its pharmaceutical network,and medco does not dispute that it had a contractual relationship with health plan.indeed,plaintiffs have filed under seal in this court the integrated prescription drug program master agreement between health plan and medco demonstrating that medco was the exclusive provider of prescription drug benefits to health plan at that time.
we reject the plans claim that janazzo must establish specific financial harm before her plan has standing,since it conflates a defense to the merits of the plan claim against medco with the requirement to make a threshold jurisdictional showing.in our view,the foregoing evidence supports the district court determination that janazzo plan was involved in a contractual relationship with medco so as to give her standing.accordingly,we need not reach the issue of standing as it pertains to any of the other named plaintiffs and instead proceed to the merits of this case 
ii.carefirst motion to intervene 
carefirst argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion to intervene and refusing to hear its objections to class certification.with respect to the court denial of its motion to intervene,carefirst contends that it is prevented from acting under contract to pursue overpayment of benefits on behalf of the plans that it administers because tpas were specifically carved from the class,yet the plans they ensured and administered were included.carefirst also claims that the district court denial of its motion has the effect of improperly releasing its claims as an insurer in a parallel new jersey action without compensation and results in prejudice because the settlement agreement distribut es proceeds directly to carefirst insured customers,thus bypassing carefirst.with respect to the district court certification of the class,carefirst contends that i the claims of the class do not raise questions common to all class members ii the claims of the class are not typical of those of the class and iii the class representatives do not adequately represent the interests of the class.
we are not persuaded by carefirst contentions because carefirst lacks the authority to opt out the claims of the plans that it administers or object to the settlement on their behalf.neither the certified class nor the settlement agreement includes tpas such as carefirst.indeed,tpas are expressly excluded from the class,which includes only plans,and only the plans fiduciaries can opt out their plans in accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement tpas are excluded from the definition of the class except that to the extent a given tpa is a plan sponsor with respect to an employee benefit plan,the tpa shall be a member of the class solely in such capacity.as the district court correctly observed,t he fiduciary duty is vested in the plan sponsor or the designated fiduciary named in any particular p lan,and such statutory duty may not be evaded by delegation to an administrator.if anybody rights were violated by medco,it was the rights of the plan not the administrator with whom the plan fiduciaries contracted.see a a providing that a plan fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and ii defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.because carefirst is not a class member,it does not have an affected interest in the class plaintiffs claims against medco so as to be able to assert its objections on behalf of its plans.nonparties to a settlement generally do not have standing to object to a settlement of a class action.alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions ed see also in re drexel burnham lambert group,citing cases,aff,cir.
carefirst argument that it could be prejudiced in a parallel action against medco in new jersey is unavailing for essentially the same reasons.tpas are not members of the class,and as such,no actionable claim held by carefirst in new jersey is released by the terms of the settlement agreement.stated simply,carefirst would possess the same legal rights against medco whether or not the settlement agreement were approved.if carefirst believes that any plan is obligated to opt out,it may exercise its discretion to make such a demand upon that plan.in any event,because carefirst rights against medco would not be impaired by the disposition of this action,its intervention would serve no purpose.accordingly,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying carefirst motion.
iii.challenges to class certification 
standard of review 
turning next to the challenges raised to the certification of the class,this court reviews a district court approval of a class certification under an abuse of discretion standard of review.as this court recently has observed 
we review the district court order granting class certification for abuse of discretion,a deferential standard.see parker time warner entm t,cir.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as the application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon,cir footnotes omitted.

requirements for class certification 
federal rule of civil procedure a sets forth the requirements for a class action 
one or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.said differently,in order to qualify for class certification,plaintiffs in the proposed class must demonstrate that they satisfy four requirements numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.see.a.
the numerosity requirement in rule a does not mandate that joinder of all parties be that the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class make use of the class action appropriate.the commonality requirement is met if plaintiffs grievances share a common question of law or of fact.marisol giuliani,cir per curiam.typicality requires that the claims of the class representatives be typical of those of the class,and is satisfied when each class member claim arises from the same course of events,and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant liability.robinson.commuter,cir.adequacy of representation means that the class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.denney deutsche bank ag,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the foregoing criteria are satisfied,the court must then decide whether questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and whether a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.moore painewebber,cir quoting.b.
the plans and carefirst claim on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in certifying the class because the plans represent a subclass whose interests differ from those of the insured plans.specifically,they contend that all plans should have been represented by independent counsel because they were more damaged by medco conduct by virtue of paying medco the entire cost of their beneficiaries drugs and were more damaged by medco conduct as a result.
in determining whether the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a,a district court must determine whether plaintiff interests are antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class.in re visa antitrust,cir internal citations omitted see also in re drexel burnham,at.with respect to the adequacy of representation in this case,the district court determined that 
the record shows that all members of the class share a common interest in establishing that medco violated erisa.all members similarly wish to obtain the highest possible recovery.
the question is whether the insured or capitated p lans suffered the same injury or any injury at all.as insured funds,they paid the same premiums regardless of which type of drug medco purchased for the account of their plan.it is highly unlikely that the plans incurred any monetary damages as a result of medco activities as alleged by the drug interchange claim,which principally affects the p lans.however,to the extent that medco was keeping rebates and breaching its fiduciary duties under erisa as claimed by the plaintiffs,those claims are equally meritorious and equally viable for the p lans and the insured p lans.for all these reasons,the settlement agreement balances the equities.it provides for the insured p lans claims to be reduced to as compared to the claims of the p lans.that the two different types of p lans might recover different amounts had they brought suit on their own,is insufficient to establish antagonistic interests among class members.this court rejects the argument that rule a has not been satisfied.
in re medco health solutions,wl,at.
while we agree with the district court that the plans advanced similar theories of liability against medco predicated on the same or similar facts,we are persuaded by the challenges to class certification raised by the plans based upon the nature of their relationship with medco.plans differ significantly from insured or capitated plans because only plans assumed the direct risk of absorbing any increases in prescription drug costs that were caused by medco conduct.they argue that since the insured and capitated plans avoided that risk by paying set premiums,those plans were not damaged and should receive no part of the settlement fund.the insured and capitated plans nevertheless claim a substantial share in the fund,contending that if medco had passed through rebates,t he would have directly reduced the costs of the plans,and indirectly reduced through lower insurance premiums over time the costs of the insured or capitated plans.the insured or capitated plans thus claim that medco failure to pass on savings damaged them financially.
in our view,this conflict among the plans does not represent a simple disagreement over potential differences in the computation of damages,since the relationship of the plans to medco and its effect on each plan goes to the very heart of the litigation.while we do not here decide whether the plans in fact suffered greater injury,we think it proper to allow them to raise their claims as part of a separate subclass.the plans dispute any recovery to the insured or capitated plans,yet none of the class representatives is part of an exclusively plan that could adequately advance this position.because the antagonistic interests apparent in the class should be adequately and independently represented,we remand to the district court for certification of a subclass encompassing the plans in order to better protect their claims in this litigation.see amchem prods.windsor,d holding that in a class action including both claimants who already had incurred an injury and claimants who merely had been exposed to asbestos,adequacy was not established because the interests of those within the single class are not aligned as for the currently injured,the critical goal is generous immediate payments,but for the plaintiffs,there is an interest in ensuring an ample,fund for the future broussard meineke disc.muffler shops,cir holding that class certification was improper because plaintiffs simply can not advance a single collective breach of contract action on the basis of multiple different contracts when there are manifest conflicts of interest in their claimed recovery in re general motors.truck fuel tank pr
