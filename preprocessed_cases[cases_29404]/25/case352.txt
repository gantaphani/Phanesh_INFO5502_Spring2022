matthew miller died at the age of thirteen,one week after beginning to take sertraline,an antidepressant drug marketed as zoloft.his parents sued pfizer,the manufacturer of zoloft,for wrongful death,claiming that zoloft caused matthew to commit suicide.
the millers hired david healy,who proposed to testify that zoloft may cause suicide and had in fact caused matthew to commit suicide.applying standards outlined in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,and its progeny for determining whether expert testimony is admissible under federal rule of evidence,the district court ruled that healy could not testify.this left the millers with no expert to provide evidence of causation.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment to pfizer.
the millers appeal.their principal claim is that the court did not give them a fair opportunity to make a proper record supporting healy conclusions.at the outset of discovery the millers had requested the court to appoint independent experts to evaluate the opinions of the parties retained experts.the district court did so only after completion of discovery.the experts ultimately advised the court that healy analysis was unscientific.the millers now argue that the district court improperly deprived healy of the opportunity to respond to concerns expressed by the independent experts.if the district court had indeed deprived healy of that opportunity,the millers might prevail on a claim of abuse of discretion.our review of the record,however,establishes that the district court acted with patience and fairness.most,if not all,of the concerns expressed by the independent experts had previously been expressed by pfizer or the district court.the millers have failed to identify any concern to which they lacked an adequate opportunity to respond.we exercise jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
douglas geenens diagnosed matthew miller with depression and prescribed zoloft on july.matthew hanged himself one week later.the millers filed a wrongful death action against pfizer in the united states district court for the district of kansas on july,basing federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship,see.their expert witness on causation has been david healy,a neuropsychopharmacologist.
zoloft belongs to a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris.healy asserts that ssris cause akathisia,a syndrome involving motor restlessness,which in turn causes some patients to commit suicide.in forming his opinion healy relied on various articles and studies involving zoloft and other ssris.of these studies,he placed the most emphasis on his own study,two reports in which subjects were given the drug,then not given it,and then given it again,and a study conducted by ian hindmarch although he ultimately decided not to rely on the hindmarch study.he also relied on depositions from this case testimony,depositions,and exhibits from other cases pfizer documents an application of what are known as koch postulates which are employed to evaluate causality and a he performed using pfizer data.
shortly after bringing suit,the millers submitted a preliminary report prepared by healy.anticipating that healy views might be challenged by pfizer,the millers,in an effort to obtain validation of healy opinions from an outside source,filed a motion to appoint independent experts on october.
the court first scheduling order,entered november,required the millers to provide pfizer with their rule expert disclosures no later than december.the scheduling order also set a deadline of february,for the millers to provide rule disclosures pertaining to rebuttal experts.on january,pfizer filed a motion to limit revision,amendment or supplementation of expert opinions disclosed pursuant to rule a.the district court sustained this motion in part on january.it ruled that the millers could serve a supplemental final expert report on or before march,and final rebuttal expert disclosures by march.dist,doc.
on march,healy was deposed for ten hours.during the following two weeks the millers provided pfizer with supplemental responses to pfizer requests for admission.the responses contained an explanation of a statistical analysis performed by healy.objecting to the responses as untimely,pfizer filed on april,an emergency motion to bar plaintiffs expert,healy,from supplementing his opinions and to strike and deem admitted plaintiffs second supplemental responses to first requests for admissions.dist,doc.the district court denied this motion on april,after observing that t he newly disclosed information does not appear to substantially depart from information which has been previously disclosed.dist,doc.at.but it reserved its final ruling on the issue until it considered the parties dispositive motions and stated that it may well strike healy information because of the late hour at which it has been produced.id.at.
also on april,pfizer filed a motion to exclude healy testimony under daubert.proceedings were delayed,however,when pfizer attorney was seriously injured in an accident on june.the district court continued the trial date from july to september.then,on august,the district court issued an order staying all proceedings and directing the parties to show cause why independent expert witnesses should not be appointed.ultimately,on april,the court entered an order appointing two independent experts,john concato,and john davis,
in its order appointing the experts,the district court identified the fundamental question on which it wanted advice whether healy methodology,and his application of it in this case,constitute valid,scientifically reliable reasoning in support of his opinions that zoloft causes suicide general causation and that zoloft caused matthew miller suicide specific causation.at.the order declared that the parties had been afforded full opportunity to adduce evidence in support of their respective positions.id.it then stated that the independent experts would be provided a copy of the parties previously filed briefs pertaining to the motion to exclude healy testimony a copy of all exhibits cited or referred to in those briefs a copy of pfizer july report to the irish medicines board the letter of january from the irish medicines board to pfizer regarding the report and healy declaration of august,which addresses the concerns which the court articulated in its order to show cause.id.at.the materials provided to the independent experts included various expressions of healy opinions as they had evolved during the course of the litigation reports dated september and december,a letter report dated march,deposition testimony on march,responses filed in april to pfizer requests for admission and declarations dated may and august.the district court also encouraged the experts to examine whatever medical or scientific literature is necessary to render their professional opinions.at.
the independent experts submitted a report on september,that generally discredits healy theory and methodology.in response,the millers filed a consolidated statement of facts on october.id.at.the court described it as a brief contain ing separately numbered statements,of which are presented for the first time in this document.dist.order.at.the district court granted pfizer motion to strike the statement on the grounds that it was not associated with any pending motion or constituted an improper attempt by the millers to supplement their briefing,did not comply with procedural rules,and was untimely.
on november,the district court held a hearing on the motion to exclude healy testimony as inadmissible under daubert.the court allowed healy to engage in a dialogue with the independent experts but,apparently relying on federal rule of civil procedure,restricted the information on which his responses to their questions could be based to those materials that had previously been supplied to the independent experts.see tr.of daubert hr g.at.the court explained 
u nder our federal rules which govern pretrial proceedings there a time set as part of the discovery process where each expert is required to produce a written report that states all of the opinions that the expert will offer at the trial,and also the basis for the opinions.that has to be done by a certain time prior to trial 
t o the extent that healy had information and could have made calculations by that deadline,he was required to do that 
id.in so limiting healy,the court characterized his testimony as a moving target and declared that the time for his expert opinions to be formulated and expressed and communicated to the other side is passed.id.at.the millers complain in particular that this ruling precluded healy from presenting at the hearing some slides that they contend would have addressed the concerns of the experts.
following the daubert hearing the district court,largely adopting the views expressed by the independent experts,excluded healy testimony.the district court considered four factors identified by the supreme court in daubert as relevant to the determination of whether a proffered expert proposed testimony reflects scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact to resolve a fact in issue whether the scientific theory or technique can and has been tested,whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication,the known or potential rate of error of the technique,and whether the methodology has attained general acceptance in the scientific community.daubert,at.the district court concluded that with the exception of the first the theory can and has been tested which the court assumed to be satisfied the daubert factors favored the exclusion of healy testimony.miller pfizer,d.because of the thoroughness of the district court published opinion,our summary of its ruling is brief.
in analyzing the factor,the court concluded that although healy had published articles expressing the theory that zoloft causes suicide,his specific calculations of the risk of suicide had not been subjected to peer review.id.at.with regard to the factor,the court noted several problems with healy study that were identified by the independent experts the study did not include a placebo control,it involved extensive interaction between the participants and researchers,and it utilized only a small sample size.id.at.the court accordingly concluded that the study did not include controls sufficient to demonstrate that zoloft causes suicide in some patients.id.at.
addressing the fourth daubert factor,the court found that healy had not utilized a generally accepted methodology in forming his opinions.again referring to flaws in the design of the study,the court determined that reliance on the study did not constitute a generally accepted methodology for assessing any causal relationship between zoloft and suicide.id.at.the court also decided that placing substantial emphasis on a few studies and case reports is not a generally accepted methodology.id.because the experts could not confirm the calculations healy made through his of pfizer data,the court likewise ruled that his use of the was not a generally accepted methodology.id.at.finally,the court decided that healy purported application of koch postulates was not a generally accepted methodology.the court concluded that healy misapplied,failed to satisfy,or failed to address six of the seven postulates and t o compound this problem,he has invented other factors and variously applied or misapplied them in ways which make it impossible to discern what his conclusions would be if they rested only on generally accepted methodology.id.at.
the district court decided to exclude healy testimony on general causation whether zoloft can cause suicide.it described his theory as being a distinctly minority position resting on only a handful of case reports,and it characterized the flaws in healy methodology as glaring,overwhelming and unexplained.id.at.
the district court also excluded healy testimony on the issue of specific causation whether zoloft caused matthew miller to commit suicide.healy had proposed to testify that in his opinion,based on a review of notes by matthew,reports by matthew father,and the deposition of matthew psychiatrist,zoloft more likely than not caused matthew to commit suicide and no other factor in his background or psychosocial situation could explain his suicide.id.at.concerned,however,about healy reliance on evidence from interested parties,to the exclusion of reliable evidence that matthew engaged in suicidal thoughts and behavior before he first used zoloft,the court had asked its independent experts whether selective reliance was consistent with generally accepted methodology on the issue.id.at.the independent experts informed the court that such selective reliance was not a generally accepted methodology.the court then concluded that healy testimony on specific causation does not satisfy rule because it does not utilize sufficient facts and data and it is not the product of reliable principles and methods.id.at.in addition,the court noted that since it had sustained pfizer motion to exclude the testimony on general causation,the issue of specific causation is for all practical purposes moot.id.
concluding that the millers could not establish causation,the district court granted summary judgment to pfizer.
ii.discussion 
on appeal the millers contend that the district court abused its discretion in restricting the information made available to the independent experts,exceeded the bounds of a proper daubert analysis when it excluded healy testimony,and erred in granting summary judgment to pfizer.
information provided to the independent experts 
the millers assert that they attempted to complete the scientific record for the independent experts by filing a consolidated statement of facts and by having healy address the independent experts concerns in part by presenting at the daubert hearing various slides depicting graphs and calculations,but were denied that opportunity when the district court ruled that only certain information could be provided to the experts.aplt.br.at.according to the millers,freezing healy opinions for nearly two years and refusing to allow him to address concerns raised by daubert motions filed,and independent experts appointed,after he had submitted his report,requiring their expert to answer questions in his report that had not yet been asked constitutes an abuse of discretion.aplt.reply br.at.in their view,the district court erred in applying federal rule of civil procedure so as to require healy to anticipate all issues that might be raised during the course of the proceedings.they conclude that pfizer did not win this case in the court below on the science.they won it by a clever application of a rule gotcha.they won it by persuading the district court that the rules of civil procedure somehow require an expert like healy to be prophetic.aplt.br.at.
under federal rule of civil procedure a,a party shall disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present expert testimony,and the disclosure must be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness,contain ing a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor.a.supplemental disclosures are permitted,and indeed may be required.e.such supplements are to be disclosed by the time pretrial disclosures are due under rule a.see.e.failure to make proper disclosures may require exclusion of the expert as a witness.c.a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a or e is not,unless such failure is harmless,permitted to use as evidence at a trial,at a hearing,or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.
we agree with the millers that an expert initial rule report can not always anticipate every possible challenge to the report.accordingly,on occasion it may be appropriate to permit the party using the expert to submit supplements to the report in response to assertions by opposing experts that there are gaps in the expert chain of reasoning.a court failure to permit such supplementation could even constitute an abuse of discretion in some circumstances.see dodge cotter,cir district courts may abuse their discretion when dec
