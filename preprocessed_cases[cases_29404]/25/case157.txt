omnicare,a pharmacy,and various of its subsidiaries,including pompton nursing home suppliers pompton,were charged by thomas quinn with submitting false claims in violation of the false claims act fca,et quinn bases his allegations on the fact that medicaid pays for medications that the defendant pharmacies dispense to medicaid beneficiaries but,if a medication is subsequently returned to a defendant pharmacy for resale,the pharmacy credits medicaid with only of what medicaid had paid the pharmacy for the medication.we find that the lack of legal authority,requiring pharmacies to credit medicaid when a medication is returned for resale,is disturbing.we conclude,however,that there can be no fca liability in the absence of such authority.in addition,quinn failure to present evidence of the actual submission of a single false claim to medicaid is fatal to this qui tam action.
factual background 
pompton is a pharmacy that provides medications to individuals residing in care facilities.care facilities,which include nursing homes,provide care to patients who participate in medical insurance programs,including medicaid.approximately sixty percent of the medications that pompton dispenses are paid for by new jersey medicaid the remainder are paid for by the patients themselves or by private insurers.after a pharmacy has supplied a medication to a medicaid patient,the pharmacy submits a claim to medicaid.medicaid then pays the pharmacy for the medication.instructions for filing medicaid claims are set forth in new jersey medicaid pharmacy services fiscal agent billing supplement fabs.fabs instructs provider pharmacies to submit medicaid pharmacy claims on the form.the claim form contains a provider certification which the provider must sign 
i certify that the services covered by this claim were personally rendered by me or under my direct supervision and that the services covered by this claim and the amount charged thereof are in accordance with the regulations of the new jersey health services program and that no part of the net amount payable under this claim has been paid and that payment of such amount will be accepted as payment in full without additional charge to the patient or to others on his behalf i understand that any false claims,statements or documents,or concealment of a material fact,may be prosecuted under applicable federal or state law,or both.
on some occasions,the medications,for which pompton has submitted a claim and received full reimbursement from medicaid,are returned new jersey pharmacy regulations allow medicaid provider pharmacies to recycle returned unit dose packaged medications if they have been stored properly and the seal and control number remain intact.see when pompton receives returned medications for recycling,it is pompton practice to send medicaid a check for of the cost of the returned medications pompton justifies retaining the other to cover the expense of restocking and redispensing the medications.
the qui tam plaintiff,thomas quinn,was pompton regional comptroller.quinn alleges that it was pompton practice,when medications were returned,to push out the individual tablets and capsules from their sealed packages and place them in separate containers for subsequent use.quinn claims that he observed workers in the return department removing pills from their original sealed containers by pushing them through their packaging and that he saw the workers create new packages for the pills by the packages with irons.quinn asserts that pompton eventually redispensed the returned medications.
after quinn learned that another recently acquired omnicare subsidiary in illinois had settled fca claims because it had represented to medicaid that medications were destroyed when they in fact had been returned and redispensed,he became concerned about pompton medicaid recycling and crediting practices.he expressed his concern to alan traster,the president of pompton,who told quinn that pompton was not required to credit new jersey medicaid for returned medications.quinn memorialized his concerns in a memo to traster.quinn was dismissed by pompton a few days later on august.
ii.procedural history 
quinn filed a complaint under seal against pompton in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.quinn brought the action under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act,et under new jersey conscientious employee protection act cepa,and under new jersey common law.quinn claimed that pompton violated a,and of the fca because it failed to submit adjustments in order to partially void claims submitted on required claim forms where the medications supplied pursuant to those claims were ultimately returned,sold medicaid the same medication twice,submitted medicaid claims for pharmaceuticals that were removed from unit dose packaging in the recycling process,in violation of new jersey board of pharmacy regulations,and returned credits to medicaid for less than of the amount initially claimed for returned medications.united states ex rel.quinn omnicare,drd,slip op.at filed march.quinn claimed that his dismissal violated the provisions of the fca and cepa.quinn also brought a claim for unjust enrichment.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to pompton on quinn fca claims and his unjust enrichment claim.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over quinn cepa claim and dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
quinn appeals the adverse disposition of his fca claims

iv.discussion 
a.the submission of the initial medicaid claim 
the fca imposes liability on any person who 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government 
a.a person acts knowingly when he has actual knowledge of the information acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information,and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.b.
each time pompton submits a claim for payment on the form,it certifies that the services covered by this claim were rendered and the services covered by this claim and the amount charged thereof are in accordance with medicaid regulations quinn alleges that pompton initial claims are false due to its failure to adjust them when medications are returned for recycling.
there are several regulatory provisions which do require the voiding or adjustment of claims under certain circumstances.section of the new jersey administrative code requires a djustments following payment of claims when a claim is incorrectly paid and the provider receives an overpayment or underpayment or when a claim is paid in error.situations that may cause underpayment or overpayment include a payment by a private insurance company after medicaid has paid for the medication,a billing error,or a computer error in processing the claim.a claim is paid in error when it is paid and it should not have been paid.see b.in addition,j requires p harmacies to initiate claim reversal for those services in which a claim was generated and adjudicated to payment and the service was not subsequently provided to a beneficiary.
fabs instructs the pharmacy to fill out an adjustment request form when a claim is underpaid,overpaid,or paid in error.in the case of a claim that is paid in error,the pharmacy voids the entire claim and medicaid deducts the voided amount from the next payment.the provider indicates on the adjustment request form the reason for the adjustment or void.one of the reasons listed is service not provided.none of these regulations,however,instruct pharmacies on how to credit or adjust a claim for medications after those medications have been returned for recycling.
nevertheless,quinn contends that pompton violates a and of the fca by failing to void or adjust claims for medications after these medications have been returned for redispensing.quinn argues that the initial claims become false when medications have been returned because the claims then become claims for services that were not provided to the intended beneficiaries.quinn asserts that,after the return of the medications,unless pompton reverses the claims as required by,the certification on the initial form is a false one.
the district court rejected quinn argument because there is no language in the form,its instructions,or medicaid regulations that states that medications can not be returned.quinn,slip op.at.the court noted that,even though j requires reversal when services are not provided,the regulation does not further state that services are not provided when medications are dispensed and subsequently returned.id.at.
we agree that there is no regulatory requirement of the reversal of a claim once a medication has been returned.as the district court held,if there is no requirement to adjust the claim,there is no liability for a failure to do so.
however,even more fundamentally,quinn allegation is that the initial claim is rendered false by the return.the fallacy of this argument lies in the fact that the return of a medication,which at the outset has been dispensed to the medicaid beneficiary,does not render the initial claim false or fraudulent.in order to prove fca liability under a and,quinn must prove that the defendant presented or caused to be presented to an agent of the united states a claim for payment the claim was false or fraudulent and the defendant knew the claim was false or fraudulent.hutchins wilentz,goldman spitzer,cir.there is no question that the forms pompton submits to medicaid are claims under the fca the only question is whether a claim,which is not false or fraudulent when initially submitted,can later be rendered so if the medication is returned.
there is fca liability when a provider knowingly asks the government to pay amounts it does not owe.united states ex rel.clausen lab.of america,cir.the fca reaches all fraudulent attempts to cause the government to pay out sums of money.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.the terms false and fraudulent are not defined in the fca.the terms,however,do have independent meanings 
a common definition of fraud is an intentional misrepresentation,concealment,or nondisclosure for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or to surrender a legal right.false can mean not true,deceitful,or tending to mislead.the juxtaposition of the word false with the word fraudulent,plus the meanings of the words comprising the phrase false claim,suggest an improper claim is aimed at extracting money the government otherwise would not have paid.
mikes straus,cir citations omitted.
under these standards,it is clear that,when pompton submits the initial claim form,it is not intentionally making any misrepresentation.to the contrary,it is merely asking for reimbursement for medication which it has dispensed and for which it is entitled to payment.when pompton submits the initial claim for payment,it has no way of knowing if a medication will be returned.pompton has not then knowingly presented a false or fraudulent claim at the time of the original claim submission.nor can the changed circumstances,caused by the later return of the medication,render the initial claim false or fraudulent.
quinn contends,however,that,in order to impose fca liability,it is not necessary that the claim have been false when it was originally submitted.we reject this argument.the fca aims to impose liability for a broad range of conduct,including each and every claim submitted which was originally obtained by means of false statements or other corrupt or fraudulent conduct.at,reprinted in,emphasis added.pompton claims were not originally did not misrepresent the dispensing of the medication or the cost of what was dispensed.
we conclude that we would be exceeding the intent of congress in defining false claims if we were to permit the transforming of a valid claim into a false claim by the occurrence of a subsequent fortuitous event which is not itself the basis of any required adjustment.
for the above reasons,we hold that pompton is not liable under the fca for the submission of the initial medicaid claims or for the failure to adjust an initial claim when a medication is returned.
b.the successive claim for a recycled medication 
in quinn second allegation,he contends that,when a returned medication is resold,pompton is making a claim for an amount that has,at least in part,already been paid.the form requires pompton to certify that no part of the net amount payable under this claim has been paid.quinn asserts that pompton submits a false claim to medicaid when pompton sells a medication to a medicaid patient for the second time.quinn alleges that by only partially crediting medicaid for a returned medication and then submitting a new claim for the full cost of the same medication,pompton violates a and of the fca because pompton has claimed more than the actual cost of the medication and has falsely represented on the second claim form that there has been no previous payment for the medication.
the district court rejected this argument.the court refused to find fca liability under quinn theory that pompton must have resold returned medications to medicaid by virtue of the large volume of medicaid business it conducts.quinn,slip op.at.the court,relying on clausen,to support the theory that the actual submission of a false claim must be proved,noted that quinn did not point to a single instance when the same medication was in fact the subject of two claims the district court held that,without evidence of the actual submission of a false claim,there was no genuine issue of material fact.
quinn argues that there is a material question of fact whether pompton submitted duplicate medicaid claims for the same medication,given that pompton recycles returned medications and approximately of pompton sales are to medicaid.pompton responds that,at the summary judgment stage,quinn has the burden to establish,in at least one instance,that a given pharmaceutical had been paid for by medicaid,returned to the pharmacy,and then redispensed and rebilled to medicaid.we agree and conclude that quinn has not met this burden.
in clausen,the court held that a false claims act plaintiff can not merely describe a private scheme in detail but then allege simply and without any stated reason for his belief that claims requesting illegal payments must have submitted,were likely submitted or should have been submitted to the government.at.clausen alleged that the defendant medical testing company was overbilling the government by performing unauthorized,unnecessary,and excessive testing.the court affirmed the dismissal of clausen claim because he never provided a single false claim was actually submitted.id.at.
similarly,in united states ex rel.alfatooni kitsap physicians service,the ninth circuit court of appeals held that the plaintiff failure to present an actual false claim submitted to the government was fatal to the action.cir.alfatooni,relying on the volume of bills submitted to the government each year,made the same argument quinn makes false claims must have been submitted.the court held that an fca plaintiff must come to court with a claim in hand and generalized,speculative suppositions will not suffice.id.at.the court contrasted united states krizek,in which the court presumed that the defendants would be liable under the false claims act for submitting psychiatric bills that totaled more than twenty four hours for a given day.alfatooni,at citing krizek,at.the court in alfatooni noted that in krizek,t he government had the claims in hand,id.citing krizek,at,even though it could not prove exactly which of the claims in hand actually was fraudulent.
the same reasoning applies here.pompton admits that approximately percent of its business is medicaid and that it accepts returned medications for recycling.however,as alfatooni failed to do,quinn also did not come forward with a single claim that pompton actually submitted to medicaid which covered a medication for which pompton had previously submitted a claim.discovery was complete at the time pompton moved for summary judgment,and quinn did not ask the district court for extended discovery pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f.quinn failed to link pompton recycling and crediting practices to the actual submission of a false claim.without proof of an actual claim,there is no issue of material fact to be decided by a jury.quinn theory that the claims must have been submitted can not survive a motion for summary judgment.
furthermore,we agree with the district court that,even assuming that pompton is submitting successive claims for the same medications,there can be no fca liability because new jersey regulations entitle pompton to recycle and redispense returned medications.section a of the new jersey administrative code,entitled disposal of unused medications,allows unused unit dose packaged medication,that has been stored in a medication room or secure area in the institution with the seal and control number intact to be recycled and redispensed.the regulation does not,however,require pharmacies to credit medicaid for the recycled and redispensed medications.because pompton can legally recycle returned medications,the initial sale and the subsequent sale of a returned medication are properly viewed as separate transactions.as the district court held,these transactions are not duplicative in any sense that would make them inconsistent with the representation on the.quinn,slip op.at.under this separate transaction theory,pompton does not make a false representation on the second claim form even though it does not state that medicaid has already paid,at least in part,for a redispensed medication.
in so concluding,we recognize that the second claim would be submitted to medicaid for payment for the same medication.when pompton submits the second claim,it knows that the medication,which is the subject of that claim,was already dispensed once and returned.pompton also knows that medicaid has already paid of the cost of the medication.however,because new jersey regulations allow pompton to recycle returned medications and because no regulation requires pompton and other medicaid pharmacies to credit medicaid for the returns,we conclude that we can not impose fca liability based on the submission of the second claim.
c.the recycling of repackaged medications 
the form requires pompton to certify that the services covered by this claim and the amount charged thereof are in accordance with medicaid regulations quinn argues that pompton violated a and of the new jersey administrative code when it submitted claims to medicaid because the certification on the claim constituted an implied false certification that the returned medication was recycled in accordance with regulations.
the certification theory of fca liability is based on a false representation of compliance with a contract term,statute,or payment is conditioned on compliance with that requirement.see,united states ex rel.siewick jamieson sci eng g,we have not yet adopted this theory of fca liability.however,other courts of appeals have.the second circuit noted in mikes that it was joining the fourth,fifth,ninth,and district of columbia circuits in ruling that a claim under the act is legally false only where a party certifies compliance with a statute or regulation as a condition to governmental payment.at citations omitted.
in mikes,the court limited the applicability of the implied false certification theory to cases where the underlying statute or regulation upon which the plaintiff relies expressly states the provider must comply in order to be paid.at.the court limited fca liability,premised on a legally false certification,to those situations where a party certifies compliance with an underlying statute or regulation as a condition of payment because the fca aims to impose liability only where a certification of compliance influences the government decision to pay.id.at noting that the fca does not encompass those instances of regulatory noncompliance that are irrelevant to the government disbursement decisions under this approach,when an underlying regulation expressly prohibits payment upon with its terms,the submission of a claim implicitly certifies compliance with that regulation.
district courts in the third circuit,including the court in this case,have cited mikes in support of the concept of false certification liability.see in re genesis health ventures,united states ex rel.cooper gentiva health,wl,united states ex rel.watson connecticut gen l life ins,wl,at.
in support of imposing liability under this theory,quinn relies on a of the new jersey administrative code,board of pharmacy regulations,which provides if a unit dose packaged medication has been stored in a medication room or secure area in the institution and the medication seal and control number are intact,the medication may be recycled and redispensed.medicaid regulations require pharmacies to comply with board of pharmacy regulations in order to participate in the medicaid program.see d expressly incorporating the requirements of.
the district court held that failure to comply with the board of pharmacy regulations may disqualify a provider from participation in the program,but compliance with the regulations is not a condition to payment by medicaid.quinn,slip op.at.quinn contends,however,that a finding of fca liability,based on implied false certification theory,should not be limited to situations where the underlying regulation or statute expressly states that compliance is a condition of payment.quinn argues that there should be fca liability when with the underlying regulations would disqualify the provider from participation and that there should be fca liability here because the improper recycling of medications would disqualify pompton from participation in the medicaid program 
here,the form requires providers to certify that the pharmaceutical services comply with medicaid regulations.the medicaid regulations expressly incorporate compliance with the board of pharmacy regulations,including,as a condition to participation in the program.if a provider does not comply with the medicaid regulations,by reason of not complying with the incorporated board of pharmacy regulations,not only will the provider be ineligible to participate in the medicaid program,but medicaid may seek to recover the money it paid to the provider for services covered by the claims.see c.
quinn arguments are compelling.even though does not expressly condition payment on compliance with its terms,it hardly can be said that with its terms is irrelevant to the government disbursement decisions.mikes,at.however,even if pompton does not qualify for medicaid reimbursement if it dispenses an improperly recycled medication to a medicaid patient,we can not say that,in this case,pompton has made any false certifications in connection with a medicaid claim.the reason we come to this conclusion is because of the impossibility of proving from the numbers alone that a claim was made by pompton to medicaid for an improperly recycled medication.
if of the medications that pompton dispensed were paid for by medicaid,then a fortiori,any claim for an improperly recycled medication would be paid for by medicaid.if that claim was made on form,it would be inevitable that pompton had violated a and,and medicaid would be paying pompton on the basis of a false certification.such a situation would be similar to the one in krizek,where we know that a false claim had to have been made when or more hours were being charged to medicaid for a hour day.
in the present case,however,quinn can not demonstrate either that an improperly recycled medication was paid for by medicaid or that it was paid for by one of the other sources of payment for the medications that pompton dispensed.although we might hypothesize that of the improperly recycled medications were paid for by medicaid,it is impossible to rule out the chance that they were paid for by sources for this reason,we agree with the district court that even assuming that the certified compliance with board of pharmacy regulations as a condition of payment,plaintiff has not pointed to sales inconsistent with the certification.quinn,slip op.at.as with our discussion on successive claims,quinn did not provide the district court with a single instance where pompton submitted a claim for payment for medications recycled in violation of for that reason,quinn false certification claim fails.
d.the failure to give medicaid credit for returned medications 
the reverse false claim provision of the fca imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government.a.to make a prima facie case of liability under a,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant did not pay back to the government money or property that it was obligated to return.the district court held that pompton was not liable under the reverse false claim provision because it found that pompton is under no legal obligation to credit medicaid for returned medications.a prerequisite for liability under this theory is a legal obligation to credit medicaid for returned medications.the district court noted that there is no federal or new jersey medicaid statute or regulation which specifically requires that pompton do so,at.
quinn asserts that pompton failure to give credit to medicaid violated a of the fca.quinn argues that j of the new jersey administrative code imposes a legal obligation on pompton to credit medicaid for returned pharmaceuticals.that section provides 
where allowable by law,the facility shall generate a crediting mechanism for medications dispensed in a drug distribution system,or other system that allows for the of medications.the crediting system shall be monitored by the provider pharmacist and a facility representative.
pompton maintains that j does not impose an obligation to credit medicaid because pompton is not a facility.quinn responds that j does require pompton to credit medicaid for returned medications because the definition of facility includes pharmacies.quinn argues that this section requires pompton to credit medicaid because credit means full credit,and i f something less than full credit was acceptable to the state,then the regulation would have said so.
as the district court noted,i t is debatable whether j even governs the conduct of medicaid pharmacies.section j is a regulation promulgated by the department of health and senior services,not medicaid.the regulation appears under chapter,which is titled standards for licensure of care facilities.this alone suggests that nursing homes,as opposed to pharmacies,are required to create a crediting mechanism.
the term facility is defined as a facility or distinct part of a facility licensed by the new jersey state department of health and senior services as a care facility.pompton is not a facility within this definition because it is not licensed as a care facility.furthermore,it does not make sense for pompton,a pharmacy,to be considered a facility within the regulation definition when,if it were considered a facility,it would,in addition,have to maintain a pharmacy.see id.facilities shall have a consultant pharmacist and either a provider pharmacist,or if the facility has an pharmacy,a director of pharmaceutical services.
although pompton is not a facility,the second sentence of the regulation requires pompton,because it is a provider pharmacist,to monitor the facility crediting system.see id.j.therefore,pompton,acting as a care facility mandatory pharmacy provider,does have an obligation under this regulation to observe,watch,or check the crediting mechanism put in place by the care facility.see id.this obligation to monitor,however,does not expressly include an obligation to credit medicaid for returned medications.
quinn cites two passages in the new jersey register in support of his argument that pompton has an obligation to credit medicaid for returned medications.the first passage states 
the department anticipates significant cost savings will accrue as a result of j the rule discontinues the current requirement to destroy all unused medications t he product is returnable and can be dispensed again by the retail pharmacy.although no statewide dollar impact is available,literally thousands of dollars of medications are destroyed by many facilities monthly.both private pay consumers and the state medicaid program will benefit from this proposed rule.
monday,may.the other passage states 
the economic impact of this amendment should result in savings to residents and families and third party payors such as medicaid.these savings will occur as a result of drugs which will be returned to the pharmacy for credit.drugs which have been returned to the pharmacy will be credited to that resident the overall savings to residents,families and medicaid may exceed.
a monday,october.these two passages do lend support for quinn argument that state officials expected j to result in savings for medicaid as a result of crediting.it nevertheless is not clear who has an obligation to credit and how much credit is required to be given.
even if the regulation imposed upon pompton an obligation to credit medicaid,as the district court noted,it does not impose upon them a requirement that they credit medicaid any specific amount for returned medications.quinn,slip op.at.quinn argues that credit means.we conclude,however,that,in light of the absence of a clear obligation to credit medicaid and the absence of any medicaid or other regulation requiring provider pharmacies to credit at a specific rate,we can not impose fca liability on pompton 
quinn also argues that pompton,by deducting to cover the costs of recycling,violates.this medicaid regulation provides a provider shall not pay nor require payment of an administrative charge or service fee for services for which reimbursement is included as part of the medicaid fee.the district court rejected quinn argument,noting that it assumes that such a restocking fee pays for a service for which reimbursement is included in other medicaid payments id.
quinn argues that the capitation payment medicaid pays to pompton for medications dispensed to medicaid beneficiaries is understood to include the costs associated with returns,titled prescription dispensing fee capitation provides,in relevant part 
a the new jersey medicaid and nj kidcare programs capitate the dispensing fee for each prescription for beneficiaries in nursing facilities additional dispensing fees per prescription shall be given to pharmacy providers who provide the following levels of services 
hour unit dose service pharmacies dispensing medication in a dispensing system in which a supply of unit dose oral medication is delivered for each beneficiary daily,shall be reimbursed the cost of all reimbursable medication plus a fee of per beneficiary day.
