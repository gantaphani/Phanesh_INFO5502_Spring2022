factual and procedural background 
minimed is the world largest manufacturer of insulin infusion pumps.minimed united states pump therapy market share is approximately.according to minimed,between the years to,users of insulin pumps increased from about to about nationwide.minimed pumps have a list price of,and a patient may expect to expend over per year for the complementary disposable items associated with the pump.
iis conducted business as an insulin pump distributor and related supplies to for at least two of minimed competitors.in the fall of,iis informally became a distributor of minimed pumps.in july,the two parties entered into a formal written distribution agreement the agreement,which provided that california law would govern,granting iis a right to sell and distribute minimed products.the agreement also bestowed upon iis the ability to purchase the pumps from minimed at the highest available discount,up to,depending on iis overall purchase volumes.additionally,iis agreed to promote minimed and its products and maintain adequate facilities and personnel to do so,as well as provide training to pump purchasers and pay all costs to deliver products to end users.iis also agreed,with one exception,to market minimed products exclusively and that it would not directly or indirectly manufacture,distribute or market products which compete directly or indirectly with products manufactured by minimed.the agreement did not grant iis an exclusive distributorship and minimed was expressly allowed both to sell its products in the territories served by iis,and to utilize other distributors.the agreement contained an annual renewal clause,which allowed either party to decline renewal of the agreement,with or without cause,on thirty days written notice prior to the end of the current calendar year 
the parties operated under the agreement from july,until december,during which time iis received a discount off of the list price on minimed pumps.on november,minimed sent iis written notice that it was not going to renew the agreement for the calendar year,and the agreement terminated on december.minimed indicated to iis that it was willing to continue selling pumps to iis at the full list price.on january,iis purchased a single minimed pump at the full list price of which was shipped from california to louisiana.iis submitted unrebutted evidence that between january,and february,minimed sold,across state lines,other distributors the same type of pump for.iis also submitted an invoice which showed that one of these distributors was a company named secure care,which the district court assumed was secure care medical,an entity named by iis as a minimed distributor in the south.
iis initiated an action in november,in which it claimed that minimed breached the agreement by both wrongfully passing iis confidential and proprietary information to minimed salespersons and by making intentional and material misrepresentations to iis customers in order to divert sales from iis to minimed.iis also complained that minimed acquired iis two main distribution competitors and unfairly manipulated the wholesale prices at which it sold its products to iis,in order to hinder iis ability to compete with minimed or distributors iis sought damages pursuant to minimed alleged price discrimination,unfair trade practices,breach of contract and implied obligation of good faith,trade secrets violations,defamation,and detrimental reliance.on march,minimed timely removed the case and filed a cross motion for summary judgment to dismiss all of iis claims,which the district court granted.
iis now appeals and argues that the district court erred in dismissing iis price discrimination claims by finding that there were no disputed facts regarding whether iis engaged in actual competition with any favored resellers of minimed dismissing iis lutpa claim excluding iis expert evidence regarding the damages it suffered as a result of minimed conduct dismissing iis breach of contract and implied duty of good faith,defamation and fair dealing claims denying iis e motion for reconsideration of its order granting minimed summary judgment dismissing of all of iis claims and dismissing iis price discrimination claims by finding that iis failed to present evidence of actual injury.

ii.price discrimination act,a a clayton act 
in order to recover damages for a claim under a of the act rpa a clayton act claim,a plaintiff must prove four facts one,sales made in interstate commerce two,the commodities sold to iis were of the same grade and quality as those sold to other purchasers three,minimed discriminated in price between iis and other purchasers and four,that the discrimination had a prohibited effect on competition.lycon juenke,cir,cert.denied,d.rpa a includes two basic types of injury,primary line and secondary line.eximco,trane,cir,reh g granted in part,amended in part on other grounds,cir.injury,which iis claims to have incurred,results from price discrimination between favored and disfavored buyers.texaco,hasbrouck,d.
the district court held that while iis met its burden on elements one and two,it failed to show element three,that minimed discriminated in price between iis and other purchasers,and dismissed iis claim at that point.the district court did not reach element four.
under element three a plaintiff must first prove that as the disfavored purchaser,it was engaged in actual competition with the favored purchaser s as of the time of the price differential and that this competitive nexus requirement is satisfied when there is a showing of competitive contact between the recipients of the price differential.best brands beverage,falstaff brewing,cir.in other words it must therefore be shown that as of the time the price differential was imposed,the favored and disfavored purchasers competed at the same functional level,all wholesalers or all retailers,and within the same geographic market.id.at.this court has explained that competition is determined by careful analysis of each party customers.only if they are each directly after the same dollar are they competing.texas foundries,cir.
in concluding that iis failed to satisfy element three,the district court noted that iis claim that it was one of minimed top three distributors in the united states and that it was competing nationwide with minimed other distributors,even if true,does not necessarily indicate that the markets of these distributors overlapped.the district court found that iis did not specifically demonstrate any evidence showing that it directly competed with any of minimed other distributors for the same dollar nationwide.the district court noted that while iis did proffer some evidence that prior to the alleged price discrimination it competed with at least one reseller,secure care medical,in the south,and that an entity named national diabetes pharmacy distributed minimed products in virginia,it had not specifically pointed to any evidence that at the time of the alleged price discrimination that it was competing with these entities or any other entity in a particular market.
iis asserts that the evidence it before and after january,it competed with other minimed distributors for sufficient to meet its competitive nexus burden and preclude the district court granting of minimed motion to dismiss for iis failure to meet element three of its a rpa claim.iis also asserts that the district court acknowledged that it submitted evidence that iis competed with at least one other reseller,secure care medical,in the south.furthermore,iis submitted evidence that another entity,national diabetes pharmacy,distributed minimed pumps iis territory of virginia.
after reviewing the facts on the record and their application to the law,we hold that the district court was correct in its conclusion in regards to element three.the competitive nexus is established if the disfavored purchaser and favored purchaser compete at the same functional level and within the same geographic market at the time of the price discrimination.best brands,at.iis has established that both secure care medical and national diabetes pharmacy compete at the same functional level as iis,they are all retail sellers of minimed pumps.additionally,iis established,at least in respect to national diabetes pharmacy,a minimed distributor in virginia,that it operated in the same geographic market because virginia was one of iis contractual territories.iis,however,has not submitted evidence that either secure care medical or national diabetes pharmacy qualified as favored purchasers at the time of the alleged price discrimination,when the agreement with minimed was no longer in effect.see,at.thus,iis has not shown actual competition with a favored purchaser at the time of the alleged price discrimination and has failed to meet its burden on this element.
iii.price discrimination,louisiana price discrimination act.
the district court also dismissed iis price discrimination claim under the lpds.for the same reasons it dismissed the rpa claim,because iis failed to show actual competition with a favored purchaser at the time of the alleged price discrimination,and thus failed to meet its burden.the district court also noted that the language of the statute clearly indicated that the louisiana legislature intended to address discriminatory pricing in the state and iis failed to show any favored distributors it competed with in louisiana.
iis federalism argument in which it contends that even if its federal rpa claim is dismissed it is still entitled to a state claim under the lpds.is incorrect.iis bases this argument on its assertion that the district court dismissed iis claim under lpds simply because it found that iis federal antitrust claim under the rpa failed.
this is not a correct understanding of the district court reasoning for dismissing iis lpds claim.the district court clearly stated that it analyzed iis claim under lpds,and whether iis established the elements for such claim.the district court found that the louisiana legislature intended the statute to address discriminatory pricing in the state and iis failed to set forth specific evidence that minimed had charged iis a different price than it charged any other pump distributor in louisiana,at the time of the alleged price discrimination.therefore,the district court held that iis claim failed.our review of the record finds no evidence of iis competing with any other pump distributor in louisiana at the time of the alleged price discrimination,and therefore the district court was correct in dismissing iis price discrimination claim under the lpds.
iv.louisiana unfair trade practices act,
the district court found that because minimed validly effectuated the of the agreement pursuant to the clause,evidence submitted by iis relating to damages from of the agreement would be excluded.the district court also held that minimed was not liable for damages under the lutpa,which precludes entitlement to damages for of an agreement as well as price discounts,and therefore any such evidence presented by iis for damages under the lutpa was irrelevant and must be excluded.turner purina mills,cir.the district court therefore dismissed iis lutpa claim.
iis argues that it submitted sufficient evidence in the form of minimed memoranda showing that minimed violated the lutpa.these memoranda allegedly contain statements made by minimed showing it intended to do harm to iis in violation of the lutpa the district court held that turner precluded damages pursuant to a lutpa claim when the damages were tied to either a of an agreement or price discounts,as was the case here.see at 
iis argues that its case is distinguishable from turner and is more analogous with chemical,exxon,cir,and notes that this court distinguished purina because unlike the claimant in that case,in exxon,the jury found that exxon had breached its contract in bad faith,there was sufficient evidence of fraud,misrepresentation,or deception,and there were internal memoranda prepared before the contracts was terminated.id.at.
this court in exxon,however,stated that exxon differed from turner in that the latter dealt with a suit between a dealer and a supplier,and part of the decision in that case rested on its analysis of the relationship between the two.id.at.exxon,in contrast,dealt with a supplier the plaintiff customer exxon relationship and outlined conduct allegedly perpetrated by exxon that iis does not allege of minimed in this case.id.such conduct by exxon included conspiring with the plaintiff supplier to eliminate the plaintiff,refusing in bad faith to pay plaintiff invoices,and unlawfully seizing the plaintiff equipment.id.this court in exxon did not indicate that any part of turner had been invalidated.because iis case significantly resembles turner more than it does exxon,the district court holding that there were no actionable lutpa claims was correct.
iis damage report and remaining claims 
once the district court found that iis had failed to establish the required elements for any of its antitrust claims,and dismissed those claims,it held that the february,damage report submitted by iis became defective as support for its remaining claims because the report failed to segregate between minimed allegedly wrongful antitrust and conduct,and the specific damages that flowed from each the district court then granted iis leave to file an amended damage report which listed only those damages caused by the conduct.iis submitted an amended damage report dated may.the district court reviewed the amended report and granted minimed motion to strike the report because it held that iis simply repackaged its original report,which claimed its damages flowed from minimed antitrust conduct,to assert that essentially the same damages now flowed from the remaining claims upon striking the amended damage report the district court also granted minimed summary judgment motion to dismiss iis remaining claims.
the district court was correct to strike the amended report because it did not properly reflect the true amount of estimated damages which flowed from the remaining claims,making the report seriously flawed and inadmissible.city of vernon cal.edison,cir,cert.denied,d affirming summary judgment for defendant because of,inter alia,plaintiff failure to properly prove damages where plaintiff did not attempt to or offer to correct the only possibly admissible damages study.
furthermore,iis argument that the disaggregation rule is only required in antitrust cases,and thus became once its antitrust claims were dismissed,is incorrect this court has not limited the concept of disaggregation merely to antitrust actions.see,perrone general motors acceptance,cir actual damages for violation of the truth in lending act requires direct causal relationship between the amount of damages and injury or harm national papaya domain industries,cir in a breach of warranty claim the p
