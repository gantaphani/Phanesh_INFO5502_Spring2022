background 
taxol paclitaxel is a natural compound found in the bark of the pacific yew tree taxus brevifolia.over the last several decades,taxol has received considerable attention in the scientific and medical communities as an drug.bd.of,dist.lexis,at.in the early,scientists discovered that taxol is not only an effective chemotherapeutic agent,but that it also enhances the effectiveness of radiation therapy for killing cancer cells,especially hypoxic cancer cells that are ordinarily resistant to radiation.a paper published by researchers at columbia university disclosed the dual activities of taxol as a simultaneously cytotoxic and radiosensitizing agent.see roy tishler et,taxol a novel radiation sensor,int l radiation oncology biology physics.the structural formula of taxol is shown below.
the patent,filed in the names of chunlin tao,neil desai,patrick,and paul sandford,and assigned to vivorx pharmaceuticals,claims three compounds.those compounds are analogs of taxotere docetaxel a compound that differs from taxol in two respects.first,taxotere has a oh group in place of taxol,also abbreviated as oac group.second,taxotere has a cooc,abbreviated as group attached to its nitrogen atom,in place of taxol benzoyl group.the structural formula of taxotere is shown below.
the following history sets forth the events that led to the filing of the patent application.
at the time these events began to unfold,professor robert holton had been conducting a research group at fsu working with taxols.chunlin tao,a chemist,joined that group as a research assistant in july.bd.of,dist.lexis,at.tao worked on two projects in the holton group.first,he was part of a team of researchers who in december completed the total synthesis of taxol.id.he was also part of a team that made taxol analogs using a process beginning with baccatin iii,a natural product found in the needles of a european yew variety taxus baccata.as shown below,baccatin iii has a hydroxy group in place of taxol side chain,but is otherwise identical to taxol.
the process requires relatively few steps,and it appears that that process was at that time the standard method for making taxol and its analogs 
while he was at fsu,tao apparently also developed a close relationship with a visiting faculty member,yang.id.at.yang is a radiation biologist who arrived at fsu in march as a courtesy professor.id.at.yang had in the past developed several compounds having increased radiosensitivity for applications,and his research focused on increasing the radiosensitivity of hypoxic cells.id.at.several months after arriving at fsu,yang visited holton and proposed a collaborative project to develop chemotherapeutic radiosensitizing taxanes crts.id.holton agreed,and he assigned one of his research assistants,hossein nadizadeh,the responsibility of synthesizing taxol analogs that holton and yang believed would prove to be effective crts.holton and yang focused particularly on the attachment of nitro electron affinic groups,which were known to be radiosensitizing,in an attempt to increase taxol radiosensitivity.id.at.even before yang arrival,however,members of the holton group had already synthesized a number of,and some of those were also given to yang for testing.the structural formula of one such compound,referred to as pnip,is shown below.
one should note that pnip has the group of the taxols.pnip showed potential in yang earliest tests in january,and yang testified that he had told tao at around that time that pnip was the most effective radiosensitizer among the compounds that he tested.id.at.
there is no evidence that tao ever synthesized pnip himself.however,the method for making pnip was apparently the subject of numerous discussions within the holton group during tao tenure at fsu because,prior to tao joining the holton group in,nadizadeh had developed a secret method for making a compound used to attach a side chain to baccatin iii to make pnip.id.at.nadizadeh method differed from a published prior art method of making in two respects in the ordering of its four steps,and in the use of acid hydrolysis rather than base hydrolysis in one of those steps.id.at 
in,patrick,a transplant surgeon,was the ceo of vivorx pharmaceuticals,as abi was then known,and of vivorx,vivorx,a related company focused on diabetes research.id.at.in,became the ceo of abi.id.at.neil desai is an organic chemist,and was vivorx senior research scientist in.that year,and desai filed a patent application directed to a method of encapsulating taxol analogs for direct delivery to tumors.they subsequently attended the second nci workshop on taxol and taxus,a conference at which they heard presentations regarding the effectiveness of taxol analogs,the use of taxol as a radiosensitizer,the use of nitro groups to enhance radiosensitization,and the use of the taxol side chain position as a point for attachment of functional groups to the taxol structure.among the speakers at the conference was holton,who spoke about the synthesis of taxol.has said that he was probably present during holton presentation.id.at.after the conference,apparently based on what they had learned there and from the existing scientific literature regarding taxol and radiosensitization,and desai discussed the possibility of creating radiosensitizers that they believed would be more potent than taxol by using taxotere instead of taxol as a core structure.id.at.
in,directed desai to begin creating analogs of taxotere.shortly thereafter,desai attended a conference in india,where he learned of a source of,a compound similar to baccatin iii,but having the group of taxotere rather than the group of baccatin iii and taxol.id.at.
at around the same time,tao was finishing his research at fsu,and and desai interviewed him for a job at vivorx.during his interview,tao presented details of his taxol analog research.id.at.looking to expand their work in cancer research,and apparently realizing that tao could help them to finally pursue the ideas that they had discussed after the conference,and desai hired tao to work on the taxotere project.id.
upon tao arrival at vivorx in december,desai discussed the published literature on radiosensitizers with tao,and assigned to him the task of creating chemotherapeutic radiosensitizing taxotere analogs with modified side chains,using the supplied by his indian contact.id.at.desai was responsible for making the final decisions as to which compounds to pursue.id.after tao had made several compounds,desai and forwarded information concerning those compounds to abi patent attorney,stephen reiter.id.at.
reiter then filed a patent application naming tao,desai,and paul sandford as inventors.he initially filed thirteen claims,including six to a method of making a compound,six to compounds,and one to a method of using the compounds as both cytotoxic agents and radiosensitizers.id.at.following a restriction requirement,reiter cancelled the method of use claim.the pto then rejected the remaining claims over the prior art.reiter accordingly cancelled all of the pending claims,replacing them with narrower compound claims.id.at.after the pto rejected the new claims as obvious over two patents,reiter successfully traversed the rejection on the ground that those patents did not disclose or suggest analogs lacking taxol group,and the patent accordingly issued in july with four claims.id.at.
claim,the sole independent claim of the patent,reads as follows 
a dual functional compound having both cytotoxic properties and radiosensitizing properties,wherein said compound is selected from the group consisting of 
itrophenyl deacetyltaxol 
itrophenyl isopropoxycarbonyl deacetyltaxol 
itrophenyl isobutoxycarbonyl deacetyltaxol.
dependent claims separately claim the three compounds set forth in claim markush group,shown below as compounds,and,respectively 
the three claimed compounds all have the group of taxotere,as well as a group.the first compound additionally has the n group of taxotere.the second and third compounds have isopropoxycarbonyl cooch,abbreviated as and isobutoxycarbonyl,abbreviated as groups,respectively,in place of the group of the first compound.
in september,fsu sued tao in the united states district court for the northern district of florida,alleging that he had misappropriated trade secrets and used them to apply for a patent in his own name.arguing that florida was an improper forum,abi and tao then sued fsu in the central district of california,alleging infringement of the patent,seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief,and seeking a declaration of inventorship.fsu voluntarily dismissed its claims and successfully moved to transfer the california action to the northern district of florida.fsu filed an answer and counterclaims for breach of contract,malicious interference with an advantageous business relationship,statutory theft of trade secrets,unjust enrichment,constructive fraud,and misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the florida uniform trade secrets act,as well as a count entitled cause of action for declaratory judgment of the invalidity of the vivorx pharmaceuticals patent,which alleged that the patent is invalid under,and.abi and tao dismissed all of their claims,apparently on the basis of representations from fsu that it was not making,using,or selling the claimed compounds.because only fsu counterclaims then remained,the district court realigned the parties,designating fsu as plaintiff and abi and tao as defendants.later,all but the last of fsu counterclaims involving invalidity were dismissed or settled.additionally,during a pretrial conference,fsu withdrew its claim that the patent is invalid,seeking instead to add holton,yang,and nadizadeh to the patent as inventors and to remove,desai,and sandford.fsu also sought a declaratory judgment that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
following a bench trial,the district court found,inter alia,that and desai had not seen any literature that discussed the use of a taxol analog as a chemotherapeutic radiosensitizing agent prior to november when tao interviewed at abi,and no one at vivorx had ever attempted to synthesize a taxane with such dual functional properties,id.at tao had used confidential information that he learned at fsu,namely nadizadeh secret method,in synthesizing the three specific compounds that are claimed in the patent,id.at tao had used his knowledge and experience from fsu in selecting the isopropoxycarbonyl and isobutoxycarbonyl functional groups,also on the basis of fsu proprietary information,the patent specification disclosed the general concept,developed by yang,of attaching electron affinic substituents to a taxane to impart radiosensitizing properties,id.at and b ecause and baccatin iii are essentially interchangeable starting materials,nadizadeh and holton obviously knew that could be used to create fsu pnip and they knew how to reduce that knowledge to practice,id.at.
the court then concluded that,desai,and sandford did not contribute to the inventions claimed in the patent,id.at and that,because holton had determined which taxol analogs were likely to possess the dual properties of a crt,and because tao had learned the concept and the specifics of a crt from yang and had used nadizadeh method to synthesize the patented compounds,clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that holton,yang,and nadizadeh contributed to the invention of the patented compounds made by tao,id.at,and hence were coinventors.the court also found that and desai could be charged with knowledge of holton,yang,and nadizadeh contributions to the invention,and that they had accordingly engaged in inequitable conduct by not telling reiter of tao former employment at fsu.id.at.it concluded that the patent was therefore unenforceable.id.at.
abi now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
inventorship 
the patent statute,provides for district court jurisdiction over inventorship disputes.that statute provides that 
the error of omitting inventors or naming persons who are not inventors shall not invalidate the patent in which such error occurred if it can be corrected as provided in this section.the court before which such matter is called in question may order correction of the patent on notice and hearing of all parties concerned and the director shall issue a certificate accordingly.
this appeal involves such an inventorship dispute.
inventorship is a question of law that we review de novo.ethicon,surgical.we review the district court underlying findings of fact for clear error.id.because the issuance of a patent creates a presumption that the named inventors are the true and only inventors,the burden of showing misjoinder or nonjoinder of inventors is a heavy one and must be proved by clear and convincing evidence,hess advanced cardiovascular,citing garrett united states,uspq.
conception is the touchstone of inventorship,and each joint inventor must generally contribute to the conception of the invention.ethicon,at,at quoting burroughs wellcome barr.conception is the formation in the mind of the inventor,of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention,as it is hereafter to be applied in practice.hybritech,monoclonal antibodies,uspq,quoting robinson on patents.an idea is sufficiently definite and permanent when only ordinary skill would be necessary to reduce the invention to practice,without extensive research or experimentation.ethicon,at,at quoting burroughs wellcome,at,at.one does not qualify as a joint inventor merely by assisting the actual inventor.see id.one who simply provides the inventor with principles or explains the state of the art without ever having a firm and definite idea of the claimed combination as a whole does not qualify as a joint inventor.
on appeal,abi argues that the district court erred in changing the names of the inventors on the patent and concluding that the patent is unenforceable as a result of inequitable conduct.according to abi,the only pertinent question concerning inventorship is whether fsu personnel contributed to the invention of the three specific compounds claimed in the patent,and they did not.in abi view,the court did not limit its inventorship analysis to the granted claims and the evidence is wholly lacking in support of the court decision.abi argues that it would be nonsensical to list as inventors persons who contributed only to,abandoned claims,and that that is nonetheless what the district court did in this case.according to abi,the district court failed to recognize that the patent as issued does not claim methods of making any compounds,and improperly based its decision on evidence regarding the method for making the compounds.abi contends that there are other viable methods for making the claimed compounds.abi also accuses fsu of engaging in discovery abuses,springing evidence regarding the on abi at the last minute,preventing abi from rebutting that evidence,and refusing to produce critical notebook pages relating to that evidence on the ground that they included trade secrets.
according to abi,the court also incorrectly dismissed the distinction between and iii as insignificant.abi points out that the pto specifically determined that abi use of rather than baccatin iii was and justified patentability,but the district court concluded that holton,yang,and nadizadeh should have been listed as inventors simply because they made seemingly similar compounds.abi points out that it is undisputed in the record that all of fsu taxol analogs had a group,whereas the claimed compounds have a group that tao never made an analog having a group while he was at fsu that no one at fsu ever made or even suggested making any of the compounds claimed in the patent and that the patentable idea to make nitro compounds came from and desai.
fsu counters that the district court factual findings were correct and based on clear and convincing evidence that supports the district court holding.according to fsu,the sum total of tao knowledge and experience with taxol and taxanes was gained at fsu in holton laboratory,and tao work at abi was simply a continuation of scientific investigations begun by the holton group at fsu.fsu asserts that the one difference between fsu pnip and the first claimed compound in the patent is only that tao used,a starting material that he learned of at fsu,to make the claimed compound at abi.fsu further contends that the use of that starting material can not differentiate abi claimed compounds from fsu compounds,because fsu itself used and baccatin iii interchangeably,depending on which was commercially available at a given time.fsu argues that abi decision to use was,likewise,simply based on the availability of that compound in.
it should not matter,according to fsu,that no one at fsu made the compounds claimed in abi patent,because there is no requirement in the patent law that a coinventor of a chemical compound prove actual reduction to practice.according to fsu,a contribution qualifying a person as an inventor may be based on either a contribution to conception or a contribution to the reduction to practice of the invention,and an inventive contribution to the method of making a claimed compound is also a contribution to the conception of the compound.fsu alleges that,before abi hired tao,no one at abi knew how to synthesize taxane analogs or how to increase radiosensitization.according to fsu,abi actively recruited tao because of his association with fsu groundbreaking research team.fsu further asserts that hired tao and encouraged him to continue the very work he had performed at fsu,even if that meant using confidential information he learned at fsu,including nadizadeh method and yang discovery of pnip radiosensitizing activity.although the claims are directed to compounds,according to fsu,their preambles require radiosensitizing and cytotoxic activities,and tao learned about radiotherapy,radiation biology,and radiosensitization from yang at fsu.thus,fsu asserts,although abi succeeded in obtaining a patent,it was the knowledge that was imparted to tao while he was at fsu that led to the selection of the compounds claimed in that patent,and the district court properly held that nadizadeh and yang are coinventors of the compounds claimed in the patent,whereas and desai are not.
we agree with abi,first,that the district court erred in concluding that and desai are not coinventors of the three compounds claimed in the patent.the burden was on fsu to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that and desai were misjoined as inventors.contrary to the district court conclusions and fsu assertions,the record indicates that it was the vivorx scientists who had the idea of making compounds having both a group and a nitro group.because there is no evidence of record that the idea of making taxol analogs having both a group,taxoteres and a nitro functional group came from anyone other than and desai,we conclude that fsu did not meet its burden.
tao also contributed to the conception of the claimed invention.the record reflects that tao introduced the idea of incorporating,isobutoxycarbonyl,and isopropoxycarbonyl groups,and chose the attachment point for the nitro group.the district court correctly retained tao as a coinventor and that issue is not before us.
sandford was the fourth inventor named on the patent.according to the district court,sandford testified that he did not contribute to the inventions claimed in the patent,even though he was named as a.bd.of,dist.lexis,at.the district court therefore dropped him as an inventor and abi does not appeal that conclusion.
having concluded that the district court erred in determining that and desai were not inventors,the remaining question is whether the district court erred in determining that the fsu scientists were true inventors of the claimed compounds.invention requires conception,and conception does not occur unless one has a mental picture of the structure of the chemical or whatever characteristics sufficiently distinguish it.it is not sufficient to define it solely by its principal biological property amgen chugai pharmaceutical.moreover,general knowledge regarding the anticipated biological properties of groups of complex chemical compounds is insufficient to confer inventorship status with respect to specifically claimed compounds.id.abi has argued that neither yang nor anyone in the holton group ever actually made any of the compounds claimed in the patent.while we agree with fsu that the law does not usually require actual reduction to practice to establish conception of a chemical compound,id.holding that when an inventor is unable to envision the detailed constitution of a gene so as to distinguish it from other materials,as well as a method for obtaining it,conception has not been achieved until reduction to practice has occurred,until after the gene has been isolated,invention does require conception,and there is no evidence that fsu inventors conceived any of the claimed compounds.having in mind specific portions of a claimed compound is not the same as conceiving the compound with all of its components.one must have a conception of the specific compounds being claimed,with all of their component substituents,and the record does not support a finding that holton or any of his conceived the three claimed compounds,all of which lack taxol group.
the grant of the patent itself supports the conclusion that the claimed taxotere compounds,all of which have a group,a side chain having a group,and either an group,an group,or an group,were novel and nonobvious over the prior art,and hence not the invention of the fsu scientists.although pnip made at fsu also contained the and groups,it did not include the group of the claimed compounds.
the district court found that baccatin iii and were used interchangeably as starting materials in holton group at fsu,depending on availability.regardless which starting material was used,however,the record reflects that all of fsu product analogs had a group.there is no evidence that any analogs that were made having a group were contemplated as ends in themselves,rather than simply as intermediates in the preparation of analogs starting with.the fact that all of fsu analogs include a group shows that,to the extent that fsu used as a starting material at all,holton and his acetylated the group to make a group in an intermediate step during the synthesis of those analogs thus,the fact that may have been used at fsu is not probative of inventorship of the compounds claimed in the patent.
much of fsu appeal brief is devoted to extolling holton scientific accomplishments,the implication being that he must be an inventor of the three claimed compounds.fsu strongest arguments for holton being a coinventor of the three claimed compounds are that t he sum total of tao knowledge and experience with taxol and taxanes was gained in the laboratories of fsu as a member of the holton research team tao work at abi was simply a continuation of scientific investigations begun by the holton group at fsu and the first compound listed in claim of the patent includes the exact same side chain from the pnip compound created by holton and nadizadeh at fsu.the district court additionally found that holton would identify the analogs or compounds that he wanted his research assistants to attempt to synthesize,bd.of,dist.lexis,at,and that,w hile at fsu and in collaboration with holton,tao created taxol analogs with isopropoxycarbonyl and isobutoxycarbonyl attached at the n position of the side chain,id.at.
fsu arguments and the district court findings together fall short of meeting the clear and convincing evidence standard required for finding that holton was a coinventor of the three specific compounds claimed in the patent.while holton may ha
