because birbragher moves to dismiss the drug conspiracy charge on the ground that the csa is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the allegations in the indictment,we consider the facts as alleged in the indictment.see united states mazurie,d it is well established that vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve first amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.see also united states farm home sav.ass n,cir providing that,in considering a motion to dismiss an indictment,we accept the government allegations as true,without reference to allegations outside the indicting document citing boyce motor lines,united states.
between approximately january and may,birbragher and marshall kanner were the principal owners and operators of pharmacom international corporation pharmacom,a company that used the internet to distribute prescription drugs,including schedule iii and iv controlled substances,for which a valid prescription is required pharmacom conducted these transactions through a website,and other affiliated websites.internet users logged onto one of these websites and placed orders for prescription drugs.indictment.the individuals completed a short health history questionnaire and provided credit card payment information.pharmacom did not verify the customers identities or require them to submit any medical records during this process.
doctors,who had contracted with pharmacom,reviewed the prescription drug orders.id.among the doctors pharmacom hired were armando angulo,employed from july to february,and peter lopez,employed from october to april.angulo was a florida resident licensed to practice medicine in florida.lopez was not licensed to practice medicine anywhere in the united states.the doctors approved the orders without an examination,and,generally,without reviewing any medical records.occasionally,the doctors emailed or called a customer on the telephone.if the doctor approve d a drug order,pharmacom digitally affixed the doctor electronic signature to a prescription created by its computers.id.
pharmacom contracted with pharmacies to fill the approved prescription orders.id.they were batched and downloaded from pharmacom website by the pharmacies,who then filled and shipped them to customers throughout the united states.for example,union family pharmacy union family of dubuque,iowa,filled prescriptions for pharmacom from august,through september.jack huzl,a licensed pharmacist in iowa and colorado,owned and operated union family.huzl hired douglas bouchey,a pharmacist licensed in iowa and michigan,to fill pharmacom prescriptions.union family filled at least prescriptions for pharmacom and distributed at least schedule iii and schedule iv dosage units.union family shipped the vast majority of these prescriptions to customers outside iowa,even though union family was only registered as a pharmacy in iowa.
collectively,pharmacom doctors and pharmacies authorized and filled more than prescriptions for controlled substances,totaling over million schedule iii dosage units and more than million schedule iv dosage units.pharmacom customers paid in excess of million for these prescriptions.pharmacom used the proceeds of this unlawful activity to pay contracting doctors approximately million for authorizing prescriptions.pharmacom paid approximately million to the pharmacies for filling the orders.the funds deposited into the bank accounts of the doctors and the pharmacies allowed them to continue operating as critical members of the drug conspiracy.pharmacom also paid approximately million to acquire the schedule iii and iv controlled substances million for shipping costs million for marketing costs,including internet advertising and million to its employees to help operate its business.these financial transactions totaled approximately million.
birbragher,along with kanner,huzl,bouchey,angulo,and lopez collectively codefendants,and others acting at their behest,shifted drug proceeds to shell corporations that they had created to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership and control of the proceeds.the shell corporations were almost all florida corporations,with the exception of one corporation registered in the virgin islands.pharmacom also sent money to various bank accounts or trust accounts controlled by or for the benefit of birbragher relatives or kanner relatives.birbragher,his codefendants,and others working at their behest,conducted at least transactions involving or more in drug proceeds 
on november,birbragher and his codefendants were charged in a indictment birbragher was charged in count i,a drug conspiracy with multiple objects,and count ii,a multiple object conspiracy to launder money from the drug conspiracy alleged in count

indictment.
bouchey and kanner moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the csa was unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.birbragher and lopez joined the motions the district court denied the motions to dismiss as to all of the defendants,concluding that the vagueness doctrine did not apply.specifically,as to birbragher and kanner,the court observed that they were nonregistrants under the csa courts have considered and rejected void for vagueness challenges to the application of the csa to nonregistrants,nonregistrants have been charged and convicted under the csa for conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment,and neither had offered precedent to the contrary or any reason to depart from that precedent.
birbragher entered into a plea agreement which contained an appeal waiver provision.on august,birbragher entered a conditional plea of to the first two objects of the count i drug conspiracy and the third object of the count ii money laundering conspiracy.the district court conducted birbragher sentencing hearing on december.based on his offense,the court determined that birbragher advisory guidelines range was to months.the court then granted the government downward departure motion due to birbragher substantial assistance.see united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense,the court may depart from the guidelines.the government recommended a percent reduction however,the court reduced birbragher advisory guidelines range by approximately percent,resulting in a final advisory guidelines range of to months.the court sentenced birbragher to months imprisonment to be followed by a term of supervised release.the court also entered a preliminary forfeiture order in the net amount of.see infra note.birbragher brings this appeal.
birbragher asserts that the csa is unconstitutionally vague in violation of his fifth amendment right to due process of law as applied to his ownership and operation of pharmacom from march through may.we review de novo whether a penal statute,like the csa,is void for vagueness under the fifth amendment.united states orchard,cir.
the fifth amendment guarantees every citizen the right to due process.stemming from this guarantee is the concept that vague statutes are void.united states washam,cir citing connally constr.the vagueness doctrine recognizes that a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.id.quoting connally,at.in other words,v oid for vagueness simply means that criminal responsibility should not attach where one could not reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct is proscribed.id.quoting united states dairy prods,d see also grayned city of rockford,d l aws must give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly.vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.to defeat birbragher vagueness challenge,the csa must pass a test the statute must first provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct,and second,not lend itself to arbitrary enforcement.united states barraza,cir quotation omitted.
first,we consider whether the csa provided birbragher with adequate notice that the statute prohibited his ownership and operation of pharmacom.birbragher asserts that he lacked the requisite notice for two reasons when reading the csa in,it was unclear that the manner in which pharmacom dispensed schedule iii and iv controlled substances was prohibited,and the fact that congress passed the ryan haight online pharmacy consumer protection act of the online pharmacy act e,on october,effective on april,establishes that,prior to the online pharmacy act passage,it was unclear whether the csa criminalized birbragher ownership and operation of pharmacom.
here,individuals purchased schedule iii and iv drugs through pharmacom.see.the csa provides it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to distribute a controlled substance.the csa further criminalizes a conspiracy to violate.id.it is also unlawful to conspire to launder the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,which includes illegal distribution of controlled substances.
the csa contains several exceptions to broad prohibition on the distribution of controlled substances.the exception relevant here empowers the attorney general to implement a registration process to authorize medical professionals,known as registrants,to dispense controlled substances such that every physician and pharmacy that distributes or dispenses any controlled substances must obtain a registration issued by the attorney general.a b.thus,the responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances falls not only on the prescribing physician but also upon the pharmacist who fills the prescription.a,a.a controlled substance may be prescribed only for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.id.a.there are no statutory definitions of legitimate medical purpose or usual course of professional practice.however,case law provides that t he term professional practice refers to generally accepted medical practice.united states vamos,cir citing united states norris,cir.
section a provides except as authorized by this subchapter,it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense a controlled substance.a.in united states moore,d,the supreme court held that,despite registration,physicians can be prosecuted under when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice because only the lawful acts of registrants are exempted.id.at.with respect to the evidence supporting the physician conviction for distributing methadone in violation of,the court determined 
the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to find that respondent conduct exceeded the bounds of professional practice.h e gave inadequate physical examinations or none at all.he ignored the results of the tests he did make.he did not give methadone at the clinic and took no precautions against its misuse and diversion.he did not regulate the dosage at all,prescribing as much and as frequently as the patient demanded.he did not charge for medical services rendered,but graduated his fee according to the number of tablets desired.in practical effect,he acted as a pusher not as a physician.
id.at footnote omitted.
in addition to its holding concerning physicians,the moore court observed,by its terms,reaches any person.id.at see also united states johnson,cir t he basic proscription in section applies to any person.it follows that applies to nonregistrants.the sixth circuit expressly addressed this issue in johnson.there,the defendant,who was not a licensed physician,oversaw the administration of a medical center where prescriptions for controlled substances were illegally dispensed and was convicted of counts of distribution of controlled substances and counts of aiding and abetting.at citing,a.on appeal,he contended that,as a nonphysician,he could not be lawfully convicted under section for issuing bogus prescriptions.id.at.the sixth circuit observed,
we are not persuaded by this argument.essentially,the defendant is contending that he does not fit within the category of physicians which,under moore,were excluded from the exception for practitioners registered under section.proceeding from this assumption,the defendant then reaches the dubious conclusion that he is not subject to the general rule.the weakness of this argument is apparent.obviously,the supreme court pronouncements in moore are not directly applicable to the defendant since he was never a licensed practitioner,and therefore,never eligible for the exception contained in the first sentence of section.thus,the administrator of a medical center falls within the general rule which applies to any person.

furthermore,the fact that the nonregistrant in this case engaged in a drug conspiracy in violation of via the internet is immaterial.the fifth and tenth circuits,and two district courts,have approved the application of to the operation of internet pharmacies.see united states fuchs,cir rejecting sufficiency of the evidence challenge to drug conspiracy conviction of pharmacist who had set up internet pharmacy united states nelson,cir rejecting sufficiency of the evidence challenge to drug conspiracy conviction of physician who had issued prescriptions for internet pharmacy united states quinones,d,denying motion to dismiss indictment charging of websites with distribution of controlled substances,conspiracy with medical professionals to distribute controlled substances,and money laundering on the ground that the acts committed were not prohibited by section of the csa united states hernandez,wl,at,unpublished denying motion to dismiss indictment charging physicians,business owners,and corporations with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in connection with sales over the internet.
birbragher was not indicted because his business,pharmacom,utilized the internet to distribute controlled substances.rather,he was prosecuted for conspiring with doctors and pharmacists to distribute controlled substances in a manner which the government alleges is outside the usual course of professional practice.see quinones,d at n can be prosecuted for conspiring with or aiding and abetting registrants regardless of the means used to carry out the distribution if the means are within the usual scope of professional practice,they are legal if they are outside that scope,they are illegal.specifically,birbragher was prosecuted because of the manner in which pharmacom allegedly operated in that 
contracting doctors issued prescriptions for controlled substances 
based on a short health history questionnaire,where t he customers identities were not verified,nor were customers required to submit any medical records,as part of the ordering process,
without examining any of the customers,and in the vast majority of cases,without reviewing any medical records,and 
t he only contact the doctors had with the customers,if any contact occurred at all,was the occasional brief telephone call or an exchange of.
contracting pharmacies filled prescriptions for controlled substances 
shipp ing the controlled substance prescriptions to customers throughout the united states,
without contacting the customers or the doctors who had approved,or purportedly approved,the prescription drug orders.
indictment.the tenth circuit recently rejected a vagueness challenge to the csa by a pharmacist in a similar fact situation.see united states lovern,cir.the court stated 
lovern was a pharmacist with decades of experience.according to his own testimony,lovern understood that he had a legal duty to ensure he filled only those prescriptions issued in the usual course of medical practice.he understood as well that a relationship,including a physical examination,usually precedes a prescription in contemporary medical practice.and he knew that the prescriptions he filled at the pharmacy were issued after a customer filled in an online questionnaire with no physical examination or consultation with a physician.a reasonable jury could find that lovern knowingly filled prescriptions issued outside the usual course of medical practice,something lovern admitted he could not do lawfully.on this record,we can not say that lovern was the unwitting victim of a law he did understand.
a reasonable person reading a is on notice that distributing controlled substances violates the csa unless such distribution fits within an exception.such a person is also on notice that the prescription exception of does not apply to prescriptions issued filled outside the usual course of professional practice.furthermore,we note that birbragher has not cited any authority,and we find none,that either the csa or fails to provide adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited.united states deboer,cir t he language in a and a clearly defines the pharmacist responsibilities that give rise to conduct that constitutes an unlawful distribution of a prescription drug.united states rosenberg,cir the language in the course of professional practice clearly means that a doctor is not exempt from the statute when he takes actions that he does not in good faith believe are for legitimate medical purposes.united states collier,cir rejecting argument that a,as applied to physicians,is unconstitutionally vague.in sum,birbragher had adequate notice that the distribution of controlled substances outside the course of professional practice violated the csa regardless of the means of distribution.
next,we ask whether a of the csa allows for arbitrary enforcement.congress must provide minimal requirements to guide law enforcement washam,at.the supreme court has identified this inquiry as the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine because w here the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines,a criminal statute may permit a standardless sweep that allows policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections.kolender lawson,d quoting smith goguen,d.furthermore,
it would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders,and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained,and who should be set at large.this would,to some extent,substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.
