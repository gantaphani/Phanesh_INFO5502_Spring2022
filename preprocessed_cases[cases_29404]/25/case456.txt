plaintiff hoffmann la roche,roche appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the district of new jersey granting the defendant generic drug companies summary judgment of invalidity as to claims of patent the patent and claims of patent the patent.we affirm.
the patents at issue in this appeal are directed to methods of treating osteoporosis through the once monthly administration of ibandronate,one of a class of compounds known as bisphosphonates.ibandronate,a salt of ibandronic acid,is commercially available as roche once monthly boniva,which was approved by the united states food and drug administration fda in for the treatment of osteoporosis.once monthly boniva provides a milligram mg dose of ibandronate.
osteoporosis is a disease characterized by abnormal bone resorption.resorption,the biological process by which bone is broken down,causes decreased bone strength and an increased risk of fractures.bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption.patent,ll.they inhibit abnormal bone destruction and enable the gradual restoration of lost bone mineral density bmd.
bisphosphonates are generally known to have a low bioavailability when administered orally,only a small fraction of a given dose is absorbed into the blood.additionally,oral administration of bisphosphonates can result in adverse esophageal and gastrointestinal side effects.as a result of the side effects and to improve the bioavailability of the drug,patients taking bisphosphonates must adhere to a dosing regimen that requires a bisphosphonate tablet to be taken in a fasting state at least minutes before eating or drinking.in the past,the inconvenience of that regimen created problems of patient compliance.researchers in the field believed that dosing would result in patients continuing the treatment for the long term,which is required for bisphosphonate treatments to be successful.
roche owns the patent and the patent,which is the parent of the patent.claims of the patent and claims of the patent are at issue in this case and describe a method of treating osteoporosis consisting of orally administering about mg of ibandronic acid once monthly on a single day.claim of the patent is representative of the claims on appeal 
a method for treating or inhibiting postmenopausal osteoporosis in a postmenopausal woman in need of treatment or inhibition of postmenopausal osteoporosis by administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of ibandronic acid,comprising 
a commencing the administration of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of ibandronic acid by orally administering to the postmenopausal woman,on a single day,a first dose in the form of a tablet,wherein the tablet comprises an amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of ibandronic acid that is equivalent to about mg of ibandronic acid and 
b continuing the administration by orally administering,once monthly on a single day,a tablet comprising an amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of ibandronic acid that is equivalent to about mg of ibandronic acid.
the defendants in this case are generic drug manufacturers who submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas to the fda for approval to engage in the manufacture and sale of generic versions of boniva prior to the expiration of roche patents.roche sued the defendants in the united states district court for the district of new jersey alleging infringement under e based on the defendants anda filings.
roche moved for a preliminary injunction.the district court denied the motion,holding that roche had failed to prove it was likely to succeed in defeating the defendants obviousness challenge.this court affirmed the district court denial of the preliminary injunction.see hoffmann la roche apotex,app x.
while the appeal of the preliminary injunction decision was pending,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment of invalidity of claims of the patent due to obviousness under a.as to the frequency of dosing,the court found that once monthly oral dosing of ibandronate was established in the prior art.as to the amount of the monthly dose,the court found that the combination of several prior art references suggested a dosage level of about mg per month,or at least indicated that a monthly dose of mg was obvious to try.
the district court considered roche evidence of objective considerations of nonobviousness but concluded that roche objective considerations evidence does not rise to the level of a mere scintilla,and it is not sufficient to defeat the motion for summary judgment.in response to roche argument that the mg once monthly dose gave results that were superior to a mg daily dose,the court found that roche had pointed to no evidence in support of its claim that the skilled artisan would have been surprised that the mg dose was superior to the mg daily dose.the court refused to consider contentions,raised at oral argument,that the mg dose had a superior and unexpected level of bioavailability,because roche had not raised that argument in its opposition brief.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f the court then raised,on its own motion,the issue of summary judgment of invalidity of claims of the patent.after considering the parties submissions,the court held those claims invalid for the same reasons that applied to the claims of the patent.roche argued that it was unexpected that an intermittent ibandronate regimen would be effective in reducing fractures.but the court concluded that the evidence on which roche relied failed to show that a person of skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation that the patented method would succeed in reducing fractures.the court explained that empirical confirmation that a method for increasing bone mineral density helps increase bone strength enough that bones break less easily would not appear to be all that surprising.
in its motion for reconsideration,roche argued that the district court had improperly failed to consider evidence that the mg dose of ibandronate showed an unexpected level of bioavailability as compared with lower doses.on the merits of that argument,the district court found that the evidence that the dosage was absorbed better by the body simply has no relevance to the core finding that the difference between the dose and the prior art was small and that there was a reasonable expectation of success with the mg dose.
roche timely appealed the grants of summary judgment of obviousness.
the issue in this case is whether it would have been obvious at the time of invention to select a once monthly oral dosing regimen of ibandronate to treat osteoporosis and to set that dose at mg.
monthly dosing 
a relatively infrequent dosing schedule has long been viewed as a potential solution to the problem of patient compliance stemming from the inconvenience of oral bisphosphonate regimens.fosamax,a prior art bisphosphonate product sold by merck,was administered weekly,and several prior art references taught once monthly oral dosing of ibandronate or other bisphosphonates.
first,an article in the trade journal lunar news entitled update bisphosphonates lunar news stated that r esearchers are seeking solutions for better compliance,including approaches that use bisphosphonates with high potency yet low irritability,such as ibandronate roche.oral agents could be given intermittently,for example and still be quite potent.second,a article by carey krause in chemical market reporter krause disclosed that roche would likely seek fda approval of an oral formulation of ibandronate in.finally,united states patent chen disclosed forms of bisphosphonic acids and methods for orally administering those dosage forms.ibandronic acid was identified as one of many known bisphosphonic acids.chen disclosed a preferred embodiment in which a dosage form of the invention is administered to a patient preferably once a month.lunar news,krause,and chen therefore specifically taught the monthly administration of ibandronate.
similarly,the prior art contained references to the monthly oral administration of bisphosphonates in general.united states patent application schofield taught dosing of phosponate s and referred to equivalent doses that can be given every other day,twice a week,weekly,biweekly or monthly.united states patent geddes disclosed a bisphosphonate administration regimen in which said bisphosphonate is administered at least day of every said thirty day treatment period.
roche argues that the art taught away from once monthly dosing because,according to roche,it was widely believed as of the date of invention that a bisphosphonate regimen with a interval longer than one or two weeks would not be effective.to support that contention,roche primarily relies on the alleged failure of its intravenous ibandronate study recker to demonstrate antifracture efficacy with quarterly dosing.secondarily,roche relies on a prior art article by thomas schnitzer schnitzer speculating that the failure of the recker study was due to the long interval.
the recker study,however,showed a reduction in vertebral fractures with intravenous ibandronate administered once every three months.the study was a failure only in the sense that the reduction was statistically insignificant given the large number of patients that would have been required to reach a statistically significant conclusion about the relative rates of fractures in the control and subject groups.with respect to the reduction of hip fractures,for example,recker concluded that a meaningful conclusion with regard to efficacy could not be made owing to the low absolute number of hip fractures.recker failure to generate statistically significant results points to a fault in the study it does not teach that infrequent ibandronate dosing is ineffective in treating osteoporosis.
the prior art references that interpreted recker results demonstrate only that it was unknown why recker was unsuccessful in demonstrating statistically significant antifracture efficacy.schnitzer speculated that the long interval was to blame for the inconclusive results and that dosing intervals longer than one or two weeks would be ineffective.on the other hand,an article by dennis black black described speculation that the doses used in recker were too low.in fact,roche itself subsequently acknowledged that the recker study was underdosed.thus,schnitzer speculation did not amount to an affirmative teaching away from monthly oral dosing of ibandronate,especially in the face of black competing explanation of the recker results.
any doubt about the efficacy of oral ibandronate dosing that may have been created by schnitzer speculation was put to rest by an article published in by riis et entitled ibandronate a comparison of oral daily dosing versus intermittent dosing in postmenopausal osteoporosis riis.riis demonstrated that intermittent ibandronate is as effective as the continuous treatment in terms of significantly increasing bmd at the spine and hip and suppressing markers of bone turnover.riis showed that increases in bmd equivalent to those obtained with a mg per day treatment regimen were obtained with a regimen of mg of ibandronate every other day for the first days of every period.those results,riis concluded,confirm ed preclinical data showing that it is the total dose over a predefined period and not the dosing regimens that is the determining factor for effect on bone mass and architecture after ibandronate treatment.riis teaching that a interval of more than two months did not impact the bmd efficacy of ibandronate was directly contrary to schnitzer speculation that such a dosing regimen would not be effective.therefore,even if schnitzer interpretation of the recker study were viewed as teaching away from monthly dosing,riis contrary findings substantially undermined that interpretation.
roche argues that riis did not overcome schnitzer interpretation because riis was not an antifracture trial.roche argues that prior art focusing only on bmd and improvements,instead of on antifracture efficacy,does not bear on the obviousness analysis in this case because such prior art does not establish a reasonable expectation of success in reducing fracture risk.
while it is true that bmd improvements do not perfectly correlate with antifracture efficacy,it was well established in the art that bmd is a powerful surrogate for measuring fracture risk.for example,roche own expert explained 
bone mineral density is directly related to fracture risk.it is one of the most powerful surrogate markers in the field of medicine.it is as powerful an indicator of osteoporosis as blood pressure is a predictor of stroke.for every standard deviation reduction in bone mineral density,fracture risk is doubled.
roche patents do not themselves present data demonstrating antifracture efficacy for a once monthly mg dose.in fact,antifracture efficacy for boniva was demonstrated to the fda through a bridging study that used bmd and bone turnover results not antifracture testing to establish the therapeutic noninferiority of the mg monthly dose relative to the previously approved mg daily dose,for which antifracture efficacy had been demonstrated.
conclusive proof of efficacy is not necessary to show obviousness.all that is required is a reasonable expectation of success.see pharmastem therapeutics,viacell,pfizer,apotex.riis along with other prior art that used bmd improvement as the primary efficacy marker for treating osteoporosis established at least a reasonable expectation that once monthly dosing of ibandronate could successfully treat osteoporosis and reduce fracture risk.
selecting the mg dose 
riis confirmed the concept whereby the efficacy of ibandronate depends on the total oral dose given rather than on the dosing schedule.riis therefore teaches that in setting the dosage level for an intermittent ibandronate regimen,one need only scale up a dose from a regimen,daily dosing to achieve approximately the same bmd and efficacy with a regimen.
the prior art provided substantial guidance as to the total dose,within a given time period,that would produce effective results.a article by ravn et ravn reported the results of a study that measured bmd improvements and markers for daily ibandronate doses of mg,mg,mg,mg,and mg.the authors concluded that the average change in bone mass showed positive outcome in all regions in the groups receiving ibandronate and mg.the mg dose exhibited a response that was virtually equal to the mg dose,even though it contained only half the amount of ibandronate.the mg dose was thereby deemed the most effective dose.
a person skilled in the art looking to scale to a monthly dose of oral ibandronate from a daily dose was thus faced with a very limited set of possibilities of the five daily doses tested in ravn,only the and mg doses showed positive outcome in all regions.even though the mg dose did not demonstrate greater efficacy than the mg dose,it was still deemed an equivalently effective dose so that someone scaling it to a single monthly dose of mg x would have anticipated equivalent success in raising bmd and limiting bone turnover,based on riis.
additionally,united states patent daifotis disclosed weekly doses of ibandronate from the group consisting of mg,mg,mg,or mg.the mg weekly dose corresponds to the same total dose as a mg daily dose.the equivalent to mg of ibandronate per day is thus the only dose that appears in both ravn and daifotis suggesting that there was a reasonable expectation of success with the equivalents of the mg daily dose,mg per month.
accordingly,the prior art pointed to a monthly treatment of mg of ibandronate.at the very least,the mg dose was obvious to try there was a need to solve the problem of patient compliance by looking to dosing regimens.and,based on ravn and daifotis,in light of riis concept,there were only a finite number of identified,predictable solutions.ksr int l teleflex.
roche contends that findings by the fda taught away from further development of the mg daily dose and its equivalents because the fda approved a mg daily dose of ibandronate instead of a mg daily dose.but the fda never made any findings contrary to the mg daily dose,because it was never asked to approve that dose.instead,in approving the mg daily dose,the fda merely restated the results of ravn and concluded that the mg daily dose of ibandronate has the most favorable benefit risk ratio and is the most appropriate dose for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
roche next contends that schofield taught away from using anything other than the lowest effective dose of a bisphosphonate,which,according to roche,was established by ravn to be mg for ibandronate.schofield,however,does not teach that the lowest effective dose is the only dose that should be used when treating osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate.instead,schofield merely defined the lowest effective dose as a measure of a drug potency relative to its therapeutic effects.schofield then described a preferred embodiment of a method for treating bone disorders in which the maintenance dose of a phosphonate ranged from to mg per day.that range clearly encompasses more than just a lowest effective dose.moreover,ravn never purported to establish a lowest effective dose.instead,it sought to establish a most effective daily dose.
roche argues that the district court misinterpreted and misapplied the concept from riis.according to roche,the district court took a technical leap in finding that riis concept implied only simple multiplication to scale from an efficacious daily dose to a monthly dose.the evidence before the district court,however,showed that the concept can be used as an effective rule of thumb by a person skilled in the art deciding how to scale to an efficacious intermittent dose of ibandronate.the riis study,in particular,established that the total dose concept can reliably predict that the efficacy of an ibandronate treatment depends on the total dose administered to a patient over a given period,not on the amount administered at any single point in time.in light of that evidence,it was reasonable to expect that a once monthly dose of mg would have roughly the same efficacy as a daily dose of mg.
safety of the mg dose 
roche next contends that there are disputed issues of fact as to whether it would have been obvious to administer once monthly doses of mg in light of alleged safety concerns about the adverse gastrointestinal effects of ibandronate and other bisphosphonates.
first,roche argues that ravn taught away from further development of the mg daily dose,and thereby its equivalents,because ravn taught that the mg daily dose was more effective than the mg daily dose and had fewer side effects.ravn,however,concluded that the responses in the groups receiving and mg ibandronate were virtually equal,not that the mg dose was more effective.and although patients on the mg daily dose dropped out of the study at a higher rate than patients on lower doses,ravn did not conclude that the higher rate was statistically significant.instead,the authors merely noted that a higher frequency of diarrhea was experienced with the mg dose.a higher frequency of diarrhea does not necessarily teach away from the mg daily dose or its equivalents,however,as the prior art indicated that modest gastrointestinal side effects must be weighed in light of the benefits of the drug.indeed,ravn itself concluded that i n the present study,the side effect profile of ibandronate seemed to be safe and that i n general,the safety evaluation did not reveal any differences between ibandronate and placebo treated groups.
moreover,even if the higher incidence of diarrhea and the larger number of dropouts in the ravn study were initially enough to teach away from further development of the mg daily dose and its total dose equivalents,any such teaching away would have been overcome by riis finding that an oral administration of mg of ibandronate every other day for days,followed by a rest phase,resulted in the same rate of side effects as a mg daily regimen.
aside from ravn,roche does not point to any references suggesting that there were safety concerns associated with the mg dose.nor was roche expert,harris,aware of anything that taught that a once monthly,mg dose of ibandronate would be unsafe.
to the contrary,the prior art establishes that doses even higher than mg were considered safe.united states patent möckel stated that rapidrelease ibandronate formulations showed no significant side effects in clinical studies using ibandronate even at high dosages and disclosed units up to mg.defendants expert,yates,testified that the disclosures in möckel would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to understand that ibandronate doses up to mg would be well tolerated.likewise,daifotis disclosed that f or human oral compositions comprising ibandronate a unit dosage typically comprises from about mg to about mg of the ibandronate compound.
there is thus no genuine issue of fact concerning whether the prior art taught away from the mg dose based on safety concerns.
unexpected results 
roche argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment of obviousness because the evidence of record showed that the mg monthly dose was more effective than the mg daily dose and that the superior effectiveness of the mg monthly dose was unexpected.roche also contends that ibandronate nonlinear bioavailability at the mg dosage level was an unexpected result.
roche mobile study,published in,demonstrated that a mg monthly dose is more effective than a mg daily dose with respect to bmd improvement in the lumbar spine and most hip sites.the mobile study demonstrated,for example,a mean bmd improvement in the lumbar spine of after one year for patients taking the mg monthly dose and after one year for patients taking the mg daily dose.another study published in showed that the extent of ibandronate bioavailability is nonlinear with increasing dosages increasing the oral dose by percent,from mg to mg,resulted in a nearly percent increase in the amount of the drug absorbed by the blood.
while the evidence would support a finding of superior efficacy of the mg monthly dose in raising bmd levels,as compared to a mg daily dose,that improved efficacy does not rebut the strong showing that the prior art disclosed monthly dosing and that there was a reason to set that dose at mg.see in re merck.the evidence of superior efficacy does nothing to undercut the showing that there was a reasonable expectation of success with the mg monthly dose,even if the level of success may have turned out to be somewhat greater than would have been expected.
for the same reasons,the nonlinear bioavailability of ibandronate does not rebut the prima facie showing of obviousness of a once monthly dose of mg.the increased level of bioavailability has not been shown to be responsible for the improved osteoporosis treatment efficacy of the mg dose.a study by ravn et in showed,for example,that a near doubling of the concentration of ibandronate with a mg daily dose,compared to a mg daily dose,produced no further bmd increase and no further reduction in bone turnover.other record evidence confirms that d ue to strong binding to the bone surface,the effects of the systemically available amount of a bisphosphonate are almost exclusively related to its concentration in bone rather than blood serum level.the evidence regarding bioavailability is therefore of little relevance to the obviousness inquiry.
accordingly,we uphold the judgment of the district court that claims of the patent and claims of the patent would have been obvious in light of the prior art and are therefore invalid.
hoffmann laroche boniva ibandronate medication for osteoporosis required twelve years of research and clinical testing and evaluation to demonstrate its efficacy when dosed once a month and its safety at this high monthly dosage.the prior investigations of intermittent dosing,and the publications describing protocols of lesser success,missed the protocol that produced this successful method.indeed,this prior art weighs heavily against obviousness,for despite extensive exploration,this successful protocol was not discovered.
invalidation of this patent is not supported by clear and convincing evidence.the court ruling of obviousness violates the principles of graham john deere,all factors must be considered,including commercial success,failure of others,and need.the court reasoning violates the guidance of ksr int l teleflex,the standard of requires a limited number of specified alternatives offering a likelihood of success in light of the prior art and common sense,this court instead invoking judicial hindsight to reconstruct the patented subject matter.
nowhere amid the many studies of bisphosphonate osteoporosis treatments over a wide range of dosages and conditions,did any reference show or suggest the boniva combination of a single mg dose and administration.no reference suggested the effectiveness and safety of this combination.nonetheless,my colleagues declare this treatment obvious to them.my colleagues primary reason,that mg is thirty times the daily dose of mg,does not mention that the fda refused to approve the mg dose due to its toxic side effects.surely this leads away from the obviousness of a single dose thirty times larger.
i respectfully dissent.
discussion 
the unexpected results of the patented method are conceded by the panel majority.the evidence on summary judgment was that many others sought and failed to find an efficacious intermittent treatment schedule.the prior art relied on by my colleagues surrounded but missed the roche method.the prior art shows that safety is likely to be compromised at high doses,and that efficacy is likely to be compromised at extended dosing intervals.nonetheless,this court now holds that it was obvious to do what no one did or even suggested my colleagues simply disregard the preferences and toxicity warnings and discard the procedures of the prior art.
the prior art shows intermittent therapies ranging from every other day to once a week to twice a week to twice a month to every three months plus varying initial loading periods,in a wide range of dosages.the prior art is replete with warnings of toxicity and patient noncompliance.the panel majority acknowledges that roche mobile study and the nonlinear bioavailability data discussed infra demonstrate that the mg monthly treatment produced unexpected results,but deems this irrelevant the court now,with knowledge of roche success,deems roche successful method to have been obvious all along.
the supreme court recognized in ksr that a patent challenger must identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to arrive at the patented invention.at.my colleagues,unable to find any suggestion of the roche protocol in the prior art,accept the argument that a monthly single dose of mg was obvious because a monthly dose of mg is thirty times a daily dose of mg.the fda had refused to approve a daily dose of mg due to its demonstrated heightened toxicity.the success of a dose thirty times larger than the prohibited mg dose can not reasonably be predicted.neither the prior art,nor common sense,provides the expectation that a treatment at a dosage of mg would be safe and effective.
a.the prior art 
the möckel patent 
my colleagues combine many references to support their ruling of obviousness.they cite the möckel for the proposition that single doses of more than mg were known.möckel is directed to coated tablet formulations,not the concentration of active ingredients.möckel provides specific examples of ibandronate tablets containing a maximum dose of mg,states that the preferred upper limit is mg,and that the formulations could contain up to about mg.möckel shows no formulated dose larger than mg,although the reference contains the usual expansive statements of the patent scrivener.
möckel states that no significant side effects were observed in clinical studies using ibandronate at high dosages,but does not state that high exceeds his preferred upper limit,for at that time the fda had determined that a single oral dose of mg is the maximum tolerable dose of ibandronate.yet my colleagues rely on this reference as rendering obvious roche specific dosage of mg.
lunar news 
other references also show that the field was seeking a better bisphosphonate protocol,and that the problems were not solved.the lunar news article on which the panel majority places heavy reliance,broadly states that some osteoporosis agents can be given intermittently.however it never directly associates ibandronate with oral therapy.instead,the lunar news article states the wisdom that t he projected mode for ibandronate is injection once every three months.contrary to the panel majority,this article supports unobviousness of the roche therapy,not obviousness.
the chen patent 
the chen is similarly inapt.chen sought to minimize the adverse effects associated with bisphosphonic acids by combining the bisphosphonic acid with a carrier that acts as a dispersing medium for the active agent.chen lists all of the known bisphosphonic acids,and states that oral dosages may be administered anywhere between once every two weeks and once every twelve weeks,with the optimal frequency of once every twelve weeks.chen does not provide any example using ibandronate,and does not suggest a specific dosage or dosage interval for any product.nor does chen state what parameters may lead to a successful regimen.
the geddes patent 
the other references on which my colleagues rely are no more helpful to their conclusion.the geddes is directed to a combination therapy of a bisphosphonate compound and a hormone,and states that the bisphosphonate may be dosed from every day to once a month.geddes does not mention ibandronate or the dosage or suggest that it may be effective at mg once a month.
the schofield patent application 
the schofield application on which the court also relies,describes a treatment regimen featuring a loading period of to days,followed by a maintenance dose.the loading dose of bisphosphonate may be given daily or every other day,while the maintenance dose may be given anywhere from daily to monthly.schofield further states that the loading dose is about two to twenty times greater than the maintenance dose.schofield mentions ibandronate as a possible active agent appropriate for use in its methods,but provides no dosages or specified periods for ibandronate.
the riis article 
several references address intermittent treatment,but none suggests administration of mg of oral ibandronate.the court relies on the riis article which shows dosing patients with mg of ibandronate every other day for days,followed by a week period of no treatment,then returning to mg every other day for days,and a week period of no treatment.the court characterizes this as definitive proof of the total dosing concept.however,riis makes no suggestion that the dosing at the high dosage used by roche could replace riis elaborate procedure.
riis illustrates the general belief that some sort of complex dosing is needed if daily doses are supplanted.the simplicity of the boniva regimen is nowhere to be found,although the need for a better regimen was well recognized.see graham,at objective evidence of nonobviousness includes need and failure of others.riis contains no suggestion that a oncemonthly dosage of mg would be both safe and effective this became known only after roche discovered it.
the recker study 
by comparison,the recker article which sets forth in its introduction the state of the art in,states that oral bisphosphonates must be administered frequently,daily or weekly and in accordance with stringent dosing recommendations.
only this court reads the prior art to suggest and render obvious that which eluded the art at the time.
the ravn study 
the court attempts to overcome the shortcomings of the prior art by applying the total dose concept of riis to the dosage ranges in the reference.ravn tested daily treatment using a range of dosages and concluded that mg per day is the most effective dose.yet the court selects ravn mg dose,despite its increased toxicity and ravn preference for the lower dose,to scale up to roche mg dose.ravn does not suggest a oncemonthly dose of mg.
it is also noteworthy that the riis publication,which is later in time than ravn,selected the mg dosage,not the mg dosage,as a framework for intermittent dosing.
the daifotis patent 
t
