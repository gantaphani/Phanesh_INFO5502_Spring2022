double patenting 
the double patenting doctrine generally prevents a patentee from receiving two patents for the same invention.thus,this doctrine polices the proper application of the patent term for each invention.the proscription against double patenting takes two forms statutory and.statutory,or same invention,double patenting is based on the language in of the patent act mandating a patent for any new and useful invention.in re goodman,if the claimed inventions are identical in scope,the proper rejection is under because an inventor is entitled to a single patent for an invention.citations omitted,or,double patenting is a judicially created doctrine adopted to prevent claims in separate applications or patents that do not recite the same invention,but nonetheless claim inventions so alike that granting both exclusive rights would effectively extend the life of patent protection.gerber garment,lectra,citing in re thorington.this case involves double patenting in this latter category.
claim of the patent recites 
a method for treating skin sunburn comprising topically applying to the skin sunburn a fatty acid ester of ascorbic acid effective to solubilize in the layers of the skin an amount effective to scavenge therefrom free radicals present as a result of transfer of energy to the skin from the ultraviolet radiation which produced said sunburn.

a method for the treatment of skin damaged or aged by free radicals or oxidative generation of biologically active metabolites which comprises topically applying to affected skin areas a composition containing an effective amount of an ascorbyl fatty acid ester in a dermatologically acceptable,carrier such that the ester is percutaneously delivered to layers of the skin.
patent,cols.the district court found claim of the patent invalid under the double patenting doctrine in view of claim of the patent.in reaching that conclusion,the district court first identified differences between the two claims 
claim of the patent teaches a method for treatment of certain skin disorders,while claim of the patent teaches a method for treatment of sunburn claim of the patent recites the use of an effective amount of an ascorbyl fatty acid ester,while claim of the patent teaches applying an ascorbyl fatty acid ester effective to solubilize in the layers of the skin an amount effective to scavenge free radicals present as a result of the transfer of energy to the skin from the ultraviolet radiation which produced the sunburn and claim of the patent recites the use of a dermatologically acceptable,carrier such that the ester is percutaneously delivered to layers of the skin,while the patent does not explicitly recite the use of a carrier.
perricone,d at.the district court analyzed those distinctions.in the first place,the district court noted that sunburn is a species of the genus of skin disorders covered by the patent.id.next,consulting the specifications of both patents,the district court concluded that the claimed effective amount in the patent falls within the ranges of effective amounts in the patent.finally,the district court construed the effective to solubilize language in claim of the patent to mean the same thing as the language in claim of the patent requiring a dermatologically acceptable,carrier such that the ester is percutaneously delivered to layers of the skin.accordingly,the district court found claim of the patent invalid for double patenting in view of claim of the patent.
claims of the patent all depend from independent claim.thus,the district court analysis of claim applies equally to claims.claim includes an additional limitation specifying a particular range of concentration of the ester.because that range substantially overlaps the range in claim of the patent dependent on claim of the patent,the district court determined that claim of the patent is also obvious in view of claim of the patent.id.at.for claims and of the patent,the district court determined that those claims added the same limitations to independent claim as claims and added to claim of the patent.thus,the district court determined that dependent claims fall with claim of the patent for the above reasons.id.at.
independent claim of the patent includes limitations analogous to those in independent claim.accordingly,the district court applied the same reasoning for its double patenting determination of claim.id.at.the district court paid special attention to the additional recitation in claim of specific tocotrienols,but determined that those tocotrienols are not patentably distinct from the vitamin e of claim of the patent.finally,the district court determined that claims and of the patent,which both depend from claim of that patent,are not patentably distinct from claims and.
this court first examines the contention that the claims of the patent contain material differences from those in the patent.this material differences argument does not show that the district court erred in its double patenting analysis.rather,the district court analysis specifically addresses differences between the claims of the and patents.for instance,the district court discussed the difference between the recitation in the patent claim of a dermatologically acceptable carrier and claim recitation of no carrier at all.thus,the district court cogently reasoned that,based on the specification,the effective to solubilize language in claim of the patent means the same thing as the carrier language in claim.thus,the difference disappears.
likewise,the district court properly resolved the apparent difference between treatment of various types of skin damage in claims and of the patent and treatment of sunburn in claim.sunburn is a species of skin damage.as such,this court perceives no error in the district court determination that the earlier species renders the later genus claims invalid under double patenting.see eli lilly barr,this court case law firmly establishes that a later genus claim limitation is anticipated by,and therefore not patentably distinct from,an earlier species claim.citations omitted.
finally,the district court did not misconstrue the relationship between claim of the patent and claim of the patent.the district court interpreted the language of claim reciting various tocotrienols,and concluded that it refers to certain forms of tocopherols,or vitamin perricone,d at.thus,the district court did not improperly conclude that a species was obvious in light of an earlier claim to a genus but correctly concluded that there was no patentable distinction between the language of claim of the patent and claim of the patent.this court finds no error in that analysis.
the district court also considered and correctly rejected the suggestion that procedures of the united states patent and trademark office pto militate against double patenting.specifically,if perricone had presented all the claims of the and patents to the pto in a single application,the pto might have made a restriction requirement.in other words,the pto might have separated the claimed subject matter into different classifications and different inventions.if the pto had entered a restriction requirement under that hypothetical situation,would have barred a double patenting rejection.yes,and if the court had a brother,he might like buttermilk.in other words,this tortured hypothetical does not correspond to the record in this case.the various claims were not filed together nor restricted by the pto.thus,in simple terms,does not rescue perricone voluntarily filed application.
finally,and contrary to the suggestion by the district court,the patent act and pto rules support the filing of a terminal disclaimer even after issuance of the second patent.see a ny patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public the entire term,or any terminal part of the term,of the patent granted cfr a incorporating the language of.the district court focus on in re goodman,explaining that a terminal disclaimer can overcome a double patenting rejection seems to have led to its conclusion that a terminal disclaimer can not be filed for an issued patent to overcome invalidity based on double patenting.the commentary from in re goodman arose in the context of ex parte prosecution,a setting not applicable to this case.an applicant must always overcome every rejection to gain issuance of a patent.accordingly,the timing requirement of a terminal disclaimer to overcome a double patenting rejection does not dictate a prohibition on terminal disclaimers.a terminal disclaimer can indeed supplant a finding of invalidity for double patenting.see applied materials,semiconductor materials,for double patenting,the improper extension of the statutory term problem can sometimes be avoided for patents through the use of a terminal disclaimer.this record,however,does not include any evidence of a disclaimer even though the district court invalidated the claims over two years ago.thus,while perricone might still file a terminal disclaimer to overcome prospectively the double patenting basis for invalidity,this court makes no determination about the retrospective effect of such a terminal disclaimer.
anticipation 
a single prior art reference that discloses,either expressly or inherently,each limitation of a claim invalidates that claim by anticipation.mining johnson johnson orthopaedics.thus,a prior art reference without express reference to a claim limitation may nonetheless anticipate by inherency.see in re cruciferous sprout.under the principles of inherency,if the prior art necessarily functions in accordance with,or includes,the claims limitations,it anticipates.id.quoting int l milgraum.moreover,i nherency is not necessarily coterminous with knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art.artisans of ordinary skill may not recognize the inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior art.see also schering geneva,rejecting the contention that inherent anticipation requires recognition in the prior art citing in re cruciferous sprout,at,at.
the district court determined that patent pereira anticipates claims,and of the patent,and claims of the patent.perricone,d at.pereira teaches a cosmetic composition for topical application and discloses various ingredients in that composition,including skin benefit ingredients,emollients,emulsifiers,and thickeners.see pereira,cols.in addition to listing examples,pereira discloses eight distinct example compositions with specific concentrations of ingredients.id.at cols.pereira identifies the disclosed compositions only briefly,identifying them as suitable for topical application to the skin or hair.pereira,ll.the district court concluded that pereira disclosed use anticipates perricone claims because pereira disclosed compositions include all the various ingredients in the concentrations claimed by perricone.thus,according to the district court,the topical application of pereira compositions would necessarily yield perricone claimed skin benefits.on appeal,perricone argues that pereira disclosed skin benefit ingredients include ascorbyl palmitate among many others,and so pereira disclosure does not anticipate the specific claimed use of ascorbyl palmitate pereira disclosed range of concentration of its skin benefit ingredient only partially overlaps with perricone claimed range and pereira does not disclose any benefit directed to skin sunburn,or any of the other specific skin disorders,as claimed by perricone.
with respect to its skin benefit ingredient,pereira discloses from to by weight of a skin benefit ingredient chosen from ascorbyl palmitate and tocopherol,vitamin e pereira,ll.in addition to those two identified ingredients,pereira lists an additional twelve ingredients.see id.in total,pereira teaches a total of fourteen skin benefit ingredients.this court rejects the notion that one of these ingredients can not anticipate because it appears without special emphasis in a longer list.to the contrary,the disclosure is prior art to the extent of its enabling disclosure.see mustek,the anticipation analysis asks solely whether the prior art reference discloses and enables the claimed invention,and not how the prior art characterizes that disclosure or whether alternatives are also disclosed.citing celeritas techs.rockwell int l.
in re baird,is not inconsistent with this anticipation analysis.in the first place,in re baird involved obviousness,not anticipation.baird observes that disclosure of millions of compounds does not render obvious a claim to three compounds.at emphasis added.baird reasoning,relevant to obviousness,does not apply to pereira disclosure of a handful of different compositions,the use of one of which anticipates perricone claims.
while other opinions state that disclosure of a broad genus does not necessarily specifically disclose a species within that genus,see,corning glass works sumitomo,this axiomatic proposition also does not rescue perricone claims.in this case,the prior art does not merely disclose a genus of skin benefit ingredients without disclosing the particular claimed ingredient.rather pereira specifically discloses ascorbyl palmitate.that specific disclosure,even in a list,makes this case different from cases involving disclosure of a broad genus without reference to the potentially anticipating species.thus,these cases do not alter the district court correct anticipation reasoning.
pereira disclosed range of concentration also does not exactly correspond to perricone claimed range.pereira disclosure nonetheless discloses and anticipates perricone particular claimed effective amount ranges.perricone claims recite a number of different ranges associated with the fatty acid ester.those claimed ranges vary in breadth from an effective amount in claim to particular specific ranges in other claims,up to by weight,patent,claim from about to about by weight,patent,claim from about to about by weight,patent,claim.pereira discloses a range of concentration from to by weight.pereira,ll.as the district court correctly noted,pereira range entirely encompasses,and does not significantly deviate from,perricone claimed ranges.thus,this court sustains the district court reading of pereira effective amount disclosure.see atlas powder ireco,at,w hen a patent claims a chemical composition in terms of ranges of elements,any single prior art reference that falls within each of the ranges anticipates the claim.citing titanium metals banner.
with respect to the particular claimed skin benefits,the district court reasoned that pereira will inherently function in the claimed beneficial manner when topically applied to the skin.perricone,d at.thus,the district court ultimately based its anticipation analysis on inherency.in general,a limitation or the entire invention is inherent and in the public domain if it is the natural result flowing from the explicit disclosure of the prior art.schering,at citing eli lilly barr,in re kratz,ccpa.in some cases,the inherent property corresponds to a claimed new benefit or characteristic of an invention otherwise in the prior art.in those cases,the new realization alone does not render the old invention patentable.see atlas powder,at t he discovery of a previously unappreciated property of a prior art composition,or of a scientific explanation for the prior art function,does not render the old composition patentably new to the discoverer.squibb ben venue,explaining that newly discovered results of known processes are not patentable because those results are inherent in the known processes.thus,when considering a prior art method,the anticipation doctrine examines the natural and inherent results in that method without regard to the full recognition of those benefits or characteristics within the art field at the time of the prior art disclosure.

claim,patent a method for the treatment of damaged or aging skin and epithelial tissue disorders said treatment comprising topically applying to affected tissue areas the combination of 
thus,perricone independent claims recite particular skin benefits together with methods of achieving those benefits,topically applying a particular compound.if pereira discloses the very same methods,then the particular benefits must naturally flow from those methods even if not recognized as benefits at the time of pereira disclosure.thus,pereira anticipates if its disclosure of topical application satisfies the application step in perricone various asserted claims.
claim of the patent,from which claims and ultimately depend,specifically recites application of the fatty acid ester to skin sunburn.this claim term raises a different problem.the issue is not,as the dissent and district court imply,whether pereira lotion if applied to skin sunburn would inherently treat that damage,but whether pereira discloses the application of its composition to skin sunburn.it does not.this court explained in catalina marketing international,that a patent to an apparatus does not necessarily prevent a subsequent inventor from obtaining a patent on a new method of using the apparatus.new uses of old products or processes are indeed patentable subject matter.see identifying as patentable any new and useful improvements of a process,machine,manufacture,in re king,principles of inherency do not prohibit a process patent for a new use of an old structure.that principle governs in this case as well.
claim of the patent recites a new use of the composition disclosed by pereira,the treatment of skin sunburn.the district court inherent anticipation analysis for this claim contains a flaw.the disclosed use of pereira lotion,topical application,does not suggest application of pereira lotion to skin sunburn.in other words,the district court inherency analysis goes astray because it assumes what pereira neither disclosed nor rendered inherent.because pereira does not disclose topical application to skin sunburn,this court reverses the district court holding that pereira anticipates claims and of the patent.
like the district court,the dissent seems to ignore,or at least dismiss as not substantial,the distinction between perricone claimed method and pereira disclosed method.thus,the dissent characterizes both methods the same way pereira describes not only the same product that is claimed in the sunburn patent,but also the same method of using it,topically applying it to the skin in an amount necessary to have beneficial effects on the skin.unfortunately,the dissent can make that statement only by dismissing the explicit language of perricone claimed method applying to the skin sunburn.patent,claim.skin sunburn is not analogous to skin surfaces generally.thus,there is an important distinction between topical application to skin for the purpose of avoiding sunburn,and the much narrower topical application to skin sunburn.that distinction highlights the flaw in the dissent knee brace hypothetical,which suggests that a particular prevention method necessarily anticipates a treatment method.to use a more apt analogy,the disclosure that a sunburn can be prevented by wearing a hat clearly does not anticipate a claim to the discovery that one can treat an existing sunburn by putting on a hat.the dissent attempts to bolster its analogy by comparing the mechanism underlying its knee brace analogy to perricone invention.with that comparison,the dissent drifts even farther from the facts of this case.the alleged anticipating reference here is pereira,not perricone own teachings.pereira is silent about any sunburn prevention or treatment benefits,not to mention the mechanisms underlying such uses.if pereira did teach sunburn prevention,as well as the mechanism behind that prevention,those teachings might suggest that perricone sunburn treatment claims would have been obvious.however,those unrealized possibilities do not alter the analysis in this case where pereira does not disclose topical application to skin sunburn.
unlike claim,claim of the patent,from which claims and ultimately depend,merely requires application of the composition to exposed skin surfaces.because all skin surfaces are susceptible to sunburn damage,and because one can only realistically apply a composition to a skin surface when that surface is exposed,pereira topical application encompasses the application step of claim.thus,the district court correctly determined that pereira disclosure of the topical application of the same composition necessarily anticipates claims,and of the patent.
claim of the patent,from which claims of that patent ultimately depend,recites application to affected skin areas.that claim further recites that those skin areas suffer from depleted or inhibited collagen synthesis.patent,claim.the specification of the patent,meanwhile,explains that such damage results from,inter alia,the natural aging process.patent,ll.because all skin is a victim of that process,claim of the patent ultimately claims merely the topical application of the recited composition.likewise,claim of the patent,from which claims of that patent ultimately depend,recites application of the composition to affected skin areas where those areas are further identified as being aged.as such,because all skin ages,the application step of claim merely requires application of the composition to skin.similarly,the affected tissue areas of claim of the patent,from which claims ultimately depend,are identified in that claim as aging skin.thus,as with claims and of the patent,claim claims merely the topical application of the recited composition.because pereira discloses the very same composition and teaches its topical application,the district court correctly applied the inherency doctrine.using the same composition claimed by perricone in the same manner claimed by perricone naturally results in the same claimed skin benefits.
in an effort to support the district court invalidity ruling on other grounds,medicis has directed this court attention to a number of other references that medicis argues anticipates perricone claims.this court declines to consider grounds for invalidity not relied on by,and not appealed from,the district court.
infringement 
recognizing that invalidity is an affirmative defense to infringement,the district court granted medicis motion for summary judgment of of the patent.perricone,d at.the district court likewise denied perricone motion for summary judgment of infringement.because it reverses the district court grant of summary judgment on claims and of the patent,this court also vacates the district court summary judgment of on those claims.
attorney fees 
in the,medicis challenges the district court denial of its motion for attorney fees under.medicis asks this court either to remand on the exceptional case question or to declare the case exceptional without further proceedings.medicis opening brief at.this court declines that invitation.
an award of attorney fees under involves a determination.first,a district court must determine whether the prevailing party has proven an exceptional case by clear and convincing evidence.forest,abbott,citing ruiz chance.this court reviews an exceptional case finding for clear error.id.at.second,if the district court finds the case exceptional,it must then determine whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate.id.this court reviews that determination for an abuse of discretion.id.citing cybor fas,en banc.as this court explained in frank casing crew weatherford international,trial judges enjoy discretion to award attorney fees for good reason.after presiding over the preparation and trial of the case,the trial judge can best weigh the relevant considerations,such as the closeness of the case,the tactics of counsel,the flagrant or good faith character of the parties conduct,and any other factors contributing to imposition of punitive sanctions or to fair allocation of the burdens of litigation.id.citing modine allen group,johnson son.this case exhibits those considerations.
medicis arguments appear to focus on the timing and content of various expert reports proffered by perricone,the propriety of various responses by perricone to medicis requests for admissions,and demands made by perricone during settlement negotiations.while the timing and content of some of those documents might be questionable,medicis points to nothing establishing that the district court committed clear error regarding whether this case is exceptional.moreover,even if this court determined that this case should have been declared exceptional,the district court failure to award attorney fees would not rise to an abuse of discretion given that court familiarity with the various relevant details of perricone conduct in this case.
conclusion 
this court affirms the district court summary judgment of invalidity of claims of the patent and claims,and of the patent.however,because the district erred in its anticipation analysis of claims and of the patent,this court reverses the district court summary judgment of invalidity as to those claims.moreover,this court vacates the district court summary judgment of of claims and of the patent,but affirms that summary judgment as to the remaining claims in that patent.finally,this court affirms the district court denials of medicis motion for attorney fees under.this court remands for further proceedings.
each party shall bear its own costs.
and remanded 
i concur in most aspects of the court opinion,including the portions upholding the district court ruling that claims of the skin disorder patent,patent,and claims,and of the sunburn patent,patent,are anticipated by patent the pereira patent.i dissent,however,from the portion of the judgment holding that the pereira patent does not anticipate claims and of the sunburn patent.in my view,the differences between the claims that the court invalidates and those that it holds not to be invalid do not justify a difference in outcome.the written description of the sunburn patent is identical to the pertinent portions of the written description of the skin disorder patent in all material respects.the only significant difference between the two patents for present purposes is that the sunburn patent claims methods for treating and preventing sunburn comprising the topical application of the composition described in the specification,while the skin disorder patent claims a method for treating skin disorders comprising the topical application of the same composition.moreover,the only difference between the claims of the sunburn patent that this court invalidates and those that it upholds is that the former recite methods for preventing sunburn while the latter recite methods for treating sunburn.the differences between the sunburn and the skin disorder patents,and among the claims of the sunburn patent,simply highlight inherent features of the compositions that are disclosed both in the common written description of the two patents in suit and in the pereira patent.under our precedents,those differences do not suffice to avoid anticipation.
claim of the sunburn patent recites 
a method for treating skin sunburn comprising topically applying to the skin sunburn a fatty acid ester of ascorbic acid effective to solubilize in the layers of the skin an amount effective to scavenge therefrom free radicals present as a result of transfer of energy to the skin from the ultraviolet radiation which produced said sunburn.
