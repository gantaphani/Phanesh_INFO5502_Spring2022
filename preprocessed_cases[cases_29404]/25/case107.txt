opinion of the court 
mylan pharmaceuticals,a generic drug manufacturer,and several other plaintiffs hereinafter mylan originally brought this action against defendants,warner chilcott and mayne pharma,both drug manufacturers.defendants manufacture and sell doryx,the version of doxycycline hyclate,an oral antibiotic of the tetracycline class used to treat severe acne.tetracyclines are a broad category of antibiotics,the most common being doxycycline monohydrate and minocycline,which vary in their use and efficacy.mylan alleges,among other things,that defendants conspired to protect their position in the market through product hopping,which involves making various insignificant modifications to a drug to keep generic competitors out of the market by forcing them to a cumbersome regulatory approval process.
after several plaintiffs in this action settled their cases,mylan was the only remaining plaintiff.mylan claims that defendants are liable for creating an unlawful monopoly under of the sherman act attempted unlawful monopolization under of the sherman act entering into an agreement in restraint of trade under of the sherman act and tortiously interfering with prospective contractual relationships under pennsylvania law.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted defendants and denied plaintiff.in doing so,the district court held that defendants conduct was not anticompetitive,and that,even if it was,mylan claims failed because it did not establish that defendants had the requisite market power in the relevant product market.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
background 
we begin by describing the complex regulatory and framework involved in most,if not all,pharmaceutical product hopping cases 
federal and state law governing drug approval 
the pharmaceutical industry consists of both and generic drug manufacturers.in general,generic drugs are priced lower than,and compete with,their counterparts both types of drugs are subject to certain approval requirements before they can be sold to the public.in particular,a company that wishes to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states must first obtain approval from the food and drug administration fda this is called the new drug application nda process 
prior to,both and generic drug manufacturers were required to go through the same nda process.that year,congress passed the drug price competition and patent term restoration act,also known as the hatch waxman act the act loosened the approval rules for generics by creating an abbreviated new drug application anda process the anda process permits generic drug companies to rely on a drug company original nda approval for a particular drug in order to gain quicker,less costly fda approval of a generic version of the drug by enabling generic manufacturers to on a brand drug scientific studies and the significant costs associated with their nda,hatch waxman speeds the introduction of generic drugs to market,thereby furthering drug competition.
to rely on a nda,however,the generic drug manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed generic product is both a bioequivalent and a pharmaceutical equivalent of the drug put simply,these two equivalencies require a generic company filing an anda to show a certain level of design and formulaic similarity between its product and the approved drug.anda filers that successfully show that their drug is bioequivalent and pharmaceutically equivalent can then have their product deemed to the drug by the fda.
to be sure,once obtained,the ab rating carries a considerable corollary benefit for generics under state law.every state in the united states has drug substitution laws these state substitution laws either permit or require pharmacists to dispense a therapeutically equivalent,generic drug in place of a brand drug absent express direction from the prescribing physician that the prescription must be dispensed as written.taken together,these laws oftentimes make obtaining a prescription cheaper for the consumer,and they can also prove to be highly profitable for generic drug companies 
as the court of appeals for the second circuit recently noted in new york ex rel.schneiderman actavis plc hereafter namenda hatch waxman and state substitution laws also reflect the fact that the pharmaceutical market functions in a unique way as the namenda court put it,i n a market,a consumer selects and pays for a product after evaluating the price and quality of the product.in the prescription drug market,by contrast,the doctor selects the drug,which creates a certain separation between the buyer and the manufacturer moreover,in most cases,a,such as a health insurance company,pays for the drug as a result,consumer buying behavior may have less of an impact on manufacturer pricing than it otherwise would in a traditional open market.
with this regulatory and market framework in mind,we turn to the facts in this case.
b.the parties and product development 
the parties in this case are manufacturers and sellers of generic and pharmaceutical drugs worldwide.defendant mayne is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in australia.defendant warner chilcott acted as a united states distributor of mayne doryx product,in both and generic form,for a number of years.plaintiff mylan,a generic drug manufacturer,began its effort to produce a generic version of doryx in.
a form of doryx had been on the market for many years.in,the fda approved mayne doryx capsules,an unpatented version of doxycycline hyclate,for sale to the public.in the meantime,using warner as a domestic sales channel,mayne sold both branded and generic versions of doryx for many years in the united states,but the effort did not prove to be fruitful.faced with shrinking profits in the early,mayne contacted warner to strategically bolster the doryx brand instead of focusing on its generic version of the drug.
to sort out their strategy for growing the doryx brand,mayne and warner entered into a licensing agreement in.under the contract,they agreed to take certain steps to bring a new doryx product to the market.mayne also agreed to pull its generic version of doryx from the market,and warner agreed to act as the exclusive distributor of doryx in the united states.warner further agreed to market and promote doryx in return for the rights to all income from domestic sales and to use mayne as its exclusive manufacturer and supplier.the parties also agreed to develop a delayed release doryx tablet,as opposed to the capsule previously marketed,for warner to sell in the united states.
the fda approved defendants nda for doryx and tablets in may.defendants then introduced them to the market in september in an effort to transition the market for doryx capsules over to doryx tablets.as the district court noted,it appears that defendants took a number of steps regarding the capsules that,in conjunction,mylan claims violated the sherman act.in particular,defendants 
stopped selling the capsules to wholesalers removed doryx capsules from the warner chilcott website worked with retailers to the doryx tablet whenever a doctor filed a doryx prescription informed wholesalers,retailers,and doctors that doryx capsules have been replaced by doryx tablets destroyed some of their remaining capsule inventory and bought back some portion of the remaining capsule inventory 
mylan refers to these steps as a hard switch from capsules to tablets and claims that this was done in an effort to stifle generic competition 
beginning in,defendants made a number of other changes to the existing doryx product and thereafter pulled older versions from the market.each of these changes would have required generic manufacturers to file,and await approval of,a new anda demonstrating the similarities between their product and the reformulated doryx product in order to continue selling generics that were to the newest doryx product.
first,defendants worked to develop a strength doryx tablet,in contrast to the previously available and tablets.the tablet would have a score,which the district court described as a groove running across the tablet surface.the score would allow a patient to divide a doryx tablet into two doses if the patient,for instance,needed to dosing based on sensitivity,doctor recommendation,or for any other reason.defendants sought fda approval for the tablet in december,it was approved by the fda in june,and defendants thereafter began marketing the tablet.
soon after,defendants turned their focus from marketing the unscored and tablets to marketing the tablet.like the tablets,they then added a score to the and unscored doryx tablets.the fda approved the and scored tablets in early.
defendants then made another change to the doryx tablet in by adding a second score line to the tablet.this tablet could be split into two or three pieces,further enhancing a patient ability to control.after defendants submitted their application for the tablet to the fda in february,they then pulled the and doryx tablets from the market.then,after receiving approval in fall for the tablet,defendants stopped distributing tablets,just as they had done with the and tablets.
all told,it appears that defendants made four critical changes to doryx,all of which required generics to apply for if they wanted to continue to benefit from state substitution laws these modifications spurred this litigation.
mylan efforts to compete with warner and mayne using generic doryx 
it is also important to our discussion to note mylan parallel efforts to effectively compete with defendants when they made each of the changes to doryx.in particular,these efforts will be relevant to our discussion of whether defendants product changes had exclusionary effects on generic competition.
the capsule version of doryx was unpatented for the first nineteen years after mayne introduced doryx to the market.during that period,another generic manufacturer,sandoz,created its own generic version of the capsule.mylan did not begin developing a generic doryx capsule until april.these efforts failed,however,and mylan finally gave up on trying to create a capsule for marketing and sale around late.
instead of making a capsule,mylan chose to develop generic versions of and doxycycline hyclate tablets.by september,mylan had created the formula for a generic tablet and,in march,it filed an anda for approval.however,the fda delayed its approval when defendants scored version of doryx was released,because,among other complications,mylan was then required,in accordance with fda regulations,to alter its original tablet design to achieve an ab rating.the fda finally approved mylan scored and generic tablets in december,by which time defendants were focused on marketing their single of the tablets.at that time,the fda had,nonetheless,granted mylan days of exclusive selling rights for its generic version of the tablet,allowing mylan to profit without any generic competition.
finally,mylan created a generic version of defendants tablet in late,and the fda granted approval of the drug in february.by that point,however,defendants had already received approval for their tablet and were focused on marketing that version of the drug.this suit followed.
d.the underlying litigation 
mylan filed this lawsuit in july,alleging violations of and of the sherman act it also asserted a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations under pennsylvania law.the crux of mylan complaint is that defendants product changes had little or no therapeutic benefit,and that they served no purpose other than preventing generics from obtaining the benefit of automatic substitution under hatch waxman and various state laws mylan further claims that defendants anticompetitive product hopping strategy was designed to frustrate their efforts to release a generic version of doryx to the market in support of its for summary judgment before the district court,mylan specifically argued that the following four hops were anticompetitive 
change from and capsules to and tablets 
introduction of a tablet 
addition of a single score to and tablets and 
change from single to dual score on the tablet 
in granting defendants motions for summary judgment and denying mylan,the district court found,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to mylan,that defendants had indeed made the doryx hops primarily to delay generic market entry.nonetheless,the court went on to conclude that mylan antitrust claims failed as a matter of law.with respect to the monopolization claim,the district court held that mylan failed to muster sufficient evidence of defendants monopoly power it rejected mylan narrow view of the market comprising only branded and generic doryx and determined that the relevant product market was a broader one,consisting of doryx and all oral tetracyclines prescribed to treat acne and,within this larger market,the district court found that defendants market share was at most only about,an amount insufficient to show that defendants exercised monopoly power the district court stated 
in sum,mylan has failed to produce economically plausible evidence to prove that defendants hold monopoly power in the relevant market.nor has mylan shown that other factors might support finding that defendants exercise monopoly power in the absence of predominant market share 
as an alternative ground,the district court also granted summary judgment to the defendants on both sherman act claims because mylan failed to put forth sufficient evidence of anticompetitive conduct the district court held that defendants did not exclude competition when they made product changes in particular,it found that mylan was free to introduce a generic doryx capsule any time after,but it failed to do so,and that mylan successfully introduced generic,and doryx tablets as the district court observed 
throughout this period,doctors remained free to prescribe generic doryx pharmacists remained free to substitute generics when medically appropriate and patients remained free to ask their doctors and pharmacists for generic versions of the drug 
the district court also concluded that mylan had failed to even attempt to market generic doryx,relying instead on the promotion provided by state automatic substitution laws,and that defendants have no duty to facilitate mylan business plan by keeping older versions of branded doryx on the market.the district court also distinguished a number of key cases dealing with alleged product hops,ultimately concluding that they were procedurally inapplicable 
finally,the court addressed a concern about turning federal courts into innovation sufficiency tribunals,stating 
adoption of mylan theory of anticompetitive product redesign could well have adverse,unintended consequences.any time a pharmaceutical manufacturer changes the formulation of a branded drug and so compels a manufacturer to reformulate or,as in the instant case,formulate for the first time its generic,this could trigger a contest.once the branded drug manufacturer offered a procompetitive justification for the product change that the generic manufacturer could not rebut,courts and juries would have to determine which product changes were sufficiently innovative to justify their anticompetitive effects.mylan has failed to offer an intelligible test of innovation sufficiency,and i doubt that courts could ever fashion one.mylan theory also risks slowing or even stopping pharmaceutical innovation.the prospect of costly and uncertain litigation every time a company reformulates a drug would likely increase costs and discourage manufacturers from seeking to improve existing drugs 
after addressing mylan sherman act claims,the district court also granted defendants motions for summary judgment on mylan claim of tortious interference with prospective contractual relations under pennsylvania law,concluding that the only alleged interference with prospective customers was privileged,in the sense that pennsylvania law permits competitors,in certain circumstances to interfere with others prospective contractual relationships.mylan appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
sherman act.mylan section claims attempted and actual monopolization 
because both the district court and the parties arguments focus heavily on mylan monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under,we will address those claims first 
section of the sherman act makes it unlawful to monopolize,attempt to monopolize,or conspire to monopolize,interstate or international commerce.to support a claim for actual monopolization,a party must prove the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.by contrast,to succeed on a claim of attempted monopolization under,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.
we begin our analysis with the first element of mylan actual monopolization claim under defendants possession of monopoly power in the relevant market.monopoly power can be demonstrated through direct or indirect evidence mylan has provided neither.
direct evidence of monopoly power 
we have previously stated in broadcom qualcomm,that monopoly power is the ability to control prices and exclude competition in a given market.we also stated there that,i f a firm can profitably raise prices without causing competing firms to expand output and drive down prices,that firm has monopoly power,and therefore t he existence of monopoly power may be proven through direct evidence of supracompetitive prices and restricted output.however,we have elsewhere emphasized that direct evidence of monopoly power to prove one claims is only rarely available.and,to support a claim that a defendant set supracompetitive prices through direct evidence,a plaintiff must often provide an analysis of the defendant costs,showing both that the defendant had an abnormally high margin and that the defendant restricted output.
to determine whether mylan has offered the rare form of direct evidence of monopoly power,we must first examine whether the record includes any proof of defendants market power based on supracompetitive pricing or restricted output to support such a claim,mylan relies heavily on its own expert testimony.
here,in noting that mylan failed to establish monopoly power,the district court concluded 
mylan has not made a serious effort to present direct evidence of defendants monopoly power.to begin,mylan offers no evidence of defendants margins for doryx,nor does it explain whether those margins were abnormally high.mylan economic expert,rubenfeld,elected to forego any analysis of defendants margins because,as he opined,other available evidence of monopoly power was more compelling,and margins are difficult to measure and imperfect indicators of market power.rubenfeld nonetheless states that at least some of defendants data suggested a margin of in the second quarter of without explaining whether that figure is abnormally high.regardless of whether or not evidence of defendants marginal and fixed costs was compelling or difficult to measure,it is still required to prove monopoly power directly.mylan has not made such a showing.mylan also fails to show that defendants restricted doryx output to maintain monopoly profits,and fails to discuss the quantity of doryx defendants manufactured during the relevant period.in these circumstances,mylan has not presented plausible direct evidence of market power 
we agree with the district court analysis.we have held that expert testimony in support of summary judgment that contains only general and theoretical observations and which is not tied to evidence in the record can be disregard ed.as the district court correctly observed,mylan expert reports are devoid of any substantiated quantitative analysis showing that defendants maintained high margins or that defendants markedly restricted output.and,to the extent that mylan experts offered any such conclusions,they were largely theoretical in nature.accordingly,mylan has failed to provide direct evidence of monopoly power.
indirect evidence of monopoly power 
the second and more common way that a party may prove monopoly power is by providing indirect evidence,which includes structural evidence of a monopolized market.to support a claim of monopoly power through indirect evidence,mylan must show that defendants had market power in the relevant market and that there were barriers to entry into the market 
proving the existence of monopoly power through indirect evidence requires a definition of the relevant market,and t he scope of the market is a question of fact as to which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.the question in this case,as in others,is whether the relevant market consists only of the defendants product and the plaintiff product,or whether the market comprises products as well.to determine if two products are in the same market,we ask if they are readily substitutable for one another,an inquiry that requires us to assess the reasonable interchangeability of use between a product and its substitute.we also look to their of demand,which is defined as a relationship between two products,usually substitutes for each other,in which a price change for one product affects the price of the other.
here,mylan argues that the relevant market consists of generic doryx and doryx and that,within this market,defendants allegedly maintained of sales until generics entered we reject mylan position and agree with the district court conclusion that the market was much broader and consisted of all oral tetracyclines prescribed to treat acne,a market in which defendants market share never exceeded approximately.
interchangeability 
to define the relevant market,we first consider the extent to which defendants product is interchangeable with alternative products in the field the term i nterchangeability implies that one product is roughly equivalent to another for the use to which it is put.it also means that while there might be some degree of preference for one product over the other,either would work effectively.
as the district court accurately observed 
the record abounds with uncontradicted evidence confirming and reconfirming the interchangeability of doryx with other oral tetracyclines.there is a consensus among dermatologists that all oral tetracyclines treat acne with similar effectiveness and so are interchangeable for that purpose.the fda has approved virtually identical labeling for most of these drugs,stating that in cases of severe acne the drugs may be useful adjunctive therapy.
to further undercut mylan position regarding interchangeability,and consistent with the underlying purpose of hatch waxman and state substitution laws,health insurers and other managed care providers encouraged the widespread substitution of numerous other oral tetracyclines for doryx.as the district court stated 
managed care organizations have sought to constrain patients to substitute doryx with other,less costly tetracyclines to treat acne.some organizations have removed doryx as a reimbursable medication others have limited any reimbursement.a number of managed care organizations sent notices to healthcare providers urging them to substitute other oral tetracyclines for doryx 
clearly,those in the managed care field acknowledged that other,more affordable tetracyclines were fully substitutable for doryx.moreover,products need not be perfectly fungible to be considered reasonably interchangeable for purposes with all of this in view,mylan simply can not escape the conclusion that a high level of product interchangeability existed between doryx and other oral tetracyclines prescribed to treat acne.
ii.of demand 
interchangeability is only one aspect of establishing a relevant antitrust market through indirect evidence.in addition to evidence establishing doryx interchangeability,defendants also point to their own unrebutted expert evidence showing of demand between doryx and other tetracyclines.this indirect evidence,they claim,further suggests that defendants did not maintain monopoly power in the relevant market.
of demand is a measure of the substitutability of products from the point of view of buyers.more technically,it measures the responsiveness of the demand for one product x to changes in the price of a different product y.so,for example,if we were to find that the doryx market consisted,as mylan proposes,only of doryx and its generic counterpart,the of demand between doryx and other oral tetracyclines prescribed to treat acne would be very small,showing that doryx price changes had no effect on patient demand for those drugs.here,as the district court correctly noted,the opposite is true,as the undisputed evidence demonstrates that when defendants increased the price of doryx,its sales decreased and the sales of other oral tetracyclines increased.
more specifically,defendants offered unrebutted expert testimony,including detailed statistical analyses,showing that demand for other generics rose in response to certain of defendants strategic marketing and sales decisions.most convincingly,we view the customer response to the various changes in doryx prescription couponing scheme,which at times made doryx more expensive than generics for consumers,as a strong indication of the existence of in particular,this evidence demonstrated that defendants responded to the market reaction to their prices with sales promotions in an effort to increase their ability to compete with other tetracyclines.it also showed that when defendants increased the price of doryx,its sales decreased,and the sales of other tetracyclines increased.moreover,mylan offered no quantitative analyses to rebut these conclusions,but rather simply relied on its own expert theoretical views on.given that mylan carried the burden of proof in defining the market,its evidence was insufficient to create a jury question in light of defendants showing of of demand.
in sum,given the high degree of interchangeability and demonstrated in the record,we agree with the district court that the relevant market consisted of doryx and other oral tetracyclines prescribed to treat acne.and,within that market,we generally require a plaintiff alleging antitrust injury under section to show that defendants maintained a market share significantly larger than to establish antitrust liability however,defendants market share in the oral tetracycline market was relatively small.it never exceeded.
anticompetitive conduct 
although the district court acknowledged that its finding with respect to monopoly power resolved the monopolization claims,the court went on to address anticompetitiveness because it was necessary to resolve the remaining claims.the district court concluded that defendants product hopping strategy was not anticompetitive.mylan contends that the district court erred in its analysis,specifically with respect to whether defendants product changes barred mylan from taking advantage of state substitution laws.mylan further claims that this case is indistinguishable from the second circuit decision in namenda and that defendants conduct was undoubtedly anticompetitive.we discern no error in the district court conclusion and reject mylan contentions.
we have stated that a nticompetitive conduct may take a variety of forms,but it is generally defined as conduct to obtain or maintain monopoly power as a result of competition on some basis other than the merits.moreover,it is clear that the sherman act directs itself not against conduct which is competitive,even severely so,but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.
in addressing allegations of anticompetitive conduct based on defendants product hops,the district court properly applied the rule of reason framework set forth by the circuit in united states microsoft under that framework,the party seeking to impose liability must initially provide evidence of the anticompetitive nature of a defendant conduct once established,the defendant then has the burden of proffer ing nonpretextual procompetitive justifications for its conduct,and t he plaintiff may then either rebut those justifications or demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm outweighs the procompetitive benefit.in conducting this analysis,we first consider whether mylan produced evidence of defendants anticompetitive conduct.the district court concluded that mylan failed on this front,and we agree while product hopping under certain circumstances may be viewed as anticompetitive conduct,this is not one of those cases.as we explain,mylan was not foreclosed from the market.
doryx capsules were available for more than twenty years,and generic companies were free to engineer their own versions during that time.at least one did,but not mylan moreover,the record demonstrates that mylan received days of exclusive rights to market and sell its and tablets once approved,giving mylan a significant leg up on generic competitors.and the undisputed evidence shows that mylan set its tablet prices higher than the price of branded doryx for at least some period of time.finally,it is clear that mylan reaped generous profits from its sale of the generic tablet,in the amount of million.thus,far from being harmed by defendants product changes,mylan was advantaged in the generic market by its day exclusivity period and ability to profit generously while raising prices.in sum,we agree with the district court that mylan failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating that defendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct prohibited by the sherman act,thereby failing on the first prong of the microsoft test 
but even if we were to assume that the first prong of the test was met,defendants have offered strong evidence of purposes for their various product changes.first,it is clear from the record that doxycycline capsules had been linked with esophageal problems.the capsule version of the drug was ultimately banned in france and sweden,and defendants faced a products liability lawsuit in michigan regarding the same problems.second,the record clearly demonstrates that doryx experienced stability problems,which in resulted in a largescale recall of doryx capsules.third,defendants introduced different dosages for doryx largely in response to the actions of their competitors.for instance,defendants offered evidence that their decision to introduce the tablet was in response to the fact that both adoxa and solodyn,tetracyclines prescribed to treat acne,were offered in a variety of dosages.defendants also offered evidence of a justification when they proposed the scoring modifications an ability for consumers to more effectively at levels.
we are also cognizant of the second circuit reasoning in namenda,which mylan relies on heavily in its briefs.however,we find namenda to be factually and procedurally distinguishable from this case.
in namenda,which was decided a few weeks after the district court decision in this case,the second circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiff,the state of new york,forcing the defendants,drug manufacturers,to keep an old version of namenda ir,a prescription drug used to treat dementia,on the market for a period of time before introducing the new drug namenda xr namenda involved the defendants attempts to avoid a patent cliff the end of patent exclusivity,corresponding to the brand drug loss of market share by stringing together new periods of patent exclusivity in order to completely bar generics from entering the market.it was alleged that the defendants did so by introducing changes to their product to delay the expiration of their patent 
here,there were no patent cliffs on the horizon,and the evidence demonstrates that there were plenty of other competitors already in the oral tetracycline market.moreover,as defendants correctly note in their brief,a lawyer for the state of new york in namenda specifically stated that mylan case against the defendants here,pending at the time,was distinguishable from new york theory in namenda echoing this sentiment,the namenda court itself also persuasively distinguished this case,citing it as an example of a situation in which there was no evidence of consumer coercion,because generics had already entered the market at the time of defendants product reformulation.perhaps more importantly,the second circuit decisi
