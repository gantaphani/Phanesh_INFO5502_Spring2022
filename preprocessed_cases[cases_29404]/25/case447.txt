becton,dickinson and company becton appeals from the district court denial of becton motion to modify the district court damages award following the partially successful appeal of the infringement judgment on which the award was based.retractable,becton,dickinson,cv led rsp,wl,opinion.because the mandate rule forecloses the relief that becton seeks,we affirm.
background 
in,retractable technologies,retractable sued becton in the eastern district of texas,alleging that becton ml and ml integra syringes infringed various claims of retractable patents.retractable,becton,dickinson.becton had commercially launched its ml syringe in march and the ml syringe in may.at trial,retractable presented its theory that infringement began in and that a hypothetical negotiation at that time would have resulted in a lump sum payment of approximately million for a license to practice the patents in any type or number of syringes,granting becton freedom to operate.id.becton countered with a lost profits theory that would have retractable recovery limited to approximately million based on the sales of the ml and ml syringes,the vast majority of which were the ml syringe.alternatively,becton argued that a reasonable royalty would have been no more than approximately million.id.at.the jury ultimately found that both the ml and ml syringes infringed.the jury verdict form included a number of interrogatories,including interrogatory 
if you have found that any of bd becton accused devices infringe any of the asserted claims of any of the,then even if you have answered yes to any portion of interrogatory through regarding invalidity,please determine the amount of reasonable royalty damages that would fairly and adequately compensate rti retractable for infringement.
the jury responded.the district court subsequently entered a final judgment in retractable favor and a permanent injunction against the continued sale of both syringes.
becton appealed the infringement and validity determinations to this court but neither appealed nor requested a remand of the damages determination in the event the infringement or validity determinations were upset in any way.becton,at.becton simply requested that this court reverse the judgment or,in the alternative,order a new trial on infringement invalidity.in that appeal,we concluded that the district court misconstrued one claim term.as a consequence,we held as a matter of law that the ml syringe could not infringe the asserted claims.therefore,we reversed the district court judgment that the ml syringe infringed.becton,at.but we affirmed the judgment that the ml syringe infringed and that the claim at issue was not invalid.id.having no basis for a new trial on infringement or invalidity,no remand was ordered.see id.
becton subsequently requested the district court to modify the permanent injunction and the damages award in light of this court decision.becton used.b as its vehicle for filing the motion,a rule under which the court may relieve a party from a final judgment when the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable becton also argued that independent of rule b,modification was necessary to conform the judgment to this court mandate,contending that the injunction and the damages award must be adjusted to reflect the fact that the ml syringe is the only remaining infringing product.retractable consented to modification of the permanent injunction to exclude from its scope the ml syringe,and the district court so ordered,concluding that its broad equitable powers allowed it to prospectively modify that injunction.opinion at.however,the district court concluded that the mandate rule precluded it from revisiting the damages issue because it was within the scope of the original judgment and was not raised in the prior appeal nor remanded to the district court for reconsideration.id.

iii.analysis 
becton argues that this court mandate,reversing the infringement verdict for the ml but not the ml syringe,required the district court to conduct new damages proceedings because the original judgment is inconsistent with that mandate.becton further argues that the issue of damages attributable only to the ml syringe was not within this court mandate because it was not and could not have been considered previously.to the extent the damages issue was within the mandate,becton argues that the district court erred by declining to apply an exception to the mandate rule in cases of a substantial change in the evidence.lastly,becton argues that it did not waive the argument over damages by failing to raise it in the previous appeal because it contends that before the court mandate,becton had no argument that the damages award itself was erroneous.
retractable responds that the damages award,based on interrogatory,is not inconsistent with this court mandate.retractable further argues that the damages issue is within the court mandate because becton could have and should have raised this issue in the previous appeal.retractable further argues that there has not been a substantial change in the evidence that would warrant an exception to the mandate rule.retractable also argues that rule b can not be used to support becton requested relief.
becton first argument,that the damages award is inconsistent with the mandate,puts the cart before the horse.considering that argument requires reconsideration of the damages award itself,which is possible only if the mandate rule allows revisiting the question,does not apply,or can be avoided by an exception.becton further contends that this court mandate actually requires the district court to conduct further proceedings on damages to determine the effect of the reversal on any damages award.we disagree.
becton relies on verizon servs.vonage holdings.in that case,the court reversed a finding of infringement under one of three asserted patents and,though neither party briefed the issue,remanded to the district court to further consider the damages issue in light of that partial reversal.verizon remarked that where the jury rendered a single verdict on damages,without breaking down the damages attributable to each patent,the normal rule would require a new trial as to damages.id.see also ntp,research in motion,remanding for further consideration of damages in light of a partial reversal and a general verdict accentra,staples,app x,same.but verizon,ntp,and accentra were all cases in which our court specifically remanded the question of damages to the district court,either because we were requested to do so or determined sua sponte under the circumstances before us that such action was appropriate.the cases do not stand for the proposition that the district court is required,let alone permitted,to revisit damages in the absence of a reversal or remand of a damages determination within a judgment of invalidity or infringement appealed to this court.while this court regularly issues remands when requested and appropriate,or on our own initiative if some but not all products are found on appeal not to infringe,there is no normal rule giving district courts the authority to regularly revisit or recalculate damages that fall within our mandate.
becton current substantive argument that the damages award must be revisited if either one of the two products at issue are found not to infringe could have and should have been raised in the previous appeal.becton conceded at oral argument that in a single sentence in the previous appeal it could have raised the issue of remanding the damages issue.see oral argument at,retractable,becton dickinson,available at if we could go back in time,we add a portion of a sentence asking to vacate the damages award,or could we wish that remand was a word that was at the end of the court opinion,the answer is obviously for sure.instead,becton not only made no effort to raise the issue,i
