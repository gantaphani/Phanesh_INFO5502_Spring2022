it has long fallen within the province of states to safeguard the health and safety of their citizens.see medtronic lohr,d.consonant with the historic primacy of state regulation of these matters,see medtronic,at,the power of states to govern in this field is considerable and undisputed.see metropolitan life ins.massachusetts,d the states traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,limbs,health,comfort,and quiet of all persons.quoting cases,wall.thorpe rutland burlington.historically,common law liability has formed the bedrock of state regulation,and common law tort claims have been described as a critical component of the states traditional ability to protect the health and safety of their citizens.cipollone liggett group,d blackmun,concurring in part and dissenting in part.in recent years,some states,in exercising their traditional authority with respect to the pharmaceutical industry,have narrowed common law liability in order to insulate drug companies from burdensome litigation.see generally david owen,special defenses in modern products liability law.the case before us concerns a supposed conflict between federal law and the products liability regime of one such state.
in,the state of michigan enacted legislation immunizing drugmakers from products liability claims so long as the food and drug administration fda approved the pharmaceutical product at issue.see.comp.laws hereinafter.michigan immunity scheme contains an exception that preserves liability if the pharmaceutical company withheld or misrepresented information that would have altered the fda decision to approve the drug.in,in a case dealing with different legal rules and a different jurisdiction,the supreme court held that state claims were impliedly preempted by federal law.buckman plaintiffs legal,d.the question presented by this appeal is whether,under the rationale of buckman,federal law also preempts traditional common law claims that survive a state legislative narrowing of common law liability through a fraud exception to that statutory limitation.for the reasons below,we conclude that federal law does not preempt these state claims.we therefore vacate the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
michigan immunity statute 
prior to its amendment in,michigan products liability statute provided that evidence showing compliance with governmental or industry standards was admissible in a products liability action in determining if the standard of care had been met.taylor smithkline beecham.in describing the law,the supreme court of michigan emphasized the limits on the probative value of this sort of evidence of compliance 
we note that our legislature has recently enacted a statute which provides that industrial and governmental standards are admissible in products liability actions citing earlier version of.the statute does not provide that such standards are conclusive.we affirm the position that compliance with governmental and industrial standards is admissible as evidence but is not conclusive as to whether the defendant was negligent or the product was defective.
in,michigan legislature amended the law in order to confer immunity upon drugmakers in product liability suits where the fda had approved the drug in question.see taylor,at the amendment of the statute provided that compliance with federal governmental standards established by the fda is conclusive on the issue of due care for drugs.the relevant provision states 
in a product liability action against a manufacturer or seller,a product that is a drug is not defective or unreasonably dangerous,and the manufacturer or seller is not liable,if the drug was approved for safety and efficacy by the united states food and drug administration,and the drug and its labeling were in compliance with the united states food and drug administration approval at the time the drug left the control of the manufacturer or seller.
in addition to several qualifications not relevant to the case before us the immunity provision contains an important exception 
this subsection does not apply if the defendant at any time before the event that allegedly caused the injury does any of the following 
a intentionally withholds from or misrepresents to the united states food and drug administration information concerning the drug that is required to be submitted under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act and the drug would not have been approved,or the united states food and drug administration would have withdrawn approval for the drug if the information were accurately submitted.
a internal citations omitted.hence,under these provisions,so long as a drug company did not withhold or misrepresent information that would have affected the fda approval of a putatively harmful drug,the company can successfully defend itself against products liability litigation by establishing that its product received the fda approval and complied with the fda labeling and substantive requirements.
procedural history 
appellants in this case are all michigan residents alleging injuries caused by rezulin,a drug marketed and sold by appellees for the treatment of diabetes.the fda originally approved rezulin in.after adverse effects were documented in patients taking rezulin,appellees agreed to a series of label changes,which were authorized by the fda on four occasions between november and june.in march,apparently at the fda request,see desiano,cir,appellees withdrew rezulin from the united states market.
the instant litigation began in state courts in michigan and california.appellants asserted various common law claims including,inter alia,breach of implied and express warranties,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,negligence per se,fraud,defective design,defective manufacturing,and loss of consortium.the drug companies removed the actions to federal court,and all of the claims were subsequently consolidated and transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to judge lewis kaplan in the southern district of new york.
in the district court,appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that liability was foreclosed under michigan state law.to support their motion,appellees emphasized buckman and the sixth circuit decision in garcia,cir,which held on the basis of buckman that the fraud exception in michigan statute was impliedly preempted by two federal food,drug and cosmetic act fdca,et,and the medical device act mda,b a b and therefore had to be severed from the rest of the michigan law.
the district court agreed with appellees,concluding that the immunity exception should be severed because under the reasoning of buckman,it was preempted by federal law the court gave two reasons for its decision.first,the district court believed that,although it was not absolutely bound by garcia,the sixth circuit reasoning was owed quite substantial deference under factors,pro arts,cir,a decision by a panel of this circuit which stated that conclusive deference should be given to a federal court of appeals interpretation of the law of a state within its circuit.second,apart from factors,the district court reasoned that i f plaintiffs covered by the michigan statute were able to litigate claims of fraud on the fda in individual personal injury suits,whether in state courts or in federal courts,the potential would exist for the fda personnel to be drawn into those controversies on a basis over and over again.concluding that this would generate a wholly impractical situation,the court held that the exception in the michigan statute is preempted,except where the plaintiff relies on a finding by the fda,or in an action brought by the fda,of material fraud in the new drug approval process absent which approval would not have been granted.hence,the court granted the drugmakers motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed all of appellants complaints.
appellants filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a suit pursuant to a motion for judgment on the pleadings.see king am.airlines,cir burnette carothers,cir.in deciding a rule c motion,we apply the same standard as that applicable to a motion under rule b,accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.burnette,at.
this appeal raises two separate and significant questions.first,under the rule in factors,must we follow our sister circuit holding in garcia because the sixth circuit decision involved the laws of michigan,a state within its circuit second,even if we are not required to defer conclusively to garcia,should we nonetheless conclude,applying the logic of buckman,that appellants common law by michigan with,and are therefore preempted by,federal law 
the district court interpreted factors to mean that,although it was not absolutely bound by the sixth circuit ruling,garcia was owed substantial deference.appellees advocate an interpretation of factors that insists upon more than deference.they contend that,under factors,we are not free to reach a conclusion contrary to garcia unless a different result is compelled by prior or subsequent pronouncements of the supreme court of michigan.for their part,appellants do not identify any contrary michigan law to refute the garcia court decision that federal law preempts michigan immunity exception as a result,appellees maintain that garcia binds us to dismiss appellants suit.appellees may be correct in their reading of factors,when it applies.but like the district court they misgauge the relevance of factors to the case before us.
factors involved a contract dispute governed exclusively by tennessee state law.in that context,we held that a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction should give conclusive deference to a ruling by a court of appeals deciding the law of a state within its circuit.factors,at.we elaborated that conclusive deference was owed except in very narrow circumstances 
we need not and do not conclude that the state law holding of the pertinent court of appeals is automatically binding upon the federal courts of all the other circuits.the ultimate source for state law adjudication in diversity cases is the law as established by the constitution,statutes,or authoritative court decisions of the state.a federal court in another circuit would be obliged to disregard a state law holding by the pertinent court of appeals if persuaded that the holding had been superseded by a later pronouncement from state legislative or judicial sources,or that prior state court decisions had been inadvertently overlooked by the pertinent court of appeals.
factors,at internal citation omitted.because neither of these circumstances applied to the sister circuit,the court of appeals decision had not been weakened by subsequent developments in state law,nor was the decision contrary to prior state factors court mandated deference 
where,as here,the pertinent court of appeals has essayed its own prediction of the course of state law on a question of first impression within that state,the federal courts of other circuits should defer to that holding,perhaps always,and at least in all situations except the rare instance when it can be said with conviction that the pertinent court of appeals has disregarded clear signals emanating from the state highest court pointing toward a different rule.
factors,at.
but factors instructed us to defer conclusively to another circuit judgment only when that court of appeals decision addressed questions of state law from a state within that circuit.it asserted no obligation to defer to a foreign circuit views on federal law.as to issues of federal law,we are,reach our own conclusions.see pan am.world airways,cir w e are not bound by the decision or the rationale of another circuit court.see also colby penney,cir we have an intermediate obligation to our sister federal courts of appeals.bearing in mind the interest in maintaining a reasonable uniformity of federal law and in sparing the supreme court the burden of taking cases merely to resolve conflicts between circuits,we give most respectful consideration to the decisions of the other courts of appeals and follow them whenever we can.our district judges should,of course,do likewise with regard to such decisions but neither this court nor the district courts of this circuit give the decisions of other courts of appeals automatic deference we recognize that,within reason,the parties to cases before us are entitled to our independent judgment.internal citation omitted.
this obligation does not change in the context of transferred cases.in menowitz brown,cir per curiam,we considered securities fraud claims that had been consolidated and transferred to the southern district of new york only to be dismissed as untimely under our circuit limitations guidelines.one set of claims,however,had originally been filed in the southern district of florida and would have been timely under the statute of limitations applicable under the eleventh circuit rule which would have borrowed florida blue sky limitations period.thus,the question presented was whether second circuit doctrine directs application of the eleventh circuit limitations rule to such a transferred action.menowitz,at.we stated that r esolution of this question turns on whether the choice of the applicable limitations period is properly understood as a matter of state or of federal law.id.were it an issue of state law,we indicated that a transferee court applies the substantive state law,including rules,of the jurisdiction in which the action was filed.id.but since we concluded that the proper statute of limitations applicable to a federal claim was a matter of federal law,we disregarded the eleventh circuit approach to the federal issue and opted instead to follow our own.in so doing,we emphasized that,even in the transfer context,a court of appeals must develop its own circuit law on federal questions it can not mechanically adopt the reasoning and conclusions of its sister circuits 
we have previously held that a transferee federal court should apply its interpretations of federal law,not the constructions of federal law of the transferor circuit f ederal courts comprise a single system applying a single body of law,and no litigant has a right to have the interpretation of one federal court rather than that of another determine his case 
u ntil the supreme court speaks,the federal circuit courts are under duties to arrive at their own determinations of the merits of federal questions presented to them i f a federal court simply accepts the interpretation of another circuit without independently addressing the merits,it is not doing its job.
id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the problem,therefore,with the district court decision and with the position taken by appellees is that both fail to appreciate that this the tennessee contract dispute in not governed primarily,and certainly not exclusively,by state law.rather,the question of whether federal law impliedly preempts part of michigan statutory scheme depends on significant issues of federal law including,inter alia,the meaning of supreme court precedents,buckman,and the scope of federal statutes,fdca.as a result,in resolving this appeal,we operate under twin mandates with respect to the sixth circuit opinion in garcia.on the one hand,under factors,we are bound to follow garcia conclusions as to questions of michigan state law.on the other hand,under menowitz,we are obligated to answer independently questions of federal law,applying only the usual intercircuit regard for the sixth circuit analysis of these federal issues.
accordingly,the central question presented by this,whether federal law preempts michigan immunity controlled by the decision in garcia only to the extent that the sixth circuit conclusion rested solely on findings as to state law.garcia did begin with an explanation of state law 
presents a somewhat different legal regime from the one invalidated in buckman.the michigan legislature has provided a general immunity for drug manufacturers with a specific exception for circumstances involving,inter alia,fraud on the fda rather than a specific cause of action for fraud on the fda.
garcia,at internal footnote omitted.under factors,therefore,we must accept the sixth circuit conclusion that does not create a new cause of action for misleading the fda.and that holding guides our review of the federal issues before us 
after issuing this interpretation of,the sixth circuit turned to issues of federal law.and,on the basis of its understanding of the supreme court decision in buckman,the sixth circuit concluded that the difference it had just those preexisting common law claims that survived and those arising under a specific cause of action for,like those invalidated in immaterial.see garcia,at as the michigan district court properly found,buckman teaches that state tort remedies requiring proof of fraud committed against the fda are foreclosed since federal law preempts such claims.
nothing in factors requires that we adopt the sixth circuit reading of buckman.on the contrary,because garcia conclusions as to preemption depended on its analysis of federal and not state law,we must decide for ourselves whether michigan surviving common law cause of action is implicitly preempted by federal law under the rationale of buckman.it is to this question that we,therefore,now turn.
in buckman,the supreme court considered whether federal,the fdca and the state claims.the plaintiffs in buckman contended that a medical device manufacturer had obtained fda approval for its product only after making fraudulent misrepresentations to the federal agency.claiming that the fda would not have approved the device but for these misrepresentations,the plaintiffs sought damages under california state law.the court began by stating what is undoubtedly true that p olicing fraud against federal agencies is hardly a field which the states have traditionally occupied.buckman,at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.as a result,the presumption against federal preemption of a state law cause of action did not apply to claims.id.
in the absence of any presumption against preemption,the court found that claims conflicted with,and were therefore impliedly preempted by,federal law.the conflict stems from the fact that the federal statutory scheme amply empowers the fda to punish and deter fraud against the administration,and that this authority is used by the administration to achieve a somewhat delicate balance of statutory objectives.id.at.in other words,policing fraud on the fda through a tort action could interfere with how the fda might wish to police that kind of fraud itself.
the buckman court went on to express its concern that the potential conflict between federal law and the competing regulatory regimes of states would unduly burden drug companies seeking to obtain fda approval for their products.the supreme court worried that these companies,fearful of state liability,would file a deluge of information that the fda does not require,thereby burdening the federal agency as well.id.at.but the court ended by emphasizing that the plaintiffs claims before it were not rooted in traditional state law,and were instead derivative of federal law 
in sum,were plaintiffs to maintain their claims here,they would not be relying on traditional state tort law which had predated the federal enactments in questions.on the contrary,the existence of federal enactments is a critical element in their case.
id.at.for these reasons,the court invalidated the plaintiffs claims as impliedly preempted by federal law.
echoing the conclusion of the sixth circuit,appellees argue that,notwithstanding garcia statement that did not create a specific cause of action for fraud on the fda,garcia,at,there is no meaningful difference between the claims struck down in buckman and appellants claims under michigan tort law.we disagree.there are three differences between the nature of the claim which exempts from abolition and the claim in buckman.given the bases of buckman holding,each of these is crucial.
presumption against preemption 
first,the presumption against federal preemption of state law obtains in the case before us.in medtronic,the supreme court explained that because the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.medtronic,at.in buckman,the court held that this presumption did not apply because p olicing fraud against federal agencies is hardly a field which the states have traditionally occupied.buckman,at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
in the case before us,instead,the cause of action which survives the changes made by can not reasonably be characterized as a state attempt to police fraud against the fda.and,significantly,garcia did not so characterize it.rather,as garcia recognized,did not invent new causes of action premised on fraud against the fda.the object of the legislative scheme was rather to regulate and restrict when victims could continue to recover under preexisting state products liability law 
the michigan legislature desire to rein in tort liability falls squarely within its prerogative to regulat e matters of health and safety,which is a sphere in which the presumption against preemption applies,indeed,stands at its strongest.see buckman,at.citing medtronic,at.as governing situations implicating federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,and contrasting these to the case before it.as a result,while there may be reasons to override that presumption,the existence of the presumption in the instant case requires an altogether different analysis from that made in buckman 
traditional common law liability 
second,appellants here are not pressing claims,as the plaintiffs in buckman were understood by the supreme court to be doing.they are,rather,asserting claims that sound in traditional state tort law.in buckman,the supreme court mentioned two characteristics of preempted claims that distinguish them from claims sounding in preexisting common law.
the buckman court suggested that the source and vintage of the duty the drug maker is accused of breaching in claims is different from the source and vintage of the duty that obtains in traditional tort claims.on this basis,the buckman court distinguished the plaintiff unpreempted claims in silkwood,d,from those before it and wrote silkwood claim was not based on any sort of theory,but on traditional state tort law principles of the duty of care owed by the producer of plutonium fuel pins to an employee working in its plant.buckman,at.
significantly,all of the claims advanced by appellants in this case are premised on traditional duties between a product manufacturer and michigan consumers.none of them derives from,or is based on,a duty between a manufacturer and a federal agency.as a result,were we to conclude that appellants claims were preempted,we would be holding that congress,without any explicit expression of intent,should nonetheless be taken to have modified and,in effect,gutted traditional state law duties between pharmaceutical companies and their consumers.we see no reason,nor can we identify any precedent,to justify such a result 
the second difference between common law actions and claims,suggested in buckman,is that in cases,proof of fraud against the fda is alone sufficient to impose liability.in buckman,there were no freestanding allegations of wrongdoing apart from the defendant purported failure to comply with fda disclosure requirements.and buckman explicitly distinguished medtronic on this ground.medtronic,the buckman court said,involved a negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective product 
t he medtronic claims arose from the manufacturer alleged failure to use reasonable care in the production of the product,not solely from the violation of fdca requirements.in the present case,however,the fraud claims exist solely by virtue of the fdca disclosure requirements.thus,although medtronic can be read to allow certain causes of actions that parallel federal safety requirements,it does not and can not
