this is a case involving the prescription drug baycol,a medication.the case comes to us after the district court granted bayer motion for summary judgment on flesner claims for strict liability,negligence,express and implied warranty,and unjust enrichment.on appeal,our decision focuses on whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that flesner failed to present competent expert testimony on medical causation,requiring entry of summary judgment.we also address whether the district court abused its discretion in striking,as untimely,flesner supplemental expert report.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court on both issues.

after bayer withdrew baycol from the market,plaintiffs throughout the country commenced lawsuits asserting various claims,including strict liability,negligence,breach of express and implied warranty,medical monitoring,and unjust enrichment.due to the number of lawsuits initiated,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated plaintiffs cases in the district of minnesota under.see in re baycol prods.liab,d.among those plaintiffs is appellant,david flesner.

flesner experience with statins began in november when brandon prescribed zocor,and later provachol,after diagnosing flesner with high cholesterol.in february,after weighing the risks and benefits associated with the medication,brandon prescribed baycol to flesner.on march,flesner complained to miller about general body fatigue and pain,with specific complaints of severe pain in his lower back,hips,and legs.during the same month,flesner requested that brandon renew his baycol prescription.brandon complied.
flesner continued to express concern about muscle pain to miller though may.in late may,flesner complained in a note to brandon about pain in his lower back and groin and dark red blood in his urine.brandon informed flesner that a kidney stone was the likely cause of these symptoms.flesner continued to complain to his doctors about this pain through june and july.
in august,after taking baycol for nearly five months,flesner discontinued his use of baycol after reading in a newspaper article that bayer had withdrawn baycol from the market.continuing to experience muscle pain and fatigue,flesner sent a letter to brandon in which he hypothesized that baycol was causing his symptoms.on august,brandon performed a blood test,which indicated that flesner creatine kinase ck levels were slightly above ck level was up to is considered normal.brandon informed flesner that his elevated ck level was consistent with flesner suspicion that baycol was the cause of his symptoms,but that a ny pains related to baycol should have long passed.since discontinuing baycol treatment,flesner has had four ck tests,three of which have been outside of the normal range.
in july,flesner filed suit in the southern district of california,alleging that,due to inadequate warnings,baycol caused the various symptoms he suffered and continues to suffer.he asserted five claims under california law strict liability negligence breach of express warranty breach of implied warranty and unjust enrichment.
as a part of the consolidated baycol litigation,flesner case was transferred from the southern district of california to the district of minnesota.bayer subsequently brought a number of motions to exclude expert testimony.see generally,in re baycol prods,d.as it pertains to flesner,the district court barred plaintiffs experts samuel mayer and stephen raskin from testifying that baycol was more toxic than other statins.id.at.in addition,the district court barred mayer from testifying as to baycol effects.id.at.finally,the court barred raskin from testifying as to the sufficiency of the baycol warning label.id.at.
three weeks after the district court daubert opinion,seven months after mayer deposition,and nearly a year after the deadline for submission of discovery,flesner submitted a supplemental expert report from mayer.bayer filed a motion to strike mayer supplemental report as untimely.the district court granted the motion to strike,finding that flesner could not show good cause for the late submission and that bayer would be prejudiced by the admission of mayer supplemental report.in the same opinion,the district court granted bayer motion for summary judgment on each of flesner claims.flesner appeals both of these rulings.we affirm.
district courts have broad discretion in establishing and enforcing deadlines and in maintaining compliance with discovery and pretrial orders.see marmo tyson fresh meats,cir.we review a district court ruling only for clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.wegener johnson,cir.in this case,there is no question that mayer supplemental report was submitted the report nearly a year after the deadline.the question is whether he was justified in doing so.
flesner only proffered reason for the delay was that mayer reviewed the records of flesner in greater detail.this explanation is insufficient,as there is nothing in the record to indicate that mayer could not have reviewed flesner records in detail at the time of his initial report.see id.at plaintiff failure to exercise due diligence with respect to her expert review of relevant medical records does not substantially justify her untimely disclosure.in addition,it is not unreasonable to conclude that bayer would be prejudiced by flesner late submission,given that bayer had already deposed mayer and moved for summary judgment based on his initial report and deposition.see marmo,at accord trost trek bicycle,cir stating that because defendant had prepared its summary judgment motion,in part,on initial disclosure of testimony,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding plaintiff untimely disclosed expert.for these reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion.
