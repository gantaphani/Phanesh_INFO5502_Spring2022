the noble pursuit of curative technologies birthed visudyne,a drug that treats the leading cause of vision loss in people over age fifty.that success involved the efforts of multiple institutions,and the common drive for financial returns now brings us a dispute over rights to the income stream of the fastest growing ophthalmic drug in history.
the entire range of claims articulated by was dismissed by the district court on summary judgment.the bulk of the opinion that follows consists of our de novo review of these dismissals.we must also address of several rulings.following a review of the factual background,considered in the light most favorable to the appellant,we will begin our analysis.
factual background 
macular degeneration 
macular degeneration amd is an ocular disease that is the predominant cause of vision loss in people over age fifty.the illness takes two forms wet and dry.the wet form,though only accounting for ten percent of the cases of macular degeneration,leads to the debilitating condition known as choroidal neovascularization cnv or neovasculature,responsible for ninety percent of cases of amd vision loss.neovasculature refers to conditions characterized by the proliferation of unwanted blood vessels.
in,several researchers at massachusetts general hospital mgh wellman laboratories of photomedicine began investigating the use of photosensitive drugs to treat eye diseases such as amd involving neovasculature.in march,the mgh researchers met with julia levy of appellee qlt phototherapeutic qlt to discuss the possibility of utilizing benzoporphin derivatives bpd or derivatives developed by qlt for the treatment of amd.levy agreed to provide mgh the bpd needed for research trials.
the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary meei or the infirmary,a medical institution located next to,but distinct from,mgh,also sought out qlt bpd for photodynamic therapy research.joan miller joined the infirmary in the fall of and soon proposed conducting studies using bpd on monkeys.in march,miller applied to meei to investigate the use of bpd to treat neovasculature.pursuant to miller application,meei and qlt signed a material transfer agreement mta in which meei would receive bpd at no cost in exchange for providing qlt the results of miller studies for use in qlt regulatory filings and patent disclosures.
in september,following their successful monkey trials,which demonstrated the potential use of photodynamic therapy with bpd,miller and her meei colleague,gragoudas,presented their data confidentially to qlt representatives visiting boston.within the next two years,meei and qlt entered into two more material transfer agreements of similar tenor.
confidential disclosure agreement 
qlt had interest in commercial applications of the infirmary experimental monkey trials and,in may,qlt and miller entered into a confidential disclosure agreement cda.as part of this agreement,qlt promised not to use the confidential information for any purpose other than the evaluation of products under the terms of this agreement and to maintain confidential information in confidence.the parties agreed that misuse or improper disclosure of confidential information would irreparably harm the business of the disclosing party or that party affiliates.pursuant to the cda,miller continued to provide meei confidential research results to qlt,including results of meei research not funded by qlt.
in july,at miller request,qlt agreed to fund further experiments by the infirmary involving the treatment of neovasculature in monkeys with the derivatives.the results of these studies,as well as other studies not funded by qlt,were shared with qlt in november,in a report entitled the preclinical pharmacology study for macular degeneration bolus study.
qlt partnership with ciba vision 
in late,qlt contacted the company ciba to commercialize the use of photodynamic therapies with bpd to treat macular degeneration.qlt provided ciba vision with meei confidential research results without first informing meei.in february,ciba vision sought full access to miller research results to pursue a high potential opportunity.qlt agreed to share with ciba vision the plans and results of our ocular programme,which included miller research.
miller learned of qlt negotiations with ciba vision in the spring of.in march,she expressed concern about the confidentiality of meei research results to julia levy and edwin levy of qlt,who assured her that qlt had not disclosed and would not disclose in the future any of meei trade secret information.miller then flew to switzerland to get ciba vision excited in the technology,but during that meeting,and subsequent meetings with ciba vision representatives in july and october of she presented only summaries of her research.
on may,ciba vision and qlt executed a letter of intent to enter into a strategic partnership for commercializing the use of photodynamic therapy to treat neovasculature arising from macular degeneration.the letter recognized that qlt had significant evidence some of which came from miller the success of the therapy for this application.the letter indicated that e ach party will manage the patent portfolio in collaboration with the other party.qlt announced the partnership to the public and meei announced that 
researchers at meei in boston are participating in a joint worldwide project with qlt and ciba to develop photodynamic therapy,a potential treatment for certain eye diseases.infirmary researchers,since,have performed studies,in collaboration with wellman laboratories,using benzoprophin derivative bpd,a proprietary drug developed by qlt.
clinical trials testing the treatment on humans began in,and the infirmary was one of several sites performing the trials under a written agreement with qlt.meei was paid more than one million dollars for participation in the trials and for the resulting clinical data.
on february,qlt and ciba vision signed a definitive agreement to pursue worldwide joint development and commercialization of therapy for the treatment of choroidal neovasculature.the partnership aimed to obtain fda approval for its treatment,tradenamed visudyne,in april.sales outside the united states began in,and visudyne received fda approval in april.as of february,over two hundred twenty million dollars worth of visudyne had been sold worldwide.
patent applications 
prior to qlt partnering with ciba vision,in march,miller approached qlt about pursuing a patent application for the treatment.qlt agreed and suggested that kate murashige,its patent attorney,prepare the application.relying on information provided by miller,murashige prepared a patent application with serial number the application and filed it on march.the claimed invention applied to methods for treating choroidal neovasculature with photodynamic therapy using bpd the named inventors included only meei miller and gragoudas and another meei employee,lucy young.
even though it was not claiming of the application,qlt confirmed that it would pay for the preparation of the application.murashige told meei that qlt does not see itself as a participant in the invention other than as a supplier of the material bpd,and the assignment would be entirely to meei.
within months of the filing,however,qlt changed its approach to the patent strategy.on behalf of qlt,murashige proposed to meei that the application could be improved upon by modifying the scope of the patent claims.murashige argued that it would strengthen the application to include methods of treating cnv with therapy using liposomal formulations of bpd.since qlt levy and the mgh inventors had contributed to the invention of this form of treatment,the addition of these claims to the application would make them.qlt appreciated the legal significance of the amplification of inventorship in the application.jennifer,qlt counsel,wrote to ciba vision that 
at the time the invention was made,there was no contractual agreement in place whereby qlt would be entitled to ownership of the invention.therefore qlt claims ownership only through julia levy if levy were not an inventor,qlt would have no rights to the patent.
thus,murashige convened the three,meei,and requested that meei and mgh retain their own patent counsel.
implementing the proposal entailed a application,with serial number the application.at the same time,murashige removed from the applications those claims directed to methods of treating unwanted choroidal neovasculature with photodynamic therapy using the benzoporhin derivatives.those claims were joined to the application.
after receiving assurances that meei would receive fair compensation for its contributions,the meei inventors consented to the changes,and murashige filed the application on february.meei miller and gragoudas executed a combined declaration of inventorship and power of attorney for application,affirming that they were joint inventors along with the others of those inventions claimed in the application.miller and gragoudas maintained that they signed the declaration of inventorship and power of attorney with the expectation that the proper inventorship would be determined once final claims were allowed,and in consideration for qlt express promise that meei would be compensated appropriately for miller and gragoudas contributions through a license agreement.
on august,the application issued as patent the patent.miller and gragoudas assigned their rights as inventors to the infirmary,and hasan and assigned their rights to mgh.levy assigned her rights to qlt.among the assignees of the inventorship of the patent,qlt is distinguished by its ownership of the patents on the benzoporphin derivatives integral to the invented treatment.this ownership means that qlt alone can independently exploit the rights of the patent.
licensing negotiations 
in december,qlt had signed a letter of intent to negotiate exclusive licenses of meei and mgh rights in any patent that issued from the pending application.such a license would prevent mgh or meei from licensing their rights under a patent issuing from the application to a competitor of qlt.according to the letter,qlt does intend to negotiate in good faith with and other assignees to come to an agreement on reasonable terms and royalty rates which will be consistent with industry standards under similar circumstances.in the same letter,qlt indicated its intent to negotiate with the for an option to license the technology which is the subject of the application.negotiations would commence,according to qlt,once a patent issued and the feasibility of the invention was proven.
meei responded in february that the letter of intent is insufficient in that it does not address the issue of how the infirmary will participate in the licensing or transferring of meei technology by qlt to third parties.meei also accused qlt of entering into an agreement with ciba vision using,in part,technology that was developed at the infirmary.meei concluded,if that is untrue,please advise us.if that is true,our position is that the infirmary should be a party to that agreement as well as any future agreements relative to that technology.qlt did not respond to this letter.
the above narrative anticipates the disposition of the,as the picture we have painted includes information that qlt wished never to disclose because qlt has challenged a number of evidentiary rulings,we must explain which evidence we find properly before us.
qlt contends that the district court erroneously ordered the production of certain communications with murashige and other attorneys of her firm.the district court found that qlt met its burden of establishing the prima facie applicability of the privilege to the communications in question.see.eye ear infirmary qlt phototherapeutics,d,accepting report and recommendation of discovery master.such communications are privileged unless an,the.the party challenging the privilege carries the burden of establishing that any communications are discoverable.fdic ogden,cir.the exception permits a party access to his communications with the shared counsel.the district court held that the exception applied,within a specified time frame and as to certain matters,thereby granting,in part,meei motion for production of certain documents.eye ear infirmary,d at.
we disturb a district court discovery management only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice,that is,where the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.mack great atl.pac.tea,cir.qlt invites us to conduct a plenary review of the relevant orders,arguing that whether an exception to the privilege applies is a question of law that deserves de novo review,citing cavallaro united states,cir.the authority qlt cites,however,specifies only that the formulation of the doctrine should be reviewed de novo.id.emphasis added.the application of properly formulated doctrine to the facts remains a matter of discretion for the district court.id.
the discovery master spelled out meei burden as follows 
meei must first establish that meei shared an relationship with morrison foerster murashige law firm on the following matters the preparation and prosecution of the application which issued as the patent the preparation and prosecution of the application which issued as the patent the licensing of the patent and the licensing of the patent.
eye ear infirmary,d at.qlt asserts that the discovery master inquiry was inadequate as a matter of law because meei not only had to show that meei and qlt were joint clients of morrison foerster,but that,in addition,they shared an identical or nearly identical legal interest as opposed to a merely similar interest.ogden,at.qlt argues that murashige legal work for meei and qlt regarding the matters was not directed toward a nearly identical legal interest.absent converging interests,parties who shared an attorney ought not have access to their counsel communications with the other party.
it is peculiar to address this question first as it inevitably requires reaching into the merits we have yet to discuss.but the district court had to do so,as must we.the irony that the ensuing discovery shows just how polarized the two parties interests may already have been is not material to the inquiry.a joint relationship remains intact until it is expressly terminated or until circumstances arise that readily imply to all the joint clients that the relationship is over.ogden,at.the rules of discovery therefore do not insulate from discovery the communications of a duplicitous party who feigns common interest while scheming otherwise with a shared,trusted advisor.
we agree,for the reasons elaborated in the master recommendation,d at,that qlt and meei were joint clients of morrison foerster during at least part of murashige representation of the parties for two of the four matters advanced by meei prosecution of the and applications.federal patent law shapes and limits the scope of joint inventors interest in the successful prosecution of a patent.until an event affirmatively terminates the relationship of parties relying on the same attorney for that prosecution,or otherwise readily impl ies that the relationship is over,as a matter of law,the joint relationship endures.behind the scenes machinations adverse to the joint client are not necessarily determinative.id.at.
the district court found an endpoint to status as of october,
there is no evidence in the record that meei and qlt joint relationship with morrison foerster for the preparation and prosecution of the application,or for the preparation and prosecution of the application,was expressly terminated.
however,in a letter dated october,meei informed qlt that meei had filed in the pto a continuation patent application of the application.from the record,it is clear that neither qlt nor morrison foerster was involved in the preparation or prosecution of the continuation patent application.thus,at least as of october,both meei and qlt understood that their respective legal interests in the patent were no longer the same,or nearly the same,legal interest.
it is less clear when meei and qlt respective legal interests in the patent were no longer the same,or nearly the same,legal interest however,at least as of october,both meei and qlt understood that their respective legal interests in the patent were no longer the same,or nearly the same,legal interest.
eye ear infirmary,d at.
qlt does not disagree,but instead raises as an alternative argument in its appeal that,if it shared a common interest with meei,the common interest would have terminated more than a year earlier,at the latest on july.on that date,meei contested,by letter,qlt and mgh role in the invention.the letter from meei patent attorney,edmund pitcher,to murashige,expressed meei view that the entirety of the subject matter of the allowed claims is the invention of meei personnel only,and that neither levy of qlt,nor hasan or schmidt of mgh made any inventive contribution.pitcher noted that levy presence on the application places meei in the uncomfortable position of being dependent on the fairness of qlt,despite its directly adverse economic interest,in the negotiation of a license agreement.the letter included the demand that qlt 
make a concrete license proposal immediately file a continuation application to permit correction of the named inventors.if the infirmary and qlt can not come to an agreement on a reasonable royalty rate and other financial terms,we are instructed to assume responsibility for prosecution of patent applications covering subject matter invented without the involvement of levy so as to try to preserve meei rights.
qlt responded to the district court order with a motion to amend order as to date of termination of common interest,in which qlt,for further support,drew on letters and memoranda written by murashige and employees from qlt and ciba vision subsequent to meei july letter.in qlt motion,qlt argued that meei letter implied to qlt that it no longer shared the same interest in the successful prosecution of the application,as meei was threatening to pursue an alternative and conflicting avenue for realizing federal protection for its invention.thus,qlt contended that as a matter of fact,as a result of meei july,letter,qlt appreciated that qlt and meei no longer shared a common interest in successfully prosecuting the claimed inventions in the application.
the discovery master denied the motion to move the date of termination of interest forward,finding,in essence,that meei conflicting interest was only conditional.that is to say,meei shared qlt interest in the successful prosecution of the application so long as a reasonable royalty rate was in the cards.meei argues that it was merely exploring other possibilities of protecting its rights in the event that qlt did not live up to its promises once the patent issued,when it filed the application.the discovery master discussed how the letters and memoranda qlt offered supported this interpretation.a memorandum drafted by jennifer,of qlt,to the vision joint coordinating committee,dated october,stated that the director of intellectual property for meei,carl finn,has indicated that if qlt were willing to negotiate a satisfactory license agreement for the patent,that meei would not pursue the inventorship issue.the master read 
the memorandum to show that qlt understood that meei remained interested in the successful prosecution of the application.thus,contrary to qlt assertions,the memorandum does not show that qlt implied,from the pitcher letter and the finn letter,that meei was no longer interested in the successful prosecution of the application.
may,slip op.at 
we believe that whether the exception expires upon the implication that a party has a conditionally adverse interest of the sort at issue here is a question of law over which we should exercise de novo review.the question is whether a party has an identical or nearly identical legal interest with another when they share a nearly identical interest with regard to one successful prosecution of the depends on a condition that pits the parties against each,negotiation of a license on agreeable terms.we believe that it does.our view is that the district court correctly focused on the continuing joint representation of the parties by murashige as to the application.insomuch as meei hoped to license its rights to the application to qlt,its objective depended upon that application successful prosecution.the fact that one potential outcome,announced by meei in the july,letter,would render its interests in the application contrary to qlt did not of its own force terminate their joint representation as to the prosecution of that application.rather,it begs the factual question of whether murashige ceased to represent meei interests as to that prosecution.the discovery master noted that in a november,letter from of qlt to meei,qlt indicated that it was willing to put aside the argument over inventorship in favor of settling upon an arrangement whereby the participants in the neovasculature project would derive a benefit from their contributions.this letter also proposed a meeting date between murashige and mgh employees,ciba vision employees,qlt employees,and meei employees.the discovery master concluded that this letter continues to show that qlt did not readily infer,from meei letter by pitcher and finn,that meei was no longer interested in the successful prosecution of the application and,as a result,that meei and qlt no longer shared the same,or nearly the same,legal interest,in the application.accordingly,qlt motion to amend the date of the termination of the joint interest was denied.the district court correctly framed the exception,and we find that it was within its discretion in requiring disclosure of communications between qlt and murashige of morrison foerster relating to the prosecution of the and applications up until october.
iii.meei appeal 
the pivotal moment that shapes nearly all of meei claims involves the filing of the application,which added julia levy of qlt and and hasan of mgh as inventors on the patent.in the course of that switch in patent strategy,qlt made numerous assurances to meei that it would license meei patent rights on reasonable terms.this case is before us because no licensing agreement was ever reached.meei claims that it was injured by this failure,and further harmed by qlt unlawful disclosure of meei trade secrets.
contract claims 
breach of contract 
the parties disagreement regarding the existence of an enforceable contract is a legal one,and so this court reviews the question of contract formation de novo.coady ashcraft gerel,cir.the district court determined that the parties failed to reach an agreement whose terms were sufficiently determinate to constitute a binding contract.meei counters that the district court erred in failing to recognize that a valid contract could include terms defined by industry standards.while there are surely some contracts in which a crucial term could be sufficiently defined by pegging it to industry standards,we agree with the district court conclusion that there is insufficient evidence in the record to find that the parties had reached a meeting of the minds.see,lucey hero intern,finding that a n agreement to enter into a contract which leaves the terms of that contract for future negotiation is too indefinite to be enforced quoting cygan megathlin.
meei has also claimed breach of contract with regard to the may confidential disclosure agreement signed by qlt and miller.we agree with the district court that meei was not a party to this agreement and that there is no evidence that miller was acting as an agent of meei.furthermore,meei does not fall within the limited class of third party beneficiaries who can enforce a contract to which they are not a party.under massachusetts law,in order for a third party to enforce a contract,i t must appear from the language and circumstances of the contract that the parties to the contract clear ly and definite ly intended the beneficiaries to benefit from the promised performance.miller mooney,quoting anderson fox hill vill.homeowners.nothing in the language of the confidential disclosure agreement indicates that meei was meant to be either a party or a third party beneficiary.qlt was listed as a party,and a vice president of the company signed for qlt.in contrast,miller signed only in her personal capacity without reference to meei.furthermore,the mere fact that meei would likely benefit from such an agreement does not,by itself,show that meei was an intended rather than an incidental beneficiary.see miller,at citing restatement of contracts.thus,meei can not pursue a claim for breach of contract as a third party beneficiary based on the confidential disclosure agreement.
breach of implied contract 
we construe meei breach of implied contract claim to be a claim of contract rather than contract.although both causes of action exist in massachusetts,meei has argued principally that it reached an actual,enforceable agreement with qlt that was implied by the dealings of the two parties.meei oriented arguments will be addressed in this court analysis of the unjust enrichment claim.see richard lord,williston on contracts ed.
a contract implied in fact requires the same elements as an express contract and differs only in the method of expressing mutual assent.william meade fletcher et,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations perm.ed.vol.thus,meei implied contract claim fails for the same reason we have rejected its express contract to reach agreement on the basic terms of the contract.in the prototypical implied contract case,the terms are already sufficiently clear,and the court looks to the actions of the parties only to determine whether their actions indicate that they,in fact,agreed on those terms.however,in this case,where the terms proposed by each side remain at odds,searching the actions of the parties for indicia of consent becomes a fruitless exercise.without agreement on the essential terms of the agreement,meei implied contract claim gets no further than does its express contract claim.
breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
having concluded that no contract exists,there can be no derivative implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing applicable to these parties.under massachusetts law,t he covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract.uno,boston kenmore realty.the covenant may not,however,create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship,as the purpose of the covenant is to guarantee that the parties remain faithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the parties in their performance.id.in other words,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing governs conduct of parties after they have entered into a contract without a contract,there is no covenant to be breached.where,as here,the parties have not yet reached a binding agreement,there is no duty to negotiate in good faith.see levenson realty,rejecting the argument that where defendant stopped short of binding himself to a contract he nevertheless had a duty to negotiate the terms in good faith.
conversion and misrepresentation claims 
conversion 
meei claims that qlt converted meei intellectual property rights in the invention of the photodynamic therapy by causing meei to file a joint patent application with mgh and qlt so that a patent issued would name employees of all these institutions as inventors.conversion requires the exercise of dominion or control over the personal property of another.third bank of hampden cty.cont l ins.however,meei agreed to the filing of the joint patent application.from the moment qlt became a of the patent,it too had full and equal rights to exploit the patented intellectual property.under a more refined statement of massachusetts law,only a defendant that wrongfully exercises acts of ownership has committed conversion.in re halmar,cir emphasis added internal citation omitted.since qlt jointly owned the property at issue and since it did nothing to prevent meei from exercising its own rights in the property,qlt did not wrongfully exercise acts of ownership,and thus,no conversion occurred.hence,it is unnecessary for us to address the district court analysis of whether intangible property,such as patent rights,can be the subject of a conversion claim.
misrepresentation 
meei claims that qlt falsely represented to meei that meei would be adequately compensated for its role in the inventions included in the patent.in order to succeed on its misrepresentation claims,meei must show that qlt did not intend to comply with these representations at the time they were made.see doyle hasbro,cir plaintiffs must allege that the statement was knowingly false that defendants made the false statement with the intent to deceive that the statement was material to the plaintiffs decision that the plaintiffs reasonably relied on the statement and that the plaintiffs were injured as a result of their reliance citations omitted.since meei does not provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to draw this conclusion,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
meei motion to amend 
we review the denial of a motion to amend under rule a for an abuse of discretion,and we defer to the district court if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.steir girl scouts of the usa,cir internal quotations omitted.in the instant case,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying meei motion to amend its complaint concerning its unjust enrichment claim and to include a claim of promissory estoppel.
meei made its motion to amend more than two years after filing the complaint,after the court had entered summary judgment for qlt on counts of meei complaint and the parties had fully briefed summary judgment arguments on the remaining four counts.where the motion to amend is filed after the opposing party has timely moved for summary judgment,a plaintiff is required to show substantial and convincing evidence to justify a belated attempt to amend a complaint.id.quoting resolution trust gold,cir.the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that meei has failed to meet its burden of showing some valid reason for its neglect and delay.hilton int l of puerto rico,cir internal quotations omitted.although the summary judgment motions already filed necessarily did not apply to meei newly proposed promissory estoppel theory,given the undue delay in raising this theory,the district court acted within its discretion in denying meei motion to amend.
unjust enrichment 
the district court believed that meei unjust enrichment claim distill ed into a disagreement over the inventorship in the patent.based on that premise,the district court reasoned that meei could not use a massachusetts unjust enrichment claim to circumvent federal patent law,and accordingly,granted summary judgment to qlt.we find,however,that the district court misinterpreted meei unjust enrichment claim,and in light of our interpretation of the claim,we find summary judgment inappropriate.
while the proper inventorship of either the application or the application is indeed a question of federal law,the question of which application to prosecute was a choice available to the parties.under the patent scheme,inventors have discretion to articulate the scope of their patent claims.donald chisum,chisum on patents,at an applicant may present more than one claim and is afforded reasonable latitude in varying the scope and terminology with which he defines his invention.meei original application primary claim involved three main green methods a method to treat conditions of the eye characterized by unwanted neovasculature claim a method to treat pigmented tumors in the eye claim and a method to observe the condition of blood vessels in the eye claim.the three methods had much in common each claim involved administering green porphyrin,which would then localize in the blood vessels in the eye the diagnostic method simply involved observing the vessels,and the two treatment methods involved irradiating the neovasculature or tumor with light.furthermore,each method had an associated but separate claim that specified that said green porphyrin is contained in a liposomal preparation claims,and.based on these claims,murashige explained in march that qlt does not see itself as a participant in the invention other than as a supplier of the material bpd.
in december,murashige suggested substantially changing the scope and inventorship of the application.first,she recommended spinning off the diagnostic method as a separate patent which would be properly assignable solely to meei.second,she recommended combining the separately stated methods for treatment of neovasculature claim and treatment of pigmented tumors claim into a single method.the goal was to be able to claim treating conditions of the eye more broadly,expand the scope of the patent.in order to do this,however,it was necessary to introduce the limitation of using the green porphyrin in a liposomal composition.to this end,murashige proposed a modified claim that claimed administering green porphyrin in a liposomal composition.as murashige acknowledged,that is substantially the same as claim in the original case except that the limitation of using a liposomal composition has been included.
murashige explained the significance of this proposal.on the one hand,by broadening claim to claim treating conditions of the eye more broadly,the patent,if granted,would have potentially broader coverage than contemplated earlier.but the only way to justify these broad claims was to introduce the limitation of using the green porphyrin in a liposomal composition,which,murashige explained,was a liberating device,allowing us to claim more broadly.
however,this change to claim broadened not just coverage of potential eye treatments,but also the list of inventors.murashige explained that if we include conditions of the eye generally using liposomal compositions,a larger circle of inventors would be included both because of this greater breadth and by virtue of the necessity to supply the green porphyrin in liposomes.it then appears that the inventorship would properly include julia levy in other words,the very aspect of the application that was a liberating device,allowing the inventors to claim more broadly also happened to be the aspect of the revised application that would require adding levy as an inventor.conversely,had liposomal preparations not been claimed at all,arguably the patent would be less valuable,but levy might not be an inventor.adding levy,of course,would give qlt full rights to exploit the patent.thus,qlt presented meei with a second viable formulation of its patent application it asked meei to change the scope of its patent application to qlt benefit in exchange for fair compensation 
meei already possessed a valid,and seemingly defensible,patent application,when qlt sought meei assent to replace the application with the application qlt acknowledged that the patent as meei envisioned it without levy and her claims would be difficult to challenge on grounds of either obviousness or noninventorship.nevertheless,qlt argued that the patent could be made some ways both broader and more changing the scope of the patent and adding the additional inventors who participated in the new claims.the addition of qlt inventor levy,however,would drastically reduce meei potential profits from the patent.if meei agreed to the application with the additional inventors,qlt would no longer need a license in order to commercialize the therapy that became known as visudyne.since qlt already owned the other required patent for the necessary bpd,qlt inclusion in the new application enabled it to commercially exploit visudyne without meei.we note that qlt was,of course,well aware that securing would put it in this uniquely lucrative position,and it was qlt attorney,murashige,who,acting also as patent counsel to meei,spearheaded the effort to convince meei to go along with the application.
not surprisingly,meei did not initially agree with this new approach proposed by qlt.attorney murashige nevertheless prepared the application,and meei eventually assented after being promised fair compensation for its contribution.of course,meei and qlt never came to an agreement on the critical compensation figures,and it is for that reason that we have affirmed summary judgment for qlt on meei contract claims.this inadequate meeting of the minds does not,however,call for summary judgment in the context of unjust enrichment.a claim of unjust enrichment is appropriate where an agreement is too indefinite to be enforced or where no contract is made because each of the parties had a materially different understanding of the terms.corbin on contracts,b.unjust enrichment provides an equitable stopgap for occasional inadequacies in contractual remedies at law by mandating that a person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.fox f j gattozzi,quoting restatement of restitution.although qlt continued reassurances that it would pay meei royalty rates consistent with industry standards were not specific enough to support meei contract claims,they form a key component of meei unjust enrichment claim and present a triable issue of fact 
furthermore,this analysis of meei unjust enrichment claim illustrates why it was not preempted by federal patent law.meei claim is not that levy was not a proper inventor of the patent,but rather that qlt induced meei to agree to the change in scope of the claims,and then unjustly profited from that change by denying fair compensation.in these circumstances,conflict preemption,not the broader field preemption,is appropriate.see hunter douglas,harmonic design.under the conflict preemption standard,if the tort action is based on conduct that is not protected or governed by federal patent law,then the remedy is not preempted.id.at compare of,am.cyanamid,independent state law inventorship standards frustrate basic objectives of patent law and thus entire field of inventorship is preempted with id.at unjust enrichment claim preempted only because it hinge d on a determination of inventorship.
qlt argues that meei claims are preempted by,which reads in the absence of any agreement to the contrary,each of the joint owners of a patent may make,use,offer to sell,or sell the patented invention within the united states,or import the patented invention into the united states,without the consent of and without accounting to the other owners.emphasis added.qlt contends that creates a federal right to practice an invention without fear of suit by,preempts state law claims between on the basis of anything other than a written contract,effectively represents a congressional determination that any asserted wrong by one against another is not unjust unless it violates such a contract.
we recognize that the preemption issue here is close.it is true that allowing meei claim to proceed would,to some extent,impinge upon qlt rights as a.however,the statute itself admits of an exception to those rights when there is any agreement to the contrary.qlt suggests that this exception only applies where there is a written,legally enforceable contract.but says no such thing.congress knew how to insist upon a contract,and even how to specify that it must be reduced to writing.holding that patent rights are assignable in law by an instrument in writing emphasis added.however,simply speaks of any agreement.meei has provided evidence of an agreement with qlt in which qlt promised to negotiate in good faith with meei to come to an agreement on reasonable terms and royalty rates which will be consistent with industry standards under similar circumstances.we have held,supra part,that this agreement was not enforceable as a contract,because the terms are too indefinite.however,if the determines that there was such an agreement,it might still qualify as an agreement under,and therefore form the basis for equitable relief on a theory of unjust enrichment without presenting any conflict with the allegedly preempting statute.
we also note that,while there is no direct precedent concerning preemption under,we may draw analogies from other situations where patent law preemption has been alleged.
first,there is precedent suggesting that a state law action alleging that the defendant secretly filed and received a patent for the plaintiff invention,and requesting monetary or equitable relief but not a change to the patent itself,is not preempted.see becher contoure.holmes,burns.inst.of,cir aldrich,laning ribbon carbon paper,cir action to determine title to assigned patent rights under state law is not preempted kleinerman snitzer.zemba rodgers,see also corpus juris patents i n the absence of any agreement to the contrary,each of the joint owners of a patent may make,use,offer to sell,or sell the patented invention unless such profits accrue after a joint owner has procured an assignment of his coowner interest to himself by fraud.emphasis added footnotes omitted citing zemba.
here,the allegation is that the defendant manipulated the plaintiff into agreeing to change the scope of the patent so as to include contributions made by the defendant.meei has not provided evidence that qlt alleged conduct was actually fraudulent.however,arguably,the case for preemption here is weaker than in the cited cases.in the cited cases,the plaintiff struck at the heart of inventorship by arguing essentially that the patent was applied for fraudulently and never should have issued.here,the plaintiff argues that the defendant induced plaintiff to agree to a certain scope of invention in exchange for compensation,and then provided none.
we also draw an analogy from the doctrine of inequitable conduct before the patent and trademarks office pto courts have distinguished state claims alleging bad faith misconduct by the applicant against the are state claims alleging bad faith misconduct occurring subsequently in the are not.see,methode elecs,finding that an unjust enrichment claim alleging bad faith misconduct by the applicant against the pto was preempted because its fundamental premise was incorrect inventorship,but making the distinction described above,and emphasizing that the focal point of the instant case is methode conduct before the pto and not conduct subsequent to the pto proceedings.the reason for this distinction is instructive claims of inequitable conduct before the pto are preempted because pto procedures themselves provided a remedy for an applicant malfeasance.an additional state action would be an inappropriate collateral intrusion on the regulatory procedures of the pto,under the guise of a complaint sounding in tort and is contrary to congress preemptive regulation in the area of patent law.abbott labs.brennan,internal citations omitted.in other words,state claims alleging misconduct before the pto are preempted because federal law contains a specific remedy for just such misconduct.even then,not all state claims that implicate the issue of inequitable conduct before the pto are preempted.see dow chem.exxon,state law tort claim for intentional interference with contractual relations that implicates patent law issue of inequitable conduct before pto is not preempted by federal patent law,even if it requires state court to adjudicate question of federal patent law,provided state law cause of action includes additional elements not found in federal patent law cause of action and is not impermissible attempt to offer protection to subject matter addressed by federal law.
again,this precedent is not directly on point.the distinction cited above is between state claims alleging misconduct by an applicant against the pto which are usually,if not always,preempted,and claims alleging misconduct between parties after the patent has issued.here,the claim is misconduct by an applicant against a before the application is completed.but misconduct between parties before the patent issues is more analogous to misconduct between parties after the patent issues than it is to misconduct by a party against the pto.
finally,we note that qlt position,while it has the advantage of creating an easily manageable rule,could lead to injustices that congress did not intend.purely as a hypothetical,imagine a case where the evidence clearly showed that the defendant deceived and manipulated a naive inventor into modifying the scope of the inventor application within the range of properly patentable applications so as to force the inclusion of the defendant as a.further suppose that the defendant deflected all requests for a legally enforceable licensing contract with empty assurances of future agreements which it never intended to fulfill.we can not imagine that congress intended,simply by enacting the phrase i n the absence of any agreement to the contrary,to preclude the from establishing such an agreement within the framework of an equitable cause of action under state law.conflict preemption applies only when there is such a direct conflict between the patent code and state law that compliance with both the patent law and state law is a physical impossibility,or the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress in enacting the federal statute.cover hydramatic packing,quoting gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d.we do not find such a direct conflict here,and while the present case differs from the hypothetical,the differences lie in the facts and equities,not the law of preemption.
for all these reasons,meei unjust enrichment claim is not preempted.
we also find that meei unjust enrichment claim should survive summary judgment based on the allegations of qlt misuse of confidential information.under massachusetts law,a constructive trust is imposed to avoid the unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of the other where information confidentially given or acquired was used to the advantage of the recipient at the expense of the one who disclosed the information.mass cash register,comtrex,quoting john alden transp.arnold bloom.the facts underlying this theory will be laid out in the course of our subsequent trade secret claim analysis 
trade secret and unfair trade practices claims 
the right to control how research is used and who is privy to trade secrets is crucial to protecting the economic interests of research institutions like meei,just as it is essential to businesses.without the ability to guard their own data,there would be fewer incentives for institutions like meei to engage in this type of research.the allegations before this court are that qlt was entrusted with the result of meei research and breached that trust,primarily by sharing information with its partner ciba vision without authorization from meei.we now consider whether the district court correctly found that these claims were brought by meei after the statute of limitations had already run.
misappropriation of trade secrets 
meei claims that qlt misappropriated its trade secrets without meei knowledge,in particular,by disclosing certain research results to qlt eventual partner,ciba vision.meei argues that the district court erred in concluding that meei trade secret claim was time barred by the statute of limitations for tort actions because,under massachusetts law,the statute should have been tolled.
massachusetts law establishes two avenues by which the statute of limitations that would ordinarily apply to meei trade secret claims can be tolled.the massachusetts common law discovery rule provides that the statute of limitations is tolled until a plaintiff knows,or reasonably should have known,that it has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant conduct.taygeta varian.the appropriate standard to be applied when assessing knowledge or notice is that of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position.id.citing riley presnell.thus,under massachusetts discovery rule,the question before the district court was when meei actually knew or should have known of qlt misappropriations of its trade secrets.
massachusetts statutory law also grants a reprieve from the statute of limitations when a potential defendant fraudulently conceals the basis for a cause of action 
if a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it,the period prior to the discovery of his cause of action by the person so entitled shall be excluded in determining the time limited for the commencement of the action.
laws ch.under this law,the statute of limitations will be tolled if the wrongdoer either concealed the existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act done with intent to deceive or breached a fiduciary duty of full disclosure.stark advanced magnetics,quotations and citations omitted.the statute of limitations,however,is not tolled if the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to his cause of action.id.
the district court made short work of meei trade secrets claims by finding that meei had actual knowledge of its claims more than three years before bringing this suit on april.since the district court concluded that there were sufficient facts to prove meei knowledge of its claims,it did not need to go any further in analyzing the tolling of the trade secret claims under either the common law discovery rule or the fraudulent concealment statute.however,we must evaluate the district court factual conclusions to determine whether they supported summary judgment.
review of district court summary judgment decision 
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.since genuine issues of material fact remain concerning meei knowledge of qlt misappropriations of its trade that could bring meei claims within the statute of find that the court erred in granting summary judgment on meei trade secret claims.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,and we read the record in the light most amicable to the party contesting summary judgment.cambridge plating napco,cir reversing the district court grant of summary judgment because material facts remained at issue where plaintiff knew it had been harmed,but could not attribute it with certainty to defendant actions.considered in the light most favorable to meei,neither the facts singled out by the district court,nor the record as a whole,suffice to support the district court conclusion that meei had knowledge of trade secret misappropriations.the district court based its conclusion on,inter alia,meei awareness of qlt partnership with ciba vision,miller statements that she was concerned about the confidentiality of her work,and miller learning from ciba vision that some of her data had been shared without her permission.however,it is not enough to show that miller was suspicious about what qlt might have disclosed.suspicion and knowledge are poles apart on a continuum of understanding,and the massachusetts fraudulent concealment statute itself uses the unqualified word knowledge in setting forth the prescribed state of a plaintiff perception.tracerlab,indus.nucleonics,cir.we will address the question of meei admitted knowledge of some disclosures below.
the district court seems to have given little weight to meei claims that qlt repeatedly reassured miller that it was not disclosing any confidential information.rather,the district court found that in a letter to qlt,meei indicated that it was already aware of its trade secrets cause of action the letter stated in part,w e believe that you may have already entered into an agreement with a third party using,in part,technology that was developed here at the infirmary.if that is untrue,please so advise us.qlt never responded to the letter.in our view,this letter demonstrates only that meei was aware of qlt business relationship with ciba vision and about the potential for trade secret misappropriation existing in that relationship.the letter makes no precise accusations and gives no indication that meei was aware of particular instances of misappropriation.
applying massachusetts tolling law 
we have held that the massachusetts court does not equate suspicion with knowledge,but is explicit in requiring actual knowledge,or,as an equivalent,full means of detecting the fraud.id.internal quotation omitted.the district court rejected meei reliance on tracerlab,because it found that the letter,among other evidence,showed that meei actually believed it had a cause of action for trade secret misappropriation.the district court believed that plaintiffs clearly had more knowledge of qlt misappropriations than the plaintiffs had in tracerlab,where the court found that the plaintiff belief was based on gossamer threads of speculation,suspicion and surmise.id.at.
however,we find tracerlab instructive.as in this case,the plaintiffs in tracerlab knew that the defendants possessed the trade secrets in question.id.at there is no question but that the plaintiff was aware from the beginning that the defendants knew plaintiff trade secrets because they were former employees of the plaintiff.furthermore,in tracerlab,the court found that the plaintiff was well aware from the very outset that the defendants had gone into the same field and were producing a competitive product.id.at.still,in that case,we found that all of this is a far different thing from having knowledge that the defendant had misappropriated and was using the trade secrets underl ying the present cause of action.id.moreover,unlike most trade secret cases,during much of the time in question in this case,use of meei trade secrets by data recipients like ciba vision would still have remained behind closed doors,as product development was not yet complete.therefore,meei was even less likely to become aware of any unauthorized disclosures.
although the massachusetts legislature has set statutory limitations periods for various causes of action,determining when claims accrue has long been the product of judicial interpretation.cambridge plating,at quoting franklin albert.massachusetts courts have recognized that it would be unfair to begin running the statute of limitations before a plaintiff is put on notice that she has a claim.id.citing bowen eli lilly.
although it is true that t he plaintiff need not know the full extent of the injury before the statute starts to run,bowen,at emphasis added,the district court incorrectly expanded this principle to find that meei need not know the full extent of its claim.eye ear infirmary qlt phototherapeutics,at,sealed memorandum in support of summary judgment.this is not a case in which meei claims only that it did not know how much it had been harmed rather,meei claims that it did not know that it had been harmed at all.
meei awareness of some of qlt misappropriations 
in order for the statute of limitations to start to run,an event or events must have occurred that are reasonably likely to have put the plaintiff on notice that he has been harmed.stark,at citing bowen,at.we do not believe that in a complex case of this trade secrets of varying importance are alleged to have been divulged over a period of notice of one misappropriation can constitute sufficient notice to begin tolling the statute for all misappropriations.although we are not prepared to state a general rule,in a case such as this one,a wronged party should not be prejudiced with regards to later torts committed against it,simply because a defendant started the clock running by committing similar acts at an earlier time.statutes of limitations provide necessary closure and fairness for potential defendants.however,a plaintiff must be able to decide when the harms it has sustained require bringing suit,and no defendant should be able to immunize itself from later,potentially graver claims,by openly engaging in prior,similar offenses that the future plaintiff does not believe warrant bringing suit.
meei has not denied knowledge of some of qlt alleged trade secrets misappropriations.the record does not,however,indicate that meei knew of all,or substantially all,such misappropriations.furthermore,meei claims are strengthened by the existence of the confidentiality agreement and qlt repeated assurances that its trade secrets were not being disclosed.to assume that meei knew the full extent of disclosure to ciba vision would be to assume that meei was already aware that it was on the verge of being cut out of any future profits from the newly developed photodynamic therapy.though this may be the
