invitrogen corporation appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the district of delaware holding that invitrogen falsely marked certain of its molecular biology products.clontech,invitrogen,d.because the evidence does not support the court finding that the relevant tests put invitrogen on clear notice that certain products were not covered by the patents used to mark those products,we,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this appeal arises from a lawsuit filed by clontech laboratories,incorporated clontech against invitrogen corporation invitrogen formerly life technologies,incorporated alleging,inter alia,false marking under.the patents involved in the suit all claim priority to patent application,which was filed on january.the application was continued as patent application,filed march,which issued as patent the patent.the application was divided,giving rise to patent application,filed january,which issued as patent the patent.the application was continued as patent application,filed march,and was again continued as patent application,filed march,which issued as patent the patent.the application was continued as patent application,filed february,which issued as patent the patent.
all four patents share the same title cloned genes encoding reverse transcriptase lacking rnase h activity.the claims in all four patents are generally directed to rnase h deficient reverse transcriptase rt polypeptides,see,the patent claim,the patent claim polynucleotides encoding rt polypeptides,see,the patent claim,the patent claim,the patent claim methods of using rts to prepare dna molecules,see,the patent claim,the patent claim and kits for preparing dna molecules using rts,see,the patent claim,the patent claim.
invitrogen markets rnase h deficient rts known as superscript ss and superscript ii ssii.d at.ss and ssii are virally derived rts either missing sequences important for rnase h activity,ss,or containing point mutations in regions of the rt coding sequence important for rnase h activity,ssii.id.invitrogen also produces and sells kits containing ssii as well as a wide variety of cdna libraries purportedly made using ssii.id.ss and ssii have been marked with all four patents.id.at.in addition,the kits containing ssii and the many cdna libraries have been marked with some of the patents at issue.see at.
below,the parties disputed whether invitrogen ss,ssii,kits,and cdna library products were falsely marked.in particular,the parties contested whether the patents at issue covered invitrogen many cdna library products and whether the kits and superscript products failed to meet the substantially no rnase h activity limitation of this family of patents,see,the patent claim,the patent claims and,the patent claims,and,and the alternative language of the most recent family member,the patent,see,claim substantially reduced rnase h activity,claim no detectable rnase h activity,claim does not significantly degrade an mrna template,claim no detectable rnase h activity.
the trial court held that invitrogen ss,ssii,kits,and cdna library products had been falsely marked with the patents in suit.d at.the trial court determined that n one of invitrogen patents in suit are directed to cdna libraries,id.at,and that the claim limitation substantially no rnase h activity,as used in this family of patents,was defined in the written description.id.at.specifically,the court concluded that the written description defines substantially no rnase h activity in terms of an assay that measures how active a nearly pure population of rt polypeptides is at cutting rna

interpreting,the trial court placed the burden on clontech to prove four elements a marking importing that an object is patented falsely affixed to an unpatented article with intent to deceive the public.d at.then the court considered these elements in light of evidence pertaining to invitrogen products and patents as well as several rnase h activity experiments performed over the life of this patent family by the inventors and other invitrogen scientists and experts.id.at.the evidence included experimental results from solubilization and gel assays performed in,and.id.at.in contrast to the earlier experiments,the experiments were performed using the solubilization assay defined in the written description for the express purpose of determining whether invitrogen ss and ssii meet the limitation of substantially no rnase h activity.deciding that the experiments were dispositive,the court found that a t the very least,these tests put invitrogen on notice that its products were not covered by the patents in suit and any good faith belief that invitrogen had that its products were covered by the patents was lost.id.at.the court reasoned that after this notice,invitrogen failure to correct its mistaken mismarking of its products rose to the level of deceptive intent.id.accordingly,the court held invitrogen liable for falsely marking its products in violation of.
invitrogen appeals,arguing that the trial court miscomprehended the legal standard applicable to the element of intent to deceive,committed clear factual error in interpreting the results of the experiments,and erred by interpreting as prohibiting marking where the patent does not cover the product at issue.clontech responds,arguing that the trial court applied the correct legal standards and did not err in its interpretation of the test results.we have jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to a and a.
we begin with the statute in suit,which provides that 
whoever marks upon,or affixes to,or uses in advertising in connection with any unpatented article,the word patent or any word or number importing that the same is patented for the purpose of deceiving the public s hall be fined not more than for every such offense.
the case law of this circuit on the statute in suit is sparse.in fact,only one precedent has substantively addressed the statute,and in that case,we affirmed,without discussion of the text of the statute,the trial court holding that no violation of the statute had occurred because the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence of intent to deceive the public.arcadia mach.tool,sturm,ruger.consequently,this case presents us with virtually an issue of first impression.
the statute supplies a civil fine for false marking of articles.id.at.according to the statute,when an unpatented article is marked with the word patent or any word or number that imports that the article is patented,and such marking is for the purpose of deceiving the public,the fine is invoked.when the statute refers to an unpatented article the statute means that the article in question is not covered by at least one claim of each patent with which the article is marked.thus,in order to determine if an article is unpatented for purposes of section,it must be first determined whether the claims of a patent cover the article in question.to make that determination,the claim in question must be interpreted to ascertain its correct scope,and then it must be ascertained if the claim reads on the article in question.
assuming an article is mismarked as patented because the claims of the cited patent do not read on the article,the question arises whether more is required by way of proof to establish that the mismarking is for the purpose of deceiving the public.that is,should the statute be read to cause all actual mismarking to be subject to the civil fine 
this question has been addressed and answered in other circuits.for example,the court of appeals for the first circuit long ago interpreted a predecessor statute in london everett dunbar corporation,cir.the earlier statute outlawed marking an unpatented article with the word patent for the purpose of deceiving the public.the first circuit recognized,even then,that interpreting claims is not an exact science,and that consequently where one has an honest,though mistaken,belief that upon a proper construction of the patent it covers the article which he marks,the requisite intent to deceive the public would not be shown.id.at.years later,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit adopted the formulation that an honest,though mistaken,mismarking of an article would not trigger liability under the statute.see brose sears,roebuck and,cir.
we see no reason to interpret the statute differently to render it a statute of strict liability for mismarking.intent to deceive is a state of mind arising when a party acts with sufficient knowledge that what it is saying is not so and consequently that the recipient of its saying will be misled into thinking that the statement is true.seven cases united states.intent to deceive,while subjective in nature,is established in law by objective criteria.id.thus,objective standards control and the fact of misrepresentation coupled with proof that the party making it had knowledge of its falsity is enough to warrant drawing the inference that there was a fraudulent intent.see norton curtiss.thus,under such circumstances,the mere assertion by a party that it did not intend to deceive will not suffice to escape statutory liability.such an assertion,standing alone,is worthless as proof of no intent to deceive where there is knowledge of falsehood.but in order to establish knowledge of falsity the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the party accused of false marking did not have a reasonable belief that the articles were properly marked,covered by a patent.absent such proof of lack of reasonable belief,no liability under the statute ensues.
in this case,the trial court examined the facts pertaining to the tests conducted in,and concluded that those tests put invitrogen on notice that its products were not covered by the patents and that its markings were,therefore,statutorily deceptive.the trial court also determined that invitrogen had no basis for asserting through its labeling that its kits and cdna library products were patented and that invitrogen products were falsely marked for the purpose of deceiving the public.
the question of whether conduct rises to the level of statutory deception is a question of fact,see,kangaroos,caldor,and when that question is resolved as here in a bench trial,we review the decision of the trial court for clear error.goodrich aircraft braking.
on appeal,clontech does not challenge the trial court finding of no intent to deceive as to the period before the year.but clontech urges that the trial court correctly found that the tests showed that invitrogen had knowledge that the labeled products were not covered by the patents.invitrogen makes two arguments in response 
first,invitrogen asserts that the results of the experiments performed in do not clearly show that the rnase h activity of ss and ssii fail to meet the limitation of substantially no rnase h activity.in other words,argues invitrogen,the trial court misinterpreted the results of the experiments.second,according to invitrogen,even if it knew that ss and ssii could not meet the substantially no rnase h activity limitation,it can not be liable for false marking with the patent because the claims of the patent define the limiting levels of rnase h activity using different language.the clear error standard permits reversal where after review we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.ruiz chance.we address each argument in turn.
after evaluating the trial court opinion,the testimony and evidence,and the parties arguments,we are convinced that the trial court clearly erred when it concluded that the results of the experiments put invitrogen on clear notice that its rts,ss and ssii,have rnase h activity greater than substantially no rnase h activity as that term is defined by the trial court claim interpretation.
as noted above,the trial court found,and the parties do not dispute,that the experiments were performed to determine whether ss and ssii meet the substantially no rnase h activity limitation of the claims of the patents in suit.d at.the experiments were performed by gerard,an invitrogen scientist who is an inventor listed on the patents in suit,and champoux,an invitrogen expert for the litigation.the rts tested were ss,ss and ssii.the disputed evidence consists of gerard notebook pages at,which contain raw data as well as gerard notes pertaining to that data,and champoux summary of his analysis of the data id.at.both scientists testified.
gerard handwritten notes reveal an analysis of the raw data.in particular,the notes reflect that of fourteen ss,ss,or ssii experiments,five showed rt rnase h activity higher than the claimed picomoles a n solubilized per g protein.at trial,however,clontech elicited testimony on two data points,one for ss,which showed rnase h levels of approximately times the claimed amount,and one for ssii,which showed activity of approximately times the claimed amount.id.at.
invitrogen does not appear to have addressed this on redirect.instead,invitrogen relied on champoux,the expert it retained for the testing to interpret the data generated from the experiments.champoux testified that the experiments showed that the tested rts had no detectable rnase h activity.id.at.champoux also testified about how the tests were designed and his involvement in designing the tests.id.at.he also explained that his calculations took into account variability resulting from the series of measurements that go into a sample.id.at.he explained that when properly interpreted the tests showed that in of the experiments performed rnase h activity was no different in the presence of ss,ss,or ssii,than in the absence of rts.id.at.finally,champoux explained that the interpretation of the data seen in gerard notes was not reliable because it did not take into account experimental variation.id.at.after reiterating his conclusion that the data showed no difference between samples with rnase h deficient rts and background,id.at,he finally explained that the one test of the that was aberrant was likely due to a contaminating bacterial rnase h in that preparation.id.at.
this testimony went largely unanswered.clontech expert provided a hypothesis that some data points,including those showing rnase activity,were reliable because they occurred in the first day of testing but that data points from later days were unreliable because freezing and thawing caused the enzyme activity to degrade with time.however,this criticism was answered by champoux who explained that the experiments used the standard technique of storing the rt enzymes in glycerol to protect against damage.id.at.
as noted above,the standard is whether clontech proved by a preponderance of the evidence that invitrogen did not have an honest good faith belief in marking its products.the trial court held that prior to the experiments,there was insufficient evidence to find that invitrogen did not have a good faith belief that ss and ssii met the substantially no rnase h activity limitation thus,the issue is whether the results of the experiments should have disabused invitrogen of any good faith belief it harbored concerning the rnase h activity of ss and ssii.viewing the testimony and evidence as a whole,we are firmly convinced the court erred in deciding that the results of the experiments put invitrogen on notice that its products were not covered by the patents in suit.d at.the testimony clontech elicited from gerard did not address the complete results of the experiments,and there is no indication that clontech was able to impeach or otherwise discredit champoux reasoned explanation of the full scope of t
