the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,granted defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under.b,and plaintiffs appeal.because plaintiffs suit involves claims of damages that were caused directly by defendants alleged fraud,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
a.the parties 
defendant is a pharmaceutical company incorporated in delaware with headquarters in new jersey.company is an unincorporated division of,and also has its headquarters in new jersey.from february through march,defendants marketed and sold rezulin,an oral drug that was approved in january by the fda to treat type ii adult onset diabetes,a disease from which more than million americans suffer.
plaintiff louisiana health service indemnity company blue cross is a blue shield health benefit provider hbp with headquarters in baton rouge,louisiana.blue cross filed a class action suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana on august,the suit was subsequently transferred to the southern district of new york by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.
plaintiff eastern states health and welfare fund eastern,an erisa plan that provides benefits to members of the needletrades,industrial,and textile employees union,is based in new york.eastern filed suit in the southern district of new york in march.the two suits were consolidated by the district court in a order in april,and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint the same month.
allegations in plaintiffs complaint 
according to plaintiffs complaint,the allegations of which must be accepted as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss,see conley gibson,d,rezulin first gained prominence in june,when the national institutes of health nih announced a million clinical study to test the drug effectiveness.the nih decision to include rezulin in the study was heavily influenced by jerrold olefsky,who held prominent positions in the nih,and by richard eastman,the nih senior diabetes researcher who had overall responsibility for the study.both doctors had financial interests in promoting the drug olefsky is listed as inventor or on three patents regarding rezulin use for preventing diabetes and was of a group that promoted the drug eastman was a board member of two organizations financed by and the drug developer.and,as it turned out,eastman received more than in undisclosed compensation from while he was overseeing the study.when these payments were brought to light in december a investigation by the inspector general.eastman was forced to resign from the nih.
submitted a new drug application nda for rezulin to the fda on july,and the fda agreed to give the drug a fast track six month review.the fda initially assigned john gueriguian as the chief medical officer to oversee the review.after concluding that the drug posed serious health and safety concerns,gueriguian recommended against approval in a detailed written evaluation dated october.specifically,gueriguian found very worrisome liver toxicity,and concluded that rezulin offered very little therapeutic advantage over existing diabetes medications.he noted that clinical trial data showed that rezulin users developed liver problems at four times the rate of control patients who received a placebo,and also expressed concern about potential cardiovascular damage from the drug gueriguian met with representatives in september and suggested the drug prospects were not good.then met with gueriguian superiors at the fda who,in november,removed gueriguian from the rezulin review.
gueriguian was replaced by alexander fleming,whose medical review noted that clinical trials had identified significant safety issues and suggested unpredictable damage associated with rezulin.nevertheless,fleming presentation to the fda endocrinologic and metabolic drugs advisory committee made no mention of either gueriguian reservations about the drug,or of the problematic results of clinical trials.three advisory committee members later told the press that,if they had been informed of the adverse liver results,they would have required monitoring as a condition of approval.the advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend approval of rezulin and,on january,the fda approved the drug,but only for use in combination with insulin or with metformin or sulfonylurea drugs.in august,this approval was broadened to allow the use of rezulin as a therapy.
marketed rezulin aggressively,and priced it at nearly three times the cost of appropriate treatments by other drugs.it touted rezulin as the first drug designed to target insulin resistence.that statement prompted the fda to accuse of making false and misleading claims,and to recommend that the company immediately discontinue circulating new releases containing the claim.more significant to this litigation,published two color in the may,issue of the new england journal of medicine,and one in the june,washington rezulin as a drug with breakthrough effectiveness,and side effects comparable to placebo.the company allegedly made this statement while knowing that its own clinical trial data showed rezulin users were three to six times more likely to suffer liver injury than patients taking the placebo.
by july,seven people receiving rezulin had died from the same side effects that had observed in its rezulin tests.by the fall of,the fda began to receive reports of rezulin patients suffering serious liver injuries,including death following liver failure.the fda appointed a misbin to evaluate the adverse event reports.he estimated that more than rezulin users would experience some liver injury,and that of those patients might die unless their liver functions were closely monitored.
sent a letter to doctors in october,reporting that rezulin users had experienced idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury ranging from mild effects to one liver transplant and one death.the letter said these reports were rare,but nevertheless recommended that liver function be tested within the first month or two of rezulin use,every three months for the first year thereafter,and then periodically.
on december,sent a second letter to healthcare professionals,announcing a label change on the drug which recommended more frequent monitoring for patients using rezulin.the letter suggested that the fda remained an advocate of rezulin and a partner with in assuring safety to the drug users.
on that same day,december,the sale of rezulin active ingredient was banned in the united kingdom,based on a conclusion by the company marketing the drug that there was no way to predict which rezulin patients would be harmed,and the pace of liver injuries and deaths was by that point unacceptably high.reacted by issuing a press release on december stating it was disappointed with the mischaracterization of its actions and intentions regarding the development and marketing of rezulin,and that it was particularly disturbed by media reports that focused on the drug risks while ignoring its significant benefits.moreover,reaffirmed that the fda supported the drug,and noted that the injured patients may not have been monitored as recommended in the labeling.
throughout this period,the nih study of rezulin continued.in may,audrey jones,a healthy,participant in the study who had taken rezulin,died,following a liver transplant made necessary by the irreversible liver failure she had developed.jones had undergone the monitoring tests that recommended.issued a press release stating that jones had died apparently due to complications unrelated to her rezulin use.this report,however,was contradicted by nih physicians,who concluded that the patient death had probably been caused by rezulin.the following month,citing concerns about the safety of the remaining participants in the study,rezulin was withdrawn from the nih study.
in july,sent a third letter to health care professionals announcing another label change for rezulin.the letter noted that a few new cases of hepatocellular events since had occurred in patients who may not have been monitored as recommended in the labeling.the statement allegedly was made despite the company knowledge that jones had been tested and carefully monitored,in accordance with warner lambert recommendation,by the nih.under the new label change,liver testing was required for all rezulin patients monthly for the first eight months,every two months for the remainder of the first year,and periodically after that.despite the new label calling for additional monitoring,the reports of patients suffering liver failure continued to rise.in november,two patients who had been monitored as recommended by the safety labels then in effect developed liver failure within two weeks of the tests,and died.
the complaint alleges that did not stop misdescribing the drug as safe.in a march article in the los angeles times,a vice president asserted that he was unaware of any deaths related to rezulin after the july label change.but,in fact,had itself reported to the fda the deaths of rezulin users between july and december.
on march,the fda convened a second advisory committee meeting to evaluate rezulin.at that meeting,a senior fda epidemiologist verified that rezulin had been implicated by the fda in reported cases of liver failure,and that the drug could be expected to cause liver failure in one out of every patients.the committee recommended that the fda withdraw its approval of rezulin as a therapy.on that same day,sent out a series of press releases claiming,inter alia,that the new labeling had substantially reduced the reported rate of liver events.
in june,the fda announced that it was allowing rezulin to remain on the market,but was requiring another label change.under the new label,rezulin could no longer be used as a therapy,and the required monitoring was again increased.patients using the drug were required to undergo testing before beginning treatment,monthly for the first months,and quarterly during the second year.
despite these changes,mortality statistics of rezulin users continued to climb,and allegedly continued to lie about them.in february,the company released a statement claiming that it believed there were no deaths attributable to rezulin after the june label change.the day after this statement was made,the fda discredited it,saying the agency had been informed of six cases of liver failure with onset after july,of which at least three resulted in death.
in march,doctors at the fda and elsewhere became even more concerned about rezulin,with one doctor writing to others that at each juncture in the management of rezulin liver failure risk,hindsight shows that the monitoring had little or no effect and that assertions that the liver failure problem was solved were proved false.another doctor,who had formerly been a principal researcher in echo study,wrote to senator edward kennedy that she believe d that the company deliberately omitted reports of liver toxicity and misrepresented serious adverse events experienced by patients in their clinical studies.moreover,an article in the march,los angeles times reported that the fda had linked rezulin to liver failures,including deaths.
on march,withdrew rezulin from the market.the withdrawal was at the request of the fda,which had concluded that continued use of rezulin now poses an unacceptable risk to patients.since then,the fda has acknowledged reports of liver damage occurring after patients were taken off the drug,which indicates that the risk of harm does not disappear with the withdrawal of the drug.
plaintiffs claims and relief sought 
in their april consolidated complaint,plaintiffs sought class relief on behalf of all health benefit providers that paid for rezulin during the period between february and april according to the complaint,the vast majority of the purchase price of prescription drugs,including rezulin,is paid directly by health benefit providers,pursuant to contracts that exist between hbps and virtually every retail and pharmacy in the united states.plaintiffs assert that members of the class paid approximately billion to purchase the drug.this amount includes only the portion of the prescription paid by the hbps and excludes the part paid by the patients,in the form of a.a prescription of rezulin cost approximately,of which the typical hbp paid about with the patient paying the rest.prior to the introduction of rezulin,the most commonly prescribed oral drug therapy for type ii diabetes was metformin,which had a prescription cost of approximately per month,of which the typical hbp paid about.
in their complaint,plaintiffs sought to recover the moneys they spent purchasing rezulin.asserting that the suit is governed by new jersey law,the complaint alleges a knowing concealment,suppression or omission of material facts,in violation of section of the new jersey consumer fraud act count b breach of express warranties and of the implied warranty of merchantability,in violation of new jersey commercial code sections and counts and and c unjust enrichment count 
d.the proceedings below 
on october,the district court lewis kaplan,granted defendant b motion to dismiss.the court rested its holding squarely on its analysis of two decisions,holmes securities investor protection,d,and laborers local health and benefit fund philip morris,cir.it concluded that,under those cases,plaintiffs could not establish that defendants actions were the proximate cause of plaintiffs damages.
in laborers local,plaintiff hbps sued several major tobacco companies,alleging that the companies had conspired to deceive the public and the plaintiffs concerning the health risks of smoking.plaintiffs sought to recover the money they had spent treating their insureds illnesses.at.a panel of this court first noted that the plaintiffs rico claims required a showing of proximate cause,and stated that,in making the determination of whether proximate cause existed,courts should apply principles,id.at citing holmes,at,which,it found,required the elements of direct injury,and foreseeability.id.at.as to the first element,the court said that the critical question posed by the direct injury test is whether the damages a plaintiff sustains are derivative of an injury to a third party.if so,then the injury is indirect if not,it is direct.id.at.applying that test to the facts before it,the court concluded that the plaintiffs injuries arose only from the injuries sustained by its insureds 
without injury to the individual smokers,the plaintiffs would not have incurred any increased costs in the form of the payment of benefits,nor would they have experienced the difficulties of cost prediction and control that constituted the crux of their infrastructure harms.being purely contingent on harm to third parties,these injuries are indirect.consequently,because defendants alleged misconduct did not proximately cause the injuries alleged,plaintiffs lack standing to bring rico claims against defendants.
id.at.the laborers local court also determined that the plaintiffs fraud and special duty claims under new york common law,like its rico claims,were barred by their inability to show proximate cause.id.at.
the district court in the instant case described the claims in laborers local as closely analogous to the claims brought by the hbps 
putting aside the question whether the hbps bought rezulin,the crux of their complaint is that marketed a defective product for use by their insureds,that it failed to disclose information undermining implicit or explicit representations as to safety,and that the demand for the thus the payments the hbps made to provide the drug to or to reimburse its insureds for higher than they would have been absent the alleged torts.thus,absent the alleged misconduct the insureds and their health care providers,the hbps would not have been injured.accordingly,laborers local controls here,and the complaint must be dismissed.
in holmes,the plaintiff was the securities investor protection corporation spic,a private corporation whose members included most registered under the securities and exchange act,holmes,at,and which insures investors against losses when a member organization is unable to meet its obligations to its investors.when an sipc member was the victim of a fraudulent scheme by holmes and,as a result,went into default,the sipc took over and spent about million to compensate the affected investors.id.at.the sipc then,as subrogee of the investors,sued holmes for violations of sec rules,mail and wire fraud statutes,and the rico act.id.the ninth circuit allowed the case to go forward,concluding that the investor losses were proximately caused by holmes fraud.id.at.
the supreme court reversed.id.at.the court first analyzed the rico statute and concluded that it required not only but for causation,but also proximate causation.id.at.the court still concerned with the requirements of rico stated that proximate cause demands some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.id.it then provided three policy rationales for this requirement of directness 
first,the less direct an injury is,the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff damages attributable to the violation,as distinct from other,independent,factors.second,quite apart from problems of proving factual causation,recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts,to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.and,finally,the need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct,since directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general,without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely.
id.at.citations omitted.
the district court in the instant case used holmes as an alternate rationale for its decision,noting that even if laborers local were not controlling,plaintiffs would have failed to establish proximate cause under the three factors articulated in holmes.
as to the first factor,the court assumed that it appears to be common ground that rezulin did not harm,and indeed benefitted,a great many and,given this assumption,asserted that c ertainly the hbps have no claim to recover the cost of providing the drug to patients who were not harmed.it concluded that the extent of plaintiffs injuries therefore depends upon whether each insured for whose rezulin they paid benefitted from or was harmed by rezulin,a matter that will turn on the individual proof as to each patient for whom it was prescribed.on the second holmes factor,the district court characterized the hbps as essentially financial intermediaries which,the court said,doubtless passed on all or much of the costs they incurred to employers and perhaps even to insureds themselves.for that reason,the court concluded that the apportionment problems that would be created by allowing the hbps to sue here would be monumental.finally,stating that t here simply is no reason why the individuals who allegedly were injured by rezulin can not recover the costs of the drug and any subsequent diagnostic testing or monitoring,the court held that the third holmes factor also weighed against the plaintiffs.
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.todd exxon,cir.on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accepting the complaint allegations as true.id.a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.id.at quoting conley gibson,d.thus,the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.
we note as a threshold matter that the district court seems to have acted on the assumption that the relevant legal standard to be applied in this case is the law of proximate cause as stated by the supreme court in holmes,and by us in laborers local.we do not agree with that view.both of those cases arose under rico,and therefore the applicable standard of causation in those cases was the standard that was established by that federal statute.see abrahams young rubicam,cir noting that,in a suit seeking recovery granted by a statute,liability does not depend on whether there is proximate causation as that term is used at common law,because w ith statutory claims,the issue is,instead,one of statutory intent.
in holmes,the supreme court interpreted the rico statute as not only requiring causation,but also as incorporating what it termed principles of proximate causation.holmes,at.it then proceeded to many possible versions of proximate cause what the proximity requirements of rico were.id.at.we,of course,applied the supreme court interpretation in laborers local,since it also involved a claim under rico.because the issue was one of statutory interpretation,the proximity requirements could have been broader or narrower than those applied under the common law of any particular state.see abrahams,at noting that,while the proximity requirements for statutory liability are usually narrower than most rules governing proximate cause,a legislature is free to go beyond the common law and create rights of recovery for plaintiffs who are not foreseeable and who are injured by defendants wrongdoing,and concluding that w ere such a statute in issue,substantial problems could arise from the continued use of proximate cause language to define when plaintiffs are meant by the legislature to be given a cause of action.in fact,the proximate cause requirements of rico were more stringent than those of most states.see moore painewebber,cir calabresi,concurring explaining that a rico plaintiff burden to show that his case meets the requirement of proximate causation derives from the legislature intent to impose that causation requirement,and not directly from the common law itself,and noting that i n practice,our cases have held rico plaintiffs to a more stringent showing of proximate cause than would be required at common law.
unlike holmes and laborers local,the legal standard of proximate cause that is relevant to the case before us is not the law of rico it is,rather,the law of new jersey.and plaintiffs strenuously argue that they meet all the requirements of proximate cause under new jersey common law.defendants,on the other hand,do not address this point at any length.our task is,therefore,to determine what new jersey common law of proximate cause requires.in cases involving state law,if we believe the issue to be uncertain,we have the option to certify the question to the state highest court so that it can tell us definitively what the law is certification is not available in this case,however,because the supreme court of new jersey allows certification only from the third circuit.see court rules.
plaintiffs contend that the law of new jersey on proximate cause does not have the relatively narrow directness requirements applied by the federal courts under rico in holmes and laborers local.defendants position,charitably read,is that new jersey proximate cause requirements mirror those of holmes and laborers local.on this issue,we are much inclined to agree with plaintiffs.but even assuming arguendo that defendants are correct,their argument is to no avail,for the situations in holmes and laborers local are significantly different from the instant case.
in laborers local,the tobacco companies alleged tort directly harmed only the smokers,who suffered both a health injury illness and an economic injury the purchase price of the fraudulently marketed cigarettes the smokers health injuries,in turn,caused economic losses to the insurance companies,who had to reimburse patients for the cost of their illnesses.that case was therefore clearly one in which the plaintiffs damages were entirely derivative of the injuries to their insured.for,as we there noted,w ithout injury to the individual smokers,the plaintiffs would not have incurred any increased costs.laborers local,at.
in the instant case,instead,plaintiffs allege an injury directly to themselves an in
