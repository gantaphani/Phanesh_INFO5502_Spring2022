on summary judgment,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia determined that excel pharmaceuticals,and abc collectively excel did not infringe smithkline beecham corporation glaxo patent on a controlled sustained release formulation of bupropion hydrochloride.smithkline beecham excel,d.because an issue of material fact remains unresolved,this court vacates the judgment of the trial court and remands.
glaxo owns patent the patent directed to controlled sustained release tablets containing bupropion hydrochloride.pharmacologically,bupropion is a monocyclic aminoketone antidepressant.see patent issued july,the patent.these compounds treat depression and inebriation.in addition,they facilitate the cessation of smoking by producing neural stimulation in mammalian systems.see patent,ll.patent,ll.patent issued june.due to this action as a stimulant,a spike in bupropion concentrations can have the side effect of causing seizures.patent,ll.
to avoid the need for multiple dosages with the attendant fluctuations in plasma bupropion concentrations,glaxo invented a sustained release formulation of the compound.while bupropion hydrochloride itself was separately patented,glaxo obtained the patent to protect its sustained release formulation of the drug.glaxo markets this patented sustained release formulation as wellbutrin sr for treatment of depression and as zyban for smoking cessation.the key ingredient for achieving sustained release in this invention is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc,which is a partly and o cellulose.in oral preparations,hpmc extends drug release by transforming into a gel that swells upon ingestion.the hydrogel state of hpmc releases bupropion hydrochloride from an ingested tablet over a period of time.
the patent claims a sustained release tablet containing an admixture of bupropion hydrochloride and hpmc.however,many of the claims as originally filed did not recite hpmc as a limitation.during prosecution on the merits in the united states patent and trademark office patent office,the examiner rejected the claims that did not recite hpmc for lack of enablement under.glaxo amended those claims to overcome the rejection.the exemplary independent claims of the patent state

excel pharmaceuticals,is a subsidiary of alpharma,that licenses generic pharmaceuticals for sale by other companies.excel filed two abbreviated new drug applications andas with the united states food and drug administration,one proposing a generic substitute for wellbutrin sr and the other a generic substitute for zyban.in both andas,excel made a paragraph iv certification that its proposed sustained release bupropion hydrochloride tablets do not infringe glaxo patent.the sustained release agent in excel generic composition is polyvinyl alcohol pva,a polymer.glaxo,upon receiving notice of excel anda filings,commenced infringement actions in virginia and new jersey,alleging infringement of claims and of the patent.the eastern district of virginia assigned glaxo case on the formula to the norfolk division and assigned the case on the smoking cessation formula to the alexandria division.
during litigation,excel moved for summary judgment of noninfringement because its formulation does not contain hpmc.excel contended that prosecution history estoppel precludes infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.glaxo opposed and filed a for an extension of time to conduct discovery.the district court determined when the patentee rewrote the claims to include hpmc,the amendment narrowed the scope of these claims from claiming a generic concept,sustained release of bupropion hydrochloride into the bloodstream,to a single species of polymer to accomplish this property hpmc.smithkline,d at.the court also concluded t his amendment was made to satisfy the requirements of,and,therefore,the amendment was made for a reason related to patentability.id.at.the district court therefore granted excel motion for summary judgment because the anda does not literally infringe the patent and because prosecution history estoppel bars glaxo from invoking the doctrine of equivalents.id.at.
the same day that the norfolk division issued its opinion in the antidepressant case,the alexandria division reassigned its smoking cessation case to norfolk.excel then invoked res judicata in its motion for summary judgment in the smoking cessation case.the trial court also granted that motion.likewise,the presiding judge in the district of new jersey dismissed that case sua sponte due to the res judicata effect of the summary judgment in the identical virginia action.
glaxo timely appealed these judgments to this court,which consolidated these appeals into this single appeal.glaxo argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment to excel,because pva is an equivalent to hpmc which glaxo did not surrender during prosecution of the claims.this court has exclusive jurisdiction under a.

narrowing amendment 
excel does not literally infringe the patent because hpmc,a recited claim limitation,is not present in its sustained release bupropion formulation.instead,glaxo seeks a judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.therefore,infringement depends on whether the prosecution history of the patent forecloses glaxo reliance on the doctrine of equivalents.specifically this court must examine whether glaxo narrowed claims and of the patent during prosecution,thereby presumptively surrendering the territory that embraces excel sustained release agent.
according to the supreme court in festo,a narrowing amendment made to satisfy any requirement of the patent act may give rise to an estoppel.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d festo viii.such a narrowing amendment,whether made to avoid prior art or to comply with,creates a presumption that the patentee surrendered the territory between the original claims and the amended claims.id.at.the patentee may rebut that presumption by showing that the alleged equivalent could not reasonably have been described at the time the amendment was made,or that the alleged equivalent was tangential to the purpose of the amendment,or that the equivalent was not foreseeable and thus not claimable at the time of the amendment.id.at.this court has recently acknowledged and applied these rebutting criteria.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,festo ix.
