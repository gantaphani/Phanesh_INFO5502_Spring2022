cordis corporation appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the district of delaware.cordis seeks review of a summary judgment that defendant medtronic ave,ave did not literally infringe two of cordis patents,and a judgment as a matter of law jmol that ave did not infringe those patents under the doctrine of equivalents.because we disagree with the district court claim construction and its application of prosecution history estoppel,we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the development of coronary stents marked a significant advance in the treatment of coronary artery disease by providing an alternative to balloon angioplasty and bypass surgery.in balloon angioplasty,an inflated balloon crushes plaque against the arterial wall to improve blood flow.the balloon is withdrawn at the end of the procedure,however,which allows the artery to close again over time.a stent of the sort disclosed in the patents at issue in this case is mounted on an angioplasty balloon and is forced to expand against the arterial walls when the balloon is inflated.when the balloon is deflated and withdrawn,the stent retains its shape and remains in the artery to keep it open.because the stent diameter depends on how much the balloon expands,the stent can be used in arteries of differing diameters.prior art stents that were designed to remain in arteries had predetermined expanded diameters.accordingly,they were liable to migrate from the desired location if they were too small or to rupture the artery if they were too large.
the two patents at issue in this case are owned by cordis.patent the patent discloses an expandable stent composed of a tubular member having a wall surface of substantially uniform thickness with a plurality of slots formed therein parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular member.after the stent is transported in its unexpanded form to the intended location within the patient body,an outwardly directed radial force as by the inflation of the balloon causes the stent to expand.the stent can be expanded and deformed according to the diameter of the body passageway in which it is located.see patent,ll.certain claims of the patent specify that the tubular member is and smooth.
approximately ten years after issuing the patent,the pto reexamined the patent in light of several prior art references.during the reexamination,the examiner rejected several claims in view of,inter alia,patents to ersek and to kornberg.the ersek patent claims a fixation device with projecting edges that can be used as a substitute for sutures the device serves to hold a prosthesis in place within a body passageway.ersek recites that his device is preferably formed from expanded metal sheeting and is produced by forming a series of staggered parallel slits in a metal sheet and then stretching the sheet in a direction perpendicular to the slits to open the slits into apertures.the resulting projecting edges embed themselves into the tissue wall upon expansion of the sleeve.
in response to the examiner rejection,cordis amended various claims of the patent to include the substantially uniform thickness limitation that was already present in claim.cordis argued that the limitation distinguished its patent from the ersek patent,noting that t he expanded metal ersek sleeve has bridge portions that are several times as thick as the strands.in its discussion of the ersek patent,cordis relied in part on an affidavit of erik antonsson that addressed the dimensions of a model of the ersek device.cordis also distinguished the ersek patent based on its contention that ersek did not disclose either a smooth surface or a tubular member.the examiner then confirmed the claims of the patent that are asserted in this case.the examiner distinguished the ersek patent on the ground that the ersek sleeve is not smooth because the bridge has a thickness which is twice as great as the strand.
the other cordis patent at issue in this case is patent the patent.that patent adds the feature of flexibility by including a connector member to link one tubular member of the stent to another.the written description provides that the claimed device,with its connector member,permits tissue of an elongated section of a body passageway to be supported by an elongated graft and provides the necessary flexibility to negotiate the bends and curves in tortuous body passageways,such as the vascular system.patent,ll.the examiner initially rejected claims of the patent as anticipated by or obvious in light of a patent to wiktor.after the applicant distinguished the wiktor patent,the examiner allowed the claims without amendment.the patent is unrelated to the patent,but the written descriptions of the two are very similar.
cordis filed suit,charging ave and others with patent infringement.ave produces stents that are formed by first bending wire rings into a sinusoidal shapes and then connecting the bent rings together,as shown below.
cordis alleged,inter alia,that ave stents infringe claims,and of the patent and claims and of the patent.all of the asserted claims recite a wall surface having a substantially uniform thickness and a plurality of slots formed therein.
the district court construed the claim language referring to a plurality of slots formed in the wall surface to be limited to devices in which the slots are formed by the removal of material.no material is removed from a wall to form the slots in ave accused stents rather,the slots are formed when material is bent into sinusoidal rings,which are then connected in line.because the court concluded that the accused products did not satisfy the plurality of slots formed therein limitation,the court granted ave motion for summary judgment of no literal infringement.
the district court construed the reference to a wall surface having a substantially uniform thickness to mean that the thickness of the wall may not vary by more than inch.the court reached that conclusion based on the patentee citation,during reexamination,of the antonsson affidavit,which reported that the wall of a device modeled on the ersek patent was between inches and inches in thickness.
after a trial,a jury found that ave stents infringed the asserted claims of the and patents under the doctrine of equivalents and awarded cordis million in damages.on motions,however,the district court granted jmol of noninfringement,holding that cordis was barred from asserting that ave stents had features that were equivalent to the plurality of slots formed therein and substantially uniform thickness limitations.in addition,the court granted a conditional new trial with respect to literal infringement of the substantially uniform thickness limitation.
ii.a plurality of slots formed therein 
with regard to the grant of summary judgment of no literal infringement,the district court ruled that the phrase slots formed therein requires that the slots be manufactured by removing material from a wall surface.we disagree.slots can be formed in a wall surface by means other than removing material,such as by constructing the wall with openings built into it.
nothing about the phrase slots formed therein suggests that the slots must be formed by a particular process the phrase certainly does not indicate that the wall must be formed first and the slots formed later.a piece of wire mesh can fairly be described as a metal surface with holes formed in it,but that description does not mean that the screen was made by starting with a solid piece of metal and drilling holes in it.the phrase slots formed therein describes the physical characteristics of the product,not the method of its manufacture.
we also reject ave contention that the patent definition of a slot as an opening indicates that the stent must be made by forming an opening in previously solid material.an opening can arise by leaving a gap during the construction of a wall surface as well as by removing material from the surface.because the language formed therein does not require the removal of material as the method of formation,we decline to superimpose a process limitation on the product claims at issue.see vanguard prods.parker hannifin,holding that the limitation of a thin layer integral therewith described the product and did not designate a specific manufacturing process,and that a method of manufacture,even when cited as advantageous,does not of itself convert product claims into claims limited to a particular process.
the specifications of the and patents do not define the slots formed therein as openings created by the removal of material from a wall surface.ave relies on the statement p referably,tubular member is initially a stainless steel tube having a uniform thickness and a plurality of slots are formed in the wall surface or tubular member.patent,ll.patent,ll.but the use of the term preferably makes clear that the language describes a preferred embodiment,not the invention as a whole.
the district court based its holding that the s lots must be formed in the wall surface of a tubular member,as by the removal of material in part on the progression of the written description of the patent from its parent,patent the patent.specifically,the district court relied on the fact that one of the embodiments disclosed in the patent was not carried over into the specification of the patent application,which was filed as a continuation in part cip.the patent discloses two differing embodiments,which are shown in figures and 
the written description of the patent states,preferably,tubular shaped member of figure is made of continuous,stainless steel wire woven in a tubular pattern to form what can be generally described as a wire mesh tube.patent,ll.because the wire is,the tube is twice as thick at the cross points as at other points on the structure.that embodiment is not present in the specification of the patent or the patent.
like the district court,ave relies on the absence of the figure embodiment from the and patents as indicating that cordis disclaimed stents lacking a wall surface from which material is removed to create the slots.we reject this basis for narrowing the claims.in neither patent is there any language surrendering stents,and the fact that the patentee chose not to include figure from the patent as an embodiment in the specification does not indicate that the patentee was no longer claiming any stent composed of bent wire.rather,it is likely that the patentee chose not to include that embodiment because its overlapping members caused it not to be of substantially uniform thickness,smooth,or all features claimed in the patent,but not in the patent.
a patentee may choose not to carry forward a particular embodiment from a parent patent to a cip because that embodiment does not satisfy a limitation that was added in the cip.that choice,however,does not mean that the scope of the cip is limited to the preferred embodiment that was carried forward.thus,we reject ave contention that the failure to include a wire mesh embodiment in which wires have been bent and overlapped to form the stent should limit the construction of the claims to exclude all embodiments created by bending wire in any form.
the district court compared the methods of making the preferred embodiments of the patent and concluded that the difference between the figure and figure embodiments is that the elongate bars of the thin bar figure embodiment may be formed integral with one another,a method of manufacture that the district court found to be singularly descriptive of the slotted tube preferred embodiment.however,expert testimony established that one of skill in the art would understand formed integral with one another,in the context of the patents at issue,to refer to formation from a single piece of material,which does not require construction by removal of material from a piece of metal.
we also disagree with the district court conclusion that it is significant that the patent claims a plurality of intersecting elongate members while the patent claims a wall surface having a plurality of slots.claiming a wall having slots is essentially the same as defining a hole in terms of the structure that forms the hole.
we next consider statements made in the prosecution history of the patent regarding the prior art wiktor patent to determine whether the patentee effected a disclaimer of claim scope.such a disclaimer requires clear and unmistakable statements of disavowal.see omega eng g,raytek,slip.op.at.
schatz,the inventor of the patent,characterized wiktor as disclosing a coiled wire stent which is a tubular shape of coiled wire wound in a special manner comprising a number of groups of turns.the coiled wire stent in wiktor has openings spiraling around its circumference as shown herein 
in response to the examiner rejection of the application for the patent in view of the wiktor patent,schatz stated 
wiktor does not disclose a plurality of tubular members,each having first and second ends and a wall surface disposed between the first and second ends,the wall surface having a substantially uniform thickness and a plurality of slots formed therein,the slots being disposed substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of each tubular member.wiktor discloses a single stent,or graft made up of coiled wire.there is no wall surface having a plurality of slots,nor slots disposed parallel to the longitudinal axis of each tubular member.applicant claimed invention is not coiled wire wound in a special manner comprised of a number of groups of turns as illustrated in wiktor.
the first sentence of schatz statement about wiktor is a general allegation that wiktor does not disclose the precise combination of elements claimed in the patent.that statement can not be read to disclaim any device not containing a wall from which material is removed.schatz more specifically distinguishes the wiktor patent in his statement that t here is no wall surface having a plurality of slots,nor slots disposed parallel to the longitudinal axis of each tubular member.clearly,he is correct that wiktor does not have slots disposed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the member even if the openings in wiktor do constitute slots,they are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the member.it is not clear,however,what schatz meant by no wall surface having a plurality of slots.he could have meant either that coiled wire is not a wall surface or that the openings in the coil do not constitute slots.the statement is amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations and it therefore does not constitute a clear and unmistakable surrender of all stents that lack a wall surface from which material is removed to form the slots.in addition,the statement does not clearly disclaim any stents made of bent wire on the ground that a stent made of wire lacks any wall surface,as ave contends.
rather than supporting a narrow construction of the slots formed therein limitation,the prosecution history of the particularly the that the patentee did not intend for the phrase slots formed therein to require the removal of material.for example,the examiner,in discussing the kornberg patent,stated that webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defines slot as a narrow opening or groove.the spaces between the kornberg struts certainly meet this definition.the slots are formed in the tubular member since the struts are part of the wall of the tubular member.the examiner remarks indicate that he understood that slots formed therein describes the location of the slots,not how they are made.the patentee did not dispute that statement by the examiner.the examiner also described the ersek patent device as having a plurality of slots formed therein even though ersek slots are not made by removing material.the patentee distinguished the ersek patent,but did not dispute that ersek device has a plurality of slots formed therein.accordingly,the patentee did not rely on the method of manufacturing as a means of distinguishing the invention from the prior art.because the prosecution histories of the and patents do not support the narrow reading of the slots formed therein limitation,we conclude that the district court erred in construing the slots formed therein limitation in the two patents to require that the slots be formed by removing material from a wall surface.
because we disagree with the district court construction of the plurality of slots formed therein limitation,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment of no literal infringement based on that limitation.for the same reason,we also reverse the district court ruling on the doctrine of equivalents,which was based on the court construction of that limitation.
iii.substantially uniform thickness 
cordis also challenges the district court construction of the substantially uniform thickness limitation and the court related ruling on prosecution history estoppel.we agree with cordis that the court claim construction was unduly narrow and that the court estoppel ruling was erroneous.accordingly,we reverse the court order granting jmol of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents and its grant of a conditional new trial on literal infringement as to that limitation.
the district court construed the substantially uniform thickness limitation to require that the thickness of the stent wall surface not vary by inch or more.cordis contends that the district court erred by imposing the numerical restriction of inch with respect to that limitation.
the patents do not set out any numerical standard by which to determine whether the thickness of the wall surface is substantially uniform.the term substantially,as used in this context,denotes approximation.see epcon gas,bauer compressors.thus,the walls must be of largely or approximately uniform thickness.moreover,the written descriptions of the two patents state only that the expansion of the tubular member is uniform along the length of tubular member in part because of the uniform thickness of the wall surface,specifically pointing to the same uniform thickness of the connecting members,the elongate members,and members and.patent,ll.patent,ll.accordingly,the substantially uniform limitation also requires that the thickness of the wall surface be sufficiently uniform along its length and between members to allow uniform expansion of the stent.the question presented here is whether there is anything in the prosecution history of either patent that justifies giving the substantially uniform thickness limitation an even narrower construction.
in its discussion of the ersek patent during reexamination of the patent,cordis argued that,according to the antonsson affidavit,the ersek device is not smooth and that the wall thickness of an ersek model varied at different points and ranged from a minimum thickness of inches to a maximum thickness of inches.cordis noted that the antonsson affidavit addresses a model of an ersek device in its expanded configuration,but that the thickness of the ersek device is not substantially uniform in either its unexpanded or expanded configuration.based on those statements,the district court construed the substantially uniform thickness limitation to require variations in wall surface thickness of less than inch.
the commentary on antonsson measurement of a model,however,does not constitute a clear and unmistakable disclaimer,see omega eng g,at,slip.op.at,excluding stents that vary in thickness by inch or more.cordis did not suggest that the variation of inch was the basis for distinguishing its invention from ersek or that cordis claimed stents vary by less than inch in thickness.rather,cordis basis for distinguishing ersek appears to have been that ersek walls were at least twice as thick at the intersections of strands as along the strands themselves.the alleged disclaimer based on antonsson measurements in the reexamination proceedings was at best ambiguous.see ims,haas automation,in light of the ambiguity of the patentee statements and the subject matter actually disclosed in the references,we can not say that the patentee clearly disavowed coverage of the contested subject matter.
in addressing ersek,cordis focused on the double thickness of the bridge portions of ersek walls.for example,in its response to the examiner reexamination rejection of claims in light of ersek,cordis stated 
as shown in ersek figure the wall of the ersek device is of varying thickness because the strands of the sleeve have twisted out of the plane of the starting material.moreover,the bonds or bridges at the junctions of the strands protrude inwardly and outwardly of the plane of the starting material,and as a result the ersek sleeve has a wall of varying thickness.
since the bonds or bridges extend generally radially outwardly of the sleeve,the sleeve has variance in thickness as compared to the thickness of the starting material in the areas of the bonds or bridges.
figure of the ersek patent is shown herein 
cordis reiterated its contention that ersek did not have a wall surface with a substantially uniform thickness in that submission 
clearly,the ersek sleeve can not be fairly said to have a wall surface with a substantially uniform thickness.the expanded metal ersek sleeve has bridge portions that are several times as thick as the strands the strands extending between the bridge portions are twisted to have inwardly and outwardly projecting edges.this irregular and variable configuration is rough and is the antithesis of substantially uniform thickness.the use of the term substantially uniform does not exclude some variations in dimension between the inner and outer surfaces of the wall.even so,it is clear that ersek rough and irregular wall does not have substantially uniform thickness.antonsson affidavit,paragraph.
at cordis request,george andros submitted a declaration to the pto as a part of the reexamination of the patent.andros stated that t he ersek fixation sleeve does not have a substantially uniform wall thickness,nor is it thin walled.the expanded metal sleeve is twice as thick in some areas as in others,and the thickness of the wall varies throughout.cordis thus focused on the double thickness of the bridge portions of the ersek device,not on antonsson assertion that the thickness of the ersek device varied by up to inch along the strands.
based on our review of the prosecution history,we conclude that a reasonable reading of the patentee statements would not lead one to conclude that variations greater than inch fall outside the scope of the patent.because there is no clear and unmistakable disclaimer of any variation in thickness of inch or more,the district court erred in imposing that numerical restriction on the substantially uniform thickness limitation.the discussion of the ersek patent does,however,support the conclusion that the owner of the patent disclaimed coverage of any device with a variation of at least percent.in any event,quite apart from any disclaimer,a wall that varies in thickness by as much as percent can not be said to be of substantially uniform thickness either literally or by equivalents.
ave contends that,under either party construction,its stents have a variable thickness because they have a round or and thus do not infringe because the thickness of its stent walls varies by more than percent.we disagree and conclude that a stent formed from struts with circular or can have a wall of substantially uniform thickness.
first,both ave and cordis experts agreed that persons of ordinary skill in the art equate thickness with diameter in the case of round struts.second,according to the patents claims,it is the wall surface that needs to have a uniform thickness,and the full circumference of the round strut is not involved in making up the wall surface.the district court described the wall surface by stating that t he outer surface of the tubular member must be disposed in a common cylindrical plane.that common cylindrical plane is formed by an imaginary circle that intersects with the outermost point of each round strut.the thickness of the wall is equal to the diameter of each round strut,the distance between the outer point that intersects the wall surface and the corresponding inner point that intersects a similar imaginary cylindrical surface on the inside of the tubular member.thus,a stent with round struts can have a substantially uniform thickness as long as the round
