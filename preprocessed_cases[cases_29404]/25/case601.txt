this is an action brought under the declaratory judgment act,and the provision of the act establishing civil actions for patent certainty,j c.caraco pharmaceutical laboratories,caraco appeals a decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan dismissing its declaratory judgment action for noninfringement against forest laboratories,et,forest.caraco action was dismissed for lack of article iii jurisdiction on the grounds that it had been rendered moot when forest unilaterally granted caraco a covenant not to sue for infringement of the,patent.however,in the context of the framework,forest covenant not to sue did not eliminate the controversy between the parties.accordingly,we hold that caraco declaratory judgment action presents a continuing article iii controversy,and reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this case arises under the act which governs the food and drug administration fda approval of new and generic drugs.the goal of the act is to strike a balance between two competing policy interests inducing pioneering research and development of new drugs and enabling competitors to bring,generic copies of those drugs to market.andrx,biovail.the following five aspects of the framework are relevant to this case.
first,a pioneering drug company must obtain fda approval for its drug by submitting a new drug application nda.see a,b.as part of the nda process,the drug company must inform the fda of all patents covering its drug or the methods of using the drug,with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture,use,or sale of the drug.see b,c.the fda lists all such patents in a publication titled the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations.this publication is commonly known as the orange book.drugs approved by the fda are known as listed drugs.see j a i.
second,to facilitate the development of generic versions of listed drugs,the act provides an abbreviated new drug application anda process for generic drug manufacturers.see j.the anda process streamlines fda approval of generic drugs by allowing applicants to rely on the results of the safety and efficacy studies that supported the fda approval of a listed drug.see eli lilly medtronic,d.under the anda process,a generic drug company must submit information to show,inter alia,that its generic drug and the relevant listed drug share the same active ingredients and are bioequivalent.j a ii,iv.in addition,generic drug companies must submit one of four certifications addressing each patent covering the listed drug.specifically,the anda filer must certify 
i that the required patent information has not been filed with the fda,
ii that such patent has expired,
iii of the date on which such patent will expire,or 
iv that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.
j a vii.if a generic drug company seeks to market a generic version of a listed drug before the expiration of patents covering that drug,it must file a certification under j a vii iv,a paragraph iv certification.see eli lilly,at.all paragraph iv anda filers must provide notice of their paragraph iv certification to both the patent owner and the nda holder.j b.this notice must set forth a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis for the opinion of the applicant that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed.j b iv ii.
third,the act facilitates the early resolution of patent disputes between generic and pioneering drug companies by providing that the mere act of filing a paragraph iv anda constitutes an act of patent infringement.e eli lilly,at.the act states that it shall be an act of infringement to submit an anda if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval to engage in the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.e.as this court has explained,e is designed to create an artificial act of infringement for purposes of establishing jurisdiction in the federal courts.glaxo group apotex,emphasis in original see also eli lilly,at.quite obviously,the purpose of subsection e is to enable the judicial adjudication upon which the anda scheme depend s.
fourth,to incentivize anda filers to challenge the validity of listed patents or design around those patents as early as possible,the act provides that the first anda applicant to file a paragraph iv certification first paragraph iv anda filer shall enjoy a period of generic marketing exclusivity.see j b iv.until the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period expires,the fda may not approve a paragraph iv anda based on the same nda hereinafter a subsequent paragraph iv anda.id.importantly,the first paragraph iv anda filer is entitled to the exclusivity period whether or not it establishes that the nda holder patents are invalid or not infringed by the drug described in its anda all that is required is that the first paragraph iv anda filer submit a substantially complete anda that contains a paragraph iv certification.j b iv ii bb.
the act provides that the period of exclusivity begins either on the date that the first paragraph iv anda filer begins marketing its generic drug,or on the date of a final court decision finding the relevant patents invalid or not infringed,whichever comes first.see j b iv see also teva pharms.usa,pfizer,pfizer.in other words,the applicable statutory provisions provide for two methods of triggering the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period a trigger pursuant to j b iv i and a trigger pursuant to j b iv ii.only the first paragraph iv anda filer can trigger its exclusivity period via the trigger.see j b iv i.however,subsequent paragraph iv anda filers can trigger the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period via the trigger.mining barr,holding that the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period can be triggered by a court judgment obtained by a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer.
since the fda can not approve subsequent paragraph iv andas until the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period expires,the date on which the exclusivity period is triggered is critical to nda holders and subsequent paragraph iv anda filers.on the one hand,subsequent paragraph iv anda filers have a strong incentive to generate a triggering event allowing the fda to approve their subsequent paragraph iv andas days after the triggering event.on the other hand,nda holders have a strong incentive to prevent a triggering event,because subsequent paragraph iv andas can not be approved until the exclusivity period expires.moreover,because subsequent paragraph iv anda filers can only activate the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period through the trigger,subsequent paragraph iv anda filers have a strong incentive to challenge the nda holder patents in court.conversely,nda holders have a strong incentive to avoid litigation that would trigger the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period and allow the fda to approve subsequent paragraph iv andas days after the triggering event.
for example,if a first paragraph iv anda filer is found liable in a e infringement action or simply fails to market its generic drug,then it has not triggered its own exclusivity period through the trigger or the trigger.in that case,a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer must generate a triggering event in order to activate the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period.j b iv ii,at.more precisely,the subsequent paragraph iv anda filer must obtain a judgment that the nda holder patents are invalid or not infringed by the drug described in its subsequent paragraph iv anda.j b iv ii.however,if the nda holder can prevent the subsequent paragraph iv anda filer court challenge,it can delay fda approval of the subsequent paragraph iv anda and thus delay the subsequent paragraph iv anda filer entry into the market.see a providing that n o person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug,unless an approval of an nda or anda is effective with respect to such a drug indeed,an nda holder could thus delay any subsequent paragraph iv anda filer from entering the market until the nda holder patents expire 
the fifth and final aspect of the act relevant to this case is the civil action to obtain patent certainty capc.see j c.the capc is designed to prevent nda holders from gaming the act by forestalling the resolution of patent disputes with anda filers.teva pharms.usa,novartis pharms,novartis.under the capc provisions,if the nda holder fails to sue a paragraph iv anda filer within days,the anda filer can sue the nda holder to obtain a declaratory judgment that the relevant patents are invalid or not infringed.j c.
in addition,congress extended federal jurisdiction over capcs to the extent consistent with the constitution.e.accordingly,federal courts have jurisdiction over capcs to the extent that they present an article iii case or controversy.novartis,at.congress explained the need for broad federal jurisdiction over capcs as follows 
w hen generic applicants are blocked by a first generic applicant exclusivity,the brand drug company could choose not to sue those other generic applicants so as to delay a final court decision that could trigger the failure to market provision and force the first generic to market.
in these circumstances,generic applicants must be able to seek a resolution of disputes involving all patents listed in the orange book with respect to the drug immediately upon the expiration of the period.we believe there can be a case or controversy sufficient for courts to hear these cases merely because the patents at issue have been listed in the fda orange book,and because the statutory scheme of the act relies on early resolution of patent disputes.the declaratory judgment provisions in this bill are intended to encourage such early resolution of patent disputes.

forest nda for lexapro 
forest holds an approved nda for its drug lexapro,which is used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder.forest currently faces no generic competition for lexapro.forest,ivax,d.
as part of the process for filing its lexapro nda,forest listed two patents in the fda orange book,namely patent nos.re.the patent and the patent.the patent includes claims covering substantially pure forms of escitalopram,the active ingredient of lexapro.the patent generally covers crystalline particles of escitalopram oxate of a particular size range,as well as dosage forms containing particles of this size range,and methods of manufacturing particles in this size range.the patent expires in the patent expires in.
b.the first paragraph iv challenge to forest patents for lexapro and the consequences for subsequent paragraph iv anda filers 
the first anda applicant to file a paragraph iv certification for forest and patents was ivax pharmaceuticals,ivax.accordingly,ivax is entitled to days of generic market exclusivity,which will begin either on the day it begins marketing its generic drug,or on the date a court determines that the and patents are invalid or not comes first.see j b iv.
forest responded to ivax paragraph iv anda by suing ivax for infringement of the patent,the earlier of the two patents to expire.ivax counterclaimed that the patent was invalid.despite suing ivax on the patent,forest did not sue ivax for infringement of the patent.by holding the patent in reserve,forest insulated itself from an invalidity or noninfringement challenge by ivax ultimately,forest defeated ivax counterclaim of invalidity on the patent and obtained a judgment that the drug described in ivax anda infringed the patent,which was affirmed by this court in forest,ivax.
in sum,after filing a paragraph iv certification for both the and patents in its anda,ivax failed to obtain a court judgment that either the or the patent is invalid or not infringed by the drug described in its anda.because ivax has not obtained a judgment that both of forest patents are invalid or not infringed by the generic drug described in its anda,ivax failed to trigger its exclusivity period via the trigger,j b iv ii.
in addition,because the generic drug described in ivax anda was found to infringe the patent,ivax can not trigger its exclusivity period via the trigger,j b iv i,until the patent expires in.indeed,the district court specifically enjoined ivax from making,using,offering to sell or selling within the united states,or importing into the united states any products that infringe the patent,including the drug products referred to in ivax anda until such time as the patent expires forest,ivax,judgment order.as a result,ivax can not activate its exclusivity period via the trigger until the patent expires.
with ivax no longer able to trigger its exclusivity period,only two pathways remain open to subsequent paragraph iv anda filers who seek to trigger ivax exclusivity period before the patent expires in.first,a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer could obtain a court judgment invalidating the patent,which would allow the fda to approve ivax drug.with fda approval,ivax would be legally free to sell its generic drug,and its exclusivity period would be triggered on the day of its first commercial marketing.see j b iv i the trigger.second,a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer could trigger ivax exclusivity period of when ivax begins marketing its the trigger,j b iv ii.however,because ivax was the first paragraph iv anda filer with respect to both the and patents,a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer can only activate ivax exclusivity period via the trigger by obtaining a judgment that both the and patents are invalid or not infringed.
if a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer is not able to pursue either of these two pathways to triggering ivax exclusivity period,then ivax exclusivity period can not begin until the patent expires in.moreover,assuming there has been no other triggering event by that time,ivax exclusivity period will not be triggered on the date the patent expires unless ivax actually begins marketing its generic drug on that date.even if ivax does so,the fda will still be restricted from approving any subsequent paragraph iv anda until days after the date the patent expires see j b iv.
in short,absent an event triggering ivax exclusivity,all subsequent paragraph iv anda filers,including caraco,will be denied entry to the drug market for a significant time.these subsequent paragraph iv anda filers will be precluded from the market regardless of whether the generic drugs described in their andas infringe forest patents and regardless of whether forest patents are valid.
caraco subsequent challenge to forest patents for lexapro 
in may,caraco filed an anda for generic escitalopram that included a paragraph iv certification for forest and patents for lexapro.under e,this constituted a technical act of infringement of both patents.forest sued caraco for infringement of the patent in a lawsuit filed in the eastern district of michigan,forest,caraco pharm,case as of the time of this writing,the parties litigation with respect to the patent is ongoing.
despite suing caraco for infringement of the patent,forest did not sue caraco on the patent.however as discussed above,under the framework caraco has an economic interest in determining whether the patent is invalid or not infringed by the drug described in its anda,because only a judgment of invalidity or noninfringement with respect to both the and patents can trigger ivax exclusivity period.see j b iv ii.accordingly,caraco filed a separate action under the declaratory judgment act,and the provision establishing the capc,j c,seeking a declaratory judgment that the drug described in its anda does not infringe forest patent.caraco declaratory judgment action with respect to the patent is the case presently on appeal.
shortly after caraco sued forest for a declaratory judgment on the patent,forest filed a motion to dismiss caraco action pursuant to.b on the grounds that the action did not present a case or controversy as required by article iii of the constitution.in its motion,forest argued that there was no controversy because caraco did not have a reasonable apprehension of suit on the patent.at the time forest filed its motion,this court most recent precedent governing the justiciability of declaratory judgment suits applied the test to determine whether a justiciable controversy existed.see,pfizer,at.however,as is discussed in more detail below,even before forest filed its motion,the supreme court found the test inconsistent with its precedent.medimmune,genentech,d.the court explained in medimmune that whether a declaratory judgment action presents an article iii controversy must be determined based on all the circumstances,not merely on whether the declaratory judgment plaintiff is under a reasonable apprehension of suit.id.at.
in addition,after forest filed its motion to dismiss but before the district court made its ruling,this court issued its decision in novartis.as in the present case,the issue in novartis was whether a paragraph iv anda filer declaratory judgment action against an nda holder presented a justiciable article iii case or controversy.id.at.in novartis,teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva was the first anda applicant to file a paragraph iv certification on all five patents covering an fda approved drug owned by novartis pharmaceuticals novartis.id.at.although teva had filed a paragraph iv certification for all five of novartis patents,novartis only brought suit under e a for infringement of one of those patents id.
after novartis filed suit,teva brought a separate action against novartis on the four remaining patents.id.at.however,the district court dismissed teva declaratory judgment action for lack of a justiciable controversy on the grounds that teva had no reasonable apprehension of suit on the four remaining patents.id.this dismissal was the subject of the appeal in novartis.id.on appeal,the court observed that the supreme court medimmune decision had abrogated the test,novartis,at,and applying the supreme court test,the court found that there was a justiciable controversy between the parties,id.at.in reaching this decision,the court held that 
a justiciable declaratory judgment controversy arises for an anda filer when a patentee lists patents in the orange book,the anda applicant files its anda certifying the listed patents under paragraph iv,and the patentee brings an action against the submitted anda on one or more of the patents.the combination of these three circumstances is dispositive in establishing an actual declaratory judgment controversy as to all the paragraph iv certified patents,whether the patentee has sued on all or only some of the paragraph iv certified patents.
in thus applying the test to a declaratory judgment action between an anda filer and a pharmaceutical patentee,the novartis decision eliminates forest argument that caraco declaratory judgment action should be dismissed because caraco had no reasonable apprehension of suit on the patent.after the novartis decision issued,forest unilaterally granted caraco an irrevocable covenant not to sue for infringement of the patent.forest stated goal in granting the covenant to caraco was to confirm that there was no case or controversy between the parties regarding the patent.forest covenant provides,in relevant part 
forest hereby covenants itself and all successors in interest to the patent not to sue caraco for any alleged infringement whether direct or indirect or violation of the patent based on caraco filing of anda or any commercial manufacture,use,sale,offer for sale or importation of the generic products described by anda.
notably,despite giving caraco this covenant not to sue,forest refused to concede that the patent was invalid or not infringed by the drug described in caraco anda.in fact,forest hinged its entire argument for dismissal on the covenant not to sue,stating there is no controversy because we gave a covenant not to sue.the district court agreed,stating from the bench that t here a covenant not to sue on the so there not going to be any loss,there no threat of lawsuit.transcript of hearing on motion to dismiss at may,emphasis added.on this basis,the district court ruled that there was no article iii controversy and granted forest motion to dismiss.notably,there is no indication in the record that the district court considered either the supreme court medimmune decision or this court novartis decision when making this ruling.
iii.analysis 
a district court dismissal of a declaratory judgment action for lack of jurisdiction presents a question of law that this court reviews de novo.novartis,at.
our starting point in analyzing caraco appeal is the declaratory judgment act,a,under which caraco filed this suit.the relevant text of the act provides 
in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
a.it is well established that the phrase actual controversy in a includes any controversy over which there is article iii jurisdiction.aetna life ins.haworth.noting that the word actual is one of emphasis rather than of definition.in addition,with respect to declaratory judgment actions brought by paragraph iv anda filers against nda holders to establish noninfringement or invalidity of patents,congress has specifically granted federal courts subject matter jurisdiction to the extent consistent with the constitution.e.thus,federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over such actions to the extent that they present an article iii case or controversy.see novartis,at.
in medimmune,the supreme court reaffirmed the proper standard for determining whether a declaratory judgment action satisfies the article iii case or controversy requirement.at.specifically,the court framed the justiciability inquiry as whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.id.quoting.cas.pac.coal oil.in addition,the supreme court emphasized that article iii requires that the dispute be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests and that it be real and substantial and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.id.quoting aetna life,at.
in novartis this court held that we must follow medimmune s teaching to look at all the circumstances to determine whether an action for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement or patent invalidity presents a justiciable article iii controversy.at.accordingly,novartis acknowledged that this court test was overruled by medimmune.see also sandisk stmicroelectronics.the test required both an explicit threat or other action by the patentee,which creates a reasonable apprehension on the part of the declaratory plaintiff that it will face an infringement suit and present activity which could constitute infringement or concrete steps taken with the intent to conduct such an activity.novartis,at.following medimmune,proving a reasonable apprehension of suit is only one of many ways a patentee can satisfy the supreme court more general test to establish that an action presents a justiciable article iii controversy.
in applying the test to caraco declaratory judgment action,we are guided by the supreme court framework for determining whether an action presents a justiciable article iii controversy.in particular,an action is justiciable under article iii only where the plaintiff has standing,lujan defenders of wildlife,d,the issues presented are ripe for judicial review,abbott labs.gardner,d,and the case is not rendered moot at any stage of the litigation,united states parole comm geraghty,d.for the following reasons,we hold that caraco declaratory judgment action satisfies these requirements and presents a justiciable article iii controversy.
the supreme court has explained that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains the following three requirements 
first and foremost,there must be alleged and ultimately proved an injury in fact a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff injury and the conduct of the defendant.and third,there must be likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.

caraco alleges a judicially cognizable 
in this case,as in most declaratory judgment actions in the patent context,caraco alleged is a restraint on the free exploitation of goods,red wing shoe.here,caraco alleges it is being excluded from selling a product because forest has taken actions that delay the fda from approving caraco anda.see novartis,at observing that an anda filer suffers the requisite where its ability to secure approval of its anda has been prevented by an nda holder.
as this court explained in novartis,the framework presents a different set of circumstances than those which underlie an ordinary infringement action ordinarily,a potential competitor in other fields is legally free to market its product in the face of an patent.in contrast,under the act an anda filer is not legally free to enter the market without fda approval.at.indeed,a provides that n o person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug,unless an approval of an nda or anda is effective with respect to such a drug.thus,by preventing the fda from approving the andas of generic drug manufacturers,pharmaceutical patentees like forest can potentially exclude generic drugs from the market.if caraco is correct that its generic drug does not infringe forest patent,then it has a right to enter the generic drug market,and its exclusion from the generic drug market by forest actions is a sufficient article iii.moreover,the fact that forest actions can only exclude caraco from the drug market in the context of the framework does not render caraco injury any less concrete,actual or imminent.steel,at.
in sum,caraco alleges that it has been restrain ed from the free exploitation of goods,red wing shoe,at.this is exactly the type of that is sufficient to establish article iii standing under our caselaw.see see also novartis,at explaining that an nda holder use of an patent to exclude a generic drug maker from the market creates the exact type of uncertainty of legal rights that the anda declaratory judgment action the capc,j c was enacted to prevent 
caraco injury is traceable to forest 
caraco injury is also fairly traceable to the conduct of the defendant,steel,at.it is not the act or the fda framework that prevents caraco anda from being approved by the fda,but rather forest actions in the under all the circumstances,medimmune.at the framework.simply put,if forest had not listed its and patents in the fda orange book as valid patents covering the drug described in its nda for lexapro,then j b iv would not independently delay caraco anda from being approved by the fda.such causation is sufficient to satisfy the traceability requirement of article iii standing.see duke power carolina envtl.study group,d.
as discussed above,where the first paragraph iv anda filer has failed to trigger its own exclusivity period,the nda holder listing of patents delays a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer from entering the marketplace indefinitely.moreover,this delay occurs even if the drug described in the subsequent paragraph iv anda does not infringe the patents.here,forest listing of the and patents in the effectively denies caraco an economic opportunity to enter the marketplace unless caraco can obtain a judgment that both those patents are invalid or not infringed by its generic drug.under these circumstances,forest listing of the patent the in the creates an independent barrier to the drug market that deprives caraco of an economic opportunity to compete.it is well established that the creation of such barriers to compete satisfies the causation requirement of article iii standing.see,ne.chapter,associated contractors of am.jacksonville,d holding that the imposition of a barrier to bid for certain government contracts satisfied the and causation requirements of article iii standing clements fashing,d holding that the imposition of an obstacle to plaintiff candidacy for higher judicial office satisfied the and causation requirements of article iii standing zenith radio hazeltine research,d holding that the plaintiff had standing to sue where it alleged that it had been denied a share of the market.
caraco injury is redressible by a favorable judgment 
finally,caraco is redressible by a declaratory judgment that the patent is not infringed a favorable judgment in this case would clear the path to fda approval that forest actions would otherwise deny,using the trigger of j b iv ii to activate ivax exclusivity period.if caraco obtains a favorable judgment that the drug described in its anda does not infringe forest patent,then it will only need a judgment of invalidity or noninfringement on forest patent in order to activate ivax exclusivity period and obtain fda approval as swiftly as possible.thus,a favorable judgment in this action would eliminate the potential for the patent to exclude caraco from the drug market 
in sum,caraco declaratory judgment action satisfies the,causation,and redressibility requirements of standing.moreover,even beyond satisfying the requirements of article iii standing,caraco action is consistent with the basic purpose of the declaratory judgment act.as this court has previously explained,the purpose of the declaratory judgment act in patent cases is to provide the allegedly infringing party relief from uncertainty and delay regarding its legal rights.goodyear tire rubber releasomers,see also novartis,at the declaratory judgment act and e serve the policies underlying the patent laws by enabling a test of the validity and infringement of patents that are being used only as scarecrows.quoting arrowhead indus.water,ecolochem.
in claiming that it has been denied the right to sell generic drugs,caraco has alleged precisely the type of injury that the declaratory judgment act is designed to remedy.see goodyear tire rubber,at red wing shoe,at see generally borchard,declaratory judgments ed discussing the history of the declaratory judgment act.in particular,caraco alleges that forest actions exclude it from the market without ever subjecting forest patent to a court determination of its scope caraco essentially argues that forest actions may allow it to use a restricted narrowly drafted patent to justify much wider claims of infringement,borchard,supra,at.indeed,caraco claims that it is being excluded from the drug market by forest patent even though the generic drug described in its anda may not infringe the patent.
finally,caraco declaratory judgment action is also consistent with the basic goal of the act,which is to balance the need for pharmaceutical innovation with the need for generic drug competition.andrx,at.as previously noted,a significant part of this carefully crafted dialectic balance is encouraging the early resolution of patent disputes when subsequent paragraph iv anda filers are blocked by a first generic applicant exclusivity.see cong.rec,remarks of kennedy 
whether an action is ripe requires an evaluation of both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott,at.as to the first prong,an action is fit for judicial review where further factual development would not significantly advance a court ability to deal with the legal issues presented.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d.as to the second prong,withholding court consideration of an action causes hardship to the plaintiff where the conduct has an immediate and substantial impact on the plaintiff.gardner toilet goods ass n,d.
in this case,both prongs of the ripeness inquiry are satisfied.first,additional factual development would not advance the district court ability to decide caraco action for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement.caraco has a complete generic drug product that has been submitted to the fda for approval,and no additional facts are required to determine whether this drug product infringes the claims of forest patent.second,if caraco drug does not infringe forest patent,then withholding court consideration of caraco declaratory judgment action has the immediate and substantial impact of forestalling caraco ability to activate ivax exclusivity period through the trigger of j b iv ii as noted earlier,only a judgment of invalidity or noninfringement with respect to both the and patents can trigger ivax exclusivity period pursuant to j b iv ii.thus,if caraco drug does not infringe forest patent,then delaying court consideration of caraco declaratory judgment action on the patent delays the date on which the fda is authorized to approve caraco anda.specifically,caraco would be delayed until at least days after the patent expires in.because caraco can not market its generic drug without fda approval,being delayed from resolving its claim to noninfringement of the patent creates a potential for lost profits.accordingly,caraco action is ripe for judicial review.
the mootness doctrine requires that the requisite personal stake that is required for a party to have standing at the outset of an action must continue to exist throughout all stages of the action.geraghty,at.the supreme court has articulated the mootness standard as follows 
simply stated,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.where one of the several issues presented becomes moot,the remaining live issues supply the constitutional requirement of a case or controversy.
powell mccormack,d internal citations omitted.the question here is whether forest unilateral covenant not to sue caraco on the patent renders caraco declaratory judgment action moot.
to be sure,forest covenant not to sue eliminates any reasonable apprehension of suit on the patent.if a threat of suit was the only action allegedly taken by forest that effectively excluded caraco from the marketplace,the covenant not to sue would moot caraco case and divest the district court of article iii jurisdiction.see,super sack chase packaging.but see fort james solo cup,holding that a patentee covenant not to sue an alleged infringer after a jury verdict of noninfringement did not moot the alleged infringer counterclaim for unenforceability.however,caraco does not only allege that it has a reasonable apprehension of suit on the patent.caraco also alleges that the listing of the patent in the orange book effectively prevents caraco from entering the drug market.essentially,caraco is alleging that it has been denied entry to the market in a manner that is unique to the context.
clearly,in the ordinary infringement context,even when a patentee maintains that its patents are valid and infringed by a potential defendant,a covenant not to sue allows the recipient to enter the marketplace.indeed,a covenant not to sue on a patent ensures that the covenant recipient will not be liable for damages or subject to an injunction for infringement of that patent.however,in the context,regardless of a covenant not to sue,a generic drug manufacturer can not enter the market without fda approval.moreover,an nda holder covenant not to sue a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer does not affect the fda authority to approve the anda.as discussed above,where the first paragraph iv anda filer fails to trigger its own exclusivity period,a subsequent paragraph iv anda filer can only obtain fda approval before the relevant patents expire by obtaining a judgment that those patents are invalid or not infringed.such a judgment is required to trigger the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period and thus allow the fda to approve the subsequent paragraph iv anda days after the triggering event.under these circumstances,even after a covenant not to sue has been granted,the dispute as to infringement or invalidity of the relevant patents constitutes a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune.at.
here,forest covenant not to sue caraco does not allow caraco to enter the generic drug market.only by obtaining a judgment of noninfringement on both the and patents can caraco trigger ivax exclusivity period,which currently prevents the fda from approving caraco anda.without a judgment of noninfringement on the patent,even if caraco prevailed against forest in the separate infringement action on the patent,caraco would not be able to activate ivax exclusivity period via the trigger of j b iv ii.moreover,until ivax exclusivity period expires,the fda can not approve caraco anda.see j b iv.thus,terminating this action without a judgment with respect to infringement on the patent could delay fda approval of caraco anda and thereby exclude caraco from the drug market,even if its generic drug does not infringe the patent.in these circumstances,forest covenant not to sue caraco does not eliminate the controversy between the parties.
in sum,caraco declaratory judgment action presents an article iii controversy as to whether the drug described in caraco anda infringes forest patent.this controversy is not premised only upon a threat of an infringement suit.a controversy also exists because forest actions effectively prevent the fda from approving caraco anda and thus exclude caraco from the drug market.forest covenant not to sue does not eliminate the controversy with caraco,because the controversy can only be resolved by a judgment that determines whether forest patent is infringed by the drug described in caraco anda.accordingly,we hold that this action presents an ongoing article iii case and controversy.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court decision dismissing caraco declaratory judgment action and remand for further consideration.
reversed and remanded 
i would affirm.
a.in most instances an alleged infringer seeks a declaratory judgment of or patent invalidity to protect itself from a subsequent judicial determination that has a significant adverse financial impact upon the infringer.the present case involves no such danger or possibility,since the covenant not to sue precludes forest the proprietary manufacturer from subjecting caraco the generic manufacturer to damages for infringement of the patent.
here caraco reason for seeking a declaratory judgment of is quite different.its concern is not that it may be sued for infringement if it markets its generic version of the patented drug,but that unless it can obtain a present judicial determination of that issue,its ability to enter the market may be delayed.this claim stems from and is based upon the particular provisions of the act.
under that act someone seeking to market a generic version of a patented drug files an abbreviated new drug application known as an anda.the filing of an anda constitutes an act of infringement.if,within days of receiving a notice of such filing that alleges that the patent on the drug is invalid or that the proposed generic drug does not infringe the patent,the proprietary manufacturer sues the generic manufacturer for infringement,the food and drug administration can not approve the anda for thirty months.the act also provides that the first generic manufacturer to file an anda covering the patented drug has the exclusive right to sell such generic product for days following the first sale of the generic product or a court decision holding the patent invalid or not infringed.this provision,under which the period of exclusivity is triggered by a judicial decision holding the patent invalid or not infringed,is the basis for caraco contention that there was an actual case or controversy before the district court despite fores
