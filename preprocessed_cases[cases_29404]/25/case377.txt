the amendments help to expedite the marketing of generic drugs.drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat.getting a new branded drug to market is a process.the manufacturer must file a new drug application nda with the food and drug administration fda,showing the new drug is safe and effective and identifying the number and expiration date of any patent or patents applicable to the drug.a,b.fda has to publish this information.id.b.it meets this obligation by publishing a directory of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations also known as the orange book,a printed cumulative supplement to the orange book,and an electronic version of the orange book.
a manufacturer preparing to market a generic bioequivalent of a branded drug can take a filing an abbreviated new drug application anda that piggybacks on the original manufacturer evidence of safety and efficacy.id.j.to start the process,the anda applicant must each patent claiming a drug for which the applicant is seeking one of four paragraphs that i patent information has not been filed ii the patent has expired iii the patent will expire on a specified date or iv the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.id.j a vii.the first drug manufacturer to file an approved anda,containing a paragraph iv certification,is rewarded with a period of marketing exclusivity for the manufacturer generic version of the drug.id.j b iv.marketing exclusivity is valuable,designed to compensate manufacturers for research and development costs as well as the risk of litigation from patent holders.see e a stating a generic drug company certifying under paragraph iv commits an act of infringement for which the drug patent holder can sue.in this case,we referee an unusual dispute between fda and an anda applicant about the effect of a paragraph iv certification submitted after the patent had been withdrawn by the nda holder but before fda deleted the patent information from the hardcopy version of the orange book.
fda insists reality matters.the point of paragraph iv,the agency argues,is to reward risk when an applicant challenges a patent that would otherwise preclude price competition.teva pharmaceuticals counters that fda obligations to keep the industry reliably informed is least in punishing the agency inadvertence when the orange book does not reflect the agency most current information.
janssen pharmaceuticals got fda approval to market risperdal in and submitted information for two patents,the patent and the patent.see letter from janet woodcock,acting director,cder,fda to jaskot,teva pharmaceuticals usa,regarding docket and february,fda letter at.fda listed both patents in the orange book.on april,janssen withdrew the patent for several different strengths of the drug,and on june,sent fda a clarification requesting the withdrawal of remaining strengths.id.fda modified its patent listing database on june,and updated the electronic orange book to reflect the delisting sometime between june,and july.id.fda conceded in its brief that neither the printed orange book nor its printed cumulative supplement reflected the delisting until.
meanwhile,on august,teva submitted an anda for a generic version of risperdal,containing a paragraph iv certification to the patent.id.at.fda promptly informed teva that the patent had been delisted and asked teva to submit a revised anda.id.teva acquiesced.id.approximately six years later,teva filed a citizen petition contesting fda actions.id.at.teva asked fda to relist the patent and confirm teva eligibility for the marketing exclusivity based on their original anda.id.fda refused.id.
teva challenged the decision in district court and sought an expedited preliminary injunction.the district court consolidated the motion for preliminary injunction with the merits case and granted judgment in favor of teva.on september,we issued an expedited mandate reversing the decision of the district court granting judgment in favor of teva,and vacating the district court injunction.
at the outset,we reject teva claim that fda raises arguments on appeal not presented to the district court.teva confusion is partially explained by its misreading of fda decision letter and its tendency to construe the statute independent publication mandate as if it modified the certification requirement.as explained more fully below,these requirements remain separate.and that is the position consistently asserted by fda.fda effort to refine and clarify its analysis in light of the district court ruling can not be transmuted into a waiver of its arguments on appeal.see yee city of escondido,d once a federal claim is properly presented,a party can make any argument in support of that claim parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.
turning to the merits,we review fda interpretation of the act it administers under step one of the analysis in chevron,nrdc,d t he court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.the statute provides that,in order to qualify for the marketing exclusivity under paragraph iv,an anda must contain,inter alia 
a certification with respect to each patent which claims the listed drug or which claims a use for such listed drug for which the applicant is seeking approval that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.
j a vii emphasis added.the same requirement appears,with slight variation,in the fda regulation.see a.how a manufacturer triggers the marketing exclusivity is clear under the text of the statute no anda applicant can obtain exclusivity without a proper paragraph iv certification.j b iv.a successful paragraph iv certification must identify a patent that claims the listed drug or that claims a use for such listed drug for which the applicant is seeking approval.id.j a vii.in the absence of such a patent,there can be no paragraph iv exclusivity.
teva anda did not meet the clear and unambiguous requirements of the statute because it did not and could not include a certification to a patent that claimed risperdal according to black law dictionary,a patent claim is a formal statement describing the novel features of an invention and defining the scope of the patent protection.black law dictionary ed.the statute requires nda holders to ascertain if,under substantive patent law,any patents claim the drugs for which the nda holder submitted an application and then provide fda with patent information for any drug which falls within the scope of a patent protection.b.the legislative purpose underlying paragraph iv is to enhance competition by encouraging generic drug manufacturers to challenge the patent information provided by nda holders in order to bring generic drugs to market earlier.thus,for paragraph iv purposes,a claim is simply a description of the subject a patent purports to cover as established by the nda holder.see engine mfrs.ass epa,recognizing if a statute clearly requires a particular outcome,then the mere fact that it does so implicitly rather than expressly does not mean that it is silent in the chevron sense.all patent claim information is provided by the nda holder.therefore,as a practical matter,a patent claims a drug when the nda holder says it does.
when it comes to the veracity of the patent information supplied by nda holders,fda operates in a purely ministerial role,relying on the nda holders to provide the agency with accurate patent information.see am.bioscience,thompson.this approach is consistent with the statute,which requires fda to publish submitted patent information,but does not require fda to review the merits of the patent information provided.b.several courts have affirmed this commonsense policy choice.see,am.bioscience,at apotex,thompson,aaipharma thompson,cir.consequently,in determining what drugs a patent claims or covers for purposes of a paragraph iv certification,the patent actual scope is irrelevant.see,purepac pharm.torpharm.rather,fda must base its decisio
