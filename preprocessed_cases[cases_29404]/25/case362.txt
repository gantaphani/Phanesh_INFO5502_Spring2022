background 
this appeal arises out of a business dispute between,a company that manufactures transdermal pharmaceutical patches,and aronowitz,an inventor of diagnostic medical products.in,the parties signed three agreements,a master agreement,a license agreement,and a security agreement collectively contract,by which they agreed to enter into a joint venture for the marketing and development of one of aronowitz inventions,the td glucose patch,a transdermal patch that takes a diabetic glucose reading without having to draw blood.under the contract,agreed to provide per month in funding to aronowitz to help develop the patch at diagnostic division research facility and to employ him there as a director and consultant also agreed to pay a licensing fee to aronowitz for rights in his diagnostic products,including an licensing fee of approximately for the first three months.the contract also gave an option eventually to buy the rights to the td glucose patch.
after a series of disputes over money owed under the contract,and sensing that the venture was not working out,the parties met and negotiated a new arrangement in in order that could cease further funding of its diagnostic division and that aronowitz could assume financial responsibility and management direction of the td glucose development business,with minimum interruption to the operations,exh.g at.under the new arrangement,the parties agreed that aronowitz employment with would cease and that he would create a new business entity to develop the td glucose patch.the parties also agreed to the assignment of the contract to the new entity such as to terminate all obligations and stipulations of the contracts between aronowitz and corporation,as of the date of the agreement and to have the new entity assume them.id.at.the contract further provided that 
if the assignment of the contract,as described above,is not performed,nevertheless the parties agree to terminate all financial obligations of corporation to aronowitz and his business entities as of the above date of this agreement,including specifically,but not exclusively,ceasing all financial obligations of corporation with regard to the diagnostic division.
id.although the new agreement terminated obligation to provide monthly funding for the development of the td glucose patch,did agree to provide certain supplies and equipment to notably weiss wands,which were necessary to perform the clinical trials.id.at.the parties also agreed to a payments and expenses provision which allocated certain specific expenses and provided that a ny expenses not specifically listed would become the responsibility of the party to whom the goods or services were delivered based on the date of delivery.id.at.under this provision,was responsible for any goods or services delivered prior to execution of the contract and aronowitz was responsible for any unlisted goods or services delivered thereafter.
the contract also granted aronowitz new entity a limited license to use the trademark diagnostics in connection with its td glucose patch development.such use was to be limited to the new entity company name and literature.id.finally,under the contract,retained an option to purchase the rights to the td glucose patch,and aronowitz was guaranteed five percent of net sales.
within two weeks of its execution,disputes arose between the parties over the provisions of the contract.aronowitz alleged that had failed to pay the electricity bill at the now transferred diagnostic division research facility and that the power was going to be cut off he also alleged that had failed to provide him with the weiss wands.aronowitz asserted that conduct entitled him to cancel its option on the td glucose patch.
in june,aronowitz filed suit against.in an amended complaint,he alleged two separate counts of breach of contract one for the contract and one for the contract.raised,inter alia,the defense of novation with respect to the contract,arguing that the agreement superseded the agreement and nullified any possible claim for breach.also initiated a counterclaim against aronowitz for trademark infringement,alleging that aronowitz had used the more general mark without its permission.a jury trial was held in october.at the close of aronowitz case,moved for judgment as a matter of law on two grounds first,that the contract effectuated a novation of the contract,thereby eliminating any claim for breach of the contract and,second,that aronowitz claimed damages for lost profits under the contract were too speculative.the trial court grudgingly denied the motion at.renewed its motion at the close of all of the evidence.the court again denied the motion,this time stating that it was concerned about the effect that the agreement had on the agreement,but was not going to prevent the jury at this point from considering it.at.aronowitz moved for judgment as a matter of law on the trademark infringement claim the court also denied that motion.
just prior to closing arguments and jury instruction,proposed two alternative amended verdict forms.the first,which omitted any mention of breach as to the contract,would have been applicable had the court granted judgment as a matter of law on the issue of novation.the second began by asking the jury to decide whether the contract had been superseded by the contract.the court ruled against use of either of the proposed forms.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of aronowitz as to each breach of contract claim.specifically,it awarded damages of as to breach of the contract and million as to breach of the contract.the jury,however,returned a verdict against aronowitz on counterclaim,finding that aronowitz had infringed on the trademark.on that claim,it awarded in damages to.the parties renewed their respective motions for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court addressed together in its february omnibus order.
with respect to renewed motion,the district court first observed that the only fair construction of the plain terms of the contract was that the parties intended to extinguish their contractual obligations under the contract,effecting a novation as a matter of law and making t he jury finding to the contrary legally unreasonable.at.the court went on to find that even if that construction were incorrect,the only reasonable conclusion based upon the evidence presented at trial was that the parties intended the agreement to extinguish the contract.id.the court concluded that aronowitz contention that the agreement applie d only prospectively fell short of creating a substantial conflict in the evidence and that was entitled to judgment as a matter of law in its favor as to breach of the contract.id.
as to the jury million verdict for breach of the contract,operating under the assumption that the award had been based solely on aronowitz alleged lost profits,the court observed that the record fails to contain sufficiently competent and substantial evidence to demonstrate a causal connection between breach and aronowitz lost future profits.id.at.the court reasoned that too many obstacles stood between fulfilled obligations under the contract and the td glucose patch generation of profit.the court particularly pointed to the need to raise at least million more for research and development,the completion of successful clinical trials,obtaining fda approval,and proving success in the market.
the court went on to observe that even if a causal connection had been shown,insufficient evidence was presented to measure the damages with reasonable certainty.id.at.however,because the court also found that the record contained sufficient evidence to support the jury conclusion that did breach the contract,the court entered judgment in favor of aronowitz,but in the amount of only in nominal damages as required by florida law.
as to the trademark infringement claim,aronowitz had argued for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that he had not used the mark without permission and,even if he had,that the use was not likely to cause confusion.the district court rejected these arguments,observing that the license given in connection with aronowitz research and development efforts had been limited to the use of the name diagnostics,but that aronowitz had gone further and used the more general and separately registered mark on his entity website.because the mark used was not equivalent to diagnostics,the court found that there had been an illicit and unauthorized use.the court then pointed to evidence in the record that both customers and potential employees had been confused by the use customers had mistaken aronowitz website for and a potential employee had mistakenly believed that was located in pompano beach,florida.accordingly,the court found that enough evidence had been presented as to each element of the trademark infringement claim to create a substantial conflict in the evidence,thereby making judgment as a matter of law inappropriate.id.at.the court also upheld the jury verdict imposing in damages,explaining that courts have wide discretion in determining the just amount of recovery on a trademark infringement claim and that had presented sufficient evidence to support the award of prospective corrective damages.id.at.
finally,the court made a conditional ruling on alternative motion for a new trial.the court found,for the same reasons covered in its discussions of breach,that the jury verdicts as to breach of the and contracts had been against the great weight of the evidence presented.the court also found it had erred in refusing to submit two special interrogatories had requested be added to the verdict form regarding whether the agreements were terminated by the agreements,and whether aronowitz had fraudulently induced to enter into the contract,despite the fact that both novation and fraudulent inducement were material issues raised by the pleadings and evidence presented at trial.id.at.in light of these errors,the court granted motion for a new trial in the alternative,in case the court judgments as a matter of law were reversed on appeal.
on appeal,aronowitz argues that the district court erred in finding,as a matter of law,that the contract constituted novation of the contract reducing the million verdict to in nominal damages on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury award on the basis of lost profits denying aronowitz motion for judgment as a matter of law on the trademark infringement counterclaim and conditionally granting a new trial in the alternative.aronowitz also argues that,in the event we reverse either judgment as a matter of law but do not reinstate the jury verdicts,he is entitled to a new trial as to damages only.

judgments as a matter of law 
we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.doe celebrity cruises,cir citation omitted.in so doing,we apply the same standard as the district court.rankin evans,cir.the district court may grant judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence or,if timely renewed,after the jury has returned its verdict,as long as there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party.lipphardt durango steakhouse of brandon,cir quoting.in undertaking this analysis we examine all evidence in a light most favorable to the party.celebrity cruises,at citation omitted.
breach of contract 
aronowitz first challenges the court judgment as a matter of law in favor of as to breach of the contract,citing the following points in support of his argument that there was no novation the parties modified the final wording such that it terminated all financial obligations rather than all contractual obligations the assignment of the contract provided for by the contract never actually occurred and the contract included a schedule of expenses which specifically allocated responsibility for expenses going forward,but did not mention debts still owed under the contract.
a novation is a mutual agreement between the parties for the discharge of a valid existing obligation by the substitution of a new valid obligation.jakobi kings creek vill.townhouse ass n,so d,under florida law,four elements are required to effectuate the novation of a binding contract a previously valid contract agreement of the parties to cancel that contract a new valid and binding contract agreement of the parties that the new contract will replace and extinguish the old one.thompson jared kane,so d,jakobi,so d at.the parties concede that the only element at issue here is the intention of the parties as to the contract.
intent may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances surrounding the transaction.thompson,so d at.the question of intent is generally a question of fact for a jury.wolowitz thoroughbred motors,so d.however,w here the terms of a written agreement are not in doubt,the question of whether it effects a novation is one of law for the court.hauser,so d,see also sink sales,so d,finding novation as a matter of law where the parties entered into an entirely new and unambiguous agreement of equal or greater dignity to the agreement first made with respect to the same subject quoting evans borkowski,so d.
here,the language of the contract states that the assignment for which it provides terminate s all obligations and stipulations of the prior contract between aronowitz and corporation,as of the date of the contract execution,exh.g at.further,the contract provides that even absent that assignment,the parties agree to terminate all financial obligations of to aronowitz under the contract.id.we agree with the district court that the only reasonable conclusion based on this language is that the parties intended to extinguish the contract.
even if the contract language were sufficiently ambiguous as to intent regarding the contract to allow us to consider parol evidence,we find that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence at trial is that the parties intended novation.first,aronowitz points out that,before execution of the contract,the draft provision which stated the parties agreed to ceas e all contractual obligations between and aronowitz,was altered to say ceas e all financial obligations.see appellant br.at referring to,exh.g at.aronowitz asserts that this change suggests that the parties intended only to cut off obligation to fund the td glucose patch division,not to extinguish all obligations under the contract.we are not convinced.the context of the paragraph in which the change was made suggests instead that the change was made for the sake of consistency in terms within the sentence rather than out of concern over significant difference in meaning.the entire sentence reads,in pertinent part if the assignment is not performed,nevertheless the parties agree to terminate all financial obligations of to aronowitz including the termination of all employees of at the diagnostic division,and specifically but not exclusively ceasing all financial originally contractual obligations of health chem corp with regard to the diagnostic division and its vendors and obligees,except as set forth in this agreement,exh.g at emphasis added.accordingly,we do not find the replacement of the term contractual with the term financial,in that context,to have created any ambiguity,particularly since what aronowitz asserts,in terms of breach,is a lingering financial obligation.
further,the failure of the parties to complete the assignment of the contract is irrelevant in the face of the contract provision that the parties will terminate and ceas e all financial obligations between the parties even i f the assignment of the contract is not performed.id.additionally,we find that the payment and expenses provision in the contract,assigning responsibility for payments and expenses over the period of transition does not establish that the parties intended the contract to remain binding and in full effect.any financial obligations not specifically mentioned were,by the plain language of the contract,to be terminated.in fact,it seems to us that the presence of a such a payment provision in the contract bolsters contention that the contract was intended to effectuate a severance of the parties business relationship.accordingly,we find that the contract constituted an entirely new and unambiguous agreement of equal or greater dignity to the agreement first made with respect to the same subject.see sink,so d at.as such,we agree with the district court that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is that the contract constituted a novation of the contract.
breach of contract 
aronowitz next challenges the court grant of judgment as a matter of law declaring the million in damages awarded by the jury for breach of the contract to be impermissibly speculative and awarding aronowitz nominal damages instead.in making this ruling,the district court apparently assumed the jury awarded damages solely in compensation for lost profits.
under florida law,an award for expectation damages will not be permitted unless the expected amount can be established with reasonable certainty.towne park smith,so d,lipscher lrp publ ns,cir applying florida law.although a business claiming lost profits is not required to show a successful operational track record,at a minimum,the lost profit damages amount must be determined by some reasonable standard or yardstick.gay mech.contractor,wharfside two,so d,per curiam.we observe that an expectation of royalties on future net sales is merely a subset of lost future profits and therefore subject to the same burden of proof for damages as lost profits would be.
although we agree with the district court that the evidence presented was insufficient to provide any reasonable certainty by which to calculate damages due to lost royalties,we do not see that the damages award made by the jury was necessarily based solely upon lost royalties.during aronowitz closing argument,he asked specifically not only for million in lost royalties,but also for for the weiss wands never purchased by and approximately in connection with a payment from a third party erroneously made to and retained by after execution of the contract.testimony presented by aronowitz during the course of the trial also raised other possible smaller bases for compensatory damages.because it is impossible,in the absence of interrogatories on the verdict form,for us to determine what factors the jury might have considered in calculating its million verdict,we are unable to say that the entirety of that verdict was unsupported however,absent the impermissibly speculative damages claimed for lost royalties,the award could not have reached million.accordingly,we reverse the court judgment as a matter of law reducing the damages to,but we decline to reinstate the jury verdict.
trademark infringement 
aronowitz also appeals the district court denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law on the trademark infringement counterclaim.a successful cause of action for trademark infringement requires the evidence to establish that the infringer used the mark in commerce,without consent and that the use was likely to cause confusion.john harland clarke checks,cir.
aronowitz does not contest the allegation that he used the shorter mark on his company website,but argues that did not and can not show a likelihood of confusion.appellant br.at.we have recognized seven factors to be considered as to the likelihood of confusion type of mark similarity of mark similarity of the products the marks represent similarity of the parties retail outlets and customers similarity of advertising media defendant intent and actual confusion.frehling enters.int l select group,cir.of these,the type of mark and the evidence of actual confusion are the most important.id.
there are four recognized types of mark,ranging from weakest to strongest generic,descriptive,suggestive and arbitrary.id.the stronger the mark,the greater the scope of protection accorded it.id.a mark strength is enhanced where there is little or no use of that mark.id.at.with regard to actual confusion,we have specifically accorded substantial weight to evidence that actual customers were confused by the use of a mark as opposed to other categories of people.safeway stores,safeway disc.drugs,cir.
here,the parties apparently agree that the mark is a suggestive mark,thus putting it in the second strongest category,meriting a higher level of protection than if it were categorized as generic or descriptive.see frehling,at.additionally,the only mention of any usage of the mark is contained in a question aronowitz attorney asked ken brody,chief financial officer,about a company in california that might be using the same name.brody did not confirm it.thus,there is no positive testimony or other evidence that any third party uses the mark,thereby according it even more strength and meriting further protection.see frehling,at.
finally,the record contains evidence of actual confusion.first,there was testimony that potential customers who had been to the diagnostics website looking for transdermal pharmaceutical patches expressed confusion about whether had a facility in florida,about whether still made the patches they were looking for,and about whether was associated with the failure of a previous associated with.there was also testimony that a potential employee of was concerned,after looking at the diagnostics website,about having to relocate to florida,and that a major customer was concerned about the discrepancy between the products described on the website and those claimed to produce.
on the other hand,an interrogatory on the verdict form indicates that the jury found that aronowitz did not intend to infringe on mark.we find no evidence in the record to controvert this finding.accordingly this factor weighs in favor of aronowitz.we agree with the district court that the remaining four factors favor neither side in consideration of all relevant factors,we conclude that because the two most important factors in determining the likelihood of of mark and actual in favor of finding such confusion,there was sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury finding of infringement.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying aronowitz motion for judgment as a matter of law 
damages for infringement 
aronowitz has also challenged the jury damages award as to trademark infringement on the ground that has not demonstrated the value of its mark,made use of its mark,or spent any money on corrective advertising.under the lanham act,damages for trademark infringement may include the defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the cost of the action.ramada inns,gadsden motel,cir citing.further,the lanham act confers upon district courts wide discretion in determining a just amount of recovery for trademark infringement.id.at.unlike in the case of future lost profits caused by breach of contract,lanham act damages may be awarded even when they are not susceptible to precise calculations.id.at.finally,as the jury was instructed,damages sustained by the plaintiff include all elements of injury to the business of the trademark owner proximately resulting from the infringer wrongful acts such as the costs of corrective advertising or injury to business reputation or goodwill.id.at.
brody testified that confusion engendered by aronowitz website among customers and potential employees caused concern,which cost both time and money to explain away on an individual basis.he explained several specific corrective actions that could be used to address the problem generally.based on his pers
