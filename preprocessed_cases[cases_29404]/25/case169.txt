the plaintiffs in this case claim that chelsea therapeutics international,chelsea and several of its corporate collectively,the defendants violated section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,b chelsea stockholder roman zak,both individually and as a class representative for other investors the plaintiffs,alleged that the defendants made materially misleading statements and omissions about the development and likelihood of regulatory approval for a new drug,northera.after considering the defendants motion to dismiss filed under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court dismissed the complaint,holding that the plaintiffs allegations were insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the defendants acted with the required scienter.
on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that the district court committed two errors.the asserted errors are the court consideration of certain documents filed with the securities and exchange commission sec that were submitted as exhibits with the defendants motion to dismiss and the court determination that the plaintiffs allegations of scienter were legally insufficient.
upon our review,we hold that the district court erred in taking judicial notice of the challenged documents filed with the sec,because those documents did not relate to the contents of the complaint.we further hold that this error was not harmless,because the court incorrectly construed these documents as supporting its holding that the plaintiffs allegations of scienter were legally insufficient.finally,we hold that based on the defendants failure to disclose critical information about the weaknesses of the new drug application,the plaintiffs allegations were sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.we therefore vacate the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiffs complaint and remand the case for further proceedings.
the plaintiffs alleged in their pleadings the following facts,which we accept as true in our review of the district court dismissal of the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.matrix capital mgmt.fund,lp bearingpoint,cir citing tellabs,makor issues rights,d.in,chelsea began its effort to gain approval from the food and drug administration fda concerning the right to market the drug as a treatment for symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension noh.noh is a condition in which a dramatic drop in blood pressure occurs when a person stands.this drop in blood pressure causes symptoms such as dizziness,impaired vision,fatigue,weakness,nausea,and an inability to think clearly.noh is associated with the presence of various disorders including parkinson disease,multiple systems atrophy,and pure autonomic failure.
after considering the significant unmet need for a clinically beneficial treatment of symptomatic noh,the fda assigned northera orphan drug status.such status provided chelsea with seven years of marketing exclusivity,and reduced certain time and expense requirements related to clinical trials mandated for fda approval of the drug.
before submitting its new drug application to the fda,chelsea conducted numerous clinical trials with certain endpoints,or goals,to demonstrate the drug efficacy and safety.as relevant to this appeal,chelsea conducted four efficacy trials,namely,studies,and 
studies and began in.both those studies had the same general efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant effect on lightheadedness and dizziness for individuals suffering from noh.the endpoint for study was set forth in a special protocol assessment spa,which was an agreement between chelsea and the fda that the study design,trial size,and clinical goals could support regulatory approval.the spa involving study also stated that the fda expected two successful efficacy studies before it would grant regulatory approval of the new drug.
the first study to conclude,study,failed to meet its primary endpoint.later documents showed that the results of study clearly dr e w the efficacy of the drug into question,and demonstrated that symptoms worsened for those individuals taking the drug.
after chelsea announced to investors the disappointing results from study,chelsea petitioned the fda to modify the spa endpoint for study,which was ongoing.in november,chelsea representatives met with fda officials,and later informed investors that the fda had agreed to permit chelsea to use a different assessment scale for study than was used in study.the fda officials also had recommended at the november meeting that chelsea submit a confirmatory pivotal study to support the new drug application,because of the failed results in study.based on this additional recommendation,chelsea announced plans to initiate a new clinical trial,study,which would involve an treatment period.
in september,chelsea announced that study had concluded,and successfully had met its revised endpoint by showing a statistically significant improvement in participants symptoms.however,study,which employed a treatment period of only one week,was the sole efficacy study conducted by chelsea that met its primary endpoint.study,which included significantly longer treatment periods than studies and,did not meet its endpoint,and failed to demonstrate that the drug provided any duration effect on symptoms.study,which also included a significantly longer treatment period,was abandoned after an interim analysis indicated that the study would not meet its endpoint 
on december,chelsea met with fda officials to assess the viability of submitting a new drug application based on study the december meeting.during the december meeting,fda officials again warned chelsea that a single successful study typically was not sufficient to support approval of a new drug.nevertheless,chelsea announced that the fda had agreed that chelsea new drug application for northera could be submitted based on data from study,the only study to meet its primary endpoint,and data from study,which had not met its primary endpoint,without the need for any further efficacy studies.
during a conference call held with chelsea investors,simon pedder,chelsea president and chief executive officer,described the december meeting as a successful outcome that reflect ed the strength of the data generated by chelsea drug development program,and mark ed a significant step forward for chelsea.pedder also stated that the fda officials had clarified that additional efficacy studies were not required for a new drug application filing.on the same conference call,william schwieterman,chelsea vice president and chief medical officer,represented that after the december meeting,chelsea was very pleased with the fda responses to chelsea questions about its application and supporting data.after these statements concerning the december meeting,chelsea stock price rose about percent.
in september,chelsea announced that it had submitted to the fda its new drug application based on purportedly robust efficacy data from studies and.however,as later observed by the fda,these studies involved treatment periods of only one week.
in accordance with the fda initial evaluation process for new drug applications,an fda staff member prepared a briefing document in advance of the meeting of the fda cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee the advisory committee,which was held to review chelsea application.the briefing document included the staff member recommendation against approval of northera,which recommendation was based in part on chelsea failure to demonstrate that the drug had a durable effect,more than weeks.
on february,eight days before the fda briefing document was made available to the public,chelsea issued a press release.in the release,chelsea stated that it was in receipt of the briefing document,and that several lines of inquiry have emerged as significant components of the analysis of northera,including that chelsea drug development program may not adequately establish a durable treatment effect as a result of the short duration of the clinical trials.notably,however,chelsea press release did not disclose that the fda briefing document concluded with the recommendation that northera not be approved.also in that release,chelsea stated that the advisory committee would review the application on february.finally,the release included a website address where the fda briefing document later would be made available.
after the february,press release issued,chelsea stock price dropped about percent.when the briefing document became public eight days later on february,chelsea stock price dropped an additional percent.
on february,however,the fda advisory committee announced its recommendation in favor of approving northera as a new drug.several members of the advisory committee raised the same concerns outlined in the staff briefing document.although the advisory committee chairperson voted in favor of approving the drug,he nevertheless stated,virtually all members of the advisory committee agree that the failed studies do not provide confirmatory evidence of benefit.and the primary study,study,also did not provide evidence regarding the duration of effect in any direct way.
on march,the fda denied the new drug application.the fda provided its decision in a complete response letter,stating,among other things,that the fda required an additional successful study to support durability of effect.
about a week after the fda decision,the initial complaint in this case was filed.the plaintiffs later filed a consolidated class action complaint the complaint,asserting violations of section b of the exchange act and sec rule,b rule.in their complaint,the plaintiffs,who purchased chelsea stock between november,and march,the class period,asserted numerous claims including that the defendants misled investors to believe that the fda would approve northera based on the results of only one successful efficacy study,even though the fda repeatedly had warned chelsea that two successful studies and evidence of duration of effect would be necessary for approval of the new drug.in their complaint,the plaintiffs identified dozens of allegedly misleading statements or material omissions by the defendants.
in response,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under rule b,contending that the complaint failed to show that the defendants made any materially false statements or omissions,and that any such statements or omissions were not made with the required scienter.the defendants attached to their motion several exhibits and asked the court to take judicial notice of them.
the exhibits relevant to this appeal include three documents that were filed with the sec collectively,the sec documents.two of these documents are sec form reports,filed by schwieterman as the reporting person,showing that while employed as a corporate officer he made two purchases of chelsea stock during the class period.
the third document submitted by the defendants,a definitive proxy statement that chelsea filed with the sec,listed the amount of chelsea stock shares held by the company officers at the end of february,near the end of the class period.the proxy statement showed that pedder owned percent of all shares of chelsea stock,while other officers owned lesser amounts of chelsea stock.however,the proxy statement did not reflect whether any of these stock holdings had been acquired or sold during the class period.
at a hearing on the motion to dismiss,the defendants represented that none of the chelsea officers had sold any shares of chelsea stock during the class period.the defendants argued that the absence of such sales undermined any inference of scienter on the part of the defendants.the plaintiffs objected to the court consideration of the sec documents,asserting that the record did not show definitively whether any individual purchased stock or sold stock during the class period because there had not been any discovery in the case.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court took judicial notice of the sec documents,and granted the defendants motion to dismiss.applying the heightened pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act pslra,b,the court held that the plaintiffs securities fraud claims failed because the plaintiffs did not plead allegations sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.
the district court concluded that although the defendants statements to investors during the class period may have been overly optimistic about the likelihood of the fda approving northera,those statements did not demonstrate a strong inference of scienter for two reasons.first,the court observed that the defendants provided many warnings to investors regarding the sufficiency of the new drug application.second,the court found that when weighing the competing inferences regarding scienter,the most glaring inference was the fact that none of the individual defendants sold stock during the class period.emphasis in original.the court concluded that the lack of stock sales tip ped the scales in favor of defendant s motion to dismiss,rendering the plaintiffs allegations insufficient as a matter of law to establish the required inference of scienter.after the district court entered its order dismissing the case with prejudice,the plaintiffs filed this timely appeal.
in addressing the plaintiffs arguments,we first state the applicable standard of review.we consider de novo the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir.
the plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred by considering the sec documents submitted by the defendants that were not integral to the complaint,and by concluding based on those documents that none of the individual defendants sold chelsea stock during the class period.according to the plaintiffs,the district court improper consideration and incorrect interpretation of these documents contributed to the court erroneous conclusion that the defendants failed to plead sufficient facts supporting a strong inference of scienter.
in response,the defendants contend that the district court properly considered the sec documents submitted with their motion to dismiss.arguing that courts routinely examine sec filings at the pleading stage of securities fraud litigation,the defendants assert that the district court did not err in taking judicial notice of the contents of the two form exhibits and the proxy statement exhibit.the defendants submit that these documents supported the district court findings that the individual defendants failed to sell shares of chelsea stock,and did not knowingly or recklessly make misleading statements.we disagree with the defendants arguments.
as an initial matter,we set forth general legal principles involving securities fraud claims that are pertinent to this appeal.we also review principles addressing the scienter required for such claims.
the exchange act and related regulations ensure that public companies release information that will permit investors to make informed investment decisions.yates mun.mortg.equity,llc,cir citing taylor first union of,cir.under section b of the act,companies are prohibited from using any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the sale of a security in violation of sec rules.see b.pursuant to regulatory proscription in rule,the following conduct is unlawful in connection with the sale of a security 
to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading 
generally,a plaintiff asserting a claim under section b must establish a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.yates,at citation omitted see matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d.because the district court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint solely based on the sufficiency of the allegations of scienter,our review is limited to that one element of the plaintiffs claims.
to demonstrate scienter,a plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at citation omitted.allegations of reckless conduct can satisfy the level of scienter necessary to survive a motion to dismiss.see matrix capital,at.reckless conduct sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter is described as severe,ottman hanger orthopedic,cir,or conduct that is so highly unreasonable and such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.matrix capital,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
claims of securities fraud are subject to a heightened pleading standard under the pslra.yates,at.under this heightened pleading standard,the allegations of a securities fraud claim must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind regarding the acts allegedly violating the exchange act.b.to evaluate the strength of scienter inferences,courts engage in a comparative analysis.yates,at see tellabs,at.a n inference of scienter can only be strong when it is weighed against the opposing inferences that may be drawn from the facts in their entirety.yates,at quoting cozzarelli inspire pharms,cir.
after comparing the malicious and innocent inferences cognizable from the facts pled,a complaint will not be dismissed so long as the malicious inference is at least as compelling as any opposing innocent inference.id.quoting zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.in evaluating these inferences,we consider the scienter allegations holistically and accord those allegations the inferential weight warranted by context and common sense.matrix capital,at citing cozzarelli,at.
in view of these principles,we turn to address the plaintiffs claims that the district court erred in its scienter analysis by considering the sec documents submitted by the defendants that were not integral to the complaint.generally,when a defendant moves to dismiss a complaint under rule b,courts are limited to considering the sufficiency of allegations set forth in the complaint and the documents attached or incorporated into the complaint.du pont de nemours kolon,cir see clatterbuck city of charlottesville,cir.consideration of extrinsic documents by a court during the pleading stage of litigation improperly converts the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.du pont de nemours,at.this conversion is not appropriate when the parties have not had an opportunity to conduct reasonable discovery.see.b,d,and.
courts therefore should focus their inquiry on the sufficiency of the facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the complaint.am.chiropractic ass trigon healthcare,cir.consideration of a document attached to a motion to dismiss ordinarily is permitted only when the document is integral to and explicitly relied on in the complaint,and when the plaintiffs do not challenge the document authenticity.id.quoting phillips lci int l,cir see cozzarelli,at considering investment analyst reports attached to the defendants motion to dismiss because the complaint quoted from those reports and the plaintiffs did not challenge the reports authenticity.
we have recognized a narrow exception to this standard,under which courts are permitted to consider facts and documents subject to judicial notice without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.clatterbuck,at.under federal rule of evidence,courts at any stage of a proceeding may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute,provided that the fact is generally known within the court territorial jurisdiction or can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.nevertheless,when a court considers relevant facts from the public record at the pleading stage,the court must construe such facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.id.moreover,the determination whether a fact properly is considered under this exception depends on the manner in which a court uses this information.id.holding that the district court improperly considered contents of a public record as an established fact and as evidence contradicting the complaint.with these principles in mind,we turn to consider the district court use of the challenged sec documents.
the plaintiffs complaint stated in general terms that,in investigating the case,plaintiffs counsel had reviewed the public filings submitted to the sec.however,the complaint did not otherwise refer to any sec filings,or the contents of such filings,to support the plaintiffs allegations.in fact,the complaint did not contain any allegation suggesting that the individual defendants made any sales or purchases of chelsea stock during the class period.
although plaintiffs asserting securities fraud claims frequently bolster allegations regarding scienter by asserting unusual sales of stock by individuals accused of committing securities fraud,the plaintiffs in the present case did not include this type of allegation in their complaint.and such allegations of unusual stock sales are not required to demonstrate a strong inference of scienter in a securities fraud case.see mizzaro home depot,cir s uspicious stock sales are not necessary to create a strong inference of scienter.citing tellabs,at.therefore,because the sec documents were not explicitly referenced in,or an integral part of,the plaintiffs complaint,the district court should not have considered those documents in reviewing the sufficiency of the plaintiffs allegations.
our conclusion is not altered by the defendants contention that the district court was entitled to take judicial notice of the contents of the sec documents because the accuracy of those documents can not reasonably be questioned.even if the sec documents and their contents could have been reviewed in accordance with rule,the district court in the present case incorrectly construed the information contained in the sec documents.
instead of considering the information in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the court found that the documents established the fact that none of the individual defendants sold chelsea stock during the class period.notably,however,the referenced sec documents fail to establish any such fact.
the form documents merely indicate that a single chelsea corporate officer,schwieterman,made two purchases of chelsea stock during the class period,while the proxy statement shows that each corporate officer held some shares of chelsea stock at a certain point near the end of the class period.the record does not reflect for comparative purposes how many shares of stock the individual defendants held at the beginning of the class period,or provide any other basis for determining whether corporate officers other than schwieterman purchased or sold any of their chelsea stock during that period.
instead,the form documents list only schwieterman as the reporting person,and do not contain any reference to any other corporate officer.and the proxy statement provides only a snapshot in time of stock shares owned by the various chelsea officers as of february.therefore,regardless whether the information contained in the sec documents could be considered under the judicial notice provisions of rule,such information did not provide a factual basis for the court conclusion that no individual defendant sold chelsea stock during the class period.see clatterbuck,at.
we also disagree with the defendants argument that even if the district court erred in this regard,the court consideration of the sec documents did not affect the outcome of the court decision concerning the adequacy of the plaintiffs allegations.in weighing the competing inferences,the district court concluded that the defendants purported failure to sell chelsea stock during the class period tip ped the scales of the competing inferences of scienter.in fact,the district court cited only one other competing inference when considering the element of scienter,namely,that the defendants informed investors regarding certain weaknesses of chelsea drug development program.therefore,the district court comparison of inferences undoubtedly was affected by its error relating to the content of the sec documents.accordingly,we conclude that the court consideration of the challenged sec documents was not harmless.
the plaintiffs argue that in addition to the district court error in relying on the challenged sec documents,the court further erred in concluding that their allegations of scienter were insufficient as a matter of law.in asserting that they pleaded facts permitting a strong inference of scienter,the plaintiffs rely on their allegations that the defendants intentionally or recklessly failed to disclose that the fda expected chelsea to produce two successful studies showing evidence of durability of effect.the plaintiffs place particular emphasis on their allegation that the defendants intentionally misled investors in the february,press release,by failing to disclose that the fda briefing document included a recommendation against approval of northera.the plaintiffs assert that because the defendants were aware of this adverse recommendation but withheld it,such conduct supports a strong inference of wrongful intent.
in response,the defendants maintain that the plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to support a strong inference of scienter.the defendants submit that because they disclosed to investors various weaknesses of their new drug application,the defendants omission of other information does not support a strong inference of scienter.with respect to the february,press release,the defendants argue that their omission of the adverse fda staff recommendation does not demonstrate wrongful intent,because the press release included a website address where investors eight days later could locate the full fda briefing document.we disagree with the defendants position.
as the supreme court emphasized in matrixx initiatives,companies can control what they have to disclose under section b and rule b by controlling what they say to the market.at.thus,while chelsea and its corporate officers may have lacked an independent,affirmative duty to disclose the adverse fda staff recommendation and the shortcomings of chelsea evidence of efficacy,the defendants failure to do so must be viewed under section b and rule b in the context of the statements that they affirmatively elected to make.see id.
based on our de novo review,we conclude that the plaintiffs complaint,when viewed in its entirety,contains sufficient allegations giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.this strong inference of intentional or reckless conduct is supported by the plaintiffs allegations that material,information known to the defendants about the status of the new drug application and required efficacy studies conflicted with the defendants public statements on those subjects.
according to the plaintiffs allegations,although the defendants knew that the fda expected two successful efficacy studies demonstrating durability of effect to support regulatory approval of northera,none of the defendants statements to investors addressed this critical expectation.after the defendants met with fda officials in december to discuss submission of the new drug application based only on study,the defendants instead informed investors that the fda had agreed that chelsea could submit its new drug application for northera without the need for any further efficacy studies.however,even assuming that this statement truthfully represented an fda communication that chelsea new drug application could be submitted,the statement was misleading given the fda continuing expectation that two successful efficacy studies would be required for approval of northera.
the defendants also were aware by december that the lone successful efficacy trial,study,involved a treatment period of only one week,in contrast to the failed study and the abandoned study,which both involved much longer treatment periods.nonetheless,the defendants described their december meeting with the fda as a successful outcome reflecting the strength of the data gathered during the clinical trials.
the issue of durability of effect is a core component of the plaintiffs allegations,along with the fda expectation of two successful studies.critically,the plaintiffs alleged that chelsea knew that the fda expected evidence of durability of effect,not just evidence of efficacy,and that chelsea was aware of study and study shortcomings.ja.
although the fda can approve a new drug based on results of only one successful study,the study must be adequate and the data must present substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports.see d.additionally,the plaintiffs did not allege that chelsea unreasonably sought review by the fda on the basis of one successful study.the plaintiffs instead alleged that the defendants misled investors regarding the risk of submitting the new drug application supported only by a single,study providing scant evidence of durability of effect.
the plaintiffs also made a significant allegation concerning the defendants failure to disclose in the february,press release that the fda briefing document contained a recommendation against approval of northera.in its press release,chelsea instead stated that chelsea had received the briefing document and disclosed that several lines of inquiry had emerged,including that the efficacy trials may not adequately establish a durable treatment effect.chelsea omission of the information regarding the adverse fda staff recommendation,when viewed in the context of the known problems of the efficacy studies and chelsea earlier remarks regarding those studies,supports the inference that chelsea intentionally or recklessly misled investors.
these allegations are significantly stronger than the allegations we considered in cozzarelli,a case on which the defendants rely.in cozzarelli,which also involved a pharmaceutical company attempt to gain fda approval for a drug,the plaintiffs primary allegation of scienter focused on a corporate officer use of an imprecise medical term when describing the endpoint of a clinical study,allegedly with the intent to mislead investors to think that the study was likely to succeed.at.we concluded that not only was the general term used by the corporate officer more or less interchangeable with the precise term not referenced,but that the pharmaceutical company also informed investors that it would not disclose the details of the study for competitive reasons.id.at.therefore,we concluded in cozzarelli that the corporate officer chosen language did not support a strong inference of scienter id.at.
in contrast,the present case involves numerous allegedly misleading statements and omissions by the defendants that were not caused by the use of imprecise language or the execution of a legitimate business decision.instead,the plaintiffs allegations,when considered in the context of the entire complaint,permit a strong inference that the defendants either knowingly or recklessly misled investors by failing to disclose critical information received from the fda during the new drug application process,while releasing less damaging information that they knew was incomplete 
we emphasize that our conclusion does not stand for the proposition that a strong inference of scienter can arise merely based on a defendant failure to disclose information.rather,the scienter inquiry necessarily involves consideration of the facts and of the nature of the alleged omissions or misleading statements within the context of the statements that a defendant affirmatively made see matrixx initiatives.at stating that companies can control what they have to disclose under section b and rule b by controlling what they say to the market.
the inference of scienter here is at least as compelling as the opposing inference that chelsea officials had signaled to investors that there were some weaknesses in their new drug application regarding efficacy studies for northera,and simply failed to provide further details regarding information received from the fda.see yates,at.we therefore conclude that the plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to support the required inference of scienter.our conclusion,however,is limited to the sufficiency of the complaint regarding the element of scienter,and does not address the sufficiency of the allegations with respect to the remaining elements of the plaintiffs securities fraud claims,which will be considered by the district court in the first instance on remand 
for these reasons,we hold that the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs complaint on the basis that the allegations supporting an inference of scienter were legally judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
vacated and remanded 
since the enactment of the pslra,we have published eight decisions reviewing the dismissal of a securities fraud suit for failure to plead facts supporting a strong inference of scienter in all of them,we concluded that the inference was lacking.see yates mun.mortg.equity,llc,cir matrix capital mgmt.fund,lp bearingpoint,cir pub.emps.ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir cozzarelli inspire pharm,cir teachers ret.of hunter,cir in re pec solutions.sec,cir ottmann hanger orthopedic,cir phillips lci int l,cir.in my view,the inference is lacking in this case,too.
the pslra requires a plaintiff in a securities fraud suit to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b a.to establish this strong inference,a plaintiff must persuade the court that it is as likely as not that the defendant acted with fraudulent intent or,at the very least,with such severe recklessness that the danger of misleading investors was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.cozzarelli inspire pharm,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the allegations do not strongly imply either fraudulent intent or severe recklessness.instead,the allegations suggest that chelsea while acknowledging the various challenges and setbacks encumbering its bid for fda the northera application with justifiable confidence in its chances for success.i therefore respectfully dissent 
scienter,as defined by the supreme court,is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.the federal circuit courts agree that reckless behavior may be enough to satisfy the scienter requirement in a securities fraud suit but they differ on the degree of recklessness required.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.the distinctions among the circuits include variations in terminology,with courts referring to the recklessness standard variously as deliberate or conscious recklessness,severe recklessness,and a high degree of recklessness.ann morales olazábal,defining recklessness a doctrinal approach to deterrence of secondary market securities fraud,footnotes omitted collecting cases.
in this circuit,we recognize that allegations of recklessness can satisfy the scienter requirement,see matrix capital mgmt.fund,lp bearingpoint,cir see also ottmann hanger orthopedic,cir recognizing for the first time in this circuit that a securities fraud plaintiff may allege scienter by pleading not only intentional misconduct,but also recklessness,but we insist that the recklessness must be severe that is,a slightly lesser species of intentional misconduct.ottmann,at internal quotation marks omitted see also cozzarelli,at teachers ret.of hunter,cir.this definition of recklessness,we have stated,comports with the observation of the supreme court that t he words manipulative or deceptive used in conjunction with device or contrivance strongly suggest that b was intended to proscribe knowing or intentional misconduct.ottmann,at alteration in original quoting ernst ernst,at.
our decision in cozzarelli inspire pharmaceuticals,makes clear that pleading scienter whether in the form of fraudulent intent or severe recklessness requires a showing of wrongful intent.at.there,a group of shareholders alleged that a drugmaker seeking fda approval of an experimental treatment misled investors into believing that an important clinical trial was likely to succeed.see id.at.the drugmaker allegedly nurtured this false impression by withholding details about the trial endpoint while simultaneously representing that the trial was very similar to a previous successful trial.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded that the allegations supported an inference that the drugmaker sought only to protect its competitive advantage in the marketplace this inference,we stated,is more powerful and compelling than the inference that the drugmaker acted with an intent to deceive.id.at emphasis supplied.
in the years since cozzarelli,our court has occasionally neglected to note that the recklessness necessary to support a finding of scienter must be severe.compare yates mun.mortg.equity,llc,cir at the pleading stage,alleging either intentional or severely reckless conduct is sufficient.emphasis supplied,with matrix capital,at pleading recklessness is sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement.the standard,though,remains unchanged.we have consistently stated that an allegedly reckless act must be so highly unreasonable and such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care as to present a danger of misleading the plaintiff to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.matrix capital,at internal quotation marks omitted see also pub.emps.ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir in order to establish a strong inference of scienter,plaintiffs must do more than merely demonstrate that defendants should or could have done more.they must demonstrate that defendants were either knowingly complicit in the fraud,or so reckless in their duties as to be oblivious to malfeasance that was readily apparent.this understanding of scienter that it necessarily entails a culpable state of mind,ottmann,at preserves section b as a prohibition on securities fraud.it ensures that corporations and their officers can not escape liability through willful blindness that is,purposeful ignorance of the truth of their own representations while,at the same time,it prevents section b from devolving into a penalty for business decisions that,in hindsight,appear questionable.
here,under the pslra heightened pleading standard,the plaintiffs were required to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent or severe recklessness.see u.b a cozzarelli,at.this is no small burden.cozzarelli,at.though the inference of scienter need not be irrefutable,it must be more than merely reasonable or permissible.tellabs,at.unless a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent,the pleading fails.id.the plaintiffs complaint here does not satisfy this standard.
reviewing the complaint in its entirety,it is clear that chelsea had plenty of reason to believe the fda would be receptive to its application.more importantly,the facts strongly suggest that chelsea acted on just such a belief.
to merit fda approval,an application must present substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed,recommended,or suggested in the proposed labeling.d.though here the plaintiffs complaint states that the fda generally requires at least two adequate and studies,federal law expressly authorizes the fda to make the requisite finding of substantial evidence based solely on data from one adequate and clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence obtained prior to or after such investigation,d.likewise,as the complaint recognizes,the fda guidelines note that the agency may acknowledge the persuasiveness of a single,internally consistent,strong multicenter study.
chelsea based its fda application on two sets of data.first and foremost,there was the data from study,which successfully demonstrated the drug efficacy.in addition,chelsea offered supplemental data from study,which,though failing t
