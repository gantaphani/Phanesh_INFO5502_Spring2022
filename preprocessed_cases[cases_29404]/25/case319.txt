factual and procedural background 
pharmaceutical sales representatives 
glaxo is in the business of developing,producing,marketing,and selling pharmaceutical products.christopher and buchanan began working as psrs for glaxo in.glaxo terminated christopher in may.buchanan career at glaxo ended when he accepted a psr position at another pharmaceutical company.since the enactment of the pure food and drug act of,stat,federal law has,to varying degrees,regulated and influenced the sale of pharmaceuticals in,the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,stat.codified as amended at et,clothed the food and drug administration with broad regulatory authority over,inter alia,drug manufacturers the amendment of established the first comprehensive scheme governing the sale of prescription pharmaceuticals to the public.see,stat.codified at b.importantly,for our purposes,formalized the now distinction between prescription and drugs the controlled substances act of,stat,continues the dichotomy,and prohibits dispensing the former without the authorization of a practitioner,other than a pharmacist,to an ultimate user.b d.currently,all pharmaceuticals requiring a physician prescription are branded rx only.b a.
we analyze this case within the framework of how glaxo sells its rx only products to an ultimate user.a key,undisputed fact underlying our analysis is that the ultimate purchase a prescription drug without first obtaining a physician authorization.
because glaxo is proscribed from selling products directly to the public,it sells its prescription pharmaceuticals to distributors or retail pharmacies,which then dispense those products to the ultimate user,as authorized by a licensed physician prescription.in this restrictive sales environment,glaxo employs psrs to make calls on physicians to encourage them to prescribe glaxo products.on calls,psrs typically present physicians with a variety of information about glaxo products,provide product samples,and attempt to convince the physicians to prescribe glaxo products,when medically appropriate,over competitor products.psrs also try to build business relationships with physicians,respond to their concerns,and recruit them to attend dinners and conventions.each psr is responsible for a particular drug bag of medications he or she tries to induce physicians to prescribe.as perceived by the plaintiffs,the primary duty of a psr is to communicate features and benefits of glaxo products to physicians.in buchanan words,he tried to convince prescribers that the benefits of glaxo products warranted them prescribing that product to the appropriate patient.
psrs usually work outside of a glaxo office and spend much of their time traveling to the offices of,and working with,physicians within their assigned geographic territories.plaintiffs visited between eight and ten physicians each day,usually between the hours of and plaintiffs claim that they worked between ten and twenty hours each week outside of normal business hours,for which they received no overtime wages.when not making calls on physicians,plaintiffs studied glaxo products and relevant disease states,prepared new presentation modules,answered phone calls,checked email,generated reports,and attended events on evenings and weekends.
before a psr makes his or her daily calls,glaxo provides him or her with detailed reports about the physicians he or she will visit.these reports include information about a physician prescribing habits and drug preferences,the market volume of glaxo products prescribed by the physician versus the volume of competitor products,and the volume of prescriptions filled in a particular region.glaxo also provides each psr with a budget to use for speaker programs and to engage socially with physicians.
glaxo prepares and provides information about its core messages for psrs to present to physicians during calls.core messages include information about product benefits and risks,dosage instructions,and the types of patients for whom glaxo recommends each product.glaxo expects psrs to use the core messages and then d evelop and deliver informative sales presentations based on customer needs.
psrs do not carry any prescriptions with them for direct sale rather,glaxo provides psrs with small amounts of sample products to distribute to physicians.psrs do not contact patients or market anything to them.to the contrary,in compliance with federal law,psrs can not sell the samples,take orders for any medication,or negotiate drug prices or contracts with either physicians or patients.
glaxo recruits applicants who have prior sales experience for its psr positions.when glaxo hires new psrs,it provides them with more than one month of training that focuses on making presentations,learning about glaxo products,and building interpersonal skills.psrs are taught how to ask for a commitment from a physician to prescribe glaxo products if the physician believes the medication is appropriate.
since,glaxo has instructed psrs on various methods of completing a call.when plaintiffs were hired,they received training in glaxo assertive selling always professional asap model.they were also trained to follow glaxo winning practices program.asap and winning practices are similarly structured and emphasize that a psr should analyze and understand what is happening in an assigned region work with the team to drive results master professional knowledge to understand clinical management of patients prepare for calls sell through dialogue obtain the strongest commitment possible from a healthcare professional at the end of the call and provide added value to the customer relationship.
in,glaxo started a new program called when why how which distilled the old model into three questions psrs should use to bond the targeted physician to the glaxo brand when should i use this product why should i use this product how should i use this product psrs strive to ensure that their targeted physicians have the answers to all three questions before psrs leave the physicians offices.
plaintiffs received two types of and compensation.compensation is paid if glaxo market share for a particular product increases in a psr territory,sales volume for a product increases,sales revenue increases,or the dose volume increases.glaxo aims to have a psr total compensation be approximately salary and incentive compensation however,the dollar value of compensation is uncapped.
the process of providing information to physicians is referred to within the pharmaceutical industry as detailing,and psrs have traditionally been known by the moniker detail men or detailers.plaintiffs job functions during their tenures at glaxo varied little from those of their predecessors of fifty or sixty years ago moreover,there is homogeneity within the carry out essentially the same business functions regardless of which drug manufacturers they represent 
the pharmaceutical industry psrs and their contacts with physicians by way of a voluntary code of pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma code.the phrma code does not speak of selling,but,rather,provides that i nteractions with health care professionals should be focused on informing them about products,providing scientific and educational information,and supporting medical research and education.the phrma code refers to psrs as industry representatives and states that i nformational presentations and discussions by industry representatives speaking on behalf of a company provide valuable scientific and educational benefits.the phrma code also regulates the provision of meals and gifts to physicians and professes an industry commitment to independent medical decisionmaking.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
this litigation commenced in august,when plaintiffs filed the complaint challenging glaxo practice of requiring overtime work without paying additional compensation as a violation of.a,b.the parties for summary judgment,and plaintiffs moved to certify a conditional class.glaxo contended that plaintiffs were exempt under the outside salesman provision in flsa or,alternatively,under the administrative exemption.a.
in granting glaxo motion for summary judgment,the district court addressed only the outside sales exemption and held that psrs unmistakably fit within the terms and spirit of the exemption.christopher smithklein beecham,civ.fjm,wl,at.the court observed that psrs are not hourly workers,but instead earn salaries well above minimum to a year,and that they receive bonuses in lieu of overtime as an incentive to increase their efforts.id.the district court continued,a psr ultimate goal is to close an encounter with a physician by obtaining a nonbinding commitment from the physician to prescribe the psr assigned product.in this highly regulated industry,that is the most a psr can achieve.id.
thereafter,plaintiffs moved to alter or amend the judgment based on the district court failure to consider an amicus brief filed by the secretary secretary of the department of labor dol in a flsa appeal then pending before the united states court of appeals for the second circuit,in re novartis wage hour,cir.the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that the dol brief was entitled to deference under either chevron,natural resources defense council,or auer robbins,and noted that the dol brief recapitulated the points argued at summary judgment.finding the dol current interpretation inconsistent with the statutory language and its prior pronouncements,and also def ying common sense,the district court denied the motion to amend the judgment.plaintiffs appeal.

discussion 
i.the flsa outside sales exemption 
the flsa imposes minimum labor standards on employers to promote the health,efficiency,and general of workers.a nigg postal,cir.the flsa was enacted because congress found that the existence in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce of labor conditions detrimental to maintaining minimum standards of living necessary for health,efficiency and general of workers perpetuates substandard conditions among workers,burdens commerce,constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce,leads to labor disputes,and interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods.hale arizona,cir en banc quoting a emphasis added see also nigg,at.
to meet those goals and expand employment opportunities across the economy,the flsa includes a baseline overtime payment requirement that employers must pay employees a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed for hours worked in excess of forty per week.a.there are numerous exceptions to this general rule.see.these exemptions to the requirement vary widely from executive,administrative,and professional exemptions to those for babysitters.a.relevant here is one part of the exemption for persons employed in the capacity of outside salesman.a vinole countrywide home loans,cir.the exemption removes from the overtime pay requirement 
any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity or in the capacity of outside salesman as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary of labor 
a emphasis added.
as the statute indicates,a proper interpretation of the flsa is necessarily guided by the regulations issued by the secretary of labor t he flsa grants the secretary broad authority to define and delimit the scope of the exemption for executive,administrative,and professional employees.auer,at alterations and citation omitted.congress did not define the term outside salesman or the other exemptions in the flsa.rather,p ursuant to congress specific grant of rulemaking authority,the dol has issued implementing regulations,at part part,defining the scope of the section a exemptions.see defining and delimiting the exemptions for executive,administrative,professional,outside sales and computer employees.in,the dol wage and hour division promulgated supplemental rules concerning the outside sales and administrative exemptions the rule.among other things,the rule explained that the major substantive provisions of the part regulations have remained virtually unchanged for years.at.
the secretary defines an outside salesman as any employee 
whose primary duty is i making sales within the meaning of section k of the act or ii obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer and 
who is primarily and regularly engaged away from the employer place or places of business in performing such primary duty.
a.an employee primary duty is the principal,main,major,or most important duty that the employee performs.the outside sales regulation provides 
in determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee,work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee own outside sales or solicitations,including incidental deliveries and collections,shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work.other work that furthers the employee sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt work including,for example,writing sales reports,updating or revising the employee sales or display catalogue,planning itineraries and attending sales conferences.
the secretary outside sales regulation references section k of the act.a.section k provides that s ale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.k.the secretary regulations provide 
sales within the meaning of section k of the act include the transfer of title to tangible property,and in certain cases,of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property.section k of the act states that sale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.
in the regulations,the secretary draws a distinction between sales work and promoting 
promotion work is one type of activity often performed by persons who make sales,which may or may not be exempt outside sales work,depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed.promotional work that is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work.on the other hand,promotional work that is incidental to sales made,or to be made,by someone else is not exempt outside sales work.
a.to illustrate the concept of promoting sales,as opposed to selling,the secretary regulations provides two manufacturer representative and a company representative who visits chain stores 
b a manufacturer representative,for example,may perform various types of promotional activities such as putting up displays and posters,removing damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant shelves or rearranging the merchandise promotion activities directed toward consummation of the employee own sales are exempt.promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that will be made by someone else are not exempt outside sales work 
c another example is a company representative who visits chain stores,arranges the merchandise on shelves,replenishes stock by replacing old with new merchandise,sets up displays and consults with the store manager when inventory runs low,but does not obtain a commitment for additional purchases.the arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction with the employee own outside sales.because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale,the work is not exempt outside sales work.
in a flsa case,the question of how an employee spends his or her workday is one of fact,while the question of whether his or her activities exclude him or her from the requirement is one of law.see icicle seafoods worthington,bratt cnty.of los angeles,cir.although the outside sales exemption is more than seven decades old,our encounters with the exemption are few and limited to the context.see in re wells fargo home mortg.overtime pay,cir vinole,at.thus,whether a psr job duties make him or her an outside salesperson is a question of first impression for our court.
we construe the outside sales exemption consistent with other section a exemptions under the flsa.the employer always has the burden of showing the exemption applies to its employee.bratt,at see also nigg,at.the exemption can only apply to persons plainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit.arnold ben kanowsky,klem cnty.of santa clara,cir.because exemptions are narrowly construed against the employer,to meet its burden,an employer must establish that the employee satisfies each of the criteria set forth in the secretary of labor regulations.see bratt,at see also wang chinese daily news,cir.reviewing a flsa exemption is well understood to be a inquiry.vinole,at citation omitted.
ii.whether deference to the secretary position is appropriate 
the secretary appearance as amicus supporting plaintiffs requires us to determine what,if any,deference we must accord to her view that psrs do not meet the primary duties test for the outside sales exemption.the secretary also advocated this construction of the regulations before the second circuit in novartis.at.although the novartis court held that secretary interpretation was owed auer deference,at,our review of the relevant authorities leads us to a different conclusion.we conclude that we owe no deference to the secretary current interpretation of the regulations,and,in any event,we respectfully disagree with that interpretation.
administrative deference in the flsa 
when a question arises as to the meaning of the flsa or the secretary regulations,we apply traditional rules of construction and,where required,administrative deference.see,webster pub.sch.emp.of,cir citing auer,at.thus,if the language of a statute or regulation is unambiguous,we apply the terms as written.see christensen harris,d eference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous.chevron,at if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.by contrast,when congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,auer,at,we will defer to the secretary regulation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.citing chevron,at.if the secretary regulations are themselves ambiguous,and the secretary uses her rulemaking authority to provide clarity,we give controlling deference to the secretary view unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at citation and internal quotation mark omitted see also christensen,at,auer deference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous.in re farmers ins,claims representatives overtime pay,cir we must give deference to the dol interpretation of its own regulations through,for example,opinion letters.lastly,if the secretary interprets an unambiguous statute by way of an opinion letter,enforcement guidelines,or the like,her opinion is merely entitled to respect to the extent the interpretation has the power to persuade the court.see christensen,at citing skidmore swift.
b.in re novartis wage hour litigation 
in novartis,the second circuit held that psrs did not meet the requirements of the outside sales exemption.as it has done here,the dol took the position that when an employee promotes to a physician a pharmaceutical that may thereafter be purchased by a patient from a pharmacy the employee does not in any sense make the sale.novartis,at.in reviewing the secretary position,the second circuit laid out the relevant statutory and regulatory history and focused its attention on the secretary regulations,and,in particular,the preamble in the rule which emphasized that no one could be considered a salesman within these regulations unless he in some sense made a sale.id.at.the novartis court highlighted a series of comment letters sent to the dol by manufacturers associations and industry trade groups that had requested the department eliminate the emphasis upon an employee own sales because of team selling,customer control of order processing,and increasing computerization of sales and purchasing activities.at.the united states chamber of commerce emphasized that promotional activities,even when they do not culminate in an individual sale,are nonetheless an integral part of the sales process.id.based on these concerns,the dol made a minor change to address commenter concerns that technological changes in how orders are taken and processed should not preclude the exemption for employees whose primary duty is making sales.id.the rule continues t he department does not intend to change any of the essential elements required for the outside sales exemption,including the requirement that the outside sales employee primary duty must be to make sales or to obtain orders or contracts for services.an employer can not meet this requirement unless it demonstrates objectively that the employee,in some sense,has made sales.id.
the novartis court also quoted the preamble elaboration of the standard employees have a primary duty of making sales if they obtain a commitment to buy from the customer and are credited with the sale.at quoting.at emphasis in original.the secretary interpretation is based on a dol interpretation,which provided in borderline cases the test is whether the person is actually engaged in activities directed toward the consummation of his own sales,at least to the extent of obtaining a commitment to buy from the person to whom he is selling.if his efforts are directed toward stimulating the sales of his company generally rather than the consummation of his own specific sales his activities are not exempt.at citation omitted.
the second circuit determined that the secretary regulations do far more than merely parrot the language of the flsa.novartis,at.for that reason,the secretary interpretations of her regulations are entitled to controlling deference unless those interpretations are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.id.quoting auer,at internal quotation omitted.the novartis court could find no inconsistencies or errors in the secretary amicus position.id.the court stated it did not believe the distribution practices of the drug company constituted an other disposition,as that term is used in the flsa.rather,the court said that because other disposition followed a line of words which,apparently,emphasized a sale being consummated,other disposition was not intended as a category.id.ultimately,the novartis court summarized its reasoning 
w here the employee promotes a pharmaceutical product to a physician but can transfer to the physician nothing more than free samples and can not lawfully transfer ownership of any quantity of the drug in exchange for anything of value,can not lawfully take an order for its purchase,and can not lawfully even obtain from the physician a binding commitment to prescribe it,we conclude that it is not plainly erroneous to conclude that the employee has not in any sense,within the meaning of the statute or the regulations,made a sale.
deference owed in this case 
our view of the level of deference we owe to the secretary in this matter is best captured by the supreme court instruction in gonzales oregon an agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when,instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation,it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language,see also chase bank usa,mccoy,slip op.at,accordingly,no deference was warranted to an agency interpretation of what were,in fact,congress words.cal.river watch wilcox,cir here,the three rules cited by the united states essentially parrot the statutory language.the parroting with which the gonzales court took issue is present in the secretary interpretation of section k.
according to the secretary regulations,a salesman is someone who either mak es sales within the meaning of section k of the act or someone who obtain s orders or contracts.a.since there is no dispute that psrs do not obtain orders for anything,only the sales element is relevant here.to define sales within the meaning of section k,we look to b,which provides that s ales within the meaning of section k of the act include the transfer of title to tangible property,and in certain cases,of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property.section k of the act states that s ale or sell includes any sale,exchange,contract to sell,consignment for sale,shipment for sale,or other disposition.k.thus,the secretary has given us two meanings with which to set the boundaries of the sales exemption.first,in b,the secretary provides an definition that sales,unsurprisingly,include the transfer of title to tangible property.in the next sentence,the secretary back to the language of section k of the very language purportedly being defined.accordingly,the secretary regulations define sale or sell by statutory is,a sale means a sale.this clarifies nothing about the meaning of section k it merely incorporates the very undefined,very term the secretary seeks to clarify.a definition dependent almost entirely on congress old statutory language is not an example of the dol employing its expertise to elucidate meaning to which we owe auer deference.see cal.river watch,at.
in gonzales oregon,the supreme court confronted an analogous situation when it rejected the attorney general regulatory attempt to frustrate the implementation of oregon death with dignity act.in that case,oregon statutory law exempted licensed physicians from liability when they prescribed medication to hasten death for terminally ill individuals.at.in,shortly after a change of presidential administration,the attorney general promulgated a new interpretive rule that restricted the use of controlled substances in suicides.id.at.in defending that rule,the government contended in its appeal that the judiciary was required to give considerable deference to the attorney general interpretive rule as it was an elaboration of one of his own regulations.id.at.in rejecting that contention,the supreme court drew meaningful distinctions with its decision in auer 
in auer,the underlying regulations gave specificity to a statutory scheme the secretary was charged with enforcing and reflected the considerable experience and expertise the dol had acquired over time.here,on the other hand,the underlying regulation does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.the language the interpretive rule addresses comes from congress,not the attorney general,and the near equivalence of the statute and regulation belies the government argument for auer deference.
id.at emphasis added.
the failure to add specificity to the statutory scheme that troubled the gonzales court,indeed the parroting of statutory language,is present in the secretary outside sales regulations.rather than setting forth a particular test for sale or instructing employers to look for indicia of sales,the secretary regulations direct employers,employees,and this court back to the language of the flsa.given the admonition in gonzales,we are unable to accord auer deference to a regulation written in this manner.
thus,when we look to the secretary brief for her application of the regulations,we see only a reinterpretation of section k.rather than applying the regulation to the facts presented,the secretary has used her appearance as amicus to draft a new interpretation of the flsa language.were we to accept the secretary offer,and give controlling deference even where there exists no meaningful regulatory language to interpret,we would unduly expand auer applicability to interpretations of statutes expressed for the first time in amicus filings.see cal.river watch,at in this case,the amicus brief purports to interpret statutory,not regulatory,language.in essence,we would sanction bypassing of the administrative procedures act and rulemaking.christensen harris,here,however,we confront an interpretation contained in an opinion letter,not one arrived at after,for example,a formal adjudication or rulemaking.accordingly,we hold that we need not give controlling deference to the secretary interpretations in this matter furthermore,even if auer applied,deference is not warranted because the secretary position is both plainly erroneous and inconsistent with her own regulations and practices,as demonstrated in the analysis that follows.
iii.sales and selling in the pharmaceutical industry 
absent an result,it is the province of the court to construe the relevant statutes and regulations.cal.river watch,at.as noted supra,plaintiffs argue that by not transferring any product to physicians,they are not selling pharmaceuticals,but only promoting them.plaintiffs say this distinction is warranted in light of the rule that the flsa be narrowly construed against employers.webster,at.for its part,glaxo urges us to view sale in section k in a commonsensical fashion,while contending that the meaning of sale is permissive.glaxo urges us to adopt the rationale that the phrase other disposition in section k definition of sale is a broad category this view was cited with approval by the district court here,and is supported by the secretary usage,dating back to,of the language that an employee must in some sense make a sale.at quoting executive,administrative,professional outside salesman redefined,wage and hour division,of labor,report recommendations of the presiding officer harold stein at hearings preliminary to redefinition,at,emphasis added.
plaintiffs contention that they do not sell to doctors ignores the structure and realities of the heavily regulated pharmaceutical industry.it is undisputed that federal law prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from directly selling prescription medications to patients.plaintiffs suggest that despite being hired for their sales experience,being trained in sales methods,encouraging physicians to prescribe their products,and receiving compensation tied to sales,their job can not in some sense be called selling.this view ignores the reality of the nature of the work of detailers,as it has been carried out for decades.plaintiffs argument also fails to account for the fact that the relevant purchasers in the pharmaceutical industry,and the appropriate foci of our inquiry,are not the of the drug but,rather,the prescribing physicians whom they importune frequently.see,baum astrazeneca lp,d,discussing why the professional paradigm places the physician as the relevant decision maker in the health services industry,aff on other grounds,fed.app x cir.unlike conventional retail sales,the patient is not at liberty to choose personally which prescription pharmaceutical he desires.as such,he can not be fairly characterized as the buyer.instead,it is patient physician,who is vested with both a moral and legal duty to prescribe medication appropriately,who selects the medication and is the appropriate focus of our inquiry.in this industry,the sale is the exchange of commitments between the psr and physician at the end of a successful call.through such commitments,the manufacturer will provide an effective product and the doctor will appropriately prescribe for all practical purposes,this is a sale.because pharmaceutical manufacturers appreciate who the real buyer is,they have structured their sales force and their marketing tactics to accommodate this unique environment.
when a psr visits a doctor,he or she attempts to obtain the absolute maximum commitment from his or her buyer a commitment from the physician to prescribe the psr assigned product when medically appropriate.in most industries,there are no firm legal barriers that prohibit the actual physical exchange of the goods offered for sale.because such barriers do exist in this industry,the fact that commitments are is irrelevant the record reveals that binding or,a physician commitment to a psr is nevertheless a meaningful exchange because pharmaceutical manufacturers value these commitments enough to reward a psr with increased commissions when a physician increases his or her use of a drug in the psr bag.see,baum,d at this court believes that other courts,and perhaps regulatory agencies,underestimate the significance of this oral commitment from physicians.in part,this error emerges from a misunderstanding of the ways in which human beings are socially and informally motivated.sometimes lawyers and judges forget that a person word means something remarkably,many people do not actually need a contract to bind themselves to their word.
moreover,the industry has agreed upon and abides by the phrma code to regulate the marketing of medicine to healthcare as any maker might develop rules to limit the express warranties its sales force might offer to a customer.such industry practice and prevailing customs should inform our disposition.reiseck universal commc ns of miami,cir in resolving whether advertising sales director was an administrative or sales worker in the publishing industry a careful consideration of employer business model provides some clarity.
under plaintiffs view,psrs are not salespeople,despite the fact that more than pharmaceutical representatives make daily calls on physicians for the purpose of driving greater sales.see ims health,at.we can not square this view with section k use of the word sale,which includes other disposition s.while we recognize that the flsa is to be narrowly construed in light of its remedial nature,that general principle does not mean that every word must be given a rigid,formalistic interpretation.for example,for over seventy years,the secretary has emphasized a sensible application of the exemptions in the preamble to the rule,the secretary employs the openended concept that a salesman is someone who in some sense sells.at emphasis added.in other words,while the secretary asks us to narrowly interpret this exemption,she herself acknowledges that technical considerations alone and changes in the way sales are made should not be grounds for denying the exemption.see.at.
to further explain our common sense understanding of why psrs make sales,we find the paradigm outside salesman case jewel tea.cir.the importance of jewel tea is illustrated by the fact that both parties and the amicus offer it as favorable precedent for their conflicting positions.
jewel tea involved a flsa suit brought by three employees of a tea,coffee,and sundry goods manufacturer and distributor.at.the plaintiffs held the position of route salesmen to sell and distribute products to customers in their homes.id.the area in which the company sold its goods was divided and e ach salesman was assigned an exclusive territory which he cover ed.id.the employees made no immediate deliveries but instead took orders for future delivery,although they might advance an item to a customer.id.the company provided sales training and sent a supervisor with a new hire on early sales calls before permitting the employee to go out on a route by himself.id.at.further,employees were taught a sale method to employ when speaking with customers.id.a certain degree of knowledge about the products and potential customers was also required t he salesman must know recipes for the preparation of the company products and must learn the general requirements of each family,in order to avoid his customer and in order to anticipate the family needs.id.after working in the field during the day,employees completed some clerical tasks at night.id.at.finally,employees were paid a base salary plus a commission if their collections were in excess of a sum certain.id.
the jewel tea plaintiffs brought suit to collect unpaid overtime,asserting they did not fall within the outside sales exemption,primarily employing the argument that they were delivery men.id.at.in its decision denying plaintiffs overtime pay,the tenth circuit penned the justification for the outside sales exemption 
the reasons for excluding an outside salesman are fairly apparent.such salesman,to a great extent,works individually.there are no restrictions respecting the time he shall work and he can earn as much or as little,within the range of his ability,as his ambition dictates.in lieu of overtime,he ordinarily receives commissions as extra compensation.he works away from his employer place of business,is not subject to the personal supervision of his employer,and his employer has no way of knowing the number of hours he works per day.to apply hourly standards primarily devised for an employee on a fixed hourly wage is incompatible with the individual character of the work of an outside salesman.
reviewing the undisputed facts here,we consider the rationale for applying the outside sales exemption to psrs to be as apparent as it was in jewel tea.of course,this case does not involve sales.but,the flsa is not an statute.as the second circuit recognized in reiseck,not all flsa claims will involve the archetypal businesses envisaged by the flsa,at.even though there are differences,it is notable that the salesmen in jewel tea and plaintiffs here each worked in assigned territories,did not make immediate deliveries,were required to analyze client backgrounds,received product training,employed a routine for client interaction,were accompanied by supervisors for training,were later subject to minimal supervisor oversight,completed clerical activities at the end of the day,and had a dual salary and compensation plan tied to their performance.even though psrs lack some hallmarks of the classic salesman,the great bulk of their activities are the same,as is the overarching purpose of obtaining a commitment to purchase prescribe something.
the primary duty of a psr is not promoting glaxo products in general or schooling physicians in drug development.these are but preliminary steps toward the end goal of causing a particular doctor to commit to prescribing more of the particular drugs in the psr drug bag.without this commitment and the concomitant increase in prescriptions,or drug volume,or market without more psr would not receive his or her commission salary and could soon find himself or herself unemployed.while not all steps in the psr daily activities constitute selling,that fact does not render the totality of those activities promotion work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee own outside sales or solicitations shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work and other work that furthers the employee sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt work.b.
the secretary distinction between selling and promoting is only meaningful if the employee does not engage in any activities that constitute selling under the act.this much is seen from the plain language of the regulations,which gives the example of promotional work as a company representative who visits chain stores,arranges the merchandise on shelves,replenishes stock by replacing old with new merchandise,sets up displays and consults with the store manager when inventory runs low,but does not obtain a commitment for additional purchases.c emphasis added.psrs do far more than collect general data or provide consultations indeed they ask for,and sometimes obtain,a commitment by the doctor to prescribe glaxo drugs,and whether the doctor keeps that commitment is verified and traced using aggregated pharmacy data glaxo collects.see ims health,at a valuable tool in this endeavor,available through the omnipresence of computerized technology,is knowledge of each individual physician prescribing history.
in reisick,the second circuit highlighted
