endo pharmaceuticals,endo appeals from the district court order denying its motions for a preliminary injunction to prevent roxane laboratories,roxane,actavis,and actavis south atlantic llc actavis from marketing and selling their respective generic drug products during the pendency of this litigation.because the district court erred in concluding that roxane and actavis appellees had an implied license to practice the asserted patents,and because appellees do not have an express license,we vacate and remand.
background 
endo sells opana er,which are branded extendedrelease tablets containing a painkiller called oxymorphone.the asserted patents are listed in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations orange book entry for opana er.two of the asserted patents,patent the patent and the patent,are each continuations of the same parent application and are directed to oxymorphone compositions and methods of treating pain using those compositions.the third,patent the patent,is not related to the other two patents.it recites purified oxymorphone compositions and methods of making those compositions.the and patents are at issue in both appeals,and the patent is at issue only in the actavis appeal.
prior to this litigation,endo sued appellees for patent infringement under e a based on their abbreviated new drug applications andas to market generic versions of opana same products as those at issue in these appeals.the first set of lawsuits settled after endo granted to appellees a license and a covenant not to sue.the settlement and license agreement between endo and roxane roxane agreement defines licensed patents as follows 
a any patents that are both i now owned by endo and ii issued as of the effective date of this agreement,including the opana er patents,b any patent applications that claim priority to the opana er patents,including any continuation,and divisional patent applications that claim priority to opana er patents,and 
c any patents resulting from the reissue or reexamination of patents or patent application of patents or patent applications comprised within clauses a and b

pursuant to the agreement,endo granted roxane a covenant that it would not assert that roxane generic versions of opana er infringe the licensed patents and a license under the licensed patents to make,use,have made,sell,offer to sell,import and use those generic products.roxane a,b emphases added see also roxane.finally,the roxane agreement includes a no implied rights provision stating that endo does not grant to roxane any license or right whether by implication,estoppel or otherwise,other than as expressly granted herein.roxane.the settlement and license agreement between endo and actavis actavis agreement is similar.the actavis agreement includes a grant of a license,a covenant not to sue,and a no implied rights provision,but covers one additional patent not included in the roxane agreement and not relevant to this appeal.in appeal actavis,at.
the patents that are the subject of this litigation issued after endo agreements with appellees.the and patents issued to endo and the patent was acquired by endo.endo again sued appellees for patent infringement under e a and moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the marketing and sales of their generic oxymorphone formulations.appellees opposed on the theories of express license and implied license by reason of legal estoppel.with regard to the latter,appellees argued that endo attempted to deprive them of the benefit of the earlier bargain.roxane see also actavis.
at a joint hearing,the district court commented that this is a highly unfair and unjust situation if infringement of the new patents would stop the marketing and permitting process that was going on by actavis and roxane.actavis.the court held that as a matter of law endo is estopped from claiming that the activity of actavis and roxane,which has gone on for a substantial period of time,is now suddenly barred because of these new patents.id.the court therefore denied endo motions.endo,actavis,cv tpg,ecf.

express license 
endo argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying endo motions for a preliminary injunction.endo contends that the plain language of the agreements,which limit licensed patents to several enumerated patents and applications claiming priority to them,does not grant appellees an express license to practice the asserted patents.it argues that the no implied rights provision further makes clear that the agreements do not cover the asserted patents.in the district court,both actavis and roxane argued that they have an express license to practice these newly issued patents.in this appeal,actavis no longer presents this argument,although roxane continues to do so.the district court did not decide the question of express license,stating that i do not feel,for the purposes of a preliminary injunction motion,that i am able to make any findings on the issues that i have just described.actavis.
roxane responds that the express terms of the settlement and license agreement grant it a license to practice the asserted patents because the previously licensed patent patent claims priority to provisional application application,and the and patents also claim priority to that provisional application.it contends that the word including in b of the roxane agreement shows that the agreement covers more than just continuation,and divisional applications that claim priority to the opana er patents.roxane argues that this section necessarily embraces any patent applications that claim priority to any applications and provisional applications to which the licensed patents likewise claim priority.roxane br.it contends that endo interpretation reads out the word including and other license terms,and argues that the common provisional application teaches subject matter that binds the patent to the asserted and patents.
roxane express license arguments are meritless.section b of the roxane agreement covers patent applications that claim priority to the opana er patents,any of the licensed patents,including any continuation,and divisional patent applications that claim priority to opana er patents.roxane b.there can be no dispute that the and patents are not continuations of any of the licensed patents likewise,there is no reasonable argument that the and patents claim priority to any of the licensed patents.an application that claims priority to another patent must contain an express to a nonprovisional application from which the patent issued.d see encyclopaedia britannica,alpine elecs.of.the and patents,however,do not the applications that issued as any of the licensed patents.see patent ll.patent ll.therefore,it is quite clear that the and patents do not claim priority to any of the licensed patents.
roxane argument that the word including somehow broadens what it means to claim priority to another patent is unpersuasive.the roxane agreement covers any applications that claim priority to the patent,including any continuation,and divisional patent applications.roxane j.claiming priority to a licensed patent is a prerequisite for the license,and including by no means eviscerates that requirement.there is no reading of this language that extends coverage to patents that merely have a provisional application in common with the licensed patents.the figure reproduced below,which is part of the record,shows this clearly.see roxane.the and patents claim priority to the provisional application,and the patent claims priority to the application as well.the and patents do not claim priority to the patent.although the language is clear on its face,the fact that endo and roxane considered including in their agreement a grant of a license to any application claiming a common priority date as the licensed patents reinforces this conclusion.roxane emphasis added.because the and patents have a provisional application in common with the patent,the common priority date language would have expressly covered the and patents.see e.but that language does not appear in the final version of the roxane agreement.
the actavis agreement likewise does not cover the,and patents at issue in the actavis appeal.it contains the same continuations,or divisionals language as the roxane agreement.see actavis.for the reasons discussed above,the asserted patents are not continuations,or divisionals of the licensed patents.see mpep.finally,the patent is completely unrelated to any of the previously licensed patents,and is likewise not covered by the agreement.we hold that appellees do not have an express license to practice any of the patents asserted in this litigation.
ii.implied license 
endo argues that the district court legally erred in concluding that appellees are impliedly licensed to practice the asserted patents due to legal estoppel.it contends that the court recognition of an implied license defense is incorrect.it argues that the specifications of the asserted patents are different from those of the previously licensed patents,and that the claims cover different subject matter.endo points out that the previously licensed patent the patent that claims priority to the same provisional application as the and patents was not even asserted in the previous litigation,and only added to the final settlement and license agreements because endo realized that appellees did not infringe it.endo argues that,in contrast,the and patents and the unrelated patent cover the accused generic tablets.endo argues that the cases relied upon by appellees regarding estoppel are distinguishable because they involved continuations and because the licenses in those cases included products as well as patents.endo argues that,by ignoring the language of the agreements and the parties intent,the district court approach violates the sanctity of contract and thus implicates serious public policy concerns.
appellees respond that they have an implied license to practice the asserted patents based on the principle that equity does not permit the licensor to detract from its grant of a property right.appellees contend that endo granted them a license to market their accused generic products for valuable consideration,that they relied on the license in going forward with the food and drug administration approval of the andas,and that endo patents eviscerated the benefit of the licenses.appellees argue that the no implied rights language in the agreements is not dispositive because estoppel must override any such provision.roxane br.see actavis br.
appellees contend that the facts here are analogous to those in transcore,lp electronic transaction consultants,where we held that the patentee was legally estopped from bringing a second infringement action even though the earlier settlement agreement stated that it shall not apply to any other patents.they argue that transcore and related cases dictate that endo can not deprive appellees of the benefit of the earlier bargain,and that nothing in the reasoning of transcore limits its holding to continuations or even related applications.appellees contend that the settlement and license agreements should be deemed as allowing them to make,use,and sell their generic tablets without threat of further lawsuits by endo.
we hold that appellees broad reading of transcore is incorrect and agree with endo that the district court erred as a matter of law in finding legal estoppel in favor of actavis and roxane.we begin with the proposition,recognized in transcore,that a patent license does not convey to the licensee an absolute right to make,use,or sell a product because not even the patentee is given that right.spindelfabrik suessenschurr,stahlecker grill gmbh schubert salzer maschinefabrik aktiengesellschaft,quoted in transcore,at.the patentee right is merely one to exclude others from making,using or selling the product covered by the licensed patent,and the patentee and his licensee,when making,using,or selling the product,can be subject to suit under other patents when practicing the patented invention.id.
the doctrine of legal estoppel does not nullify these general principles.instead,it refers to a narrow category of conduct encompassing scenarios where a patentee has licensed or assigned a right,received consideration,and then sought to derogate from the right granted.transcore,at alteration omitted emphasis added.in transcore,the patentee asserted a continuation patent that was broader than,and necessary to practice one of the patents included in a prior settlement agreement.id.we observed that the fact that the patentee adopted its licensed patent infringement contentions as its contentions related to the asserted patent,provided undisputed evidence that the patentee sought to enforce the asserted patent in derogation of the rights it granted under the prior agreement,id.at.even though the agreement stated that it shall not apply to other patents to be issued in the future,we concluded that the patentee was legally estopped from asserting a patent whose claim scope fully encompassed that of the claims of one of the licensed patents.id.at.we thus recognized that the asserted patent claims were broader than the licensed claims.to avoid a windfall to the licensee,we expressly limited the implied license to the scope of the licensed claims.id.t o obtain the benefit of its bargain with the licensor,the licensee must be permitted to practice the asserted patent to the same extent it may practice the licensed patents.id.at licensee rights under its implied license to the asserted patent are necessarily coextensive with the rights it received in the license agreement.
our subsequent cases confirm the limited scope of transcore.in general protecht group,leviton manufacturing,inc,we found an implied license where the asserted patents had t he same inventive subject matter as that disclosed in the licensed patents and t he same products were accused.as in transcore,the patents at issue in general protecht were continuations of the licensed patents.see id.at quoting transcore,at.we observed that the newly asserted continuations are based on the same disclosure as the previously licensed patents and that,by definition,the continuations can claim no new inventions not already supported in the earlier issued patents.id.at.after explaining that transcore prohibits a patent licensor from derogating from rights granted under the license,we held that where continuations issue from parent patents that previously have been licensed as to certain products,it may be presumed that,absent a clear indication of mutual intent to the contrary,those products are impliedly licensed under the continuations as well.id.emphasis added.in intel negotiated data solutions,we explained that transcore and general protecht analyzed a licensee rights when the patent holder received a continuation patent and recognized that allowing the patent holder to sue on subsequent patents,when those later patents contain the same inventive subject matter that was licensed,risks derogating rights for which the licensee paid consideration,emphases added.taken together,these cases stand for the rule that a license or a covenant not to sue enumerating specific patents may legally estop the patentee from asserting continuations of the licensed patents in the absence of mutual intent to the contrary.see protecht,at transcore,at.we reject appellees invitation to expand the implied license doctrine.you get what you bargain for.and we will not use the implied license doctrine to insert ourselves into that bargain and rewrite the contract.
endo is not estopped from asserting the patents at issue in these appeals because none of the asserted patents is a continuation of any of the licensed patents.the only familial relationship between the asserted and licensed patents is that the and patents claim priority to the same provisional application as the patent.that,however,does not make these patents continuations of the patent.see mpep.the patent is not related to any of the licensed patents.the lack of a continuation relationship between any of the asserted and licensed patents and explicit disclaimer of any other licenses not within the literal terms of the contract are dispositive.
appellees rely heavily on the general rule that t he grantor is estopped from taking back in any extent that for which he has already received consideration.actavis br.quoting transcore,at quoting amp united states,see also roxane br.but this rule does not apply to the cases before us because,unlike accused infringers in transcore and general protecht,appellees seek to capture via implied license subject matter in addition to that for which they bargained.amp is not to the contrary because the agreement at issue in that case gave the government the license to practice,and cause to be practiced throughout the world,each subject invention rather than any specific patents.at,emphasis added.amp made clear that t he facet of this licensing agreement which is of crucial importance is that it licenses the government to use an idea and not just the byrem patent itself.id.at emphasis in original.by asserting a newly acquired patent covering the licensed invention,amp derogated from its grant,and the court of claims concluded that amp patent infringement suit was barred by legal estoppel in order to protect the specific rights granted to the government by contract.id.at.
here,rather than grant a license to an idea,endo has granted to appellees a license and covenant not to sue limited to specific patents and patent applications.if appellees wanted to market and sell their accused generic products free from any threat of being sued by endo for patent infringement,they could have negotiated for the appropriate language in the settlement and license agreements.as we observed in spindelfabrik,patent license agreements can be written to convey different scopes of promises not to sue,a promise not to sue under a specific patent or,more broadly,a promise not to sue under any patent the licensor now has or may acquire in the future.at quoted in transcore,at.having agreed to licenses that do not cover the patents at issue in these appeals,appellees will not now be heard to complain.
conclusion 
we have considered the parties remaining arguments and do not find them to be persuasive.we vacate the district court denials of a preliminary injunction in both cases and remand for further proceedings.
vacated and remanded 
i agree with the majority that roxane did not have an express or implied license to practice the and patents.roxane was aware of endo applications for those patents at the time of the settlement with endo,and the parties agreed not to include them in the settlement agreement.this,it seems to me,is inconsistent with an implied license.i also agree that actavis does not have an implied license to the patent,which endo did not own at the time of the actavis settlement agreement.
i part company with the majority on the question of whether actavis has an implied license to the and patents.at the time of their settlement agreement,endo owned those patent applications,which claimed priority to the same provisional application that provided priority to a patent covered by the settlement agreement the patent.during the settlement negotiations,endo did not disclose the and patent applications,but rather licensed actavis to produce the product at issue here.furthermore,there are material differences between the actavis and roxane agreements and negotiations.under these circumstances,i conclude that actavis has an implied license to practice the and patents with respect to the product covered by the anda that was the subject of the settlement agreement.i respectfully dissent from the majority contrary conclusion.
under the hatch waxman act,pharmaceutical manufacturers filing a new drug application nda must list patents in the fda orange book that could reasonably be asserted against a competing generic producer.b c ii.endo filed an nda for a pain relief medication called opana er on june,nda.endo listed four patents covering the nda product the,and patents in the orange book.the fda approved endo nda.
on february,actavis sent endo notice that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application anda seeking fda approval to market a generic version of opana er,as did roxane on december.after receiving these notices,endo sued actavis and roxane which had also filed a similar anda in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,claiming that actavis and roxane anda filings constituted an act of infringement.see e a.endo asserted only the patent in the complaint.
before the litigation could proceed to trial,endo entered into separate settlement and license agreements with actavis in and roxane in,permitting these companies to sell generic versions of opana er pursuant to their anda filings.sections a and b of actavis agreement with endo granted actavis a license to produce and sell generic versions of opana er under the patent and specified that endo covenant s not to sue i,licenses actavis for infringement of the opana er patents,the,and patents based on the manufacture,use,import,sale or offer for sale of any opana er generic products actavis.the actavis agreement defined opana er generic product as any product that is sold under the actavis anda.actavis.sections a and b of roxane settlement agreement with endo were similar both agreements also contained clauses stating endo do es not grant to actavis or roxane any license,right or immunity,whether by implication,estoppel or otherwise,other than as expressly granted herein.actavis roxane.however,as i later discuss,roxane negotiation history and resulting agreement differed significantly in other respects from that of actavis.
the fda approved both actavis and roxane andas,and those companies have been selling generic versions of opana er under their andas since.
at the time of the settlement agreements,endo had pending patent applications for the and patents.this was disclosed to roxane but not to actavis.after actavis and roxane began to sell their generic versions of opana er pursuant to their settlement agreements,the pto issued the and patents to endo in november and december,respectively.these patents cover opana er active ingredient as well as its slow release method.see patent patent.endo has now listed these new patents in the orange book as related to opana er.the and patents claim priority to the same provisional application that gave priority to the patent licensed under the settlement agreements.
in this case,endo has sought to enjoin actavis and roxane production of opana er generic products on the ground that such sales infringe the and patents.thus,the question is whether,as the district court held,these companies have implied licenses to produce the disputed products under their settlement agreements with endo.
in my view,the majority holding that actavis has no right to an implied license is inconsistent with our prior decisions in transcore,lp electronic transaction consultants,f d and general protecht group,leviton manufacturing.the majority reads these cases as standing for the proposition that a license or a covenant not to sue enumerating specific patents may legally estop the patentee from asserting continuations of the licensed patents in the absence of mutual intent to the contrary.majority op.at.i think there is no meaningful distinction between the provisional patent relationship at issue in this appeal and the continuation patent relationships at issue in our earlier decisions.
