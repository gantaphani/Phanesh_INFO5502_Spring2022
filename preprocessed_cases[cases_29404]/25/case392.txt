pursuant to the chemical diversion and trafficking act of,the drug enforcement agency dea may order the suspension of any importation or exportation of a listed chemical on the ground that the chemical may be diverted to the clandestine manufacture of a controlled substance petitioner,a pharmaceutical manufacturer,does not dispute that some of its products contain ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,both listed chemicals and both critical in the manufacture of methamphetamine,a controlled substance.nor does petitioner dispute that its ephedrine and products have been and will continue to be diverted to illicit methamphetamine labs.instead,petitioner argues that when dea suspends shipments of listed this case,the agency suspended two such may act only on the basis of evidence that the raw listed chemical,not the finished product containing the listed chemical,may be diverted.alternatively,petitioner argues that even if dea may act on the basis of evidence that the finished product may be diverted,the suspension orders in this case were unsupported by substantial evidence.we disagree on both counts and deny the petition for review.dea,acting on the basis of its law enforcement experience and expertise,reasonably interpreted the phrase listed chemical to include ephedrine and pseudoephedrine contained in finished drug products.moreover,a series of letters from dea warning petitioner that thousands of bottles of its products had been found in some methamphetamine labs in at least eighteen states provides more than enough evidence to support the suspension orders.
a powerful and highly addictive synthetic stimulant,methamphetamine is a growing problem for and officials across the country,particularly in western states.chronic methamphetamine abuse can lead to psychotic behavior including intense paranoia,visual and auditory hallucinations,and rages that can result in violent episodes.office of drug control policy,methamphetamine fact sheet.rooting out the illegal manufacture and distribution of the drug has proven especially difficult because it can be made in a portable cooler with ingredients bought at the corner drugstore.timothy egan,meth building its hell kitchen in rural america,times,at.
congress first major effort to arm the federal government with adequate authority to stamp out homemade methamphetamine production came in the chemical diversion and trafficking act of cdta,tit.vi,subtit.a,stat.to discourage the diversion of listed chemicals including two critical methamphetamine ingredients,ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,id.codified as amended at c,k the cdta requires companies to report transactions in such chemicals to dea,see id.a codified at b,and imposes criminal liability on individuals who import a listed chemical knowing,or having reasonable cause to believe,that it will be used to manufacture a controlled substance,see id.c codified as amended at d.using language central to the issue before us,one section of the act,now codified at section c,also provides that dea may order the suspension of any importation or exportation of a listed chemical on the ground that the chemical may be diverted to the clandestine manufacture of a controlled substance.id.a codified as amended at c.
as the cdta tightened the screws on access to raw listed chemicals,illicit methamphetamine manufacturers shifted to extracting ephedrine and pseudoephedrine from common medications,including sudafed and some types of primatene.since the two listed chemicals are present in such medications in a chemically unchanged form,the extraction process is relatively simple.congress sought to counter this trend with the domestic chemical diversion control act of,which for the first time required companies to report all transactions in drug products containing listed chemicals.pub.a c,stat,codified as amended at a iv.still dissatisfied,congress enacted the methamphetamine act of,pub,tit.xxxvi,stat,which allocated significant funding to combating methamphetamine production,id.c,b,c,and imposed stiffer penalties on the operators of methamphetamine laboratories,id.
petitioner pdk laboratories,a large manufacturer of generic drugs containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,has long known that its products have been diverted to clandestine methamphetamine labs.in march,dea sent pdk a warning letter documenting the appearance of the company products at methamphetamine labs in various states over an period.two years later,another dea warning letter informed pdk that its products had been found at additional methamphetamine labs.and over the subsequent eleven months,dea sent additional warning letters informing the company that its ephedrine and products were still showing up at illicit drug labs across the country.in total,dea alerted pdk to the diversion of thousands of bottles of its previously imported listed chemicals to approximately illicit methamphetamine sites located in at least states.see indace,suspension of shipments.
by january,dea had had enough.relying on the string of warning letters,as well as on pdk failure to report several regulated transactions,dea flexed its section c authority and issued suspension orders to two foreign manufacturers preparing to ship kilograms of raw ephedrine to pdk.pdk challenged the suspension orders,and an administrative law judge alj,siding with the company,concluded that the orders lacked adequate legal and factual support.in her analysis,the alj construed dea authority to suspend importations of listed chemicals to extend only to cases in which the agency has evidence that bulk listed chemicals like raw not finished drug products that contain listed be diverted to clandestine drug manufacturers.
on appeal,dea deputy administrator disagreed with the alj.indace,suspension of shipments.reading section c to permit suspension if dea finds that finished drug products containing listed chemicals may be diverted,the deputy administrator held that dea could properly rely on the diversion of pdk products to justify suspending the ephedrine shipments.id.at.considering the totality of the circumstances,including both the warning letters and the reporting violations,the deputy administrator concluded that substantial evidence supported the suspension orders.id.at.
pdk filed a petition for review in this court.in considering this first appeal,we saw ambiguity as to whether,as the suspension orders assume,the phrase the chemical may be diverted from section c includes the prospect that pdk pills in retail stores will be sold to,or shoplifted by,people who then use the pills to produce methamphetamine.pdk,dea,pdk i.reasoning that the deputy administrator had therefore improperly concluded that section c compelled a result that it did not in fact compel,we vacated and remanded to dea to fill in the gap by bring ing its experience and expertise to bear in light of competing interests at stake.id.at.although roberts disagreed on this point,he joined in the majority alternative reason for vacating the deputy administrator order,id.at roberts,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment,namely,that it failed to address dea own relevant precedent in finding that pdk violated the cdta reporting requirements.see id.at providing the majority reasoning.
on remand,a new deputy administrator explained that,in her view,the totality of congress progressive enactments reflected its intent to provide dea the regulatory means to monitor the domestic production,manufacture and distribution of listed chemicals and prevent their illicit use in manufacturing methamphetamine.at.therefore,while acknowledging that these chemicals are often found in products that have legitimate therapeutic uses,id.at,the deputy administrator held that section c permits suspension of imports of listed chemicals based on evidence that finished drug products containing such chemicals may be diverted,id.at.because s ection c is considered by dea to be a significant component of the regulatory arsenal given it by congress to combat this immense and growing problem,and because using precursor chemicals obtained by theft or purchase of listed chemical products poses an acute challenge,id.at,the deputy administrator concluded that a narrow interpretation of the statute would unnecessarily hamper the agency efforts to prevent the diversion of listed chemicals.id.at.
defending her interpretation of section c,the deputy administrator asserted that her approach comported with the statute text,reasoning that i f congress wanted to make an express distinction between a bulk listed chemical and a finished product it could have done so.id.at.she further explained that listed chemical should be construed broadly in light of that term use in other parts of the same statute enacted by congress in,id.at,and pointed out that the ninth circuit had already interpreted listed chemical as used in one of the cdta criminal provisions to cover the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in finished drug products,id.citing united states daas,cir.the deputy administrator also believed that a narrow interpretation would create an arbitrary dual standard,for if dea could suspend shipments only if raw ephedrine were at risk of diversion,then even when dea had facts to show that an importer had reasonable cause to believe that a listed chemical was to be imported,tableted,and distributed to a clandestine laboratory,it could do nothing to suspend the shipment.id.at.such a result,she concluded,is certainly inconsistent with the criminal penalty provisions of the law involving imports,which would allow for the imposition of lengthy prison terms on the importer.id.
turning to the second substantial evidence supported the suspension deputy administrator again looked to the totality of the circumstances.examining three categories of warning letters and two types of reporting concluded that the orders were adequately supported,emphasizing that the evidence of diversion reflected in the series of warning letters provides a sufficient independent basis for sustaining the suspension orders.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the deputy administrator rejected pdk argument that dea failure to compare the rate of diversion of other companies products to pdk diversion rate rendered the suspension orders invalid.she explained 
dea recognizes that it and other law enforcement agencies are aware of and able to take action against only a small number of the total clandestine methamphetamine laboratories and dump sites in this country.accordingly,the specific universe of pdk product diverted,vis a vis,all other manufacturers products,is a number which can not be established with any specificity 
given the quantities and diverse locations of pdk listed chemical products discovered at illicit sites reflected in the warning letters,dea is able to draw a reasonable inference regarding the likelihood that the instant shipments may be diverted and to exercise its discretion as to the need to prohibit their import.
id.at.the deputy administrator also pointed out that she had considered warning letters to be adequate grounds for taking adverse action against other drug manufacturers,and that in one case she had sustained a suspension order based on fewer warning letters than dea had sent to pdk.id.
before addressing the two types of reporting violations neither of which is relevant to our disposition of this case,the deputy administrator noted a s a collateral matter that michael lulkin,pdk former counsel responsible for implementing pdk operating procedures for responding to dea warning letters,had been convicted of four counts of felony fraud,one of which involved pdk.id.yet after his conviction,lulkin remained at pdk,where his duties include overseeing the company regulatory compliance.id.the deputy administrator also observed that pdk former president,michael krasnoff,had been convicted of similar charges,yet continued to serve as a consultant to the company,his statement that it none of my business if someone gets high off of this stuff,id.at.neither of these personnel decisions,she concluded,but particularly the retention of lulkin as a key overseer of regulatory matters,generates confidence on the part of the deputy administrator that pdk is sufficiently committed to complying with the myriad of regulatory requirements designed to prevent diversion of listed chemicals.id.at.
pdk again petitions for review,challenging the deputy administrator interpretation of section c and arguing that insufficient evidence supports the suspension orders.we address each contention in turn.
when considering the legitimacy of an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with enforcing,we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron natural res.def.council,d.in this case,pdk i has already answered this question in the negative it concluded that section c is ambiguous as to whether dea can issue suspension orders based on the diversion of finished drug products that contain listed chemicals.see pdk i,at we do not agree that the meaning of c is as plain as dea says it is.this leaves us with the task of resolving at chevron second step whether the deputy administrator resolution of that ambiguity is based on a permissible construction of the statute,chevron,at,keeping in mind that a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency,id.at.
even at chevron second step,we begin with the statute language.abbott labs.young,the reasonableness of an agency construction depends on the construction fit with the statutory language as well as its conformity to statutory purposes.recall that section c provides that dea may order the suspension of any importation or exportation of a listed chemical on the ground that the chemical may be diverted to the clandestine manufacture of a controlled substance.c.according to pdk,section c does not vest dea with the authority to suspend an import based on misuse of a finished product.pet r br.but nothing in the statute spare language supports that contention.section c simply authorizes dea to suspend an importation when it finds that a listed chemical may be diverted.while it true that under the deputy administrator interpretation,the listed chemical subject to diversion may be part of a finished drug,section c in no way precludes her view that a listed chemical remains a listed chemical when,without any change in its chemical structure,it is incorporated into pills or tablets.as roberts explained in his pdk i separate opinion,the deputy administrator 
interpretation comports with common sense.if a methamphetamine manufacturer steals,for the purpose of making methamphetamine,a bottle containing pure ephedrine,or pure ephedrine dissolved in water,or a bottle containing ephedrine pills and guaifenesin pills guaifenesin is another compound present in some of pdk products,we would not hear an argument that he did not divert a listed chemical because he also diverted a bottle,some water,or some guaifenesin.the presence of packaging materials or other extraneous items does not vitiate the existence of the listed chemical.here,a bottle of pdk mini action contains pills each consisting of mg of ephedrine and mg of guaifenesin and binders.for purposes of section c,the decongestant and the binders are extraneous materials,no more relevant to the analysis than the bottles and boxes in which the pills are packaged.
pdk i,at roberts,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
absent anything in section c language suggesting that the deputy administrator interpretation is impermissible,pdk resorts to the assertion that congress,committed to ensuring that popular cold medications remain readily available,could never have intended to give dea authority to shutter the industry.although citing nothing in the cdta legislative history to support this contention,pdk explains that 
given that some misuse of ephedrine drug products concededly is endemic to the industry,the deputy administrator interpretation would allow dea to shutter the entire listed chemicals industry by using section to suspend imports to any and every manufacturer whose finished goods are misused in some is,every manufacturer in the united states.
pet r br.invoking pdk i statement that no one doubts that congress did not intend to ban,or to give dea the authority to ban,all sales of drugs in retail stores,pdk i,at emphasis added,pdk contends that the deputy administrator interpretation must therefore be unreasonable.we disagree.
for starters,the deputy administrator has never suggested that section c permits dea to ban drug sales in retail stores.nor has she claimed authority to suspend imports to any and every manufacturer in the united states.she has concluded only that in deciding whether to suspend a particular shipment of raw ephedrine,dea may consider evidence that drug products are being diverted.if,as pdk asserts,dea can readily amass evidence of diversion sufficient to warrant suspending any ephedrine shipment,that attests to the rampant nature of the diversion problem for our section c breadth,not to whether the deputy administrator interpretation is unreasonable.as we have explained,the supreme court has consistently instructed that statutes written in broad,sweeping language should be given broad,sweeping application.consumer elecs.ass fcc.
even under pdk narrow interpretation,moreover,dea would still have authority,at least in principle,to shutter the industry.after all,there is a risk that every shipment of raw ephedrine could be diverted before delivery,just as there is a risk that finished drug products containing ephedrine could be diverted after delivery.if dea could amass substantial evidence to support the inference that all raw ephedrine shipments may be diverted a big if,of no one doubts it would have the authority to suspend those shipments,thus shuttering the industry.when even a narrow interpretation of section c would authorize dea to shutter the industry,a more expansive interpretation could hardly be considered unreasonable on that basis.the relative ease with which dea can document diversion of ephedrine and drugs goes to the quantum of evidence necessary to justify the inference that a shipment may be diverted a question we shall turn to shortly,but it has little relevance to the interpretation of listed chemical.
nor do we see any merit to pdk charge that the deputy administrator failed to consider the competing interests at stake,as pdk i instructs.pdk i,at.contrary to pdk insistence,nothing in pdk i requires the deputy administrator to weigh the risk that her interpretation could potentially shutter the industry against dea statutory charge to prevent ephedrine diversion.pdk i merely gives the boilerplate instruction that the deputy administrator,when interpreting section c,must bring her experience and expertise to bear in light of competing interests at stake.id.
moreover,as pdk i directs,the deputy administrator did interpret section c in light of her experience and expertise.see cont l air lines,dot,an agency must provide a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the interpretation serves the statutory objectives internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.she emphasized not only that dea considers the suspension provision a critical weapon in its arsenal,but also that pdk narrow reading would severely hamper the provision usefulness.at.she reasoned that pdk interpretation would lead to an arbitrary dual standard,an importer who delivered ephedrine knowing that it would be diverted after being processed into finished products could be held criminally liable,yet dea would lack authority to suspend the shipment itself.id.at.and drawing on dea experience with the growing problem of homemade methamphetamine,she concluded that the statute should be construed broadly to effectuate its purpose of protecting the public.id.at.far from being a case in which an agency has failed to explain its interpretive decision,see republican comm.fec,w e might determine that although not barred by statute,an agency action is arbitrary and capricious because the agency has not considered certain relevant factors or articulated any rationale for its choice,the deputy administrator reasoning provides a justification for her resolution of section c ambiguity,see.pub.serv.epa,as long as the agency stays within congress delegation,it is free to make policy choices in interpreting the statute,and such interpretations are entitled to deference.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in reaching this conclusion,we acknowledge that dea could someday abuse its broad section c authority to reach an outcome congress would not have approved.yet all congressional delegations of discretionary broad delegations like this such a risk.without more,the theoretical possibility that an agency might someday abuse its authority is of limited relevance in determining whether the agency interpretation of a congressional delegation is reasonable.should dea one day opt to shutter the industry,as pdk fears,the courts remain open to consider a challenge to that action pursuant to the administrative procedure act.
pdk remaining arguments likewise lack merit.the company rightly points out that pdk i criticizes the deputy administrator for relying on legislative enactments to explicate what the cdta plainly meant,reasoning that the views of a subsequent congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.pdk i,at quoting united states price,d.but here,the deputy administrator used legislative action for a very different purpose,namely,to help her choose among several plausible constructions of a statute congress charged her agency with administering.we see nothing inappropriate about this.in exercising delegated authority to resolve statutory ambiguities,agencies can and should consider policy input from a wide variety of sources,including the views of private citizens,industry groups,organizations,legal commentators,and,most certainly,congress.our case law supports this.for example,while we cautioned in southern california edison ferc,against relying on subsequent legislative history to divine an earlier congress intent,id.at,we nonetheless observed that w ith respect to congress current policy goals,as distinguished from retrospective legislative history,we find the subsequent committee reports quite illuminating,id.at mccreary offner,t o determine whether a statute is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning legislative commentary offering a plausible interpretation is certainly relevant,much like plausible interpretations from litigants,other courts,law review articles,or any other source would be.indeed,it would be quite peculiar to bar an agency seeking to fill a statutory gap from considering strong indications of congress developing preferences.here,for example,subsequent congressional action reflects the severity of the diversion problem,as well as congress commitment to addressing it aggressively,both of which clearly support the deputy administrator broad interpretation of her statutory authority.
pdk next points to our observation in pdk i that the domestic chemical diversion control act dcdca drew a distinction between,on the one hand,the finished product and,on the other hand,the listed chemical.pdk i,at.according to pdk,this tends to indicate that congress intended section to address diversion of raw,bulk listed chemicals from their intended destination.pet r br.even setting aside the hypocrisy of this claim when juxtaposed with pdk previous later congressional enactments are relevant to interpreting section c or they argument is without merit.true,the dcdca does speak of drugs and drug products as distinct from listed chemicals,see dcdca b codified at a,e,leading us to have reasoned in pdk i that o ne might say that in the view of a later congress it is pdk drug or drug product,not the listed chemical mentioned in c,that is being diverted,pdk i,at emphasis added.but the dcdca distinction could just as easily demonstrate that when congress wishes to distinguish between drugs and listed chemicals,it does so.indeed,the deputy administrator took just this position.at if congress wanted to make an express distinction between a bulk listed chemical and a finished product in section c,it could have done so,and we have no license to substitute pdk preferred interpretation
