on appeal,plaintiffs contend section is inapplicable to physician because prescribing a lethal dose of drugs a patient may or may not have filled or take is not direct participation in suicide and,in any event,the legislative history of section shows the legislature never intended that section apply to a person furnishing the means of suicide.alternatively,plaintiffs contend section as applied to physician violates the state constitutional right to autonomy privacy.cal.
on october,governor jerry brown signed the end of life option act,which authorizes a terminally ill patient with the capacity to make medical decisions to request a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs,insulates a prescribing physician from criminal liability,and sets forth rigorous procedures and safeguards to protect against abuse.assem.bill.assembly bill.the parties agree assembly bill does not render the appeal moot because it will likely not become effective in time to benefit plaintiffs,particularly christy lynne donorovich odonnell,given her life expectancy and the measure future is uncertain because opponents have filed paperwork with the attorney general to challenge it by referendum on the state ballot in.
we have great compassion for plaintiffs,but we conclude their statutory and constitutional arguments lack merit.we agree with defendants that physician,and attendant procedures and safeguards against abuse,are matters for the legislature.we affirm the judgment for defendants entered after their demurrers to the complaint were sustained.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs donorovich odonnell,elizabeth antoinette melanie gobertina wallner,and wolf alexander breiman,are all terminally ill.donorovich odonnell,who resides in santa clarita,suffers from stage iv adenocarcinoma of the left lung,which has metastasized to her brain,liver,spine,and rib.at the time of the complaint filing in may,her estimated life expectancy was less than six months.she is morphine intolerant and can not benefit from many of the most common and effective forms of pain management.wallner,who resides in sacramento,has stage iv colon cancer,which has metastasized to her liver and lung.breiman,who resides in ventura,has multiple myeloma,a blood cancer.
donorovich odonnell,wallner,and breiman are competent adults who desire the option of a peaceful death without suffering,and they want a d ying to be an option in their health care.they all want to live,but accept their terminal prognoses.having a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs they could if their suffering became too great in the final days would provide great comfort to them and would alleviate some anxiety related to the dying process.
plaintiff lynette carol cederquist,resides in san diego.she is board certified in hospice and palliative medicine and internal medicine.in addition to being a medical school clinical professor,she regularly treats patients and advises them on options.she does not provide because she fears prosecution under section.if such treatment were lawful in california,she would be willing to write a prescription for medication to terminally ill,competent adults who,at their own discretion,could exercise the option to the drug.she considers a compassionate and ethical choice in appropriate circumstances,and believes some of her terminally ill patients would choose that option.
in may,plaintiffs brought an action in san diego county superior court for declaratory and injunctive relief.defendants are public officials with the power of criminal prosecution kamala harris,attorney general of california jackie lacey,district attorney for los angeles county ann marie schubert,district attorney for sacramento county and bonnie dumanis,district attorney for san diego county.
the complaint sought a judicial declaration that section is inapplicable to physicians who provide the option of to terminally ill,competent adults who request such aid.it also sought an injunction permanently prohibiting defendants from prosecuting physicians who provide advice and write a prescription for lethal medication under such circumstances.the complaint alleged that as applied to physicians providing to terminally ill patients,section violates state constitutional rights of privacy and liberty cal,art,free speech cal,and equal protection cal.the court granted plaintiffs request for trial preference.
attorney general harris and district attorney lacey separately demurred to the complaint,and district attorneys schubert and dumanis joined in harris demurrer.at the july hearing on the demurrers,the court stated t he first point i want to make is what is not on the table here today.this is not a case about the right to die.in california,suicide is legal.it not illegal to take one own life.there is constitutional authority that settled law that a patient can decline treatment even if that results in the patient death.so that really not an issue.whether the plaintiff s can travel to a state that allows assisted suicide is also not an issue.clearly they can.
the court characterized the issue as whether there is a constitutional right to have an assisted suicide with concomitant immunity to the assisting party.the court determined that under established precedent,donaldson lungren th donaldson,washington glucksberg glucksberg,and vacco quill vacco,there is no such right.the court believed the issue was for the legislature,and the answer is not to declare a statute section,which is clearly constitutional,unconstitutional.the court granted the demurrers without leave to amend.
judgment for defendants was entered in august.this appeal followed,and we granted in part plaintiffs request for calendar preference.
discussion 
istandard of review 
a demurrer is intended to test the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law,and thus we independently review a judgment sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend.holiday matinee,rambus,th.we assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law.citation.it is error for the trial court to sustain a demurrer if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory,and it is an abuse of discretion for the court to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff has shown there is a reasonable possibility a defect can be cured by amendment.california logistics,state of california th.
interpretation of section 
plaintiffs contend the court misinterpreted section to apply to physician.whether section applies to physicians in those circumstances is an issue of first impression.
in construing statutes,we aim to ascertain the intent of the legislature so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citations.we look first to the words of the statute,because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.klein united states of america cal th.if the plain,commonsense meaning of a statute words is unambiguous,the plain meaning controls.fitch select products cal th.
section provides every person who deliberately aids,or advises,or encourages another to commit suicide,is guilty of a felony.italics added.the language of section closely resembles that used in other parts of the penal code to define or describe the principal criminal liability of persons who aid and abet the commission of a crime,and the courts have frequently used the terms aiding and abetting interchangeably with those employed by section in discussing the elements of the crime defined by that statute.ryan,supra,th at.
although section appears to criminalize simply giving advice or encouragement,the courts have required something more than mere verbal solicitation of another person to commit a hypothetical act of suicide t he courts have interpreted the statute as proscribing the direct aiding and abetting of a specific suicidal act.some active and intentional participation in the events leading to the suicide are required in order to establish a violation.citation.thus,to prove a violation of section it is necessary to establish all of the following essential elements the defendant specifically intended the victim suicide the defendant undertook some active and direct participation in bringing about the suicide,such as by furnishing the victim with the means of suicide and,finally,the victim actually committed a specific,overt act of suicide.ryan,supra th at last italics added.
in people matlock cal d,the california supreme court held a jury instruction on section was inappropriate when the defendant was charged with strangling the victim and claimed he did so at the victim request.relying on an oregon opinion,which addressed a statute similar to section,the court explained the statute contemplates some participation in the events leading up to the commission of the final overt act,such as furnishing the means for bringing about death,the gun,the knife,the poison,or providing the water,for the use of the person who himself commits the act of.id.at,italics added,citing state bouse,defendant wife drowned in bathtub court held instruction on assisted suicide statute as alternative to murder was proper because jury might have found that defendant participation in his wife death,if he did participate,consisted only of running the water into the bathtub and helping her to get into it.
in in re joseph cal d,the court held that when a genuine suicide pact was partially fulfilled by driving a car over a cliff,the conduct of the driver,who survived,did not constitute murder and fell more properly within the statutory definition of section.the defendant supplied the instrumentality of his passenger death by driving the car over the cliff.id.at see people lam th,mccollum cbs,d,bouvia superior court d.
defendants contend section unambiguously applies to physicians providing.we agree that the term e very person in section necessarily applies to physicians.the term every person in a statute applies to all persons.people gangemi th.we also conclude the term aids in section is broad enough to apply to physicians furnishing a means of suicide.we believe prescribing a lethal dose of drugs to a terminally ill patient with the knowledge the patient may use it to end his or her life goes beyond the mere giving of advice and encouragement and falls under the category of direct aiding and abetting.plaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that furnishing the means of death whatever the means are is not direct aiding.
plaintiffs assert prescribing a lethal dose of drugs is not aid within the meaning of section because the physician is unaware of whether the patient will actually have the prescription filled or take the drugs.plaintiffs submit that the physician just makes it possible for the patient to obtain the medication from someone else,a pharmacist,and thus the physician assistance is indirect,not direct.we are unpersuaded.in support of this theory,plaintiffs rely on baxter state.in baxter,a statute provided that a person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being id.at,and another statute establishe d consent as a defense,stating the consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof is a defense.ibid.baxter held if the state prosecuted a physician for providing to a terminally ill patient,the physician may be shielded from liability pursuant to the consent statute.ibid.
plaintiffs isolate language from baxter they deem helpful,such as a physician who aids a terminally ill patient in dying is not directly involved in the final decision or the final act.baxter state,supra,at.that language,however,appears in the context of a discussion on whether physician fell within an exception to the consent statute for conduct that is against public policy even though consented to.id.at.baxter noted a survey of courts that have considered this issue yields unanimous understanding that consent is rendered ineffective as against public policy in assault cases characterized by aggressive and combative acts that breach public peace and physically endanger others.id.at.baxter concluded physician does not violate public policy because e ach stage of the interaction is private,civil,and compassionate.id.at.baxter did not interpret a statute similar to section or suggest prescribing a lethal dose of drugs does not constitute furnishing the means of suicide.an appellate decision is not authority for everything said in the opinion but only for the points actually involved and actually decided.santisas goodin cal th.
we agree with the trial court finding that w riting a prescription is direct participation for purposes of section.a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs is instrumental in accomplishing a patient suicide,and thus the act of prescribing is active and intentional participation in the events leading to the suicide.ryan,supra,th at.
for the first time on appeal,plaintiffs assert the plain terms of section do not control because the statute is latently ambiguous in light of its legislative history.they submit the legislative history shows the legislature never intended to criminalize the furnishing of the means of suicide for anyone,let alone physicians.
a statute is ambiguous when it is susceptible to more than one interpretation.coburn sievert th.a statute may be ambiguous on its face or latently ambiguous.ibid.a latent ambiguity exists where some extrinsic evidence creates a necessity for interpretation or a choice among two or more possible meanings.citation.citation.such a necessity is present where a literal construction would frustrate rather than promote the purpose of the statute.ibid.
defendants object to plaintiffs latent ambiguity argument on the ground of waiver.as a general rule,failure to raise a point in the trial court constitutes a waiver in re marriage of priem th.we have discretion,however,to address a pure question of law raised for the first time on appeal.id.at.the interpretation of a statute raises a pure question of law bettencourt city and county of san francisco th,and we consider plaintiffs position.

plaintiffs assert the drafters of the field penal code recognized that the advises,encourages,abets or assists language of draft field penal code section was not broad enough to criminalize furnishing the means of death,and thus a separate statute,draft field penal code section,was required to accomplish that goal.plaintiffs reason that because california section uses the terms aids,or advises,or encourages,which are similar to those used in draft field penal code section,the code commission intended that section not apply to furnishing the means of suicide.
we disagree with plaintiffs analysis.we believe it likely that the code commission recognized the term aids in section is broad enough to cover furnishing the means of suicide,and thus an additional statute would be superfluous.the code commission was not required to propose redundancies.kleps observes the code commission sought to simplify matters and give only one expression of a particular rule kleps,supra,cal.at,fn,and n o direction to codify the laws of the state along the lines of field new york work can be read into the statute authorizing the code commission work.id.at,italics added.
plaintiffs assert it seems that,in the code commission view,field penal code section did not stand the test of examination,and thus it did not intend to criminalize the furnishing of the means of suicide.plaintiffs,however,concede we can do no more than surmise this,because v ery little record remains of the internal functioning of the code commission quoting kleps,supra,cal.at.conjecture and speculation are not proper bases for statutory interpretation.people barker cal th,veguez governing bd.of the long beach unified school dist.th,fn.

as applied constitutional challengea 
alternatively,plaintiffs contend section as applied to any physician who may prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to a terminally ill patient competent to make medical decisions violates the patient state constitutional right of autonomy privacy this contention also presents an issue of first impression.
the courts will presume a statute is constitutional unless its unconstitutionality clearly,positively,and unmistakably appears all presumptions and intendments favor its validity.people falsetta cal th.the party arguing unconstitutionality has the burden of proof.in re york cal th.
an as applied constitutional challenge may seek relief from a specific application of a facially valid statute or ordinance to an individual or class of individuals who are under allegedly impermissible present restraint or disability as a result of the manner or circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied,or an injunction against future application of the statute in the allegedly impermissible manner it is shown to have been applied in the past.it contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the statute has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right.tobe city of santa ana cal th.if a plaintiff seeks to enjoin future,allegedly impermissible,types of application of a facially valid statute or ordinance,the plaintiff must demonstrate that such application is occurring or has occurred in the past.ibid.
article i,section of the california constitution provides all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.italics added.the phrase and privacy was added by an initiative adopted by the voters on november,the privacy initiative.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,hill.
we must interpret and apply the privacy initiative in a manner consistent with the probable intent of the voters of california.legislature eu cal d.when,as here,the language of an initiative measure does not point to a definitive resolution of a question of interpretation,it is appropriate to consider indicia of the voters intent other than the language of the provision itself.such indicia include the analysis and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.hill,supra,cal th at.
the official ballot pamphlet of the privacy initiative indicates voters were concerned about practices of both government and business.hill,supra,cal th at.the argument for the initiative emphasized the capacity of both governmental and nongovernmental agencies to gather,keep,and disseminate sensitive personal information without checking its accuracy or restricting its use to mutually agreed or otherwise legitimate purposes.id.at.a reasonable voter would most likely have concluded he or she was casting a ballot to safeguard his or her personal privacy against private as well as government entities.id.at,fn.omitted.
however,a utonomy privacy is also a concern of the privacy initiative.the ballot arguments refer to the federal constitutional tradition of safeguarding certain intimate and personal decisions from government interference in the form of penal and regulatory laws.citation.but they do not purport to create any unbridled right of personal freedom of action that may be vindicated in lawsuits against either government agencies or private persons or entities.whether established social norms safeguard a particular type of information or protect a specific personal decision from public or private intervention is to be determined from the usual sources of positive law governing the right to privacy common law development,constitutional development,statutory enactment,and the ballot arguments accompanying the privacy initiative.hill,supra,cal th at,italics added.
plaintiffs point out that under california supreme court authority interpreting the constitutional right of privacy,a person has a fundamental right of to refuse or have terminated any type of medical treatment,even when doing so will cause or hasten death.thor superior court cal th.this preeminent deference derives principally from the importance in our anglo american legal tradition of personal autonomy and the right of.id.at.further,the interest in autonomy privacy protected by the california constitutional privacy clause includes a pregnant woman right to choose whether or not to continue her pregnancy.american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th.this right to choose implicates a woman fundamental interest in the preservation of her personal health and in some instances the preservation of her life,her interest in retaining personal control over the integrity of her own body,and her interest in deciding for herself whether to parent a child.
here,the trial court relied on donaldson,supra,th,and we also find the opinion instructive despite significant factual distinctions.in donaldson,plaintiff donaldson had an inoperable brain tumor and an estimated life expectancy of five years from the date of diagnosis.he wanted to be cryogenically suspended,premortem,with the assistance of plaintiff mondragon and others.this procedure would freeze donaldson body to be later reanimated when curative treatment exist ed for his brain cancer.following cryogenic suspension,donaldson would suffer irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function and irreversible cessation of all brain function.he would be dead according to the definition of death under california law.id.at.
donaldson sought a judicial declaration he had a constitutional privacy right to fulfill his plan with the aid of third parties.he wanted mondragon to advise and encourage him to minimize the time between his legal death and the onset of the cryogenic suspension process.donaldson,supra,th at.recognizing that mondragon would be committing a homicide,or alternatively,aiding and advising a suicide,donaldson and mondragon sought an injunction protecting mondragon from criminal prosecution.id.at.
donaldson affirmed the sustaining of defendants demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend.donaldson,supra,th at.as do plaintiffs here,donaldson relied on opinions pertaining to a patient right to refuse medical treatment.donaldson explains it is one thing to take one own life,but quite another to allow a third person assisting in that suicide to be immune from investigation by the coroner or law enforcement agencies.in such a case,the state has a legitimate compelling interest in protecting society against abuses.this interest is more significant than merely the abstract interest in preserving life no matter what the quality of that life is.instead,it is the interest of the state to maintain social order through enforcement of the criminal law and to protect the lives of those who wish to live no matter what their circumstances.this interest overrides any interest donaldson possesse d in ending his life through the assistance of a third person in violation of the state penal laws.we can not expand the nature of donaldson right of privacy to provide a protective shield for third persons who end his life.id.at,italics added.the court added that i n the case of assisted suicides,the state has an important interest to ensure that people are not influenced to kill themselves.the state interest must prevail over the individual because of the difficulty,if not the impossibility,of evaluating the motives of the assister or determining the presence of undue influence.id.at thor superior court,supra,cal th at citing donaldson for proposition there is criminal liability for assisting suicide.
in addition to donaldson,the trial court here relied on glucksberg,supra,in which the united states supreme court rejected the contention that as applied to physician,washington state ban on suicide violated the liberty interest protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution glucksberg,supra,at.the court inquired whether this asserted right has any place in our nation traditions id.at,and answered it in the negative,noting we are confronted with a consistent and almost universal tradition that has long rejected the asserted right,and continues explicitly to reject it today,even for terminally ill,mentally competent adults.to hold for respondents,we would have to reverse centuries of legal doctrine and practice,and strike down the considered policy choice of almost every state.id.at,italics added.
the court concluded washington suicide ban was rationally related to legitimate government interests,including an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life glucksberg,supra,at,interests in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession id.at,protecting vulnerable groups including the poor ibid,and the fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia.id.at.glucksberg noted throughout the nation,americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality,legality,and practicality of suicide.our holding permits this debate to continue,as it should in a democratic society.id.at.
further,the trial court here relied on vacco,supra,in which the united states supreme court rejected the contention that as applied to physician,new york statutes banning assisted suicide violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.plaintiffs theory was that for terminally ill patients the refusal of medical treatment and are essentially the same,and the legality of the former and illegality of the latter constitutes differential treatment.id.at.the court concluded the statutes affect and address matters of profound significance to all new yorkers alike id.at,and thus they neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve suspect classifications and are entitled to a strong presumption of validity.id.at.
the court disagreed that refusing or ending medical treatment,which may hasten death,is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide.vacco,supra,at.rather,the distinction between assisting suicide and withdrawing treatment,a distinction widely recognized and endorsed in the medical profession and in our legal traditions,is both important and logical it is certainly rational.id.at,fn.omitted.the distinction comports with fundamental legal principles of causation and intent w hen a patient refuses medical treatment,he dies from an underlying fatal disease or pathology but if a patient ingests lethal medication prescribed by a physician,he
