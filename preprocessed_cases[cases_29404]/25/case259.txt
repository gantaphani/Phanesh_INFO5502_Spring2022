the plaintiff brought suit seeking a declaration that it had not violated a contract to which it and the defendant,along with a third firm,are parties.jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship,and the governing substantive law is that of the state of washington,though no peculiarities of washington law have been drawn to our attention.the defendant counterclaimed,charging that the plaintiff had indeed broken the contract.on for summary judgment,the district court ruled for the defendant and entered a permanent injunction against the plaintiff,precipitating this appeal.
the contract involves a medical device known as a stent.the narrowing of an artery,as by atherosclerosis,is called stenosis and one way of treating it is by balloon angioplasty,a procedure in which a small balloon is inserted into the affected artery to press against the artery wall restoring it to its normal dimensions.the stent is a metal tube that encloses the balloon and remains in the artery after the procedure.yet sometimes despite the stent the stenosis reappears this is called restenosis and there is medical opinion that the likelihood of this happening can be reduced by coating the stent with a suitable drug.one candidate to be such a drug is paclitaxel,which gained fame as an anticancer drug under the trade name taxol.the patent rights for use of paclitaxel on stents are held by a canadian company called angiotech pharmaceuticals.angiotech does not manufacture either stents or drugs,and so it decided to license the use of paclitaxel for coating stents.it granted coexclusive licenses to cook incorporated and boston scientific corporation bsc,firms involved in the development of stents for preventing restenosis.each license grants the licensee worldwide right s and license to use,manufacture,have manufactured,distribute and sell,and to grant sublicenses to its affiliates to use,manufacture,have manufactured,distribute and sell paclitaxel solely for use in stents.the licenses are exclusive in the sense that angiotech promises not to license the use of paclitaxel for coating stents to any other firm,but coexclusive in the sense that each licensee has the same rights.critically,the licenses forbid the licensee to assign his license,or to grant a sublicense to anyone except an affiliate,unless all parties to the two licenses,which is to say angiotech,bsc,and cook,agree.we call this provision the clause,although it covers sublicenses as well.why the distinction between assignment to an affiliate,which is forbidden,and sublicensing an affiliate,which is permitted,is unclear,since,while an assignment and a sublicense are not identical,a sublicense can be drafted in such a way as to have the same effect.finance investment geberit ag,cir black clawson kroenert,cir prima tek ii,a roo.
the two licenses were granted in a single contract,so that both the licensees and angiotech are contractually bound to one another.the contract provides for the arbitration of disputes arising under it,but the parties have waived that provision.angiotech is not a party to this suit it may be indifferent to the outcome or reluctant to take sides in a dispute between its most important partners in the development of stents.
why coexclusive licenses no evidence has been presented or arguments made concerning the reason for the coexclusive feature.the lawyers either have not bothered to inquire or have not bothered to inform us or the district judge concerning the commercial setting of such a contract.they seem insensitive to the importance to the sound interpretation of contracts of understanding the business purpose served by a contract provisions,and to the limitations of generalist judges knowledge of the customs and practices of specific industries.we are left to speculate,having found no secondary literature on coexclusive licenses either.
a patentee choice between granting exclusive and nonexclusive licenses is similar to a seller choice between granting exclusive and nonexclusive rights to his dealers.the dealer who is granted an exclusive right will have an enhanced incentive to devote his sales efforts to the seller product.dealers who do not receive exclusive rights will have enhanced incentives to minimize their margins by competing among themselves,thus maximizing the price that the seller can charge.consumers demand is a function of the dealer as well as the original seller profit margin.for both margins are components of the retail price,and so the lower the dealer margin is,the lower that price will be,the more therefore will be sold,and so the greater will be the original seller total profits.
thus a patentee can ordinarily be expected either to grant nonexclusive licenses in order to exploit the effect of competition in minimizing the licensees margins or to grant an exclusive license in order to encourage the licensee to invest in the further development of the licensed process or product by protecting the licensee from the competition of other licensees,which might prevent the licensee from recouping his investment.john schlicher,licensing intellectual property legal,business,and market dynamics.there are other considerations bearing on the choice between exclusive and nonexclusive licensing as well,see,michael katz carl shapiro,how to license intangible property,econ.carl shapiro,patent licensing and rivalry,am.econ.papers proceedings,may,but we need get into them.
the second goal that we have mentioned,that of encouraging investment by the licensee,is the relevant one in this case.angiotech does not manufacture or coat stents itself.it depends on its licensees to develop the product that is,the coated stents and obtain the food and drug administration approval so that the product can be marketed.if,therefore,cook or bsc were essentially interchangeable,or one were clearly a superior developer to the other,we would expect angiotech to grant an exclusive license to one of them.probably the reason it did not is that the two firms use different coating methods,requiring each to obtain separate approval from the fda before being permitted to market a stent in the united states.when the contract was made,and indeed to this day,neither cook nor bsc had yet obtained fda approval.their products are still being tested for safety and efficacy.angiotech would not have wanted to risk betting on the wrong horse granting bsc an exclusive license,for example,when cook stent might turn out to be the only stent that the fda would approve,or might be approved earlier than bsc product,or might prove to be the superior product.
at the same time and here we approach the crux of the appeal cook and bsc might be reluctant to accept nonexclusive licenses.to obtain fda approval for a new drug or medical device a stent is what the fda calls a combination product and is assigned to the division of fda that handles devices requires a substantial investment,which the manufacturer of the device might have difficulty recouping if it faced competition from another licensee.with angiotech reluctant to grant an exclusive license and cook and bsc reluctant to settle for nonexclusive licenses,coexclusive licenses were a natural compromise.
the compromise might be undone by assignment or sublicensing.suppose cook fell behind bsc in the race to develop an approved and marketable stent and tried to recover the lead by assigning its license to a firm with greater resources or other advantages that would enable it to overtake bsc.the effect would be to confront the latter with more competition than it had reckoned on when it took out its license from angiotech.hence the bar on assignment without the permission of the other licensee plus angiotech,though that is not a factor here.although competition is generally a good thing,there is no argument that angiotech would have violated antitrust law or been guilty of patent misuse had it granted an exclusive,nonassignable license.and so we can not see how angiotech action in granting two licenses and forbidding the licensees to increase the number of competitors by means of assignment or sublicensing could raise an antitrust or issue.notice that the licenses do not
