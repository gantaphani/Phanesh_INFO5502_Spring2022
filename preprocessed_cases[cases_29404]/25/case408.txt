eli lilly eli lilly is the owner of patent patent.it filed this consolidated suit against teva parenteral medicines,app pharmaceuticals llc pliva hrvatska teva pharmaceuticals usa,and barr laboratories,collectively,defendants to prevent defendants from launching a generic version of a chemotherapy drug with accompanying product literature that would allegedly infringe methods of treatment claimed by the patent.the united states district court for the southern district of indiana held two bench trials,one on infringement and one on invalidity.the district court found that no single actor performs all steps of the asserted claims because the actions of both physicians and patients are required.nonetheless,under akamai technologies,limelight networks,akamai v,fed.cir.en banc per curiam,cert.denied,the court found direct infringement attributable to physicians and held defendants liable for inducing that infringement.the court also determined that the asserted claims were not invalid for,inter alia,indefiniteness,obviousness,or double patenting.
for the reasons below,we affirm.
background 
the patent,which issued in,relates to methods of administering the chemotherapy drug pemetrexed disodium pemetrexed after pretreatment with two common vitamins folic acid and vitamin.pemetrexed is an antifolate that kills cancer cells by inhibiting the function of folates,a class of nutrients necessary for cell reproduction.the purpose of the dual vitamin pretreatments is to reduce the toxicity of pemetrexed in patients.eli lilly markets pemetrexed under the brand name alimta,and the drug is used to treat certain types of lung cancer and mesothelioma.
around,defendants notified eli lilly that they had submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking approval by the food and drug administration fda to market generic versions of alimta.after the patent issued,defendants sent eli lilly additional notices regarding their andas,including notices that they had filed paragraph iv certifications under j a vii iv,declaring that the patent was invalid,unenforceable,or would not be infringed.eli lilly subsequently brought this consolidated action against defendants for infringement under e.specifically,eli lilly alleged that defendants generic drugs would be administered with folic acid and vitamin pretreatments and,thus,result in infringement of the patent.defendants raised noninfringement and invalidity defenses.
eli lilly asserted claims,and of the patent at trial.importantly,all of the asserted claims require patient pretreatment by administering or administration of folic acid.claims and depend from claim,which recites 
a method of administering pemetrexed disodium to a patient in need thereof comprising administering an effective amount of folic acid and an effective amount of a methylmalonic acid lowering agent followed by administering an effective amount of pemetrexed disodium,wherein 
the methylmalonic acid lowering agent is selected from the group consisting of vitamin,hydroxycobalamin,aquocobalamin perchlorate,perchlorate,azidocobalamin,cobalamin,cyanocobalamin,or chlorocobalamin.

the parties agree for purposes of this appeal that no single actor performs all steps of the asserted claims rather,the steps are divided between physicians and patients.though physicians administer vitamin and pemetrexed,patients folic acid with guidance from physicians.eli lilly theory of infringement therefore requires establishing liability for divided infringement an area of law that this court was actively reconsidering during the pendency of this case.
in june,defendants conditionally conceded induced infringement under law set forth in akamai technologies,limelight networks,akamai ii,fed.cir.en banc per curiam,rev,at the time,the akamai ii decision was the subject of a petition to the supreme court for a writ of certiorari.the parties stipulation included a provision reserving defendants right to litigate infringement if the supreme court reversed or vacated akamai ii.
eli lilly and defendants proceeded with a bench trial on invalidity,after which the district court held that the asserted claims were not invalid for,inter alia,obviousness or double patenting.the court had also previously rejected defendants contention that the asserted claims were invalid for indefiniteness of the term vitamin.defendants filed an appeal on invalidity,which was docketed in this court as case.while that appeal was pending,the supreme court reversed akamai ii,holding that liability for inducement can not be found without direct infringement,and remanding for this court to possibly reconsider the standards for direct infringement.limelight networks,akamai,akamai iii.in view of that development,the parties in this case filed a joint motion to remand the matter to the district court for the limited purpose of litigating infringement.we granted the motion.
the district court held a second bench trial in may and concluded in a decision issued on august,that defendants would induce infringement of the patent.as explained in further detail below,the court applied our intervening akamai v decision,which had broadened the circumstances in which others acts may be attributed to a single actor to support liability in cases of divided infringement see akamai v,at.the court accordingly entered final judgment against defendants,barring them from launching their generic products before the expiration of the patent.
defendants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
defendants appeal the district court finding of induced infringement,as well as the court decision that the asserted claims are not invalid for indefiniteness,obviousness,or double patenting.we will address each of these issues in turn.
pursuant to b,w hoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.importantly,liability for induced infringement under b must be predicated on direct infringement.akamai iii,at.the patentee must also show that the alleged infringer possessed the requisite intent to induce infringement,which we have held requires that the alleged infringer knew or should have known his actions would induce actual infringements.dsu med.jms,fed.cir.en banc in relevant part internal quotation marks omitted.a patentee seeking relief under e bears the burden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence.apotex,fed.cir.
infringement is a question of fact that,after a bench trial,we review for clear error.alza mylan labs,fed.cir.reversal for clear error is appropriate only when this court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court was in error.id.
the district court relied in part on defendants proposed product labeling as evidence of infringement.for purposes of this case,the parties have agreed that defendants product labeling would be materially the same as the alimta product labeling,which consists of two documents the physician prescribing information and the patient information.both documents include instructions regarding the administration of folic acid the step that the district court found would be performed by patients but attributable to physicians.for example,the physician prescribing information provides,among other things 
instruct patients to initiate folic acid μg to μg orally once daily beginning days before the first dose of pemetrexed.
instruct patients on the need for folic acid and vitamin supplementation to reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity.
the patient information includes similar information 
to lower your chances of side effects of pemetrexed,you must also take folic acid prior to and during your treatment with pemetrexed.emphasis omitted.
it is very important to take folic acid and vitamin during your treatment with pemetrexed to lower your chances of harmful side effects.you must start taking micrograms of folic acid every day for at least days out of the days before your first dose of pemetrexed.id.emphasis omitted.
where,as here,no single actor performs all steps of a method claim,direct infringement only occurs if the acts of one are attributable to the other such that a single entity is responsible for the infringement.akamai v,at.the performance of method steps is attributable to a single entity in two types of circumstances when that entity directs or controls others performance,or when the actors form a joint enterprise.id.eli lilly did not pursue a joint enterprise theory,so the question of direct infringement before us is whether physicians direct or control their patients administration of folic acid 
in akamai v,we held that directing or controlling others performance includes circumstances in which an actor conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon others performance of one or more steps of a patented method,and establishes the manner or timing of that performance.id.at emphases added.in addition to this test,we observed that,i n the future,other factual scenarios may arise which warrant attributing others performance of method steps to a single actor.going forward,principles of attribution are to be considered in the context of the particular facts presented.id.
here,the district court decided that the factual circumstances we re sufficiently analogous to those in akamai v to support a finding of direct infringement by physicians.eli lilly teva parenteral,eli lilly iii,supp.the court observed initially that taking folic acid in the manner recited by the asserted claims is a critical and necessary step to reduc e potentially toxicities caused by pemetrexed,to receive the benefit of the patented method.id.at.regarding the first akamai v prong,the court found,based on the product labeling,that taking folic acid in the manner specified is a condition of the patient participation in pemetrexed treatment.id.regarding the second prong,the court found that physicians would prescrib e an exact dose of folic acid and direct that it be ingested daily.id.at.the court therefore held that,under akamai v,the performance of all steps of the asserted claims would be attributable to physicians.
with respect to the first prong conditioning participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of one or more method steps defendants argue at the outset that the district court did not make a relevant finding because it misidentified the benefit that would be conditioned as the benefit of the patented method,a reduction of potentially toxicities caused by pemetrexed.appellants opening br.we agree that a reduction in toxicities is not a benefit that physicians can condition as it follows from folic acid pretreatment and that the relevant benefit that may be conditioned on folic acid administration is pemetrexed treatment.but the court discussion of reducing pemetrexed toxicities in relation to its analysis was not erroneous.a reduction in pemetrexed toxicities is relevant only if pemetrexed treatment is administered,and it provides a reason why physicians would condition the receipt of pemetrexed treatment on folic acid administration.the court recognized this relationship and correctly identified pemetrexed treatment as the benefit to be conditioned what is relevant is whether the physician sufficiently directs or controls the acts of the patients in such a manner as to condition participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit in this case,treatment with pemetrexed in the manner that reduces toxicities upon the performance of a step of the patented method and establishes the manner and timing of the performance.eli lilly iii,supp.at emphasis added see also id.t aking folic acid in the manner specified is a condition of the patient participation in pemetrexed treatment.emphasis added.
the district court finding that physicians condition pemetrexed treatment on the administration of folic acid is supported by the record evidence.the physician prescribing information,which is directed to the physician,explains that folic acid is a r equirement for p remedication in order to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed.consistent with the importance of folic acid pretreatment,the product labeling repeatedly states that physicians should i nstruct patients to take folic acid and includes information about folic acid dosage ranges and schedules.see also.the patient information also informs patients that physicians may withhold pemetrexed treatment you will have regular blood tests before and during your treatment with pemetrexed.your doctor may adjust your dose of pemetrexed or delay treatment based on the results of your blood test and on your general condition.emphasis added.
furthermore,eli lilly expert,chabner,testified that it is the physician responsibility to initiate the supplementation of folic acid.he explained that the product labeling shows that taking folic acid is an absolute requirement before pemetrexed treatment because it would be safe to take the drug without the vitamin supplementation.i t must be done this way.see also i t an absolute requirement,i think it that important.he further testified that if a physician realizes that a patient did not follow his or her instructions to take folic acid,then the doctor will not give the pemetrexed.even defendants expert,schulz,acknowledged that it is standard practice both his personally and physicians generally that a patient must have taken their required folic acid in order to have the pemetrexed administered.see also i would withhold the pemetrexed therapy until the patient had initiated or resumed their folic acid treatment s o as to avoid the toxicities associated with pemetrexed without vitamin replacement.schulz agreed that he was not aware of any reputable institution or doctor who,when they think the patient has taken the required folic acid would go ahead and administer pemetrexed.
the record is thus replete with evidence that physicians delineate the step of folic acid administration that patients must perform if they wish to receive pemetrexed treatment.
defendants argue that mere guidance or instruction is insufficient to show conditioning under akamai v.but the evidence regarding the critical nature of folic acid pretreatment and physicians practices support a finding that physicians cross the line from merely guiding or instructing patients to take folic acid to conditioning pemetrexed treatment on their administration of folic acid.if a patient does not take folic acid as instructed,a physician,in his or her discretion,need not provide pemetrexed treatment based on the patient failure to perform the step of folic acid administration.defendants also complain that there is no evidence that physicians go further to verify compliance with their instructions or to threaten denial of pemetrexed treatment.appellants opening br.conditioning,however,does not necessarily require another performance or making threats.
we also reject defendants argument that an actor can only condition the performance of a step by imposing a legal obligation to do so,by interposing that step as an unavoidable technological prerequisite to participation,or,as in akamai v,both.id.in akamai v,we found conditioning based on evidence that the defendant required all of its customers to sign a standard contract delineating the steps that customers had to perform to use the defendant service.at.but we did not limit conditioning to legal obligations or technological prerequisites we cautioned that principles of attribution are to be considered in the context of the particular facts presented and even expressly held that a infringement is not limited solely to relationships,contractual arrangements,and joint enterprise.id.at.
the product labeling,combined with the testimony discussed above,provide sufficient evidence that physicians condition pemetrexed treatment on folic acid pretreatment.
with respect to the second prong establishing the manner or timing of performance defendants argue that the product labeling gives patients wide berth to select the dose,the dosage form,and the timing of folic acid.appellants opening br.eli lilly submits that expert testimony and product labeling demonstrate that physicians prescribe or specify a dose of folic acid,specify that patients must ingest the folic acid daily during a particular span of days,and withhold pemetrexed if patients do not follow orders.appellee br.we agree with eli lilly.
the product labeling is again informative.for instance,the physician prescription information instructs physicians not only to tell patients to take folic acid orally,but also to take μg to μg of folic acid once daily beginning days before the first dose of pemetrexed,accompanied with warnings about the consequences of.that dosage range and schedule overlaps with all of the asserted claims dosage ranges and schedules in addition,chabner testified that it the doctor who decides how much folic acid the patient will take and when the patient takes it.in view of the record evidence,the court finding that physicians establish the manner and timing of patients folic acid intake is not clearly erroneous.even if,as defendants argue,patients are able to seek additional outside assistance regarding folic acid administration,such guidance is beyond what is required here to establish the manner or timing of performance and is therefore immaterial.
we therefore see no reversible error in the district court finding that physicians condition patient participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit pemetrexed treatment on folic acid administration and also establish the manner or timing of performance.our holding today does not assume that patient action is attributable to a prescribing physician solely because they have a relationship.we leave to another day what other scenarios also satisfy the direction or control requirement.the test that we set forth in akamai v is applicable to the facts of this case and resolves the existence of underlying direct infringement.
although we conclude that the akamai v test is met here,this does not end our inquiry.the mere existence of direct infringement by physicians,while necessary to find liability for induced infringement,is not sufficient for inducement.takeda pharm.usa,pharm,fed.cir.to show inducement,eli lilly carries the burden of further proving specific intent and action to induce infringement.takeda,at.mere knowledge of the acts alleged to constitute infringement is not sufficient.dsu,at.
as noted before,the district court found that the administration of folic acid before pemetrexed administration was not merely a suggestion or recommendation,but a critical step.eli lilly iii,supp.at.it further held that defendants induce physicians infringement because physicians act in accordance with defendants proposed labeling.id.accordingly,the district court concluded that defendants would induce infringement of the patent.
defendants submit that,even if there is direct infringement,their product labeling does not induce such infringement.they argue that eli lilly has not offered any evidence of what physicians do in general,offering instead only speculation about how physicians may act.appellants opening br.second emphasis added.furthermore,they submit that physicians who merely follow the product label are not induced to infringe because physicians must go beyond the labeling instructions such as by prescribing specific doses of folic acid or requiring patients to keep pill counts or pill diaries to infringe.id.at.we agree with eli lilly that defendants arguments are unavailing.
we make two observations at the outset.first,to be clear,the intent for inducement must be with respect to the actions of the underlying direct infringer,here physicians.second,we have not required evidence regarding the general prevalence of the induced activity.when the alleged inducement relies on a drug label instructions,t he question is not just whether those instructions describ e the infringing mode,but whether the instructions teach an infringing use such that we are willing to infer from those instructions an affirmative intent to infringe the patent.takeda,at internal quotation marks omitted.the label must encourage,recommend,or promote infringement.id.for purposes of inducement,it is irrelevant that some users may ignore the warnings in the proposed label.astrazeneca lp apotex,fed.cir.
depending on the clarity of the instructions,the decision to continue seeking fda approval of those instructions may be sufficient evidence of specific intent to induce infringement.id.at.with respect to those instructions,we held in astrazeneca that a label that instructed users to follow the instructions in an infringing manner was sufficient even though some users would not follow the instructions.id.at.this was true even though the product in question had substantial noninfringing uses.id.
conversely,vague instructions that require one to look outside the label to understand the alleged implicit encouragement do not,without more,induce infringement.takeda,at.defendants try to analogize the product labeling here to the labeling in takeda that we held did not provide clear enough instructions for the infringing use to show inducement.takeda,however,is distinguishable.the generic manufacturer in that case sought fda approval for a generic drug to be used as a prophylaxis for gout flares a use not covered by the patents that had been asserted.id.at.the only link between the proposed use described on the labeling and the patented use was an instruction stating,i f you have a gout flare while taking the drug,tell your healthcare provider.id.at first alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the patent owner argued that physicians who are accordingly consulted might prescribe the drug for the infringing,use and that the accused infringer was willfully blind to this possibility.id.we rejected the patent owner reliance on such vague label language and speculation about how physicians may act.id.the product labeling here is not so tenuously related to the use covered by the asserted claims,and eli lilly does not need to rely on speculation about physician behavior.
again,the product labeling includes repeated instructions and warnings regarding the importance of and reasons for folic acid treatment,and there is testimony that the physician prescribing information,as the name indicates,is directed at physicians.see.the instructions are unambiguous on their face and encourage or recommend infringement.
defendants rely heavily on evidence that physicians as a matter of practice take steps beyond the instructions in the product labeling,such as asking patients to keep pill diaries or pill counts,or confirming compliance with folic acid administration.for example,they point to chabner testimony that he gives patients instructions beyond what the instruction is in th e patient information.but the asserted claims do not recite additional steps such as pill diaries,pill counts,and compliance measures.where the product labeling already encourages infringement of the asserted claims,as it does here,a physician decision to give patients even more specific guidance is irrelevant to the question of inducement 
in sum,evidence that the product labeling that defendants seek would inevitably lead some physicians to infringe establishes the requisite intent for inducement.the district court did not clearly err in concluding that defendants would induce infringement of the asserted claims of the patent.
we turn next to the district court holding that the limitation vitamin was not indefinite.pursuant to,a patent specification must conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.the district court considered the indefiniteness of the asserted claims before the supreme court changed the relevant standard in nautilus,biosig instruments,and held that vitamin was not indefinite eli lilly teva parenteral,eli lilly i,wl,at.june.the district court further construed vitamin to mean cyanocobalamin,a particular vitamin supplement.id.at.
in nautilus,the supreme court rejected our not amenable to construction or insolubly ambiguous standard for indefiniteness and articulated,instead,that a patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims,read in light of the specification delineating the patent,and the prosecution history,fail to inform,with reasonable certainty,those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.at.indefiniteness is a question of law that we review de novo.teva pharm.usa,sandoz,fed.cir.we have reiterated that general principles of claim construction apply to the question of indefiniteness.biosig instruments,nautilus,fed.cir.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we review subsidiary factual determinations made by the district court based on extrinsic evidence for clear error.see also teva,at reviewing subsidiary factual findings in the indefiniteness context for clear error.
the parties do not dispute that,depending on the context,vitamin can be used in the art to refer either to cyanocobalamin specifically or,more broadly,to a class of compounds including pharmaceutical derivatives of cyanocobalamin.the parties do not dispute that the written description of the patent uses the term both ways defendants argue that,because vitamin is used in two different ways in the intrinsic record,it is impossible to determine which meaning applies to the claims with any reasonable certainty,as required by nautilus.appellants opening br.eli lilly counters that the claims of the patent involve administering a vitamin supplement to a patient,and in that context,the one and only meaning of vitamin to a person of ordinary skill is cyanocobalamin.appellee br.
the district court expressly accept ed the testimony of eli lilly expert,who concluded that a person of ordinary skill would understand vitamin to mean cyanocobalamin in the context of the patent claims.eli lilly i,wl,at.we do not defer to ultimate conclusion about claim meaning in the context of th e patent,as that is a legal question.teva,at.but the district court underlying determination,based on extrinsic evidence,of what a person of ordinary skill would understand vitamin to mean in different contexts is a question of fact.see id.understandings that lie outside the patent documents about the meaning of terms to one of skill in the art or the science or state of the knowledge of one of skill in the art are factual issues.testified that,although vitamin can refer to a class of compounds in other contexts,it refers specifically to cyanocobalamin when vitamin is prescribed in the medical field.see,vitamin is used by medical oncologists to mean a particular vitamin supplement,and medical oncologists refer to vitamin,and prescribe vitamin,without further explanation or definition.we see no clear error in the district court acceptance of the understanding that vitamin,when used to refer to vitamin supplementation in a medical context,refers to cyanocobalamin in view of this understanding,and because the specification uses vitamin primarily in two ways,we do not face the problem that we did in teva,in which the disputed term did not have a plain meaning to one of skill in the art that could be determined from context.at.
the claim language here would inform a person of ordinary skill that the term vitamin,as used in the patent claims,refers to cyanocobalamin.first,the claims,on their face,are directed to administering vitamin supplements,including vitamin,followed by chemotherapy treatment.this context informs persons of ordinary skill that vitamin is being used to refer to the supplementation form of vitamin,cyanocobalamin.second,the structure of the claims also supports such an understanding.claim requires administering a methylmalonic acid lowering agent selected from the group consisting of,inter alia,vitamin and cyanocobalamin.patent ll.claim,which depends from claim,further requires that the methylmalonic acid lowering agent is vitamin.id.at ll.eli lilly asserts,and defendants do not dispute,that if vitamin were to refer to a class of compounds,then claim would be the same scope as claim,as claim would encompass the same methylmalonic acid lowering agents set forth in claim.appellee br.the doctrine of claim differentiation,however,presumes that dependent claims are of narrower scope than the independent claims from which they depend.ak steel sollac ugine,fed.cir.reading the claims to require vitamin to be a specific compound in the class of methylmalonic acid lowering agents would avoid this problem,as it would render claim,and all of the claims that depend from it,narrower than claim.
defendants submit that,if vitamin means cyanocobalamin,then claim recites a markush group of methylmalonic acid lowering agents that lists the same compound twice.although we have in some instances interpreted claim terms to avoid redundancy,the rule is not inflexible.power mosfet,llc siemens ag,fed.cir.see also multilayer stretch cling film holdings,berry plastics,fed.cir.manual of patent examining procedure h i the mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more than one member of a markush group recited in the claim does not necessarily render the scope of the claim unclear.here,the redundancy is supported by the prosecution history,during which the examiner stated that vitamin and cyanocobalamin are the same agents.therefore,faced with an interpretation that would read redundancy into claim and another that would violate the doctrine of claim differentiation,we hold that the claims here support the former result over the latter.
we are not persuaded by defendants contention that the prosecution history fails to provide reasonable confidence in any particular meaning of the term vitamin.appellants opening br.in response to the examiner statement that vitamin and cyanocobalamin are synonymous,the patentee initially removed the term cyanocobalamin from the proposed claims.see.later during prosecution,the patentee added cyanocobalamin back into the claim that eventually issued as claim.defendants do not point to any reason,though,that a person of ordinary skill would understand the patentee decision to ultimately include cyanocobalamin in the claim language to be a departure from the understanding expressed by the examiner that vitamin and cyanocobalamin refer to the same compound.the prosecution history here does not detract from,and is consistent with,the other intrinsic evidence that would inform a skilled artisan regarding the scope of the claim term vitamin.
we therefore hold that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the scope of the claim term vitamin with reasonable certainty.applying nautilus in this case does not lead us to a different result from the district court conclusion on the question of indefiniteness.
next,we address defendants arguments that the asserted claims were obvious over several references that are not disputed to be prior art as of the critical date in june.to prevail on obviousness,an alleged infringer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention,and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.procter gamble teva pharm.usa,fed.cir.internal quotation marks omitted.obviousness is a question of law based on underlying facts,and o n appeal from a bench trial,this court reviews the district court conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.prometheus,roxane,fed.cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
in a thorough opinion,the district court found,inter alia,that a skilled artisan would not have been motivated to use folic acid pretreatment with pemetrexed use vitamin pretreatment with pemetrexed or use the claimed doses and schedules of folic acid and vitamin pretreatments with pemetrexed.the court also found that eli lilly had established several secondary considerations in favor of nonobviousness.on appeal,defendants contend that all of those findings were erroneous.eli lilly submits that defendants arguments amount to nothing more than an effort to reargue the facts.appellee br.
we agree with eli lilly that defendants arguments fail to raise reversible error with respect to at least the findings that a skilled artisan would not have been motivated to use vitamin pretreatment with pemetrexed,let alone the appropriate doses and schedules of such vitamin pretreatment.
the district court found,based upon two abstracts published in by niyikiza the niyikiza abstracts that a skilled artisan would have concluded that vitamin deficiency was not the problem in pemetrexed toxicity.eli lilly teva parenteral,eli lilly ii,wl,at.it further found that a skilled artisan would not have used vitamin supplementation to address antifolate toxicities because of concern about a reduction of efficacy of the antifolate treatment.id.at.
niyikiza was an eli lilly scientist at the time and is the named inventor on the patent.in,he performed statistical analyses to try to determine which clinical trial patients were likely to develop toxicities from pemetrexed treatment.he published the results in the niyikiza abstracts and reported a correlation between increased pemetrexed toxicities and elevated homocysteine levels.elevated homocysteine levels serve as an indicator of either a folic acid or vitamin deficiency,but they do not indicate which of those two vitamins is specifically lacking.levels of another marker,methylmalonic acid mma,serve more specifically as an indicator of vitamin deficiency.but the niyikiza abstracts reported that no correlation between toxicity and mma levels was seen.
given the toxicity correlations that niyikiza observed with homocysteine levels but not with mma levels,eli lilly experts testified that the niyikiza abstracts present ed no evidence for a relationship of vitamin and pemetrexed toxicity and would not have motivated a skilled artisan to administer vitamin to patients to address pemetrexed toxicity.see also.defendants expert,ratain,confirmed that if a patient exhibits elevated homocysteine but normal mma levels,a skilled artisan would conclude that that patient was folate deficient but not vitamin deficient.
to try to overcome this missing link between vitamin deficiency and pemetrexed toxicity,defendants turn to other prior art references.they argue that,based on those references and perhaps preexisting knowledge,a person of ordinary skill would have known that folate deficiency is correlated with pemetrexed toxicity and that vitamin directly affect s the amount of folate available to healthy cells.appellants opening br.citing.as a result,they argue,skilled artisans would have been motivated to use vitamin,along with folic acid,to address pemetrexed toxicities.id.put another way,if we assume that the prior art would have motivated skilled artisans to use folic acid pretreatment to counter pemetrexed toxicity an issue we do not reach,defendants submit that those skilled artisans would have also used vitamin as part of the pretreatment because the biochemical pathways for vitamin and folic acid are related.defendants further submit that other prior art expressly teaches that folic acid supplementation improves the therapeutic index of pemetrexed,so a skilled artisan would not have been concerned about using vitamin supplementation to reduce pemetrexed toxicities.id.at.
but the parties experts agreed that nothing in the literature as of the critical date described cancer patients being provided with vitamin supplementation prior to receiving any antifolate,with or without folic acid.see also.defendants fail to point to evidence that,even if folic acid supplementation were known to improve effects of pemetrexed treatment,a skilled artisan would have thought the same of vitamin.indeed,eli lilly offered expert testimony that a skilled artisan would have viewed the use of vitamin with antifolates as a problem based on having to increase the antifolate dose to get the same activity of cancer treatment.
we are therefore not convinced that the district court committed clear error in concluding that defendants failed to carry their burden of proving that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill to use vitamin pretreatment to reduce pemetrexed toxicities.
regarding the dose and schedule of vitamin,the district court reiterated that there are no prior art references where any amount of vitamin pretreatment had been used with an antifolate in the treatment of cancer.eli lilly ii,wl,at emphasis added.the court also discounted defendants citations to literature outside the field of oncology.id.at.
defendants argue that,o nce a skilled artisan is motivated to use vitamin pretreatment,selecting a dose and schedule for vitamin would have been routine.appellants opening br.setting aside motivation to use vitamin pretreatment in the first instance,defendants only cite evidence of vitamin doses and schedules that are routine in other medical contexts.see.there is no evidence that,considering the context of pemetrexed treatment and associated toxicity problems,a person of ordinary skill would have applied such doses and schedules wholesale.
we therefore also see no clear error in the court finding that defendants failed to carry their burden of proving that the prior art disclosed the claimed doses and schedules of vitamin for purposes of pemetrexed pretreatment.
defendants make two additional,overarching arguments that we also find unavailing.
first,defendants cite pharmastem therapeutics,viacell,fed.cir,to argue that the district court erred by accepting expert testimony that was inconsistent with the express disclosures of the prior art.but pharmastem is distinguishable.in that case,we discounted testimony regarding prior art references that could not be reconciled with statements made by the inventors in the joint specification of the asserted patents and with the prior art references themselves.id.at.here,despite defendants averments,we do not perceive any irreconcilable differences between the prior art disclosures on their face and the testimony regarding whether a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to use vitamin pretreatment in the claimed doses and schedules with pemetrexed treatment.
second,defendants argue that the district court committed legal error by requiring an express prior art disclosure of the claimed combination because ksr international teleflex,rejected such a rigid formula in favor of a more flexible inquiry.id.at.while ksr did make the obviousness inquiry more flexible,it does not advance defendants position here.defendants cite to two prior art references that would purportedly motivate a skilled artisan to review literature regarding known doses and schedules for vitamin supplementation.appellants opening br.but those references merely note in passing that vitamin can be related to homocysteine levels and folate biochemical pathways.see.defendants do not cite to any testimony to support their contention that those references would motivate a skilled artisan to arrive at the claimed use of vitamin as a pretreatment for pemetrexed,especially in view of the evidence of gaps and concerns regarding the prior art discussed above.
the district court did not commit reversible error in finding that the prior art fails to render obvious use of vitamin pretreatment with pemetrexed,or use of the doses and schedules of vitamin that are recited in the asserted claims.we therefore affirm the determination of nonobviousness.we need not reach the other grounds put forth for obviousness.
finally,we address defendants argument that the district court erred in holding that the asserted claims are not invalid for double patenting over patent patent,an earlier patent also owned by eli lilly.
the doctrine of double patenting is intended to prevent the extension of th
