opinion of the court 
in this private securities fraud class action under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,two institutional investors allege a pharmaceutical company and its executives made materially false and misleading statements in violation of the securities exchange act of the exchange act regarding interim clinical trial data related to the development of an experimental alzheimer drug.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we will affirm 
city of edinburgh council as administering authority for the lothian pension fund and arca the funds bring suit on behalf of a class of investors who purchased wyeth,common stock between may,and july,the class period.the funds allege wyeth and four former wyeth robert essner,bernard poussot,kenneth martin,and robert ruffolo,materially false and misleading statements regarding the development of the experimental alzheimer drug bapineuzumab.defendant pfizer is the to wyeth,which it acquired in.
the funds bring three claims securities fraud under section b of the exchange act,b,and securities and exchange commission sec rule control person liability under section of the exchange act,and insider trading under section of the exchange act,a 
approximately million americans and million people worldwide suffer from alzheimer disease.wyeth and elan corporation,plc elan an pharmaceutical company,embarked on a joint venture to develop an alzheimer treatment that,unlike other drugs then on the market,would target the underlying causes of the disease.this joint venture produced bapineuzumab,which is designed to treat mild to moderate alzheimer.as required by food and drug administration fda regulations,wyeth and elan launched clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of bapineuzumab in treating alzheimer in,wyeth and elan completed phase trials of bapineuzumab and received fast track status from the fda before announcing phase results,wyeth and elan began the phase trial,a controlled,study designed to measure the efficacy of bapineuzumab compared to a placebo.the companies measured bapineuzumab efficacy using two tests,the alzheimer disease assessment scale cognitive and the disability assessment scale for dementia dad.
the phase trial was not scheduled for completion until,and wyeth and elan said they did not expect to release any phase trial data until that time.the focus of the funds complaint is a joint press release issued on may,the may release,announcing the companies decision to initiate a phase clinical trial,subject to fda approval,in the second half of.the may release stated emphasis added 
elan and wyeth today announce the decision to initiate a phase clinical program of bapineuzumab this decision was based on the seriousness of the disease and the totality of what the companies have learned from their immunotherapy programs,including a scheduled interim look at data from an ongoing phase study,which remains blinded.no conclusion about the phase study can be drawn until the study is completed and the final data are analyzed and released in.phase clinical trial design will be finalized with regulatory agencies,and subject to regulatory approval,it is intended for the trial to begin in the second half of.
the funds contend that at the time wyeth issued the may release the company did not the phase interim results did not support the decision to initiate the phase trial the funds two confidential allege the interim results showed bapineuzumab had failed criteria for efficacy and revealed serious adverse safety risks.wyeth disputes this allegation,arguing the phase results showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits among an important patient of the apolipoprotein gene who are believed to make up to percent of alzheimer patients,or approximately to million americans.further,wyeth contends statements confirm its interpretation of the subgroup datacw noted the phase interim results were interesting and warranted further testing with regard to of the gene but only as an additional phase trial,not as a phase trial.and wyeth notes it had to obtain fda approval to initiate the phase trial on which the companies spent millions of dollars of their own assets.
the funds also argue the may release was misleading in light of a prior statement made on october,by defendant ruffolo,wyeth head of research,at the company annual meeting for securities analysts.ruffolo stated orally that the companies planned to conduct an interim review of the phase results at the end of in order to determine whether and how to proceed to a phase trial 
now,again,we do have any results from this phase study at all,but we have a planned interim look at the data at the end of the year.and,based on this interim look,we could do two things.one,depending on the data,we could advance directly into phase iii in the first half of,but the results would have to be spectacular.we do know what results we going to get.alternatively,we could complete the study and then move to the next interim look,which would be in the first half of.despite defendants explicit warning in the may release that n o conclusion about the phase study can be drawn and that initiation of phase would be subject to regulatory approval,the funds allege ruffolo remarks led them to interpret the may release statement that the phase trial would commence early based in part on the phase interim results to mean those results were spectacular.
on june,wyeth and elan issued a press release the june release disclosing preliminary findings from the phase study.the june release reported that the phase trial failed to meet its objectives as to the entire study population and reported serious adverse events among both placebo and patients.but it noted that based on p analyses,bapineuzumab showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits among of the gene who are believed to make up to percent of alzheimer patients.accordingly,the june release announced the companies conclusion that the results of the phase trial,as well as its safety findings,supported the decision to proceed with the phase trial 
on july,wyeth and elan revealed the phase results through a joint press release,conference presentation,and investor conference call.despite the disclosure in the june release that the phase trial had failed to meet its overall objectives,the funds contend investors only learned for the first time on july that the phase trial was nearly a complete results showed no efficacy and revealed serious safety concerns.according to,the final phase results did not differ significantly from the phase interim results referenced in the may release.
the district court granted defendants first motion to dismiss on february,holding the funds had not adequately alleged defendants made any materially false or misleading statements and defendants had no duty to disclose allegedly omitted details.on december,the district court granted the funds leave to file a second amended complaint.on april,the district court again dismissed the funds claims,holding the funds failed to adequately allege defendants made any affirmatively false or misleading statements,defendants had no duty to disclose additional information about the phase interim results,and the funds failed to sufficiently plead a predicate exchange act violation required to maintain their control person liability and insider trading claims.
on appeal,the funds contend the district court erred in dismissing their section b and rule claims for failure to adequately plead falsity.the funds also argue defendants statements and actions triggered a duty to disclose full and complete material information to investors about the phase interim results.and the funds challenge the district court dismissal of their control person liability and insider trading claims.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant defendants rule b motion to dismiss.see in re aetna.sec,cir.we also exercise plenary review over the dismissal of a complaint for failure to satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the pslra and over the district court interpretation of federal securities laws.institutional investors grp.avaya,cir.the pslra heightened pleading standards require a private securities fraud complaint alleging false or misleading statements to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation is made on information and belief,state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b see tellabs,makor issues rights.this standard requires plaintiffs to plead the who,what,when,where,and how the first paragraph of any newspaper story.institutional investors,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a complaint must also state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b tellabs,at.we must evaluate the complaint in its entirety,as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on rule b motions to dismiss,including documents incorporated into the complaint by reference and matters of which we may take judicial notice.tellabs,at citation omitted.
this is not the first case in which the federal courts have adjudicated securities fraud allegations arising out the development of bapineuzumab.three federal courts have considered and dismissed claims similar to those at issue in this case.see kleinman elan,plc,cir in re elan.sec,cv june,philco,martin,wl.
in kleinman,the second circuit affirmed the rule b dismissal of a suit against elan,pfizer,and two elan executives for failure to allege any actionable false statements or omissions and failure to plead a predicate exchange act violation.kleinman,at.the plaintiff in kleinman alleged the june release misrepresented the phase results as e ncouraging and omitted key information about the lack of a dose response and analysis of the phase data.but the second circuit rejected those contentions,holding the june release clearly stated the e ncouraging results were subgroup results and finding words like encouraging to be puffery.id.at.and the court found the omitted information claim was not actionable because,although possibly of interest to a reasonable investor,its omission did not render the june release false or misleading.id.at.
in in re elan,a district court dismissed claims against elan for failure to allege any actionable false statements or omissions.the case challenged many of the same statements at issue in this case,including the may release.the court rejected the allegation that the may release was false based on ruffolo spectacular statement.transcript of argument at,in re elan.sec,cv there nothing about the may release that says it going to be spectacular.everyone knows that in this business it extraordinarily risky and expensive,and lots of drugs have been stopped in phase,even though they had high hopes in phase.the court described ruffolo spectacular statement as puffery and noted that the law does not provide that an early puffery,if not corrected,continues to be a false statement every day of the year that follows.id.at.and the court said elan and wyeth would not have agreed to proceed to phase,given the millions of dollars the companies spent,unless phase showed at least some promising data.id.at.
finally,in philco investments,a district court dismissed claims against elan and three of its executives for failure to adequately allege falsity and to plead a predicate exchange act violation.philco,wl,at.plaintiffs challenged both the may release and the june release.the court found plaintiffs failed to allege elan disclosed criteria by which it would judge the phase interim results,and,accordingly,plaintiffs failed to adequately allege the may release was false.id.at.the court also concluded plaintiffs failed to allege the june release was false because,although it may not have included all the information a reasonable investor would have liked to have,it did not contain false or misleading information.id.at.
section b of the exchange act prohibits the use or employ ment,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe.b.sec rule implements this provision by making it unlawful to,among other things,make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b b.the supreme court has implied a private cause of action from the text and purpose of section b.matrixx initiatives,siracusano.
to state a claim for securities fraud,plaintiffs must allege a material misrepresentation or omission,scienter,a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security,reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission,economic loss,and loss causation.id.at in re aetna.sec,cir.
the primary issue in this appeal is the first element,whether the funds have adequately alleged defendants made a material misrepresentation or omission.the district court concluded the funds had failed to do so.but the funds contend that conclusion was incorrect because the may release contained affirmatively false and misleading statements about the phase interim results,and defendants statements were also false or misleading.we agree with the district court.
we first analyze whether the may release contained any affirmative false statements,and then we consider whether the may release was misleading in light of defendant ruffolo october spectacular statement.
specifically,the funds allege one statement in the may release was affirmatively decision to initiate the phase trial was based on the seriousness of the disease and the totality of what the companies have learned from their immunotherapy programs,including a scheduled interim look at data from an ongoing phase study,which remains blinded.this statement was affirmatively false,the funds contend,because wyeth decision to move to phase was not based on the phase interim was made in spite of those results,which the funds characterize as abysmal.because their confidential witness statements demonstrate bapineuzumab failed the interim review,the funds argue the phase interim results did not support defendants decision to initiate phase 
we agree with the district court,however,that the funds allegations are insufficient to maintain a plausible claim of falsity regarding the may release statement under the e xacting pleading requirements of the pslra.see tellabs,makor issues rights,institutional investors grp.avaya,cir the pslra imposes a particularity requirement on all allegations,whether they are offered in support of a statement falsity or of a defendant scienter.citation omitted.
the funds own pleading demonstrates the accuracy of defendants statement that the initiation of phase was based in part on the phase interim results.see cal.pub.emps.ret.chubb,cir finding plaintiffs failed to adequately plead falsity where information provided by their confidential witnesses was generally consistent with defendants allegedly false and misleading public statements.analyzing the phrase based on in the may release under the pslra heightened pleading standards,the funds have failed to specify the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading because the most cogent interpretation of that phrase is that defendants considered the phase interim results as one factor in their decision to initiate the phase trial.see tellabs,at.the funds confidential witness statements indicate defendants did analyze and consider those results in deciding whether to initiate phase.
moreover,the funds argument that the may release falsely conveyed that the phase interim results justified the initiation of phase fails because it is based on a selective reading of that document.see id.instructing courts to consider complaints under the pslra in their entirety,including documents incorporated by reference.the may release made no statement about the strength of the interim results.instead,the may release provided three bases for the move to phase the seriousness of alzheimer disease,the totality of what the companies learned from their immunotherapy programs,and the phase interim results.a full reading of the may release under the pslra heightened pleading requirements,therefore,bolsters the district court conclusion that it contained no false statements.see in re burlington coat factory sec,cir noting we are to examine statements in the full context of the documents of which they are part.most importantly,the may release explicitly cautioned investors that n o conclusion could be drawn about the phase interim results until the completion of phase.
a comparison with the second circuit decision in kleinman is instructive.in that case,plaintiff challenged allegedly false statements in the june release.the june release,unlike the may release,did make affirmative characterizations about the phase described the phase results as supportive of the decision to initiate phase because of the statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits shown for the subgroup.but the second circuit concluded plaintiff had not alleged anything in the june release was literally false because the references to e ncouraging results could not have meant anything other than the positive subgroup results.kleinman elan,plc,cir.moreover,the second circuit held expressions such as encouraging constituted puffery.id.because the may release offers no affirmative characterization of the phase interim results,kleinman supports defendants position that the may release was not affirmatively false.
even reading the may release as conveying the message that the interim results supported the move to phase and assuming the truth of the funds confidential witness allegations,the funds allegations still fail to establish that defendants may release statement was affirmatively false.see institutional investors,at noting that confidential witness allegations may be found adequately particularized under the pslra but may still fail either to establish the falsity of a statement,or to give rise to a strong inference of scienter.the funds confidential witnesses allege bapineuzumab failed the interim review because it did not achieve wyeth used to assess the statistical significance of bapineuzumab versus a placebo under the and dad tests.specifically,alleges that unless the phase interim review met these specified,wyeth and elan had agreed they would not proceed to phase based on the interim review.cw contends the phase interim results did not reveal any statistically significant difference between patients and patients with respect to any of the efficacy endpoints measured by the and dad tests.nor did bapineuzumab show any dose response,meaning higher doses of the drug were not associated with better results.furthermore,the phase interim results showed serious safety concerns with bapineuzumab,including numerous side effects and three deaths compared to no deaths in patients treated with placebo.
but the funds point to no public disclosure by defendants of the specific bapineuzumab was expected to achieve under the and dad tests,no public statements regarding a dose response or whether one would be expected,see kleinman,f d at,and no public comments about the safety metrics,including anticipated side effects,through which bapineuzumab would be evaluated.because defendants never told investors bapineuzumab would only pass the interim review if specific,dose responses,or safety metrics were achieved,the funds confidential witness allegations fail to establish with sufficient specificity that the challenged may release the decision to initiate phase was based in part on the phase interim false.
moreover,cw noted that the results showed circumstantial evidence of efficacy for an important patient of the of approximately to percent of alzheimer patients.cw also stated that one of his superiors was upset about the decision to initiate phase testing and that the subgroup results justified further investigation through a phase exploratory trial,not a large scale phase confirmatory trial.
these allegations show a difference of opinion within wyeth about whether the phase interim with the seriousness of alzheimer disease and the totality of what the companies had learned from their immunotherapy initiating a phase trial.interpretations of clinical trial data are considered opinions.see kleinman,at in re adolor.sec,d.opinions are only actionable under the securities laws if they are not honestly believed and lack a reasonable basis.in re merck,derivative erisa,cir kleinman,at.
the funds have failed to adequately allege defendants did not honestly believe their interpretation of the interim results or that it lacked a reasonable basis.a company failure to accurately disclose clinical trial data may be actionable under the securities laws,but the cases the funds cite are distinguishable because they involve plausible allegations of affirmative false statements about a drug efficacy and safety.see,in re viropharma.sec,no,wl,at,in re transkaryotic therapies.sec,d.in contrast,the may release contains no affirmative statement about bapineuzumab efficacy or safety.moreover,the initiation of phase cost millions of dollars and required fda approval,rendering it improbable that defendants would have continued if they did not believe their interpretation of the interim results or if they thought the drug a complete failure.see kleinman,at.
moreover,because the phase interim results showed circumstantial evidence of efficacy for one important patient subgroup,the disagreement of some wyeth employees with the company interpretation of the interim results is not sufficient to show defendants interpretation lacked a reasonable basis.the funds present three pieces of evidence showing disagreement among wyeth employees about the decision to initiate phase.noted that after presentation of the phase interim results to the company elan alliance committee and approximately member r d committee,he and two other members of the r d committee expressed skepticism at the decision to proceed with phase based on the interim results.cw revealed that one of his superiors was upset wyeth decided to proceed,at ruffolo urging,with a massive phase study.and noted his own belief that wyeth should have conducted another phase study to investigate the subgroup results,not a phase trial.but the disagreement of five employees within a large pharmaceutical company about the interpretation of clinical trial data and the critical strategic decision of initiating an expensive phase trial does not render defendants decisions unreasonable or their statements false.see kleinman,at finding no basis for inferring defendants did not honestly believe their statements because the initiation of phase could only be made after there have been positive phase results sufficient to satisfy both business and regulatory interests in re adolor,d at holding disagreements about the proper methodology and conduct of clinical studies are insufficient to establish falsity.at bottom,the funds fail to plead sufficient facts to show defendants did not honestly believe initiating phase was appropriate or that defendants lacked a reasonable basis for that decision.
we next evaluate whether the district court correctly determined that the may release was not misleading in light of defendants prior statements.the funds contend the may release was misleading because defendant ruffolo had assured investors in october that wyeth would not commence phase early unless the phase interim results were spectacular in meeting specific efficacy criteria by telling investors they were moving to phase early based in part on the phase interim results,the funds contend defendants misled the market by failing to disclose those poor results,leaving the impression they must have been spectacular or at least positive.the funds argue this failure to disclose in fact misled the market,and they cite statements by stock analysts and point to the increase in wyeth stock price following issuance of the may release.
we agree with the district court that defendants statements,taken in context,were not misleading.the may release did not characterize or discuss the strength of the phase interim results.it only listed those results as one factor among three in the decision to initiate phase,and it expressly cautioned investors not to draw conclusions about the phase study until its completion.the funds attempt to differentiate between conclusions regarding the interim and final results is unavailing in light of the may release plain language.defendants explicit caution against drawing conclusions about the phase study by definition includes the interim results,which were part of the phase study.
the funds also appear to misread ruffolo october statement.they interpret it to mean wyeth would not commence phase early unless the phase interim results were spectacular in meeting specific efficacy criteria.but ruffolo statement was more narrow.he noted the companies could advance directly into phase iii in the first half of if the results were spectacular or could complete the study and then move to the next interim look in the first half of.as defendants correctly point out,the course of events ruffolo envisioned in the spectacular scenario did not come to companies did not advance to phase in the first half of.instead,the may release announced the initiation of phase in the second half of.accordingly,the may release should have superseded any lingering impression left by the spectacular statement in the minds of reasonable investors.see united states schiff,cir oran stafford,cir.
bolstering our conclusion is the nature of ruffolo prior statement.ruffolo spectacular statement was a statement about a course of events that,as it turned out,did not come to pass.by using the conditional could,ruffolo did not bind the company to any particular course of action.nor could he,because at the time he spoke initiation of phase still required fda approval.moreover,the adjective spectacular is the kind of vague and general statement of optimism that constitute s no more than puffery and is understood by reasonable investors as such.in re advanta.sec,cir,abrogated on other grounds by tellabs,makor issues rights,as recognized in institutional investors grp.avaya,cir see also transcript of argument at,in re elan.sec,cv june,philco,martin,wl,at.furthermore,although the may release did not offer any specific characterization of the phase interim results,it did caution that no conclusion could be drawn about the phase data until the completion of the study.had the interim results been spectacular,it is reasonable to assume the companies would have trumpeted that fact in the may at least given some indication the data were positive.
moreover,ruffolo never said bapineuzumab was required to meet specific efficacy criteria to advance to phase.that remark was made by elan ceo at a january,healthcare conference.defendants can not be held responsible for statements they did not make.see schiff,at.although the funds confidential witnesses stated that bapineuzumab was required and failed to achieve certain in phase and showed no dose response and numerous safety concerns,the funds fail to allege any public statements by defendants regarding specific,dose responses,or safety metrics bapineuzumab would be expected to achieve in order to advance to phase.
accordingly,we conclude the district court correctly determined the funds failed to adequately allege defendants made any affirmatively false or misleading statements in the may release.
the funds also contend defendants made six false or misleading public statements following issuance of the may release.the funds allege these statements failed to disclose the efficacy and safety problems revealed in the phase study,as well as that the phase interim results showed bapineuzumab did not meet criteria and phase testing was nearly a complete failure.we concur with the district court and reject these allegations.
the funds first challenge defendant ruffolo may,remarks at the citigroup healthcare conference.when asked to discuss which aspects of the phase interim review justified the early initiation of the phase trial,ruffolo said he can not comment and will not comment on the interim look because he can not do anything to destroy the blind in that study.because ruffolo only referred attendees to the may release and refused to comment on how the interim review justified the initiation of phase,he made no false or misleading statement.
next,the funds contend statements made by wyeth investor relations representative justin victoria and defendant poussot during earnings calls on july,and april,that described the phase interim results as one factor in the composite decision to move to phase were false and misleading.but those statements are consistent with the may release and accurately convey that the interim results were one factor defendants considered in deciding to initiate phase.moreover,victoria confirmed to investors and analysts on the april,call that wyeth had not yet disclosed the strength of the phase results and needed to complete the analysis of the phase data to make that determination.as a result,we find the july and april statements were not false or misleading.
the funds also challenge statements made by wyeth executives joseph camardo and joseph mahady.at the january,morgan healthcare conference,camardo described bapineuzumab as a potential breakthrough drug for alzheimer,and at the march,lehman brothers global healthcare conference mahady mentioned bapineuzumab as an example of a drug offering opportunities for transformational growth of the company.but these statements are not actionable because they are vague,and.see in re advanta,at philco,wl,at.both speakers were also noted the companies still faced risks establishing bapineuzumab efficacy and safety,and mahady reminded the audience that the final results of the phase study were not yet available.furthermore,camardo statement that wyeth and elan learned a lot in phase ii is true based on the statements from the funds own confidential witnesses.accordingly,the funds allegations that these statements were false or misleading lack merit.
finally,the funds allege defendant poussot statements on wyeth july,k and earnings call were false and misleading because he described the phase results as encouraging and supportive of our prior decision to initiate phase.unlike the other statements,poussot did characterize the final phase results as positive.but he only repeated conclusions wyeth had disclosed six days before in the june release.the district court held the june release was not actionable because defendants were under no duty to disclose information the funds alleged was omitted from that document,and the funds do not challenge that determination on appeal.accordingly,we concur with the district court that because the june release is not false or misleading,poussot statements can not be the basis of liability here.
based on the foregoing analysis,we hold the district court correctly determined the funds failed to sufficiently allege defendants statements were false or misleading.
in addition to alleging defendants statements were affirmatively false or misleading,the funds contend those statements triggered a duty to disclose full and complete material information regarding the phase interim results.a duty to disclose under federal securities laws may arise when a statute requires disclosure,insider trading occurs,or there is an inaccurate,incomplete,or misleading prior disclosure.oran stafford,cir.the funds urge us to impose a duty to disclose on each of these grounds because defendants chose to speak about a material subject to investors,defendants ruffolo and martin allegedly engaged in insider trading,and disclosure was necessary to make defendants prior statements not misleading.we agree with the district court that defendants were under no duty to disclose the allegedly omitted information.
the funds first argue defendants had a duty to speak fully and truthfully about the phase interim results because they put the subject in play by discussing those results publicly.instead of concealing material information about the poor phase interim res
