fournier industrie et santé and laboratoires fournier collectively,fournier,along with abbott laboratories abbott,appeal from the decision of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois granting novopharm limited novopharm summary judgment of noninfringement of patent the patent.abbott labs.novopharm,c,c,and c,wl,dist.lexis.we affirm.
background 
fournier is the assignee of the patent.the patent includes claims directed to a therapeutic fenofibrate composition claims,a method for the manufacture of that fenofibrate composition claims and,a method for improving the bioavailability of fenofibrate claim,and a method for treatment of hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia using the claimed fenofibrate composition claims and.
abbott is fournier exclusive licensee under the patent.abbott also holds a new drug application nda approved by the united states food and drug administration fda,permitting it to market fournier fenofibrate capsules in the united states.abbott sells the capsules under the tradename tricor.
novopharm filed an abbreviated new drug application anda in december,seeking the fda approval to market a generic micronized formulation of fenofibrate prior to the expiration of the patent.along with its anda,novopharm submitted a certification under j a vii iv a paragraph iv certification,declaring that the manufacture,use,and sale of its proposed fenofibrate formulation would not infringe the patent.under j b i,an anda applicant who files a paragraph iv certification is required to include in its application a statement that it will give notice of that filing to the owner of the patent to which the certification pertains,j b i i,and to the holder of the approved nda for that drug,j b i ii.pursuant to those provisions,novopharm notified fournier and abbott,respectively,that it had filed the anda and paragraph iv certification.also,as required by j b ii,novopharm provided in its notice letter a detailed statement of the factual and legal bases for its opinion of noninfringement of the patent.
fournier and abbott then filed suit against novopharm.they alleged that novopharm generic version of tricor would infringe one or more claims of the patent,and that novopharm submission of an anda for approval to sell fenofibrate capsules prior to the expiration of the patent constituted an act of infringement under e.that provision,in pertinent part,provides that 
it shall be an act of infringement to submit a an application under section j of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act codified at j,an anda for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent,if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such act,title of the united states code to engage in the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.
e.fournier and abbott sought,among other things,a judgment that the patent was valid,enforceable,and infringed an order staying the approval of novopharm anda until the january,expiration date of the patent and an injunction prohibiting novopharm from commercially manufacturing,selling,using,or importing infringing fenofibrate compositions.
novopharm amended its anda twice,both times adding a new dosage form and including a paragraph iv certification for the newly added form.following each of those amendments,fournier and abbott filed a new complaint against novopharm.the district court eventually consolidated all three actions into a single proceeding novopharm thereafter moved for summary judgment of noninfringement.
claims and,which are the patent only two independent claims,define the patented subject matter as follows 
a therapeutic composition,which is presented in the form of gelatin capsules and which is useful especially in the oral treatment of hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia,said composition containing a mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,wherein the mean particle size of said mixture is less than μ.
a method for improving the bioavailability of fenofibrate in vivo,which comprises of the fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,the said being carried out by micronization of a surfactant mixture until the particle size of the powder obtained is less than μ.
emphases added.
claim of the patent was amended during prosecution,in response to a rejection under.as originally filed,that claim recited the phrase the said composition containing fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,which have been.the amendment made during prosecution replaced that phrase with said composition containing a mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,wherein the mean particle size of the mixture is less than μ.the patent specification includes data showing that the patented composition has improved properties relative to formulations in which a solid surfactant is added to fenofibrate impliedly without fenofibrate is micronized on its own or fenofibrate and surfactant are separately micronized and then intimately mixed.patent,ll.during prosecution of the application that led to the patent,fournier also distinguished its composition from prior art formulations in which fenofibrate was granulated in a matrix containing a particle size of between and microns.
the district court found that fournier had distinguished the claimed invention,as amended,from the cited prior art,on the ground that the prior art did not teach or suggest of a mixture of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,which resulted in an improvement in bioavailability and dissolution rate not taught or suggested in the prior art.abbott,slip op.at.fournier further distinguished the amended claim on the basis that to produce particles having a diameter of less than fifteen microns was not taught or suggested in the prior art.id.the court also observed that the patent specification states that 
the of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,the micronization of an intimate mixture of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant makes it possible to improve the bioavailability of the fenofibrate to a significantly greater extent than that which would be achieved either by adding a surfactant to fenofibrate,or by micronizing the fenofibrate on its own,or by intimately mixing the separately micronized fenofibrate and surfactant.
id.at alteration in original.the court thus concluded that fournier claims could not be construed to include mixtures obtained by adding a surfactant to fenofibrate,or micronizing fenofibrate by itself,mixing separately micronized fenofibrate and surfactant.id.at.
the district court then found that sodium lauryl sulfate sls was the only example of a solid surfactant,and that a method involving of a mixture prior to the addition of excipients such as lactose or starch was the only detailed example of disclosed in the patent.id.at.elaborating on that point,the court found further that t he claims,description,and prosecution history do not indicate that anything other than fenofibrate and a solid surfactant are micronized no other excipient is identified as part of this mixture.id.at.the court concluded on the basis of those findings that the term ed,ation in independent claims and does not encompass of excipients other than fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,but instead is construed to mean that fenofibrate and a solid surfactant have been micronized together in the absence of other excipients.id.the court also concluded that the phrase surfactant mixture in claim of the patent must be construed,according to novopharm proposal,so as to exclude any ingredients other than fenofibrate and solid surfactant,noting that fournier and abbott had not objected to that construction.id.the court applied essentially the same construction to the phrase mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant in claim,interpreting that phrase to mean a mixture wholly of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,to the exclusion of any other excipients.id.at.
having so construed the claims,the district court then considered novopharm proposed fenofibrate formulations.the court found that,according to the anda,novopharm process for making its proposed products involves fenofibrate on its own,in the absence of solid surfactant.the fenofibrate is then dry mixed with lactose monohydrate,pregelatinized starch,croscarmellose sodium,and crosspovidone.separately,a granulating solution is prepared by dissolving povidone and sls in water.the granulating solution is then added to the dry mixture,and the resulting mixture is then subjected to a wet granulation process,which involves mixing,with the introduction of additional water,to form a uniform wet mass.the wet mass is then dried to form a dried,granulated mixture of fenofibrate,sls,and excipients.the granulated mixture is dry blended with additional croscarmellose sodium,crosspovidone,and magnesium stearate to produce granules that can pass through a mesh screen,for storage and eventual encapsulation into gelatin capsules.id.at.
in novopharm motion for summary judgment,it had argued that its process does not include of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,and therefore would not infringe the patent.fournier and abbott opposed novopharm motion,alleging that the wet granulation and drying steps used by novopharm constitute the required,because the fenofibrate particles are reduced in size during those steps.nonetheless,finding that there was no dispute among the parties that fenofibrate and a solid surfactant are not micronized together in the absence of other excipients in novopharm process,and having already construed the claims to require just that,the court held that novopharm formulations could not literally infringe either independent claim in the patent.id.at.
the court also ruled out infringement under the doctrine of equivalents on the basis of prosecution history estoppel.the court reasoned that fournier prosecution arguments,which distinguished the claimed invention from the prior art on the ground that the prior art did not teach or suggest of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant such that the resulted in improved bioavailability,viewed together with statements in the patent specification and arguments that fournier made during reexamination of the patent,would reasonably lead a competitor to conclude that fournier had relinquished a product and process that involved either adding a surfactant by itself or by micronizing the fenofibrate on its own or by intimately mixing the separately micronized fenofibrate and surfactant.id.at.having concluded that fournier and abbott had relinquished coverage of novopharm process and thus could not prevail,the district court granted novopharm motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.
fournier and abbott now appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,reapplying the standard used by the district court.ethicon,surgical.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
determination of patent infringement requires a analysis.first,the court determines the scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted secondly,the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing product.cybor fas,en banc citations omitted.step one,claim construction,is an issue of law,markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d,that we review de novo,cybor,at,at.step two,comparison of the claim to the accused product,requires a determination that every claim limitation or its equivalent can be found in the accused product.hilton davis chem,d.a claim limitation is equivalently present in an accused product if only insubstantial differences distinguish the missing claim element from the corresponding aspects of the accused product.sage,devon,citation omitted.those determinations are ordinarily questions of fact,bai l l wings,but summary judgment should be granted in any case where no reasonable fact finder could find equivalence.sage,at,at see also,at.where the evidence is such that no reasonable jury could determine two elements to be equivalent,district courts are obliged to grant partial or complete summary judgment.
fournier and abbott argue on appeal that the district court erred by construing the claim term to require micronization of fenofibrate and solid surfactant in the absence of other excipients.they argue that the court also erred by construing the claim phrase mixture of to mean mixture wholly of,again requiring exclusion of all ingredients other than fenofibrate and solid surfactant in the mixture during.according to the appellants,both misconstructions result from the court having improperly imported limitations into the claims from the patent examples.
we disagree,first,with the appellants contention that the district court misconstrued the term.although courts must presume that the terms in a claim mean what they say,and unless otherwise compelled,give full effect to the ordinary and accustomed meaning of claim terms,johnson worldwide,zebco,see also nike wolverine world wide,du pont de nemours phillips petroleum,we have previously identified limited situations where a sufficient reason exists to require the entry of a definition of a claim term other than its ordinary and accustomed meaning,johnson worldwide,at,at.one such situation is when the patentee has chosen to be his or her own lexicographer by clearly setting forth an explicit definition for a claim term.id.
the district court found that,although the term was not known in the art prior to the filing date of the application that led to the patent,both micronization and the prefix co had meanings as of that date,and one of ordinary skill in the art at that time therefore would have readily understood the meaning of.had that term not been explicitly defined in the patent specification,we might well agree with the appellants that that term could simply mean micronized with or together and would not necessarily exclude the presence of ingredients not specifically recited in the claim.however,the phrase of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant is in fact explicitly defined at column,lines,of the patent,as micronization of an intimate mixture of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant.hence,this is a case in which the patentee has chosen to be his own lexicographer,and the district court did not err by reading the patentee definition from the specification into the claim.moreover,the inclusion of the word intimate in the definition,together with the fact that fenofibrate and sls are the only ingredients present in every mixture described in the patent specification,makes it abundantly clear that of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant should be construed as referring to of a mixture consisting essentially of fenofibrate and solid surfactant 
since each of the claims of the patent requires either a mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid surfactant or of the fenofibrate and a solid surfactant,carried out by micronization of a surfactant mixture,each of the claims requires of a mixture consisting essentially of only fenofibrate and solid surfactant.because it is undisputed that fenofibrate and a solid surfactant are not mixed in novopharm process without other significant ingredients,excipients and water,being present,we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to literal infringement in this case.
fournier and abbott also argue,however,that the district court erred in its analysis of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents by holding that fournier had relinquished during prosecution coverage of all methods in which fenofibrate is.fournier and abbott further contend that the court erred by concluding that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to infringement by equivalents,and thus that the court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement was improper.
in addition to assigning error to the district court claim construction,the appellants argue t
