a jury convicted william hurwitz of multiple counts of drug trafficking for prescribing narcotic pain medicine in violation of a and west.hurwitz appeals,arguing,inter alia,that the district court improperly admitted evidence recovered in a search of his office and incorrectly instructed the jury on the law.although we affirm the district court decision to admit the evidence seized in the search,we conclude that the district court did not properly instruct the jury on the controlling law.accordingly,we vacate hurwitz convictions and remand for a new trial.
hurwitz is a medical doctor who operated a practice in mclean,virginia,dedicated to the treatment of patients suffering from pain.hurwitz approach to pain management involved the use of opioids,including methadone,oxycodone typically oxycontin,a version of a form of oxycodone,and hydromorphone usually the dilaudid.many of hurwitz patients were on a protocol that used very high doses of opioids to control their pain.
hurwitz came to the attention of federal authorities in,after several of his patients were arrested for attempting to sell illicit and prescription drugs.the patients identified hurwitz as the source of their prescription drugs,and they began cooperating with the investigators.the information these patients provided eventually led to hurwitz indictment on numerous count of conspiracy to engage in drug trafficking,see one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,see west two counts of healthcare fraud,see west and counts of drug trafficking,including two counts each of resulting in serious bodily injury and resulting in death,see a.
the government evidence at trial painted a picture of a doctor who operated well outside the boundaries of usual medical practice.the government contended that hurwitz was little more than a common drug dealer who operated out of a medical office rather than on a street corner.the government expert witnesses testified that a doctor who knowingly prescribed opioids to an addict or to a patient the doctor knew was selling the drugs on the street was acting outside the bounds of legitimate medical practice,and the government presented compelling evidence suggesting that hurwitz did just to prescribe large quantities of opioids to patients that he knew were selling the drugs or abusing them for example,by injecting drugs that were directed to be taken orally.
several of the patients who were cooperating with the authorities their appointments with hurwitz.in one recording,hurwitz indicated that it was not inconceivable to him that some patients were selling part of their medicines so they could buy the rest.in another recording hurwitz stated,so i have kind of a huge conspiracy of silence because i,in fact,even,even knowing what i call the suspicious nature of you guys,assumed that you were stupid enough not protect my practice and preserve your own access to medications.hurwitz told another patient to get an or an mri for the files to cover our butts.
the government presented evidence of what seemed to be extraordinarily high doses of opioids prescribed by hurwitz.an expert witness for the government testified that opioid therapy typically involved doses of the equivalent of approximately milligrams of morphine a day,although there had been a study involving doses of milligrams a day and another involving doses of up to two grams a day.
the doses prescribed by hurwitz,however,vastly exceeded those quantities.hurwitz often wrote prescriptions calling for a patient to take thirty oxycontins per day.for hurwitz patients in the program,a prescribed opioid dosage of pills per day was not uncommon.hurwitz testified that between and,the median daily dosage for his patients was approximately milligrams grams of morphine or its equivalent.because oxycontin is stronger than morphine,hurwitz testified that milligrams of morphine would translate to about milligrams of oxycontin.between july and october,hurwitz prescribed to one patient a total of more than pills,which amounted to more than pills per day.towards the end of the time that hurwitz treated the patient,the prescribed dosage included roxicodones a release version of oxycontin per day still another patient was prescribed roxicodones as a supply.patients with limited visible sources of income spent tens of thousands of dollars a month on narcotics prescribed by hurwitz.
the government also presented evidence showing that hurwitz had previously been disciplined for improper prescribing practices.in,the district of columbia board of medicine had reprimanded hurwitz and placed him on probation for prescribing drugs when not authorized to do so and for failing to conform to the prevailing standards of acceptable medical practice.in,the virginia board of medicine revoked his license upon finding that he had prescribed excessive amounts of controlled substances.the virginia board also required hurwitz to attend classes on proper prescription practices and how to detect when patients were trying to use him as a source for prescription drugs rather than a doctor to treat pain.
not surprisingly,the defense painted an entirely different picture.hurwitz and his witnesses contended that the protocol was a proper medical procedure for treating patients with intractable pain.they testified that the body quickly develops resistance to the dangerous of opioids such as respiratory depression,which then permits an escalation of the dosage until pain relief is obtained.one expert testified that once a patient becomes tolerant of the,there is effectively no ceiling on the quantity of opioids that can be prescribed if necessary to control pain.that expert also testified that many patients over time will require an increase in their opioid dosage in order to maintain control of their pain.hurwitz experts also testified that there is no medical reason to stop treating a patient for pain simply because that patient may be abusing illicit drugs and that,in some cases,stopping such treatment may even be more problematic.
hurwitz testified about his practices and the patients he treated.he discussed how patients were generally asked to fill out questionnaires and submit medical records before receiving treatment and how he often included patients family members during visits as a part of his approach to treating pain.hurwitz participated in an discussion group with other professionals about how to approach various situations in pain treatment,and he would confer with other physicians concerning the treatment of certain patients.hurwitz also discussed how he based his approach on what he learned at pain management conferences and what he understood other doctors would do.
some of hurwitz patients testified on his behalf,explaining that hurwitz was the only physician who had managed to relieve their debilitating pain.molly shaw,for example,discussed her futile attempts to treat what the mayo clinic had diagnosed as neuropathic pain,a pain so severe that it forced her to retire at age and remain almost completely bedridden.she testified that hurwitz treatments allowed her to regain her life and live in considerably less pain.the patients testimony,as well as the testimony of hurwitz staff,portrayed hurwitz as a caring physician whose sole focus was providing pain relief for his patients.
hurwitz was convicted of one count of drug trafficking conspiracy,one count of drug trafficking resulting in death,two counts of drug trafficking resulting in serious bodily injury,and counts of drug trafficking.the jury acquitted hurwitz of six counts of drug trafficking,as well as one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and two counts of healthcare fraud.the jury failed to reach a decision on the remaining drug trafficking counts.the district court sentenced hurwitz to years in prison.this appeal followed.
we first consider hurwitz claims that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence recovered from the search of his office.before we address the substance of hurwitz suppression claims,however,a review of some background facts is necessary.
as mentioned above,federal authorities began monitoring hurwitz practice in,after several of hurwitz patients were arrested on drug charges.on the basis of the information obtained during the investigation,federal authorities obtained search warrants for hurwitz home and office 
in support of its warrant application,the government relied on the affidavit of agent fulton lucas,a task force officer with the drug enforcement administration high intensity drug trafficking group for northern virginia.agent lucas supporting affidavit explained that the investigation of hurwitz stemmed from reports by local law enforcement agencies of an unusually high incident of arrests of individuals for distributing prescription narcotics in the northern and southwest region of the state of virginia,and rural areas of west virginia and tennessee.according to agent lucas,a significant number of these arrests resulted in the cooperation of individuals who revealed that the source of their prescription narcotics was william hurwitz of mclean,virginia.the affidavit provided details about the investigation of hurwitz,including evidence obtained with the assistance of five of hurwitz patients.
agent lucas submitted the standard federal warrant application form,which prompts the applicant to describe the person or property to be seized.agent lucas description provided as follows see attachment a of affidavit,referring to his supporting affidavit.in turn,attachment a the attachment listed specific items the government sought permission to seize related to hurwitz s medical practice which constitute evidence of drug trafficking including p atient medical and billing files.the attachment did not identify any individual patient files.
the magistrate judge granted the application,granted the government motion to seal the application and accompanying affidavit,and issued a search warrant for hurwitz medical practice on the face of the the space reserved for a description of the items to be words see attachment had been entered.the search warrant indicated that agent lucas affidavit established probable cause to seize the property described in the reserved space on the search warrant.the government executed the search warrant,seizing all of hurwitz patient files.
hurwitz challenges the validity of the search warrant on two grounds.he contends that the search warrant was invalid because it failed to identify the items to be seized with sufficient particularity,and that the search warrant was fatally overbroad.we review a district court disposition of a motion to suppress de novo.see united states stevenson,cir,cert.denied,d.
the fourth amendment instructs that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.the requirement that a search warrant describe with particularity the items to be seized ensures that a citizen is not subjected to a general,exploratory rummaging in his personal belongings.coolidge new hampshire,d.significantly,the particularity requirement applies to the warrant,as opposed to the application or the supporting affidavit submitted by the applicant.see groh ramirez,d see also owens ex rel.owens lott,cir.thus,t he fact that the application adequately described the things to be seized does not save the warrant from its facial invalidity.groh,at.
hurwitz first argues that the search warrant was invalid because it failed to particularly identify the property to be seized.the search warrant did not,on its face,describe any of the property to be seized instead,it simply referred to the attachment to lucas affidavit that was submitted with the application for the search warrant.hurwitz claims that the executing officers carried the warrant at the time of the search but not the attachment or the affidavit,both of which were sealed.hurwitz argues that because the attachment did not accompany the warrant at the time of the search,the particulars contained in the attachment can not be construed to be part of the search warrant 
the particularity requirement of the fourth amendment may be satisfied by in the warrant to separate documents that identify the property in sufficient detail.see groh,at.we do not say that the fourth amendment forbids a warrant from other documents.indeed,most courts of appeals have held that is permissible under certain circumstances.united states washington,cir.as a general rule,a supporting affidavit or document may be read together with and considered part of a warrant that otherwise lacks sufficient particularity if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation,and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant.groh,at.although the search warrant in this case does not on its face describe the items to be seized in the search of hurwitz office,it does refer to the attachment to lucas supporting affidavit detailing the property to be seized.
hurwitz contends that the mere reference to the attachment to lucas affidavit was insufficient,on its own,to satisfy the fourth amendment particularity requirement.according to hurwitz,the attachment itself must have accompanied the warrant at the time of the search for it to be construed to supply the particulars lacked by the search warrant.hurwitz bases his argument on the language of groh suggesting that the majority of the courts of appeals permit a general warrant to be cured by reference to a separate document only if both words of incorporation be used and that the incorporated document accompany the met.see id.thus,hurwitz reads groh as establishing a definitive rule for validating a warrant by incorporation of a separate document.
groh,however,establishes no such rule.instead,groh simply acknowledges the approach generally followed by the courts of appeals.because neither requirement was satisfied in groh,the supreme court declined to further consider the question of incorporation by reference.see id.at.but in this case the warrant did not incorporate other documents by reference,nor did either the affidavit or the application which had been placed under seal accompany the warrant.hence,we need not further explore the matter of incorporation.
we recognize that a majority of our sister circuit courts of appeals appear to require the satisfaction of both conditions before allowing a separate document to be read as part of the search warrant.see bartholomew pennsylvania,cir united states mcgrew,cir united states dahlman,cir united states dale,per curiam united states morris,cir united states curry,cir.in this circuit,however,it is sufficient either for the warrant to incorporate the supporting document by reference or for the supporting document to be attached to the warrant itself.see washington,at concluding that warrant was sufficiently particular where the warrant completely failed to refer to the supporting affidavit listing items to be seized but the affidavit was attached,and explaining that a n affidavit may provide the necessary particularity for a warrant if it is either incorporated into or attached to the warrant emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.at least one other circuit subscribes to this view.see baranski fifteen unknown atf agents,cir en banc.
in this case,the search warrant the attachment to lucas supporting affidavit.although the words of incorporation used in the warrant are not overly precise,hurwitz does not contend that they are insufficient to incorporate the attachment for purposes of the particularity requirement moreover,hurwitz does not dispute that the attachment itself identifies the items to be seized from hurwitz office with sufficient particularity.thus,we need not explore either of these issues at length.we conclude that the search warrant properly the attachment which,in turn,supplied the requisite particularity to the search warrant,regardless of whether the attachment accompanied or was appended to the search warrant at the time it was executed.
hurwitz maintains that because the attachment did not accompany the warrant when the search was performed,the essential purposes of the fourth amendment particularity requirement went unfulfilled.a sufficiently particular warrant not only guards against general searches,but also assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer,his need to search,and the limits of his power to search.united states chadwick,d.moreover,according to hurwitz,requiring the attachment to accompany the search warrant at the time of the search would also inform the executing officer of the limits of his discretion to search.see mcgrew,at.
these policy aims,as important as they may be,do not reflect a constitutional mandate that an executing officer possess or exhibit the affidavit or any other document incorporated into the warrant at the time of the search in order for the warrant to be valid.the fourth amendment does not require an officer to serve a search warrant before executing it.see groh,at.in fact,the fourth amendment is not offended where the executing officer fails to leave a copy of the search warrant with the property owner following the search,see united states simons,cir,or fails even to carry the warrant during the search,see mazuz maryland,cir t he requirement of particular description does not protect an interest in monitoring searches or engag ing the police in a debate about the warrant.united states grubbs,d.rather,t he constitution protects property owners by interposing,ex ante,the deliberate,impartial judgment of a judicial officer and by providing,ex post,a right to suppress evidence improperly obtained.id.internal quotation marks omitted.these protections are sufficient to ensure that the officer search is properly limited and to provide assurance to the property owner that the executing officer enjoys the lawful authority to search for specific items.indeed,hurwitz was able to examine agent lucas affidavit and its attachment and raise a full and complete challenge to the validity of the warrant after the search.we see nothing in the constitution requiring that an officer possess or exhibit,at the time of the search,documents incorporated into a warrant as an additional safeguard for the particularity requirement.see baranski,at.accordingly,the district court did not err by rejecting hurwitz claim that the absence of the attachment at the time of the search rendered the warrant invalid.
hurwitz also challenges the breadth of the warrant.when executing the warrant,the officers seized all of the patient files in hurwitz office.on appeal,hurwitz contends that there was no probable cause to justify the seizure of the files of every patient.
the fourth amendment requires that a warrant be no broader than the probable cause on which it is based.united states zimmerman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the concept of probable cause resists an exacting definition,it exist s where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.united states perez,cir quoting ornelas united states,d.an assessment of probable cause by an impartial magistrate judge must take into account the totality of the circumstances,maryland pringle,d,including hearsay information,see united states dequasie,cir,as set forth in the affidavit presented in support of the warrant.
when reviewing a magistrate judge probable cause determination,we look to whether there was a substantial basis for the decision.united states lalor,cir.a scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should accord great deference to the magistrate determination of probable cause.illinois gates,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the attachment to the supporting affidavit,which we read as part of the search warrant,identified specific items to be seized,including patient medical and billing files and all related records and documents,including complete medical files.hurwitz argues that because the supporting affidavit was based on statements of only five of hurwitz numerous patients,there was insufficient probable cause for the government to seize all of the files.we disagree.
there is no requirement that the government have evidence relating to each and every patient of hurwitz to support the seizure of all of the files in this case 
w here there is probable cause to believe that a business is permeated with fraud,either explicitly stated in the supporting affidavit or implicit from the evidence therein set forth,a warrant may authorize the seizure of all documents relating to the suspected criminal area but may not authorize the seizure of any severable portion of such documents relating to legitimate activities.
united states oloyede,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in oloyede,we affirmed the conviction of a lawyer who was involved in a scheme to defraud the government by falsifying immigration papers.like hurwitz,the lawyer in oloyede challenged the scope of a search that seized all of his clients files,claiming that the government should have limited the search to files reviewed by the agent who testified in support of the warrant or to files involving similar immigration applications.we rejected this argument,holding that the seizure of all of the files was justified by probable cause that the business was permeated with fraud.id.the question in this case,then,is whether a substantial basis existed for the issuing judge to find probable cause that hurwitz medical practice was permeated with his drug trafficking activity such that all of his patient files could be seized.
agent lucas indicated in his affidavit that he discovered an unusually high incident of arrests of individuals for distributing prescription narcotics in certain regions in virginia,west virginia,and tennessee,and that a significant number of these arrests resulted in the identification of hurwitz as the source of the prescription drugs.he then recounted evidence suggesting that hurwitz commonly performed only the most cursory he performed them at to prescribing heavy doses of controlled substances.according to agent lucas,hurwitz had a reputation in the drug community for his practice of prescribing high amounts of narcotics,and one cooperating source claimed to have become a patient for that very reason.additionally,agent lucas indicated that hurwitz demanded initiation fees from patients,as well as monthly maintenance fees,to be paid in cash,suggesting that hurwitz made a common practice of fronting drugs rather than practicing medicine.according to the supporting affidavit,hurwitz activities as a mere drug dispenser followed a pattern in that hurwitz license to practice medicine was suspended in virginia in for controlled substances to at least patients,and that the district of columbia board of medicine likewise suspended his license for similar reasons in.
additionally,the lucas affidavit included facts suggesting that hurwitz apparently understood that his patients,on a basis,were and distributing the controlled substances that he prescribed to them in the first instance.hurwitz purportedly told one patient something to the effect that all of his patients were being arrested and that he had patients in other states who were being arrested.
agent lucas affidavit provided a substantial basis for the magistrate judge to find probable cause that hurwitz practice was permeated with the illegal distribution of drugs.see oloyede,at.the evidence of hurwitz common practice gave reason to believe that he consistently departed from accepted professional standards and was not practicing medicine,but was instead cloaking drug deals under the guise of a professional medical practice.united states alerre,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we find no reversible error in the district court decision to admit the evidence seized in the search of hurwitz office.
we turn now to hurwitz challenges to the jury instructions with regard to the charges he faced under.the decision to give or not to give a jury instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united states moye,cir en banc.we review a jury instruction to determine whether,taken as a whole,the instruction fairly states the controlling law.by definition,a court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
section provides that,e xcept as authorized by this subchapter,it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance.a.doctors who are registered by the attorney general are authorized to write prescriptions for or to otherwise dispense controlled substances,so long as they comply with the requirements of their registration.see b west authorizing those registered by the attorney general to possess,manufacture,distribute,or dispense controlled substances to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this subchapter.
as authorized by the controlled substances act,see west supp,the attorney general has promulgated regulations addressing the conditions under which registrants are authorized to dispense controlled substances.the regulations provide that a prescription for a controlled substance is effective only if it is issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.a.the regulation further provides that 
an order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of professional treatment or in legitimate and authorized research is not a prescription within the meaning and intent of section of the act and the person knowingly issuing such a purported prescription shall be subject to the penalties provided for violations of the provisions of law relating to controlled substances.
synthesizing the requirements of the relevant statutes and regulations,we have held that to convict a doctor for violating,the government must prove that the defendant distributed or dispensed a controlled substance that the defendant acted knowingly and intentionally and that the defendant actions were not for legitimate medical purposes in the usual course of his professional medical practice or were beyond the bounds of medical practice.united states singh,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted see also alerre,at united states daniel,cir united states tran trong cuong,cir 
on appeal,hurwitz raises several objections to the district court instructions to the jury.he argues that the instructions required the jury to apply the knowledge requirement only to hurwitz act of writing a prescription,and that the instructions therefore permitted the jury to convict even if it concluded that hurwitz did not know that any given prescription was not for a legitimate medical purpose or was beyond the bounds of medical practice.hurwitz claims that the instructions thus improperly limited the statute mens rea requirement and permitted the jury to convict him of a serious crime with little more than a finding of negligence.and in a related argument,hurwitz contends that the district court erred by not including a instruction in connection with the charges and by specifically instructing the jury that it could not consider hurwitz good faith as to any of the charges.hurwitz also argues that the district court erred by not defining the phrases beyond the bounds of medical practice or not for a legitimate medical purpose.as we explain below,we conclude that a new trial is required because of the district court error regarding the instruction.given this conclusion,we need not consider and we express no opinion on hurwitz other challenges to the jury instructions.
hurwitz first contends that the district court erred by rejecting his request for a good faith instruction.hurwitz argues that his good faith in issuing the challenged prescriptions was relevant to his intent when treating his patients and thus relevant to the jury determination of whether he acted outside the bounds of accepted medical practice or without a legitimate medical purpose.
the district court agreed with the government position that hurwitz good faith was legally irrelevant to the charges,and the court declined to include hurwitz requested instruction.however,as to the two healthcare fraud charges,the district court agreed to give a instruction.as to those counts,the district court instructed the jury that it could not convict hurwitz if he acted in good faith in dispensing any of the prescriptions alleged to constitute the crime of healthcare fraud.the court defined good faith to mean good intentions in the honest exercise of best professional judgment as to a patient needs.it means the doctor acted according to what he believed to be proper medical practice.the district court instructed the jury that good faith applies only to the healthcare fraud counts.thus,the district court not only declined to give a instruction with regard to the drug counts,but also informed the jury that it could not consider good faith when deciding whether to convict hurwitz of drug trafficking under 
as an initial premise,we agree with hurwitz that a doctor good faith generally is relevant to a jury determination of whether the doctor acted outside the bounds of medical practice or with a legitimate medical purpose when prescribing narcotics.
in united states moore,d,the seminal case addressing the prosecution of physicians under,the supreme court concluded that registered physicians can be prosecuted under when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.id.at.in the course of concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury conclusion that the defendant acted beyond the bounds of professional practice,the court noted two instructions that had been given to the jury.the district court had instructed the jury that the defendant could be convicted if the jury found that he knowingly distributed controlled substances other than in good faith for detoxification in the usual course of a professional practice and in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the united states.id.at,and that the defendant could not be convicted if he merely made an honest effort to prescribe in compliance with an accepted standard of medical practice.id.at.
building on the supreme court approach in moore,lower courts have concluded that when resolving the ultimate question in a prosecution against a the doctor acted without a legitimate medical purpose or beyond the bounds of accepted medical latitude must be given to doctors trying to determine the current boundaries of acceptable medical practice.thus,courts have consistently concluded that it is proper to instruct juries that a doctor should not be held criminally liable if the doctor acted in good faith when treating his patients.see alerre,at noting that the jury was correctly instructed on the applicable legal principles,and that the jury was instructed that the could not be convicted if they had dispensed the controlled substances at issue in good faith united states hughes,cir citing moore standard that physicians can not be convicted if they dispens e controlled substances in the course of professional practice and explaining that b ecause dudley was a licensed physician,the jury could not find him guilty of distributing controlled substances,as long as he acted in good faith united states vamos,cir t he doctor must act in the good faith belief that his distribution of the controlled substance is for a legitimate medical purpose and in accordance with the usual course of generally accepted medical practice.united states hayes,cir finding no error in charge that required jury to determine that physician acted other than in good faith and defined good faith as an honest effort to prescribe for a patient condition in accordance with the standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country united states norris,cir finding proper district court instruction to the jury that a controlled substance is prescribed by a physician in the usual course of a professional practice,and,therefore,lawfully,if the substance is prescribed by him in good faith,medically treating a patient in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the united states united states carroll,cir reversing conviction because trial court did not advise the jury that physicians are exempt from the provisions of the drug abuse statute when they dispense or prescribe controlled substances in good faith to patients in the regular course of professional practice.accordingly,the district court erred by concluding that good faith is not relevant when a registered physician is charged with violating.
the question we must next consider is hurwitz argument that the district court erred by refusing his proffered charge.while the government objected below to any suggestion that a instruction was appropriate,the government on appeal does not contend that a instruction is never warranted in a case where a registered physician is prosecuted under.instead,the government argues that hurwitz is not entitled to reversal on this point because the instruction hurwitz offered below was an incorrect statement of the law.see united states lewis,cir a district court refusal to provide an instruction requested by a defendant constitutes reversible error only if the instruction was correct was not substantially covered by the court charge to the jury and dealt with some point in the trial so important,that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to conduct his defense.internal quotation marks omitted.we agree with the government that the instruction offered by hurwitz was not an accurate statement of the law.
the instruction offered by hurwitz at trial stated that 
if a doctor dispenses a drug in good faith to medically treat a patient,then the doctor has dispensed the drug for a legitimate medical purpose and in the course of medical practice.that is,he has dispensed the drug lawfully.good faith in this context means good intentions in the honest exercise of best professional judgment as to a patient needs.it means the doctor acted according to what he believed to be proper medical practice.
emphasis added.this proposed instruction clearly sets forth a subjective standard,permitting hurwitz to decide for himself what constitutes proper medical treatment.as the government contends,however,allowing criminal liability to turn on whether the complied with his own idiosyncratic view of proper medical practices is inconsistent with the supreme court decision in moore.
in moore,the supreme court discussed the circumstances under which doctors could be prosecuted under using language that strongly suggests the inquiry is an objective one.for example,the court held that registered physicians can be prosecuted under when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.moore,at.emphasis added.the court also noted that,when passing the controlled substances act,congress intended to confine authorized medical practice within accepted limits,id.at.emphasis added,and that physicians who go beyond approved practice remain subject to serious criminal penalties.id.at.emphasis added.and as discussed above,the supreme court when concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant conviction noted two instructions that had been given to the jury.those instructions clearly set forth an objective standard.see id.at.
the instructions used in other circuits likewise have reflected an objective standard for determining whether the defendant acted in good faith.see hayes,at affirming conviction where district court instructed that g ood faith is not merely a doctor sincere intention towards the people who come to see him,but,rather,it involves his sincerity in attempting to conduct himself in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the country norris,at rejecting argument that instruction should reflect subjective rather than objective standard united states voorhies,cir affirming conviction where jury was instructed that good faith means good intentions and honest exercise of best professional judgment as to a patient medical needs.it connotes an observance of conduct in accordance with what the physician should reasonably believe to be proper medical practice.
hurwitz,however,contends that his proffered instruction was proper because it was derived from our opinion in united states tran trong cuong,cir.in that case,the defendant argued,inter alia,that the district court and the prosecution used a medical malpractice standard rather than a criminal standard to judge his actions.id.at.in the course of addressing the defendant arguments,we reviewed the jury instructions given by the district court and concluded that the instructions correctly set forth a criminal standard of liability.see id.
the jury instructions in tran trong cuong included the following language 
if a doctor dispenses a drug in good faith in medically treating a patient,then the doctor has dispensed the drug for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of medical practice.that is,he has dispensed the drug lawfully.good faith in this context means good intentions in the honest exercise of best professional judgment as to a patient need.it means the doctor acted in accordance with what he believed to be proper medical practice.
id.at.this charge is essentially identical to the instruction proffered by hurwitz.since we described the instructions in tran trong cuong as correctly establishing a criminal standard of liability,hurwitz argues that we approved of the portion of those instructions.we disagree.
no issue was raised by the defendant in tran trong cuong that required us to consider the precise contours of a instruction.instead,the only challenge to the jury instructions was the defendant claim that the instructions set forth a civil rather than criminal liability standard.we found no merit to that argument and concluded that the instructions correctly set forth a criminal standard.see id.at.however,we specifically noted that the district court instructions on the element appear to be more strict than that required by moore and therefore was to defendant benefit.id.at.the instruction was part of the instructions on the element and thus was part of the instructions that we believed were more favorable to the defendant than required by moore.because in tran trong cuong we were not called on to consider the defendant good faith and because we explained that the portion of the instructions that included the instructions were broader than necessary to comply with moore,it simply can not be said that in tran trong cuong we approved the instruction sought by hurwitz.
in this case,however,we are squarely presented with the question of whether,in a prosecution against a doctor,the inquiry into the doctor good faith in treating his patients is a subjective or objective one.we believe that the inquiry must be an objective one,a conclusion that has been reached by every court to specifically consider the question.as the second circuit explained,
p rofessional practice as used in a refers to generally accepted medical practice a practitioner is not free deliberately to disregard prevailing standards of treatment 
to permit a practitioner to substitute his or her views of what is good medical practice for standards generally recognized and accepted in the united states would be to weaken the enforcement of our drug laws in a critical area.
vamos,at,see also united states williams,cir williams proposed instruction fails to introduce any objective standard by which a physician prescribing behavior can be judged.under williams proposed instruction,if it is a physician subjective belief that he is meeting a patient medical needs by prescribing that patient a controlled substance,then that physician can not be convicted of violating the controlled substances act even if he acts outside all accepted standards of medical practice.thus,the proposed instruction is contrary to moore.norris,at rejecting defendant claim that a standard medical practice may be based on an entirely subjective standard because o ne person treatment methods do not alone constitute a medical practice leonard sand et,modern federal jury instructions,instruction,comment eve
