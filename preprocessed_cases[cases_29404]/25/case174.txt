relying on the whistleblower protection provisions of the act of,mark livingston commenced this action against his employer wyeth,a pharmaceutical company,alleging that wyeth unlawfully discharged him because of his complaints to wyeth management about wyeth inability to implement on schedule a training program at its sanford,north carolina facility,supposing therefore that local employees would likely misrepresent or cover up the deficiencies in progress to internal compliance auditors and to the food and drug administration.the training program was designed to train employees in good manufacturing practices,and its implementation was required by regulations of the food and drug administration.livingston asserted that in making his complaints,he reasonably believed that wyeth potential conduct in misrepresenting or covering up the deficiencies in timely implementation of the program would constitute violations of b of the securities exchange act of and rule promulgated under it,and therefore that his conduct was protected under the act.
the district court entered summary judgment against livingston,concluding that his complaints were not protected activity under the act because livingston could not reasonably have believed that wyeth was violating the securities laws.the court also concluded that wyeth had shown,by clear and convincing evidence,that it had discharged livingston for insubordination in threatening to have the police remove wyeth director of human resources from a holiday party and that wyeth would have discharged livingston regardless of whether he had complained about the progress of the training program.
because we conclude that no objectively reasonable basis existed for livingston to have believed that wyeth was violating the securities laws,we affirm.
on thursday,december,following a brief investigation,mark livingston was discharged from his employment with wyeth as associate director of training and continuous improvement at wyeth sanford,north carolina facility.the parties agree that the precipitating events occurred on the previous friday,december,when livingston held a lunch party for members of the training staff.david mccuaig,the director of human resources at the sanford facility,came to the party without an invitation from livingston,allegedly to wish the group a happy holiday.according to livingston own testimony,livingston approached mccuaig as mccuaig came into the room and asked,what are you doing here you not invited.we have a gift exchange.you have no gift.we have limited food.after some more discussion,livingston then stated,i need you to leave.i asking you to leave.if you do not leave,i going to ask the police escorting holiday traffic downstairs to escort you out.although there is a factual dispute about the manner in which livingston told mccuaig to leave,it is undisputed that he threatened to have the police remove him.wyeth suspended livingston on the following monday,december,pending investigation,and,following a investigation,it terminated his employment.
wyeth contends that this incident was the culmination of a long history of abusive and insubordinate conduct by livingston,about which he had been warned numerous times previously.livingston contends,however,that he was fired in retaliation for complaining about the insufficient progress in implementing a training program to teach employees good manufacturing practices,as required by the food and drug administration fda,and about the potential that wyeth could misrepresent the progress of the program or cover up its true status,in violation of the securities laws.
wyeth,formerly known as american home products corporation,is a publicly traded company that develops pharmaceutical and consumer health products worldwide.its net revenue in was approximately billion.its sanford,north carolina facility is one of more than two dozen at which it develops and manufactures products.
from august to december,mark livingston was employed at the sanford site,first as a manager of training and continuous improvement,and then as associate director of training and continuous improvement.he reported to bruce kaylos,the managing director of the sanford site.during the period of his employment,livingston oversaw audits of training programs at the sanford facility to monitor their progress.the events which form the basis of livingston complaint in this case occurred during july and august.
wyeth manufacturing operations are regulated by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,et,and the fda regulations promulgated thereunder.pharmaceutical products,such as the vaccine components produced at the sanford facility,must be made in accordance with current good manufacturing practice.in addition to specific mandates,such as requiring workers to wear clean clothing during drug production,see id.a,the regulations for good manufacturing practices require that e ach person engaged in the manufacture of a drug product shall have education,training,and experience sufficient to perform the functions assigned to them.id.the regulations do not specify what training is required,how it should be accomplished,or how it must be documented,but rather leave it to each regulated company to create and implement appropriate procedures,subject to fda inspection.if a pharmaceutical product is produced in a facility that does not adhere to good manufacturing practices,including training for good manufacturing practices,the product is legally considered adulterated and is subject to seizure by the fda.see a,a.
precisely for this failure to follow good manufacturing fda seized allegedly adulterated products at wyeth pearl river,new york and marietta,pennsylvania facilities,leading to a consent decree in october,directed at those facilities.while the decree did not apply to any other facility,it did require wyeth to retain an expert consultant to conduct a assessment of its quality control programs at all sites,including the sanford site,and to respond to the expert report,providing the fda with a timetable for its responsive actions.as required,wyeth did retain a consultant and,in may,advised the fda that it would revise its training guidance documents,setting september,as the date by which it would implement training changes and verify compliance with the new program.the fda has never suggested that wyeth ever violated the october consent decree.
wyeth training for good manufacturing practices at the sanford facility required each manufacturing employee to have a curriculum of required training courses and a signed record to document the training.beginning in,these records were to be loaded into an electronic document control system known as isotrain.to transition to the new system,managers needed to be trained on the new system,curricula needed to be drafted,and forms and data for all employees needed to be entered into isotrain.as part of his job responsibilities,livingston was designated to direct and oversee preparations for training system audits at the sanford site between january and september,which were to be conducted to monitor progress.for the period through june,livingston found no problem with the program progress.he advised management on may,that the sanford facility remained on track for the september,implementation date.
wyeth office of compliance scheduled the final internal verification of the new training system for july,two months before september,the date committed to the fda.by july,livingston became convinced that wyeth could not meet this internal verification deadline,and he formally expressed his concerns in a july,memorandum to kaylos and various corporate directors and managers.he stated in the memorandum that several departments of the sanford site 
require additional time to implement the initial components of the wyeth site employee training system.as well,we will need additional time to verify sustainable operation of a compliant training system in these areas.to indicate otherwise provides false and misleading information to outside auditors,including the fda.
kaylos did not receive the memorandum until approximately july,because he was on vacation.but he met with livingston on july to discuss the memorandum.livingston states that at the meeting kaylos threatened to fire him if he persisted in his criticism of the company compliance status and that kaylos implied that livingston should hide or cover up noncompliance issues from the wyeth internal auditor.livingston also acknowledges,however,that a t no time during this meeting,did i claim that kaylos and wyeth were trying to mislead the fda and those involved with the july internal verification audit.
wyeth proceeded with the july internal verification audit,and marlene raschiatore of the wyeth office of compliance,who conducted the audit,found the system to be satisfactory,noting that gaps in training documentation could be addressed in a legacy plan.a legacy plan is the means of closing compliance gaps after the target date for compliance passes.livingston,who had drafted legacy plans in the past and was familiar with them,admits that he signed off on raschiatore verification,but states that he did so on limited terms because,by then,he intended to file an ethics complaint based on the july meeting with kaylos.
on or around july,livingston did file a formal complaint with wyeth office of compliance,in which he stated that he had informed kaylos of his belief that the sanford site was not ready for the planned july internal verification of the training system.as livingston noted,i expressed my concern that if we were to conduct the audit and not fully disclose the status of training system implementation at the site,wyeth would be in the unfortunate position of providing false and misleading information to compliance auditors,including the fda.he further stated that kaylos had mocked and ridiculed his analysis and that t he underlying message from kaylos was are going to conceal facts,data,and information from the verification auditor that would shine negatively on system implementation or operation at sanford.the complaint concluded 
federal law deems it a crime to make any false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement to any government agency,or in making such statement,to conceal any material fact.as i read the wyeth code of conduct,this policy is in place to ensure that information provided to government agencies is truthful,accurate,and complete.
wyeth office of compliance conducted an investigation into livingston complaint,but it found no violations by kaylos or other wyeth employees and closed its file on october.
the sanford facility ultimately met the september,compliance target given to the fda,and the sanford site training system for good manufacturing practices received full verification by the wyeth office of compliance.livingston does not dispute that he signed the verification checklist certifying that the compliance deadline had been met.
on or around october,well after verification of the new training program was complete,the human resources director of the sanford site,david mccuaig,placed livingston on a personal improvement plan pip containing ten expectations.these included the specific requirements that livingston stop making comments,such as saying that the use of approved and verified training practices is defrauding the fda,and that he r efrain from making negative and insulting comments regarding the practices of other departments.the pip stated that f ailure to show immediate,significant and sustained improvement within the next days will result in termination.livingston refused to sign the pip.
the october pip was not the first livingston had with the human resources department.in and,the human resources office had received numerous complaints from wyeth employees about livingston use of abusive language and inappropriate behavior.in may,livingston was formally warned for the use of foul and abusive language and unprofessional behavior toward subordinates.livingston does not dispute that a number of employees asked for transfers or resigned as a result of his conduct.
tension between livingston and kaylos and mccuaig continued to grow after the october pip,with livingston becoming increasingly suspicious that he was about to be terminated.livingston states that mccuaig stalked him at staff meetings and generally acted in a way that led livingston to believe that he would be fired in front of his team members.
the situation came to a head on friday,december,at the wyeth holiday party,when livingston excluded mccuaig from the room in front of company employees.wyeth in turn suspended livingston the following monday,december,pending investigation of the incident,and formally terminated him on december.
livingston filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint with the secretary of labor on january.the secretary issued preliminary findings against livingston on june,but did not issue a final decision within days,thus permitting a district court to obtain jurisdiction over the claim.livingston commenced this action on september,naming wyeth,kaylos,and mccuaig as defendants.he alleged that the defendants hereinafter collectively,wyeth violated,by taking adverse employment action against him in retaliation for expressing concerns about training at the sanford facility,and violated north carolina common law for wrongful discharge.
after the parties conducted discovery,the district court granted wyeth motion for summary judgment,dismissing all counts of the complaint.livingston wyeth,wl at july.the court concluded that t here was nothing in the in livingston that wyeth made false or misleading statements,or omitted relevant information,in any documents provided to its shareholders.id.at.nor was there an objectively reasonable basis,at the time of the allegedly protected activity,for livingston to equate the perceived training deficiencies with imminent wrongdoing t he record is insufficient to support a finding that wyeth appeared to be ready to commit wrongdoing.id.in addition,the court concluded that any wrongdoing hypothesized by livingston would,in any event,not have resulted in a material loss to wyeth,requiring the loss to be reported publicly.id.finally,the court found as a matter of law that wyeth had established by clear and convincing evidence that a rationale independently caused livingston termination.id.at.the court observed 
plaintiff,acting in front of subordinate employees,threatened to have a superior official removed from an office party by police officers who were nearby.such an act of insubordination and insolence without question called for and supported plaintiff immediate termination,and plaintiff was in fact suspended immediately and fired within six days on the basis of his actions at the holiday party.
id.consistent with these conclusions,the court also concluded that essential elements of livingston wrongful discharge claim under north carolina law were lacking.id.at.
livingston appeals the district court judgment,dated july,challenging each of the reasons given by the district court for granting wyeth motion for summary judgment.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of wyeth de novo.see holland washington homes,cir.
to address livingston claim,the factual essence of his claim must first be articulated.
livingston rests his claim of retaliation on his complaints about wyeth training program at the sanford facility,principally communicated through two memoranda dated july and july,but also through related oral conversations.in the july memorandum,livingston complained to management about serious deficiencies in the implementation of the training program for good manufacturing practices,observing that deadlines for completion of the training program were in jeopardy.he said,we will need additional time to verify sustainable operation of a compliant training system in these areas.to indicate otherwise provides false and misleading information to outside auditors,including the fda.in the july memorandum,which he submitted as a formal complaint in furtherance of his obligations as associate director of training,he repeated that the sanford facility was not ready for the planned july internal audit to verify the necessary progress of the training program and to ensure that the september deadline would be achieved.he warned that if we were to conduct the audit and not fully disclose the status of training system implementation at sanford,wyeth would be in the unfortunate position of providing false and misleading information to compliance auditors,including the fda.he added the admonition,federal law deems it a crime to make any false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement to any government agency,or in making such statement,to conceal any material fact.
at no time did livingston complain that wyeth had in fact made a false statement to any government agency or to stockholders.and,as it turned out,livingston fears went unrealized.he signed off on the internal verification audit that took place from july to august,and on the implementation of the whole training program,which was completed by september,as committed,albeit with an agenda under a legacy plan to fill gaps.nonetheless,in this action livingston claims that his complaints to management were a contributing factor to his firing on december,and accordingly that wyeth violated the whistleblowing provisions of the act insofar as it protects employees who make complaints about violations of b of the securities exchange act of,and rule promulgated under it.
section of the act of,stat,added to title of the united states code,providing whistleblower protection for employees of companies by prohibiting their employers from retaliating against them for providing information or cooperating in investigations related to violations of specified laws,including prohibiting securities fraud and rule of the sec prohibiting the same,as well as any other provision of federal law relating to a company fraud against shareholders.section provides,as relevant 
no company,or any officer or employee of such company,may discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the employee 
to provide information regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of section mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,or securities fraud,any rule or regulation of the securities and exchange commission,or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders,when the information or assistance is provided to 
c a person with supervisory authority over the employee or such other person working for the employer who has the authority to investigate,discover,or terminate misconduct.
a emphasis added.the burdens of proof for establishing a claim under a are incorporated from the whistleblower protection program of the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,a,stat,codified at.see b c providing that the retaliation claim under shall be governed by the legal burdens of proof set forth in b.section b,in turn,provides with respect to the burdens of proof that the plaintiff bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.b b.if the plaintiff carries his burden,the employer may nonetheless defeat the plaintiff claim for relief by showing by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of the protected activity.id.
thus,for livingston to establish a cause of action under,he must show,in the context of this case,by a preponderance of the evidence that he provided information or a complaint to a wyeth supervisor or to one authorized to investigate and correct misconduct the information or complaint regarded conduct that he reasonably believed constituted a violation of an enumerated statute or any regulation promulgated by the securities and exchange commission relating to fraud his employer discharged him or took other unfavorable personnel action against him and his providing the information or making the complaint was a contributing factor to his discharge or other adverse employment action taken by wyeth.
to reasonably believe that company conduct constitutes a violation of law,as those terms are used in a,livingston must show not only that he believed that the conduct constituted a violation,but also that a reasonable person in his position would have believed that the conduct constituted a violation.it would make no sense to allow livingston to proceed if he himself did not hold the belief required by the statute,and the language of the statute itself requires that the belief be a reasonable one.a.thus,requires both a subjective belief and an objectively reasonable belief that the company conduct constitutes a violation of the relevant law.
moreover,the statute requires livingston to have held a reasonable belief about an existing violation,inasmuch as the violation requirement is stated in the present tense a plaintiff complaint must be regarding any conduct which he reasonably believes constitutes a violation of the relevant laws.a emphasis added.in an analogous context,we have construed the reasonable belief of a violation to allow for a reasonable belief that the violation not only has happened but also is in progress.jordan alternative resources,cir construing the retaliation provision in title vii,a,cert.denied,d.as we amplified in jordan,the employee must have an objectively reasonable belief that a violation is actually occurring based on circumstances that the employee observes and reasonably believes.id.at.we rejected the claim,however,that a reasonable belief that a violation has occurred or is in progress can include a belief that a violation is about to happen upon some future contingency.see id.at 
once livingston establishes his cause of action,wyeth can nonetheless defeat his claim for relief if it shows,by clear and convincing evidence,that it would have taken the adverse employment action against him even in the absence of his providing the information or making the complaint.see b b iv.
in this case,the district court concluded that livingston failed to establish element of his cause of his complaint regarded company conduct that he reasonably believed constituted a violation of b of the securities exchange act and rule under that wyeth would have discharged livingston even in the absence of livingston having provided the information or made a complaint.
addressing livingston failure to establish element,we conclude that livingston failed at several of the suppositional levels assumed by him to satisfy that element in the circumstances of this case.livingston himself recognizes the speculative reasoning on which he must rely.as he asserts in his brief on appeal 
all that livingston needs to show in order for his complaints and disclosure to enjoy protected activity status under is a reasonable belief that wyeth was violating any rule or regulation of the sec,or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.
pointing to the july and july,memoranda,he states that the core of his complaints about violations of law was that 
wyeth was intentionally concealing the same type of fda good manufacturing practices violations that resulted in the consent decree of october,covering two sites in pennsylvania and new york and this noncompliance would violate the consent decree and good manufacturing practices violations.concealing consent decree and good manufacturing practices compliance violations,after having told the sec and shareholders in its and annual reports and filings that wyeth was compliant with good manufacturing practices and consent decree requirements constituted a violation or apparent violation of section b of the exchange act and rule.
in reaching this conclusion,however,livingston has failed to detail numerous critical steps that he must,but can not satisfy.
first,as of the date of the july,memorandum,and indeed as of anytime,livingston failed to show that wyeth misrepresented or concealed anything,and the july memorandum did not complain of any misrepresentation or concealment.it expressed a concern that if we were to conduct the audit and not fully disclose the status of training system implementation at sanford,wyeth would be in the unfortunate position of providing false and misleading information to compliance auditors,including the fda.emphasis added.livingston july memorandum did draw the conclusion that he perceived kaylos implicit message in their july meeting to be that facts and data would be covered up from the wyeth internal auditor and the fda.yet,the record is devoid of evidence that any wyeth employee thereafter manifested even an intent to misrepresent facts or conceal any wrongdoing concerning training documentation.to the contrary,livingston stated under oath that a t no time during this july meeting,did i claim that kaylos and wyeth were trying to mislead the fda and those involved with the july verification.furthermore,he informed the wyeth investigators who responded to his july ethics complaint that he did not believe that anyone at the site would intentionally provide false statements,and a copy of the results of this investigation was actually provided to the wyeth internal auditor who conducted the july inspection of the sanford facility,negating any possibility that livingston concerns could be covered up from the auditor.in addition,in order to anticipate a misrepresentation to the fda,he would have to assume that the new training documentation system would not actually be implemented by the september commitment date that wyeth would fail to develop an acceptable legacy plan to afford it additional time to close any remaining compliance gaps and that wyeth would then misrepresent or conceal the true status of the program.this chain of speculation is simply too long to support a claim that wyeth in fact covered up anything and made misrepresentations to the fda or was in the process of doing so,as is required to support a violation of the securities laws.
second,just as the hypothetical misrepresentations of the program progress never occurred,so also no violation of the consent decree occurred.that decree,issued with respect to two plants in pennsylvania and new york,was and did not cover the sanford facility.the only way in which activities of the sanford site could be implicated by the decree was the decree requirement that wyeth retain an expert consultant to undertake a assessment of wyeth quality control programs and to submit proposed responsive actions to the fda,along with a timetable for completing those actions.but wyeth concededly did those things.it retained an expert,and in response to the expert evaluation of the sanford facility procedures,it committed to implementing a new training program for good manufacturing practices at the sanford site by september.thus,during the summer of,when the training system implementation was in progress,there was no objectively reasonable basis from which to conclude that the consent decree had been or was being violated.
third,there is no suggestion in either the july or july memorandum that wyeth or its employees had or even intended to mislead shareholders,as necessary to support a reasonable belief that the securities laws had been or were being violated.the annual reports for and,indicating that wyeth was compliant with good manufacturing practices,was never shown to be false or misleading when made,and there is no indication in the record that wyeth intended to make false or misleading statements about its manufacturing practices in the annual report that would come out in the spring of.in addition,to convert a hypothesized and misrepresentation with respect to the progress of the training program at the sanford site into a securities fraud violation would require even larger leaps of speculation than livingston took in supposing misrepresentations to internal auditors and the fda.in order to justify his belief that wyeth committed securities fraud,livingston would have to have reasonably believed that wyeth made a material misrepresentation or omission with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of a security on which the seller or purchaser reasonably relied,causing economic loss.see dura,broudo,d miller asensio,cir.while wyeth did state in its public reports for and that it was compliant with the consent decree covering its pennsylvania and new york sites and not its sanford,north carolina site,there is no evidence that that statement was false or misleading.and there was no statement,false or otherwise,about wyeth training program implementation at the sanford site.indeed,livingston own observations indicate that no finding that wyeth made a false or misleading statement would be possible,inasmuch as livingston acknowledged that he never complained that kaylos and wyeth were trying to mislead the fda and those involved with the july verification and that he did not believe that anyone at the sanford site would intentionally provide false statements.nor was there any actual deficiency in implementing the training program that could be misrepresented or concealed.none of the fears expressed by livingston in his july and july memoranda about false or misleading statements ever materialized.thus,even though his claim requires that he have complained about what he believed as a past violation or one in progress,he can not even point to evidence indicating that wyeth intended to make false or misleading statements in any statement or report to shareholders.the chain of speculation,in light of a record totally devoid of any wyeth wrongdoing at the sanford site,is simply too weak on which to hang even a postulated violation of the securities laws.livingston,therefore,could not have reasonably believed that wyeth had violated or was violating the securities laws.
fourth,even if wyeth had made the false statements to compliance auditors and the fda that livingston supposed could be made,none would amount to a material statement as necessary to violate b of the securities exchange act and rule.for a statement or omission to be actionable under b of the securities exchange act and rule,it must concern a material fact.the supreme court has noted that to fulfill the materiality requirement,there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic,levinson,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,for deficiencies in the training program schedule to have had a material impact on wyeth finances,there must have been some realistic possibility that the fda would take regulatory action against wyeth having material financial consequences to a reasonable investor.it is undisputed,however,that the fda never issued any warning or made any observation regarding wyeth training schedule deficiencies at the sanford site during the period when livingston made his complaint.
furthermore,at the time of livingston alleged protected activity,wyeth was developing pharmaceuticals at over two dozen facilities worldwide and had revenues of over billion.the sanford site alone had different quality elements defined by its good manufacturing practices manual,of which the training about which livingston complained was only one element.livingston has not demonstrated why wyeth would be obligated to report to investors as material any deficiencies in the training documentation procedures at a single why he could reasonably believe that they must do when the fda was aware that wyeth was taking steps to improve that procedure and before the fda had in any way indicated it would take action,or even threatened such action.see acito imcera group,cir noting that failure to disclose negative results of fda inspections of two plants was not material where defendant operated over plants,the fda had taken no materially adverse action,and the defendant had committed to correct plant deficiencies.
in sum,not one link in livingston imaginary chain of horribles was real or was in the process of becoming real.the only fact about which livingston ever complained was the fact that the training system for good manufacturing practices was off schedule.and based on this one fact,he made a judgment that the program would not likely be ready for verification by internal compliance auditors on july and would not be completed by september.even this predictive judgment,however,proved to be wrong.
thus,livingston has failed to produce evidence that he provided information or made a complaint to wyeth about conduct which a reasonable employee in his position could have believed at the time constituted a violation of the securities laws.and because we affirm the district court with respect to this element,we need not reach the other conclusions of the district court challenged by livingston.
livingston also contends that the district court erred in concluding that he had not established a claim for wrongful discharge under north carolina common law.on appeal,however,livingston entire argument is contained in a single sentence in his opening brief because the district court findings of fact leading to dismissal of the federal claim are also the factual basis for dismissing the wrongful discharge claim,the latter dismissal was also in error.
we agree with the district court that livingston state law claim is unsupported in the record.he has presented no evidence that he was discharged on december,for refusing to violate the law or that he was fired for reporting the violation of a law expressing the public policy of north carolina.
the judgment of the district court is accordingly 
i respectfully dissent from the majority holding that mark livingston can show no set of facts to entitle him to protection under the whistleblower provision of the act of.
the whistleblower protections in respond to 
a culture,supported by law,that discourage s employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not only to the proper authorities but even internally.this corporate code of silence not only hampers investigations,but also creates a climate where ongoing wrongdoing can occur with virtual impunity.the consequences of this corporate code of silence for investors in publicly traded companies,in particular,and for the stock market,in general,are serious and adverse,and they must be remedied.
at.section was enacted to provide such a remedy.in short,serves to encourage and protect employees who report fraudulent activity that can damage innocent investors in publicly traded companies.id.at.
to gain the protection of,an employee only has to show that he alerted his publicly traded employer to activity that he reasonably believed constituted a violation of an enumerated law,such as the violation of a provision relating to fraud against shareholders.livingston meets this standard when the facts are read in his favor,as is required at the summary judgment stage.while working at wyeth,wyeth,a pharmaceutical manufacturer,livingston formed a reasonable belief that wyeth was intentionally failing to comply with a consent decree that arose out of regulatory action against wyeth by the food and drug administration fda.the consent decree compelled compliance with fda regulations requiring good manufacturing practices aimed at ensuring product safety.when livingston stated his concerns to his superiors,he was told that he would be fired unless he retracted his statements and stopped all reports of at the facility where he worked.he then made an internal complaint to the company offices that deal with ethics and regulatory compliance,stating that he was concerned about the effect wyeth would have on shareholders.wyeth then fired him.because these facts are sufficient to require a trial on livingston claim,i would reverse the grant of summary judgment to wyeth.because the majority affirms the summary judgment by construing the facts in favor of wyeth the,i respectfully dissent.
in reviewing the award of summary judgment to wyeth,the majority has failed to state the facts in the light most favorable to livingston.see anderson liberty lobby,d stating that t he evidence of the is to be believed in summary judgment proceedings.the facts,stated in that light,are as follows.
on october,wyeth became subject to a consent decree arising out of the fda seizure of allegedly adulterated products from two wyeth facilities.the consent decree was entered in a forfeiture action in which the fda asserted that the seized products were adulterated under the food,drug,and cosmetic act,a b,because certain wyeth facilities had failed to comply with federally mandated good manufacturing practices gmps.according to fda regulations,gmps require proper training of all persons engaged in manufacturing drugs.the regulations specify that each employee must be trained in the pertinent gmps and in the employee particular job functions.id.a.training must be conducted by qualified individuals on a continuing basis.id.this training is essential to provide assurance that every drug product has the safety,identity,strength,quality,and purity that it purports or is represented to possess.id.b.
the consent decree imposed binding requirements on all wyeth facilities in its drug manufacturing division,including the facility in sanford,north carolina.the consent decree ordered wyeth to hire an independent auditor to conduct a assessment of the company quality control and compliance with gmps.thereafter,wyeth was required to submit a plan with a timetable for the correction of deficiencies to the fda,obtain fda approval of the plan,and comply with the timetable.the timetable adopted under the consent decree could not be altered without written authorization by the fda.
in keeping with industry practice of reporting gmp compliance to shareholders,wyeth represented in its and annual reports that it was complying with the consent decree.the annual report also stated that the company was making an investment of million to support our number one operating make sure that our manufacturing and operations maintain high quality standards.the statement about this investment also mentioned the consent decree and noted that wyeth was independently strengthening sustainable compliance.id.
when the consent decree was entered in october,livingston was the manager for training and continuous improvement at the sanford site.he was responsible for gmp compliance and implementation of the gmp training system.in april wyeth apparently pleased with his work promoted livingston to the position of associate director of training and continuous improvement.he continued to be responsible for gmp compliance.
in november the independent auditor retained pursuant to the consent decree reported that sanford was not complying with legally mandated gmp requirements.the auditor listed specific deficiencies related to training,including the following many employees were manufacturing drugs with no training whatsoever,managers were not trained,the individuals conducting training were not properly trained themselves,and training was not assessed for its effectiveness.in response to the audit report,wyeth proposed september,to the fda as the date by which the company would finish implementation and verification of gmp training compliance.the fda apparently approved this deadline,and there is no evidence that wyeth ever sought or was granted an extension.
over the course of the two years leading up to the consent decree deadline for gmp training compliance,wyeth sanford site made little headway on the subject.wyeth set several internal deadlines november was the first to achieve compliance before the consent decree date,but internal audits showed that the company dismally failed to meet each deadline.sanford management pushed the november deadline first to february,then to april,then to july,and finally to the actual september consent decree date that wyeth also failed to meet at sanford.while some of these deadlines were revised,others were met through the use of legacy plans.a legacy plan is a term used at sanford to describe an internal document that provides a time line for remedying after a planned compliance date is missed.
livingston faced stiff resistance from department directors as he attempted to remedy the serious noncompliance with training gmps identified by the independent auditor and periodic internal audits.this resistance persisted despite livingston ongoing and increasingly urgent reports of compliance failures for example,in november a vaccine development director informed him that she refused to implement the compliance requirements for training in her department.in december,in response to livingston report of compliance gaps at a meeting of the site quality council the group responsible for internally monitoring compliance at sanford,two members of the council verbally assaulted livingston and refused support for the training plan.in early march livingston reported at a staff meeting that attendance at training for sanford directors had been abysmal.the directors nevertheless continued to avoid their training obligations.livingston made similar reports in april and early may,and he was informed by sanford management that no information regarding sanford compliance failures would be shared outside the sanford site.
as the official fda compliance date of september,approached,livingston reports became more urgent.the district court explained the state of documented training at the sanford facility in the summer of was so abysmal that it mirrored the conditions in pearl river,new york and in marietta,pennsylvania that prompted entry of the consent decree.convinced that sanford would be unable to meet the compliance deadline,livingston requested a meeting with the site quality council.on july,bruce kaylos,the sanford site director,angrily informed him that he would not be allowed to discuss the compliance issue with the council.
after being blocked from meeting with the site quality council about the imminent compliance failure,livingston shared his evaluation with kaylos and the council in a memo dated july.he concluded,i do not support the request for sustainable compliance initiative verification or attest to our state of compliance to corporate,site,and regulatory gmp training requirements.the following day,july,kaylos met with human resources to discuss putting livingston on a personal improvement plan pip,a wyeth personnel action threatening termination.kaylos then left a telephone message for livingston at his home on july and had his assistant telephone livingston at work on july.livingston attempted to respond to these messages,but he was not able to speak with kaylos.livingston understood the telephone messages of july and to indicate that kaylos had received the july memo on july,kaylos met with livingston to discuss the memo.according to kaylos notes of this meeting,livingston told him that the site and i kaylos were trying to mislead fda and corporate audit groups into believing that training was compliant.as he had done previously,kaylos instructed livingston not to report noncompliance to wyeth corporate headquarters.kaylos also threatened to fire or demote livingston if he continued to report sanford failure to comply with training gmps.that same day,in response to his meeting with livingston,kaylos again contacted human resources to discuss the creation of a pip threatening livingston termination.
the final internal audit prior to the fda compliance date revealed that sanford continued to violate gmp requirements,and it noted that wyeth would have to adopt yet another legacy plan to address these problems.despite the majority assertion to the contrary,there is no evidence that the auditor verified compliance at this time or that livingston signed off on any verification.ante at.
around july livingston submitted a complaint to wyeth office of ethics and business conduct and its office of sustainable compliance compliance office.livingston explained that kaylos had attempted to intimidate him in an effort to prevent his accurate reporting of sanford compliance gaps.livingston concluded,
federal law deems it a crime to make any false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement to any government agency,or in making such statement,to conceal any material fact if we succumb to the pressure of the moment,if we avoid our compliance obligations,if we are unwilling to do the right thing,or if we purposefully prevent the inner from matching the outer,we fail the ethics test and our code of conduct becomes another empty promise for employees,patients,health care providers,regulatory bodies,shareholders,and ourselves.
in response to these allegations,wyeth compliance office opened an investigation and recommended that the pip proposed by kaylos be delayed.an investigator met with livingston,who explained his concerns about gaps in training documentation and the impending release of adulterated vaccine.the investigator report found livingston training compliance concerns to be substantiate d.in particular,the investigator found that sanford supervisors were systematically reporting employees as trained to complete tasks for which they,in fact,lacked training,thus allowing them to manufacture adulterated drugs in violation of.
on september,the fda compliance date,livingston signed two documents a verification checklist indicating that certain aspects of the training were complete and yet another legacy plan to address continued training compliance gaps.there is no evidence that wyeth sought,or that the fda approved,any extension of the deadline.on october wyeth compliance office closed the file on livingston complaint without taking any remedial action.within a week kaylos and david mccuaig,the human resources director,placed livingston on a pip.the pip required,among other things,that livingston i mmediately end comments to internal and external staff and contacts that the establishment and utilization of certain corporately approved and verified training practices is defrauding the fda.if livingston failed to show immediate,significant and sustained improvement within days,he would be terminated.
from october through december livingston became increasingly concerned that he was about to be terminated,based on repeated actions and comments from mccuaig,his placement on a pip with little explanation,and a decision by kaylos to limit his job responsibilities.livingston and mccuaig both reported to kaylos and were equals in the sanford hierarchy.on december,mccuaig appeared at livingston offsite holiday party for his team.mccuaig appearance was an unusual occurrence because each team had its own holiday party,so mccuaig would have been expected only to attend the human resources party.in fact,mccuaig did not attend any team holiday party other than the one held by livingston.using brusque terms,livingston asked mccuaig to leave,and livingston was fired five days later.
livingston claims that wyeth terminated him in violation of.the statute protects employees of publicly traded companies from retaliation for 
provid ing information,caus ing information to be provided,or otherwise assist ing in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of section mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,or securities fraud,any rule or regulation of the securities and exchange commission,or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.
a.i would refine certain aspects of the majority interpretation of the statute.
the majority states that a plaintiff reasonable belief in a violation may not be based on a belief that a violation is about to happen upon some future contingency.ante at citing jordan alternative res,cir.while i agree with this statement,it requires some elaboration.the reasonableness standard in is intended to impose the normal reasonable person standard used and interpreted in a wide variety of legal contexts,at citing passaic valley sewerage comm rs dep t of labor,cir.as the majority recognizes,a similar standard is used in title vii retaliation cases.see ante at see also allen admin.review,cir.under title vii a plaintiff complaining of retaliatory discharge does not have to prove that he believed a violation had already occurred or was complete.see jordan,at citing eeoc navy fed.credit union,cir.instead,he has a claim if he was retaliated against for reporting his reasonable belief that a violation was taking shape,that a plan was in motion to violate the law,or that a violation was likely to occur.id.at.in other words,an employee belief is unreasonable and unprotected if it is based entirely on unsupported conjecture about hypothetical future events his belief must relate to activity that a reasonable person could conclude is or is about to become a violation.id.at.
further,in applying the standard requiring the complainant to have an objectively reasonable belief that his employer is engaged in a violation,the majority consistently focuses on whether the violation did,in fact,occur.an actual violation is not required,however.an employee reasonable belief about a violation is protected even if the belief is mistaken and an actual violation never occurs.allen,at.
finally,the majority states that because th e analysis for determining whether an employee reasonably believes a law is being violated is an objective one,we resolve the question as a matter of law.ante at citing jordan,at.the majority our warrant at the summary judgment stage.jordan simply states that the issue of objective reasonableness may be resolved as a matter of law.jordan,at emphasis added.the issue of objective reasonableness should be decided as a matter of law only when n o reasonable person could have believed that the facts amounted to a violation.clark county sch.dist.breeden,d per curiam.however,if reasonable minds could disagree about whether the employee belief was objectively reasonable,the issue can not be decided as a matter of law.allen,at citing lipphardt durango steakhouse of brandon,cir fine ryan int l airlines,cir.
livingston contends that he believed wyeth was intentionally misleading shareholders about its noncompliance with federal gmp regulations and the consent decree,in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and securities and exchange commission rule.to avoid summary judgment on his whistleblower claim asserted under,livingston must proffer evidence that his whistleblower complaints implicated shareholder fraud by wyeth he subjectively believed that wyeth was violating b and rule,that a plan was in motion to violate these laws,or that a violation was likely and his belief was objectively reasonable.see ante at.for his belief in a b and rule violation to be objectively reasonable,he must show that a person in his position would have believed that wyeth made a material misrepresentation or omission,with a wrongful state of mind,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,and that a seller or purchaser would have reasonably relied on the representation or omission,with resulting economic loss.dura,broudo,d citations omitted.the majority holds that livingston has not offered evidence that would create a genuine issue of fact about the elements of his claim.to reach its result,the majority places an improperly high burden on livingston and fails to recognize fully the strength and breadth of the factual case he has offered.
first,livingston whistleblower complaints implicated a violation of b and rule.he was not required to specifically cite these provisions.he simply had to provide information regarding any conduct that he believed constituted a violation.livingston satisfied this burden by repeatedly reporting to wyeth his concern that fda regulations were certain to be violated,that violations were being covered up,and that,as a result,shareholders were being impacted adversely.as kaylos notes of his july,meeting with livingston reveal,and the october pip confirms,livingston informed kaylos in person that he believed that the sanford site and kaylos were involved in fraud on the fda.then,in his july complaint to wyeth compliance office,livingston again reported that sanford was failing to comply with federal gmp requirements and that kaylos had instructed him to misrepresent the state of sanford compliance.specifically,livingston reported that kaylos attempt ed to shame me to retract the analysis and position,imparted the message that we are going to conceal facts,data,and information from the verification auditor,and threatened to fire livingston if he persisted in raising the awareness level of this issue up the.livingston was convinced that kaylos behavior in the july meeting violate d wyeth code of conduct,and explained why in his complaint to the compliance office 
federal law deems it a crime to make any false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement to any government agency,or in making such statement,to conceal any material fact.as i read the wyeth code of conduct,this policy is in place to ensure that information provided to government agencies is truthful,accurate,and complete.
wyeth code of conduct explicitly instructed employees to avoid false reporting to government agencies and to accurate ly and complete ly and fairly present information in its disclosures to shareholders.livingston concluded his complaint by asserting that avoid ing our compliance obligations,as kaylos had suggested,would fail the ethics test and our code of conduct,which would then amount to another empty promise for,among others,shareholders.in short,livingston asserted that wyeth was covering up its noncompliance with gmp requirements and the consent decree,thus failing to keep its commitment to shareholders.
the majority argues that livingston did not complain of any misrepresentation or concealment,ante at,and presumably therefore did not communicate information regarding shareholder fraud.in support of this conclusion,the majority reads the facts in the light most favorable to wyeth,not livingston as is required.the majority first cites livingston use of conditional language in a background paragraph in his july complaint.the conditional language,however,referred to livingston earlier july memo to kaylos,the site quality council,and others,urging full disclosure of problems in the upcoming internal audit of training compliance.see livingston stating in his july complaint that in his july memo he expressed his concern that if we were to conduct the audit and not fully disclose the status of training implementation at sanford,wyeth would be in the unfortunate position of providing false and misleading information to compliance auditors,including the fda.there is nothing conditional,however,in livingston report in his july complaint detailing kaylos response to the july memo.livingston provides an unequivocal report that kaylos,the site director,threatened retaliation if livingston refused to join in the plan to wyeth failure to comply with federal law.the majority next concludes that livingston told investigators that he did not believe that anyone at the site would intentionally provide false statements.ante at.this quote is taken from the investigator letter,not livingston.livingston,in fact,definitively stated under oath that i did not tell ed babiaz the investigator that i did not believe anyone would intentionally provide false or misleading statements.emphasis added.livingston affidavit thus directly contradicts the majority conclusion.the majority also notes that livingston says in his affidavit that he did not mention fraud in his july meeting with kaylos.ante at.nevertheless,it is uncontested that livingston july complaint informed wyeth that he had been instructed to misrepresent facts about compliance.in addition,both kaylos notes from the july meeting and the october pip confirm that livingston was alleging fraud.
livingston thus meets the first requirement for whistleblower protection because the clear text of his july complaint communicates a concern about fraud on shareholders.livingston assertions also provide evidence to satisfy the second and third requirements for protection he believed wyeth was committing securities fraud and this belief was objectively reasonable.
in particular,livingston has provided sufficient evidence to establish that he had a reasonable belief that wyeth was violating rule.first,livingston reasonably believed that wyeth was making and would continue to make material misrepresentations or omit material facts in reports to shareholders.wyeth stated in its and annual reports that it was complying with the consent decree and that gmp compliance was its highest priorit y.at the time of these representations,wyeth was not planning to comply with the consent decree,nor was
