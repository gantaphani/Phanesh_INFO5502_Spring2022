licensed pharmacists and three corporations that own and operate pharmacies in a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court of sangamon county against various illinois public officials and the state board of pharmacy,seeking to invalidate an administrative rule that forces pharmacies to dispense plan b contraception also known as the pill or emergency contraception.the rule provided that a pharmacy must dispense the contraceptive without delay upon receipt of a valid prescription.if the item is not in stock,the pharmacy must order it if the patient requests that it do so.j.the plaintiffs amended complaint alleged,inter alia,violations of the illinois health care right of conscience act conscience act or act ilcs et west and the illinois religious freedom restoration act religious freedom act ilcs et west,as well as a claim that the rule was unconstitutional on its face and as applied because it violated the first amendment of the united states constitution.plaintiffs alleged that the rule contravenes their moral and religious beliefs because they believe that life begins at conception and that plan b can act as an abortifacient.
the circuit court dismissed the complaint with prejudice on grounds of standing,ripeness,and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.a divided appellate court affirmed.d.we granted plaintiffs petition for leave to appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
according to the amended complaint,plaintiffs luke vander bleek and glen kosirog are licensed pharmacists who own and control a number of division i pharmacies.a division i pharmacy is a pharmacy that engages in general community pharmacy practice and that is open to,or offers pharmacy services to,the general public.vander bleek resides in morrison,illinois,and is owner of the fitzgerald pharmacy and the sole shareholder of,the corporation that controls the fitzgerald pharmacy.the fitzgerald pharmacy has two locations,one in prophetstown,illinois,and the other in morrison.additionally,vander bleek is the majority shareholder of doyle,which does business as the eggleston pharmacy,with locations in sycamore,illinois,and genoa,illinois.vander bleek is the chief pharmacist at his morrison location.
the amended complaint further alleges that vander bleek is the third of children and a lifelong catholic.he graduated from the university of illinois in with a bachelor of science degree in pharmacy,concentrated in medical chemistry and drug design.he has formed a professional opinion about teratogenic or abortifacient drugs and their destruction of what he considers is human life,and he believes that plan b has an abortifacient mechanism of action.through prayerful reflection and consideration as a practicing catholic,he has informed his beliefs and conscience on which he relies to hold that life begins at conception.he therefore does not believe that his convictions allow him to dispense plan b.he also does not believe that the pharmacies he controls can cooperate in the sale or dispensing of drugs like plan b and therefore conscientiously objects on behalf of his corporation.over the past several years,he has affirmed his company policy of not dispensing drugs with abortifacient qualities when his pharmacies were presented with prescriptions for such drugs.specifically,his company written policy is that in the event that a prescription for emergency contraception is presented,the pharmacist on duty is to immediately return the prescription to the patient.he is then to communicate in a confidential environment,without lecturing about morality,that company policy does not allow the pharmacy to procure,stock or dispense the product.
according to the amended complaint,plaintiff kosirog resides in wheaton,illinois,and is the sole shareholder of kosirog pharmacy,which does business as kosirog rexall pharmacy in cook county.kosirog is a lifelong christian and has five children,one with down syndrome.he graduated from the university of wyoming in,earning a bachelor of science degree in pharmacy.he has formed a professional opinion about teratogenic or abortifacient drugs and their destruction of what he considers is human life.he believes that plan b has an abortifacient mechanism of action,it can cause abortions by preventing an already fertilized egg from implanting in the womb.based on kosirog conscience and belief,his pharmacy forbids the sale or dispensing of drugs suspected to have teratogenic or abortifacient qualities,such as plan b.in specific instances over the past few years when presented with prescriptions for such drugs,kosirog,on behalf of his pharmacy,has affirmed the aforementioned policy not to dispense such drugs.
on april,the governor filed an emergency rule that amended section of title of the illinois administrative code.the emergency amendment became permanent in the form of an administrative rule hereinafter the rule or subsection j on august,and states in relevant part as follows 
j duty of division i pharmacy to dispense contraceptives 
upon receipt of a valid,lawful prescription for a contraceptive,a pharmacy must dispense the contraceptive to the patient or the patient agent without delay,consistent with the normal timeframe for filling any other prescription.if the contraceptive is not in stock,the pharmacy must obtain the contraceptive under the pharmacy standard procedures for ordering contraceptive drugs not in stock,including the procedures of any entity that is affiliated with,owns,or franchises the pharmacy.however,if the patient prefers,the prescription must be transferred to a local pharmacy of the patient choice under the pharmacy standard procedures for transferring prescriptions for contraceptive drugs,including the procedures of any entity that is affiliated with,owns,or franchises the pharmacy.under any circumstances an unfilled prescription for contraceptive drugs must be returned to the patient if the patient so directs.
for purposes of this subsection j,the term contraceptive shall refer to all drugs or devices that prevent pregnancy.j,j.
plan b and the pill fall within the rule definition of contraceptives.on october,plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint seeking a declaration that the rule is invalid.plaintiffs also sought an injunction against the rule enforcement.named defendants in the suit included rod blagojevich,the governor of the state of illinois,fernando grillo,then the secretary of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation department,daniel bluthardt,then the acting director of the department division of professional regulation division,and the state board of pharmacy 
with respect to the language of the rule,plaintiffs amended complaint states that by demanding that division i pharmacies fill any prescription for contraceptives,including the pill and plan b,the rule requires the plaintiffs to act against the collective conscience of their corporate control group and against the policies of their pharmacies.plaintiffs allege that both the emergency rule and the permanent rule were enacted for the purpose of compelling religious and conscientious objectors to fill plan b contraceptive prescriptions despite those objections.plaintiffs allege that when the emergency rule was promulgated on april,the governor publicly warned that illinois pharmacists who violate the rule face significant penalties,ranging from fines to the loss of professional licenses.then,on april,the governor issued a press release indicating that he will vigorously defend the emergency rule requiring pharmacists to sell and fill prescriptions for contraceptives without delay.the governor further warned on that same date as follows 
if a pharmacy wants to be in the business of dispensing contraceptives,then it must fill prescriptions without making moral judgments.everyone free to hold personal religious beliefs,but pharmacies are not free to let those beliefs stand in the way of their obligation to their customers.press release of governor blagojevich,april,
plaintiffs complaint also alleges that as early as september,than a month after the rule became initiated proceedings against pharmacies alleged to have violated the rule and emphasized that they were vigorously enforcing the rule.see illinois department of financial and professional regulation press release,september.furthermore,defendants have issued an additional rule requiring all division i pharmacies to prominently display a notice advising customers of the rule and inviting them to file complaints against refusing pharmacists with the department through its website.k,k.
plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on september.the trial court denied the motion after a hearing,finding that plaintiffs have another adequate remedy at law and are not likely to be successful on the merits due to standing and ripeness issues.on october,plaintiffs filed their amended complaint,along with a motion for a temporary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the rule.on that same day,defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.in their motion,defendants argued,among other things,that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge subsection j and failed to exhaust their administrative remedies because they did not wait to be sued and disciplined by the department before resorting to a declaratory judgment action in circuit court.following a hearing,the circuit court granted defendants motion to dismiss.the docket entry for november,showed that the court rule d in favor of defendants granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice on the grounds of lack of standing,ripeness,and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
in december plaintiffs timely filed their notice of appeal,arguing,inter alia,that they had standing to bring their claim and they were not required to exhaust administrative remedies.in august,prior to the filing of the appellate court opinion in this case,the united states food and drug administration fda approved plan b contraceptives for,nonprescription sale to women and older.the drug remains available as a prescription drug for women and under.subsection j applies only to prescriptions for contraceptives and not to sales.
in march,a divided appellate court affirmed the circuit court dismissal of plaintiffs complaint.d.the majority applied the ripeness standards set forth in abbott laboratories gardner,d,which requires consideration of two factors the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.in applying abbott laboratories,the appellate court recognized that plaintiffs had satisfied the first factor in that the department rule applies to plaintiffs,the state had made clear it intended to enforce the rule,and the issue of whether the rule is facially valid is fit for judicial decision.the majority concluded,however,that plaintiffs claims were not ripe for review based on the second factor of abbott laboratories,finding that plaintiffs chances of suffering future hardship were too slim to outweigh courts traditional reluctance to get involved in administrative determinations.d at.the majority predicted that it is extremely unlikely one of plaintiffs will ever be placed in a position where he will have to violate either his conscience or the letter of the rule.d at.in view of this holding,the appellate court declined to address whether plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.justice turner dissented,asserting that plaintiffs claims were not only ripe,but compelling under both the conscience act and the religious freedom act.d at,turner,dissenting.
plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing in the appellate court.in that petition,plaintiffs noted that the appellate court found that plaintiffs had failed to allege that they have been presented with a prescription for emergency contraception since the rule went into effect d at,and that the court used this as a basis for finding that the rule application to plaintiffs was remote.plaintiffs attached two affidavits to their petition.in the first,vander bleek stated that since the rule went into effect,plaintiffs have been presented with prescriptions for plan b contraception more than times.plaintiffs argued in their petition that these were precisely the occurrences that the court found so extremely unlikely that their lack rendered plaintiffs claims unripe.
vander bleek also alleged in his affidavit that his prophetstown pharmacy had been forced to close because of the chilling effect of the rule.vander bleek explained that the pharmacist who ran the pharmacy at that location moved out of state.a replacement pharmacist ultimately refused to work there because of the possibility that the pharmacy could be prosecuted and lose its license because of its policy against selling contraceptives.no other qualified pharmacist could be found.as a result,the pharmacy was forced to close,resulting in an annual loss of profits of.
additionally,plaintiffs attached an affidavit from kosirog to their petition for rehearing.kosirog affidavit stated that he had been required to spend additional resources recruiting pharmacists and addressing their concerns about the impact of the rule upon his business.
the appellate court majority denied the petition for rehearing over a second dissent from justice turner.we allowed plaintiffs petition for leave to appeal.we further allowed the american association of pro life obstetricians and gynecologists,the christian medical and dental associations,the catholic medical association,physicians for life,and the national association of prolife nurses to file an amicus curiae brief.we also allowed the christian legal society and christian pharmacists fellowship international to file an amicus curiae brief.in addition,we allowed the illinois pharmacists association and the american pharmacists association to file an amicus curiae brief.finally,we allowed the american civil liberties union of illinois to file an amicus curiae brief.
after briefing and oral argument in this court,the department revised subsection j,effective april.the amendment was the result of a settlement in other litigation involving different parties over the legality of the rule.see.reg.may.the amended version of subsection j retains the essential features of the previous version,including the requirements that a pharmacy which sells contraceptives must,when presented with a valid prescription,dispense the contraceptive without delay and if the contraceptive is not in stock,the pharmacy must obtain the contraceptive under the pharmacy standard procedures for ordering contraceptive drugs not in stock.the amended version,however,adds several,more onerous provisions pertaining specifically to emergency contraception.
the amended version now specifically mandates that each retail pharmacy use its best efforts to maintain adequate stock of emergency contraception to the extent that it continues to sell contraception.j amended by.reg,eff.april.it also mandates a new dispensing procedure called remote medication order processing rmop.if a pharmacist objects to dispensing emergency contraception and there is no nonobjecting pharmacist present at this pharmacy,which is deemed by the amendment the dispensing pharmacy,the dispensing pharmacy must still sell the emergency contraceptive through rmop.rmop involves a nonobjecting pharmacist at a different location authorizing the dispensing of the drug by a nonpharmacist employee at the dispensing pharmacy.j a,j b amended by.reg,eff.april.the new amendment further requires that a retail pharmacy must be responsible for ensuring either that there is a pharmacist scheduled at all times the pharmacy is open,or that there is a licensed pharmacist available to perform rmop for emergency contraception at all times the pharmacy is open and no pharmacist is available at the pharmacy.j amended by.reg,eff.april.
before this court,plaintiffs first argue that their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are ripe for judicial review and should not have been dismissed.plaintiffs contend that their preenforcement challenge to the validity of the regulation is justiciable because the very existence of the rule constitutes illegal coercion in violation of the illinois health care right of conscience act and the illinois religious freedom restoration act,as well as the first amendment of the united states constitution.plaintiffs also claim that they have stated a claim that is ripe for resolution absent an enforcement action by the state against are given a right by these two illinois statutes to pursue an affirmative claim.additionally,plaintiffs maintain that they have satisfied the abbott laboratories test for ripeness because the rule has a concrete,negative impact on their operations,and they have therefore shown that sufficient hardship would be caused by withholding court consideration.
defendants argue that plaintiffs claims are unripe because the rule application to plaintiffs is remote.defendants claim that the rule structure makes it a practical plaintiffs obligations to dispense would ever be triggered.relying on the version of the rule in effect prior to the april,amendment,defendants claim that the rule does not require plaintiffs to stock emergency contraception.rather,it requires that if a potential customer presents a prescription,the pharmacy has to order the contraceptive only if the customer requests that the pharmacy order it.according to defendants,this is an unlikely event that tends to show that plaintiffs will not experience the rule impact in a concrete way.additionally,defendants argue that plaintiffs complaint was properly dismissed because they failed to make use of a statutory variance procedure.defendants note that the illinois pharmacy practice act of authorizes the director to grant a variance excusing compliance with an administrative rule promulgated under the authority of the pharmacy act when applying the provision would be unnecessarily burdensome.ilcs a west.in defendants view,plaintiffs failure to seek a variance constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
justiciability 
we first examine whether the requirements of justiciability have been satisfied.concepts of justiciability are divided into different categories,such as advisory opinions,feigned and collusive cases,standing,ripeness,mootness,political questions,and administrative questions.alternate fuels,director of the illinois environmental protection agency.where,as here,justiciability is challenged in a motion to dismiss under section,a court must accept as true all facts in plaintiffs complaint and all inferences that can reasonably be drawn in plaintiffs favor.in re estate of schlenker.moreover,it is well established that a cause of action should not be dismissed with prejudice unless it is clear that no set of facts can be proved under the pleadings which would entitle plaintiffs to relief.smith central illinois regional airport.an order granting a motion to dismiss based on a lack of justiciability presents a question of law,which we review de novo.see doe chicago board of education,schlenker,at.
section of the code of civil procedure sets forth the general requirements for a justiciable declaratory judgment action,as follows 
no action or proceeding is open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby.the court may,in cases of actual controversy,make binding declarations of rights,having the force of final judgments,whether or not consequential relief is or could be claimed,including the determination,at the instance of anyone interested in the controversy,of the construction of any statute or other governmental regulation and a declaration of the rights of the parties interested.the foregoing enumeration does not exclude other cases of actual controversy.the court shall refuse to enter a declaratory judgment or order,if it appears that the judgment or order,would not terminate the controversy or some part thereof,giving rise to the proceeding.ilcs a west.
the declaratory judgment statute must be given a liberal construction and should not be unduly restricted by a technical interpretation.first of america bank,rockford,netsch.this court has recognized that the mere existence of a claim,assertion or challenge to plaintiff legal interests,which cast s doubt,insecurity,and uncertainty upon plaintiff rights or status,damages plaintiff pecuniary or material interests and establishes a condition of justiciability.alternate fuels,at,quoting netsch,at,quoting roberts roberts,d.
a threshold question in any declaratory judgment action is whether the plaintiff has standing.messenger edgar.to establish standing in such a case,there must be an actual controversy between adverse parties,and the party seeking the declaratory judgment must be interested in the controversy.underground contractors ass city of chicago.but here,we are considering justiciability in the context of administrative action,so we must specifically consider ripeness as a component of justiciability.alternate fuels,at.in this setting,the question of standing becomes subsumed in the question of ripeness.this is because the more stringent requirements for ripeness will necessarily establish the less strict demands of standing.thus,if we reverse the appellate court determination on ripeness in this case,we would necessarily reverse the trial court determination on standing.
the basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott laboratories,at.at,d at.in abbott laboratories,the supreme court formulated a inquiry to evaluate ripeness first,courts look at whether the issues are fit for judicial decision and second,they look at any hardship to the parties that would result from withholding judicial consideration.abbott laboratories,at.at,d at.the court held that the plaintiffs in that case,who were various drug companies,could bring a preenforcement challenge to an agency interpretation of a federal statute that would have required the established name of a drug to be used every time the proprietary name is used.the court found that the impact of the regulation was sufficiently direct and immediate so as to render judicial review appropriate because the plaintiffs would have to incur the significant cost of changing all their labels over or else risk criminal and civil penalties for their belief that their current labels were in compliance.abbott laboratories,at.at,d at.
this court specifically adopted the abbott laboratories approach to considering ripeness claims in both alternate fuels,at,and national marine,illinois environmental protection agency.in alternate fuels,this court found that an agency interpretation of a statute was ripe for judicial review where the agency interpretation affected the plaintiff in a concrete way,causing the plaintiff to lose financially.alternate fuels,at.national marine,on the other hand,found that the mere issuance of a notice under section q of the illinois environmental protection act did not make the plaintiff claims ripe where there was no effect on the plaintiff legal rights,as it remained free to deal with its property as it saw fit.national marine,at.
here,we conclude that plaintiffs claims are ripe under the abbott laboratories criteria.with respect to the first factor,the appellate court ruled in favor of plaintiffs,finding that i t is fairly clear the issue of whether the rule is facially valid is fit for a judicial decision.d at.we agree with the appellate court assessment that the issues are fit for judicial decision.the claims raised are essentially legal in the language of the rule violates the constitution and must therefore be declared void,as well as whether the rule violates various illinois and federal statutes see minnesota citizens concerned for life federal election comm n,cir fitness for judicial decision means,most often,that the issue is legal rather than factual.
as to the second factor,we find that sufficient hardship exists so as to make judicial review appropriate.again,we note that defendants argue the version of the rule in effect prior to april.they contend that the rule does not require plaintiffs to stock plan b contraception and therefore does not require plaintiffs to take,or refrain from,any action.defendants further argue that the rule structure makes it unlikely that plaintiffs obligation to dispense would ever be triggered because it is a remote possibility that a customer would ever request plaintiffs to order plan b.we disagree for several reasons.
first,we note that prior to the april amendment,all it would have taken to trigger the rule and subject plaintiffs to the possibility of license revocation was for a customer with a prescription for plan b to say the words order it.in any event,the rule has been changed and in its current form has an even greater concrete and coercive impact on plaintiffs.the rule now expressly requires that plaintiffs must stock and dispense plan b contraception.under the current version,the simple failure by plaintiffs to make efforts to stock the contraceptive in question would subject plaintiffs to a range of penalties,including license revocation.additionally,they must dispense it within their stores through rmop.under these circumstances,application of the rule to plaintiffs can not be considered remote.instead,the rule affects their business operations on a basis and exposes plaintiffs to strong sanctions.this case is thus indistinguishable from abbott laboratories,where the court found that the plaintiffs could not be denied access to the courts under a ripeness theory,stating as follows the regulation is directed at them in particular it requires them to make significant changes in their everyday business practices if they fail to observe the commissioner rule they are quite clearly exposed to the imposition of strong sanctions.abbott laboratories,at.at,d at.
furthermore,we note that it is appropriate for this court to consider the latest version of the rule to inform our ripeness decision.again,we point out that the trial court order granting the motion to dismiss should not be affirmed unless it appears that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts that would entitle them to recovery.moreover,ripeness is decided based on all the information available to the court at the time of the decision intervening events that occur after the decision in the lower courts should be included,just as must be done with questions of mootness.see wright,miller,cooper freer,federal practice procedure supp.see,blanchette connecticut general insurance,d,hargrave vermont,cir buckley valeo,d,per curiam basing ripeness determination on facts occurring s ince the entry of judgment by the court of appeals in re ual,cir describing buckley as a case where dispute was resolved on the merits on appeal,even though the controversy was not ripe at the time the district court acted reno catholic social services,d,it is the situation now rather than at the time of the initial complaints,that must govern,concurring fisch loews cineplex theatres,d,considering new evidence alleged after appellate briefing on issue of mootness city of chicago yellen,d,allowing supplementation of the record to aid the court in deciding personal jurisdiction.
second,we believe that sufficient hardship exists based on plaintiffs affidavits attached to their appellate court petition for rehearing.these affidavits show that plaintiffs have already suffered financial loss because of the rule.vander bleek asserted that he was forced to close one store because of the rule at an annual cost of.kosirog also claimed financial loss due to having to expend additional resources to recruit pharmacists and to address concerns about the rule.these circumstances are similar to the choice the plaintiffs faced in both abbott laboratories and alternate fuels between complying with the regulation at added cost or else continuing on in opposition to the rule and risking the even greater harm of serious penalties.see abbott laboratories,at.at,d at alternate fuels,at.in sum,the rule has affected plaintiffs in a concrete way on a basis,and they can allege that they have lost financially.
finally,we note that the rule contained in subsection j in both the pre and,version,poses harm to the plaintiffs that is even greater than financial loss.plaintiffs allege that the rule chills their first amendment rights.plaintiffs are forced to comply with the rule or else compromise their rights to act according to their consciences and religious tenets.in such a case,courts relax the ripeness requirement of abbott laboratories.see,minnesota citizens concerned for life,at sufficient hardship is usually found if the regulation chills protected first amendment activity.in fact,courts routinely find not just harm,but irreparable harm,where a plaintiff asserts a chill on free exercise rights.see,tenafly eruv ass borough of tenafly,cir stormans,selecky,d,finding the first amendment claims of pharmacists and pharmacies were ripe and granting a preliminary injunction because of the likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury.
here,plaintiffs complaint raises a first amendment claim.specifically,they allege that the rule substantially burdens their free exercise of religion,is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest,and is not the least restrictive means of serving any alleged governmental interest.plaintiffs also assert that the purpose and object of the rule is to coerce conscientious and religious objectors to fill plan b prescriptions despite their objections.
courts have specifically found that pharmacists and pharmacies in similar cases involving state regulation requiring the dispensing of plan b contraception have sufficiently stated causes of action that could be considered by the judiciary.see stormans,selecky,d found that plaintiffs claims were ripe where plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a first amendment claim menges blagojevich,d court denied defendants motion to dismiss and directed them to answer complaint that sufficiently alleged a first amendment violation.accordingly,we find that plaintiffs have stated a cause of action that is ripe for judicial review.
exhaustion and the variance procedure 
we next turn to defendants contention that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by failing to seek a variance before the department.we initially note that the circuit court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice on the grounds of lack of standing,ripeness and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.with respect to the ground,the circuit court did not consider whether plaintiffs were required to seek a variance before proceeding this issue was not raised by defendants until sometime in the appellate court.instead,the exhaustion argument in the circuit court centered around whether plaintiffs should have to slog through a disciplinary proceeding and suffer loss of their licenses,or at least wait to be cited and sued,before challenging the rule in circuit court.the appellate court affirmed the dismissal with prejudice on the sole grounds of ripeness.it did not reach the issue,finding it was unnecessary to reach it given its holding on ripeness.
we must reject the defendants exhaustion argument for several reasons.first,the pharmacy practice act of pharmacy act ilcs et west does not provide any procedure for the filing of a claim by a party who has conscientious objections to the rule and whose rights might be chilled by the rule.nor does it provide any procedure that would govern the agency decision with respect to a variance from the rule.specifically,the variance statute reads as follows 
duties of the department.the department shall exercise the powers and duties prescribed by the civil administrative code of illinois for the administration of licensing acts and shall exercise such powers and duties necessary for effectuating the purpose of this act.however,the following powers and duties shall be exercised only upon action and report in writing of a majority of the board of pharmacy to take such action 
a formulate such rules,not inconsistent with law and subject to the illinois administrative procedure act,as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and enforce the provisions of this act.the director may grant variances from any such rules as provided for in this section 
the granting of variances from rules promulgated pursuant to this section in individual cases where there is a finding that 
the provision from which the variance is granted is not statutorily mandated 
no party will be injured by the granting of the variance and 
the rule from which the variance is granted would,in the particular case,be unreasonable or unnecessarily burdensome.emphases added.ilcs west.
the case before us poses a significantly different situation than all of the cases cited by the parties that discuss the exhaustion doctrine.those cases involve situations where either the applicable statute gave the litigant a right to bring a claim before the agency with a corresponding procedure to govern the claim before the agency right to a hearing,time frame for decisions,or the agency sought an enforcement action against the litigant,but he failed to wait for the completion of the agency proceeding or failed to take advantage of his right to reconsider the decision before the agency prior to seeking judicial review.neither situation is applicable here.to the extent the second situation could be applicable,it would be more along the lines of a ripeness challenge than an exhaustion argument,because there is,as of yet,no agency enforcement action against plaintiffs.but as discussed above,we have already found that plaintiffs claims are ripe for judicial consideration.moreover,the conscience act and the religious freedom act on which plaintiffs claims are based expressly authorize plaintiffs to seek judicial relief from the courts when their rights are burdened by government action.see ilcs west ilcs west.thus,this case clearly differs from all of the cited cases that have considered exhaustion.
second,even if an exhaustion analysis applies,we note that there are a number of exceptions that would be applicable.an aggrieved party may seek judicial review of an administrative decision without complying with the exhaustion of remedies doctrine where a statute,ordinance or rule is attacked as unconstitutional on its face.canel topinka.
here,plaintiffs first amendment claim is a facial challenge to the statute.the difference between an and a facial challenge is that if a plaintiff prevails in an claim,he may enjoin the objectionable enforcement of a statute only against himself,while a successful facial challenge voids enactment in its entirety and in all applications.napleton village of hinsdale.under plaintiffs theory,if they prevail,the offending provisions of subsection j would be declared void completely,not just as applied to plaintiffs.it is therefore a facial challenge.
a challenge to a statute does not become an challenge,as opposed to a facial challenge,simply because the text is neutral and the law appears at first glance to be one of general applicability.a finding with respect to the facial neutrality of the statute should not be confused with the ultimate determination that a statute is void on its face because it has a religious motivation and does not satisfy strict scrutiny standards.see church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d,stormans,d at.if a rule is facially neutral as to the text,a court must then look beyond the face of the rule to determine the true object of the statute.see lukumi,at.at,d at.where the object of the rule is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,the law is not neutral,and it is invalid unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest.lukumi,at.at,d at.pertinent to this inquiry is the historical background of the decision under challenge,the specific series of events leading to enactment of the subject regulation,and the legislative or administrative history,including contemporaneous statements made by members of the decisionmaking body.stormans,d at,citing village of arlington heights metropolitan housing development,d.additionally,the impact of the law in its actual operation is strong evidence of its operation and purpose.stormans,d at,citing lukumi,at.at,d at.
here,the rule at issue is facially neutral as to the text,but plaintiffs have alleged that the rule was motivated by a desire to compel religious objectors to dispense plan b contraceptives in violation of their beliefs and religious practices.in such a case,the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny and can only survive if it is justified by a compelling governmental interest.accordingly,plaintiffs did not have to seek a variance and exhaust administrative remedies before filing their claim in circuit court.
a party may also seek review where no issues of fact are presented or agency expertise is not involved.canel,at,castaneda illinois human rights comm n.moreover,exhaustion is not required if the administrative remedy is inadequate or futile or in instances where the litigant will be subjected to irreparable injury due to lengthy administrative procedures that fail to provide interim relief.canel,at.
in canel,plaintiffs filed suit in circuit court seeking return of unliquidated stock that had been turned over to the state but belonged to plaintiffs.plaintiffs did not comply with the administrative procedure that required them to specifically request a hearing with the treasurer or seek judicial review of the final administrative decision of the treasurer.
this court in canel excused the lack of exhaustion by stating the following 
we note that,in this case,plaintiff specifically alleged that although section of the act allows the state discretion in returning the dividends of unliquidated stock to owners,it is the policy and practice of the treasurer office not to return to the property owner any income on securities held in custody pursuant to the act.plaintiff further alleged that in no case has such income ever been returned to the owner.in their motion to dismiss,defendants did not dispute plaintiff allegations on this point.indeed,one of defendants bases for dismissal was that plaintiff was not entitled to the dividends under the act.in light of the parties positions,this is not a case where facts need to have been developed before the agency nor does the question presented constitute a matter for agency expertise.rather,the issue revolves around the construction and meaning of section of the act.moreover,the pleadings reveal that it would have been futile for plaintiff,or any other similarly situated claimant for that matter,to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to asserting a claim for dividends on stock held by defendants pursuant to the act because the defendants position in these types of cases is that the act transforms into state property dividends earned on shares of stock presumed abandoned under the act.defendants argue that because of that fact they need not return dividends to the previous owner.section,however,clearly contains an exception that provides that claimants may in fact be entitled to dividends on unliquidated stock.given that defendants,as alleged by plaintiff,have never chosen to exercise their discretion in favor of a the permissive language of the hold that exhaustion,under these circumstances,was unnecessary and that our review of section is not limited solely to its facial validity.with this procedural matter settled,we now turn to the merits.emphasis added.canel,at.
we believe that canel supports plaintiffs position in the present case that seeking recourse before the administrative agency would be futile and that this is an exception to the exhaustion requirement.plaintiffs have alleged that defendants are on record via the governor public statements,warning that the entire point of the rule is to coerce pharmacists with religious objections into dispensing plan b contraceptives.the governor has allegedly publicly stated that pharmacists with moral objections to dispensing plan b contraceptives should find another profession,and that they must fill prescriptions without making moral judgments.defendants have also declared that the rule will be vigorously enforced.thus,it can be concluded that granting variances in these kinds of cases would eviscerate the whole purpose for the rule.under such circumstances,exhaustion is not required.
defendants argue that the main entities they are trying to coerce are large pharmacies that do not hold religious objections.they argue that they are trying to prevent situations where an individual pharmacist with a religious objection is the only one on duty when a plan b prescription is called upon to be filled.but,if what defendants say is true,they could more narrowly tailor the rule to provide an exemption for pharmacies that hold religious objections.instead,they have publicly stated that they will vigorously prosecute pharmacists with religious objections to drive them out of the profession and that a pharmacy must fill plan b prescriptions without making moral judgments if it wants to stay in business.
defendants also suggest that plaintiffs could get a variance if they could show that they were religious institutions,have true religious objections,and that there were other pharmacies within a certain number of blocks that would be able to fill such prescriptions.then,defendants argue,the statutory standard for a variance could be met,which requires a showing that no one will be hurt and that application of the rule in this particular case would be burdensome and unreasonable.we find defendants argument to be unpersuasive.the public statements of defendants in this case are analogous to the allegation in canel that the remedy of never been granted before to anyone.also,there is no indication that defendants have ever granted a variance or would choose to grant one to a pharmacy who refused to dispense plan b contraceptives.and again,the religious freedom and conscience acts expressly confer a right to file a judicial action when the rights protected therein are infringed upon.
beahringer page,is the main case relied upon by defendants to argue the inapplicability of the futility exception.in beahringer,the plaintiff inmate filed a declaratory judgment action alleging that the warden violated his first amendment rights in authorizing the taking of his art supplies.the inmate had commenced the required administrative process by filing a complaint to challenge the confiscation.basically,the statute required a decision within days whenever possible.the inmate waited days without receiving a decision or a response and then filed suit without first getting the response.beahringer found that it was not enough for the plaintiff to allege that grievance procedures with the warden historically have failed.beahringer also found that the time requirements were merely directory.beahringer further stated as follows 
a party will not be required to exhaust his or her administrative remedies when it would be patently useless to do so.citation.however,the fact that there are clear indications that the agency may or will rule adversely is generally inadequate to terminate the administrative process or to avoid the exhaustion requirement.citations.further,mere conclusions of fact or law unsupported by specific factual allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action.citations.
plaintiff declaratory judgment action was properly dismissed for failure to sufficiently plead that he exhausted his administrative remedies.our holding obviates discussion of plaintiff first amendment claim.beahringer,at.
the case before us is easily distinguished from beahringer.here,plaintiffs have brought a facial challenge to the rule under the first amendment.additionally,there is no administrative process that prevented the instant plaintiffs from bringing their claims in circuit court.nor is there any procedure laid out in connection with seeking a variance.instead,the statute simply says that the director may grant a variance,with a list of criteria,which,based on the governor prior statements,show that it would violate the purpose of the rule to grant the variance.as to futility,plaintiffs rely upon more than a mere allegation that grievances have historically failed.rather,they rely upon the governor statements that the purpose of the rule is to coerce pharmacists into violating their religious objections.they also rely on defendants declared intent to vigorously enforce the rule without ever mentioning the possibility that variances might be granted.
defendants claim that the appropriate procedure to be followed in this case is for an aggrieved party to apply for a variance by writing a letter or making a telephone call to the department.the director then considers the criteria for granting a variance under section of the pharmacy act.defendants further claim that granting a variance is a fact question that needs agency expertise because the director would have to look at whether anyone will be hurt and if the applicant for the variance would really be burdened.
we do not find defendants arguments persuasive.there is no provision in the statute for a hearing before granting or denying a variance,and the statute does not authorize the director to conduct any such hearing.this militates against the notion that a fact question or agency expertise is crucial.as previously stated,if there are no questions of fact or agency expertise is not involved,a litigant is not required to exhaust remedies.in our opinion,this is largely a case involving a question of pharmacists and pharmacies can be compelled to violate their consciences and religious beliefs in violation of two illinois statutes and the first amendment.there is no agency expertise involved.accordingly,we find that plaintiffs did not have to seek a variance before proceeding with their claims in circuit court.
as a final matter,we note that plaintiffs urge this court to reach the merits of their conscience act claim and declare subsection j void and facially invalid.we have previously acknowledged that plaintiffs claims are legal in nature,but we do not believe that it would be consistent with our role as a reviewing court to rule on the merits of the conscience act where defendants,as of yet,have not been required to answer the allegations of plaintiffs complaint in the trial court.
additionally,we note that plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,which the trial court denied on justiciability grounds after a hearing.plaintiffs did not file an interlocutory appeal from that order under supreme court rules a or d rs.a,d.thus,we do not consider its propriety here.plaintiffs also moved for a preliminary injunction,but the trial court did not hold a hearing on this motion or rule upon it because the court granted defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice based on justiciability issues.as our discussion above indicates,we believe that plaintiffs claims are ripe and that plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies.the appropriate remedy is to reverse the judgments of the appellate and circuit courts and to remand the cause for further proceedings,including a hearing on plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction and to allow further amendments to the plaintiffs complaint.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgments of the appellate and circuit courts and remand the cause to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
judgments reversed cause remanded.
the majority reverses the appellate court,holding that plaintiffs challenge to the administrative rule requiring pharmacies to dispense prescription contraceptives.j is ripe for judicial review.the majority also holds that,even though plaintiffs undisputedly failed to seek a variance excusing their compliance with the rule,this did not constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.alternatively,the majority concludes that even if an exhaustion analysis applies,plaintiffs are exempt from the requirement under various exceptions.
i disagree with the majority regarding the exhaustion issue,which is dispositive.plaintiffs failure to seek a variance from the director pursuant to section of the pharmacy practice act of ilcs west constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and plaintiffs were not exempt from the exhaustion requirement.plaintiffs complaint was properly dismissed by the circuit court.i write separately to explain why the exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine asserted by the majority do not apply.
generally,a party may not seek judicial relief from an administrative action unless the party has exhausted all available administrative remedies.arvia madigan.an exception to this doctrine provides that a plaintiff who attacks a statute or rule as unconstitutional on its face need not exhaust administrative remedies.arvia,at.in the case at bar,the majority concludes that plaintiffs claim is a facial rather than an challenge,and holds that the exception for facial challenges therefore applies.citing napleton village of hinsdale,the majority explains the difference between facial and challenges in terms of the differing results if the plaintiff prevails.the difference between an and a facial challenge is that if a plaintiff prevails in an claim,he may enjoin the objectionable enforcement of a statute only against himself,while a successful facial challenge voids the enactment in its entirety and in all applications.at.at,at.the majority continues under plaintiffs theory,if they prevail,the offending provisions of subsection j would be declared void completely,not just as applied to plaintiffs.plaintiffs challenge is therefore a facial challenge.at.at,at.
the majority fails to mention napleton additional,somewhat different description of the distinction between facial and challenges when the challenge is first presented,rather than when a plaintiff prevails.with regard to facial challenges,napleton explains 
a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a legislative enactment is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully citation because an enactment is facially invalid only if no set of circumstances exists under which it would be valid.citation.the fact that the enactment could be found unconstitutional under some set of circumstances does not establish its facial invalidity.napleton,at.
accord people greco.by contrast,in an as applied challenge a plaintiff protests against how an enactment was applied in the particular context in which the plaintiff acted or proposed to act,and the facts surrounding the plaintiff particular circumstances become relevant.napleton,at.
in the case at bar,plaintiffs challenge to subsection j does not present a facial attack.it is premised on religious objections to the rule requirements.however,plaintiffs do that every retail pharmacy has such religious objections.nevertheless,every retail pharmacy must comply with subsection j.plaintiffs fail to allege there is no set of circumstances under which subsection j would be valid.see,greco,at.even if plaintiffs challenge were successful,the rule would not be void in its entirety and in all applications napleton,at.in this instance,plaintiffs claim is an as applied challenge rather than a facial attack.accordingly,the exception to the exhaustion doctrine for facial challenges does not apply here.
under a second exception to the exhaustion doctrine,a party is not required to exhaust administrative remedies where it would be patently futile to do so.beahringer page,castaneda illinois human rights comm n.the plaintiff bears the heavy burden of establishing that the futility exception applies to his or her case.see,cullen town council,coleman newburgh enlarged city school district,d,rann chao,d.
in the case at bar,the majority concludes that this exception applies as well,holding that it would be futile for plaintiffs to seek a variance.the majority points to public statements by the governor and other defendants allegedly indicating that the purpose of the rule is to coerce pharmacists with religious objections into dispensing emergency contraceptives.the majority states i t can be concluded that granting variances in these kinds of cases would eviscerate the whole purpose for the rule.under such circumstances,exhaustion is not required.at.at,at.in reaching this conclusion,the majority notes defendants contention that the main target of the rule is not pharmacists with religious objections to emergency contraception,but rather large pharmacies that do not have such religious objections.the majority also notes defendants argument that they are trying to prevent situations where an individual pharmacist with a religious objection is the only one on duty when a plan b prescription is presented.at.at,at.however,the majority dismisses these contentions,asserting that defendants should have more narrowly tailor ed the rule to provide an exemption for pharmacies that hold religious objections.at.at,at.
in focusing on public statements to determine the rule purpose,the majority is forced to rely on questionable sources such as press releases.the majority should have looked to more appropriate sources such as the rule itself,as amended in april,and the manner in which it is enforced.
the amended version of the rule see.reg,eff.april,amending.j,which the majority describes in the background section of its opinion,retains the essential features of the previous version of the rule but adds what the majority describes as several,more onerous provisions pertaining specifically to emergency contraception.at.at,at.chief among the changes pertaining to emergency contraception is a new dispensing procedure called remote medication order processing rmop.notwithstanding the majority description of the changes as more onerous,rmop,which takes up the lion share of the amendment,actually supports defendants claims that the target of the rule is not pharmacists with religious objections to emergency contraception,and defendants are attempting to prevent situations where an individual pharmacist with a religious objection is the only one on duty when a plan b prescription is presented.under rmop,if a pharmacist objects to dispensing emergency contraception and there is no nonobjecting pharmacist present at the dispensing pharmacy,a nonobjecting pharmacist at a different remote location may authorize the dispensing of the drug by a nonpharmacist employee at the dispensing pharmacy.j a,j b.in addition,a retail pharmacy is responsible for ensuring either that there is a pharmacist scheduled at all times the pharmacy is open,or that there is a licensed pharmacist available to perform rmop for emergency contraception at all times the pharmacy is open and no pharmacist is available at the pharmacy.j.
with regard to the manner in which the rule is enforced,plaintiffs specifically allege only three enforcement actions charging violations of subsection j.similar to the amended version of the rule,these three complaints provide support for defendants contention that the rule is aimed at large pharmacies that do not have religious objections to emergency contraceptives,rather than pharmacies that hold such objections.two of the three complaints were filed against walgreen pharmacies,and the third was filed against an osco pharmacy.according to defendants,these enforcement actions involved large chain pharmacies that unlike plaintiffs do stock emergency contraceptives and do not have a corporate policy of religious refusals to dispense.in those administrative complaints,the pharmacies allegedly failed to ensure that their employees complied with store policy and instead allowed individual pharmacists to obstruct customers access to contraceptives.
in the case at bar,as previously noted,the majority conclusion that the futility exception applies here is based,in large part,on public statements by the governor and other defendants allegedly indicating that the purpose of the rule is to coerce pharmacists with religious objections into dispensing emergency contraceptives.assuming,arguendo,that it is proper to base a determination of the rule purpose on such public statements,rather than the rule itself and its manner of enforcement,i note that an examination of these public statements raises serious questions as to whether the purpose of the rule actually was,as the majori
