astra aktiebolag,aktiebolaget hässle,astra merck enterprises,astra merck,kbi,astra pharmaceuticals,and astrazeneca collectively astra filed patent infringement suits against several pharmaceutical companies that were seeking permission from the food and drug administration fda to market generic versions of prilosec,astra gastric acid inhibiting drug.the united states district court for the southern district of new york tried the case in four phases.following a day bench trial,the district court decided in phases i and iii that andrx product infringes two of astra patents,patent the patent and the patent.astra aktiebolag andrx,d.this court affirmed that judgment.in re omeprazole patent.omeprazole ii.
this appeal involves phases ii and iv of the same litigation.the district court entered a final judgment finding that andrx pharmaceuticals,andrx literally infringed claims,and of astra aktiebolag united states patent the patent.the trial court also entered several other judgments about the enforceability of that patent and other astra patents.in re omeprazole patent,bsj,mdl docket july,final judgment.at the same time,however,the district court also found the asserted claims of astra patent anticipated or obvious.final judgment,slip op.at.detecting no error of law or fact,this court affirms.
phases i and iii of this case produced judgments of patent infringement against andrx and other defendants.this case,however,involves only the patent and one defendant,andrx.as set out in the district court thorough opinion,phase ii involves infringement and validity of the patent phase iv involves andrx defenses of inequitable conduct and unclean hands.in re omeprazole patent litigation,bsj,mdl docket may,omeprazole iii.in addition,unlike the patents that claimed a formulation in phases i and iii,the patent claims only a process.
omeprazole is the generic name for prilosec.astra aktiebolag andrx,d,omeprazole i.omeprazole inhibits the production of gastric acid through a unique mechanism.id.at.after a complex absorption process,omeprazole transforms into its active species in the parietal cells cells in the stomach lining and inhibits acid production.id.however,omeprazole degrades in acidic and neutral environments.therefore,it must be protected from contact with gastric juices while traveling to the parietal cells.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.thus,an omeprazole formulation needs a protective enteric coating around the core containing the active alkaline reacting compound arc and a separating layer between that core and the coating.id.
the patent recites a method for making this pharmaceutical formulation.the pharmaceutical formulation is composed of a core that contains a proton pump inhibitor like omeprazole to decrease gastric acid secretion,a water soluble separating layer,and an enteric coating layer.patent,abstract.specifically,the patent recites a process for creating the separating layer by causing an in situ reaction involving the material and the arc in the core.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the reaction creates a salt form of the polymer between the core and the layer.id.thus,the process produces an omeprazole formulation with three distinct layers,but starts with only two of the three layers.id.this in situ reaction requires a specific arc concentration in the core.claim,for example,requires more than dry ingredients in the core 
a process for preparing an oral pharmaceutical formulation comprising the steps of 
forming a core material comprising a proton pump inhibitor and at least one alkaline reacting compound arc,wherein the concentration of the alkaline reacting compound is about dry ingredients in the alkaline containing part of the core material,and 
applying an enteric coating polymer layer so as to surround the core material thereby forming in situ a separating layer as a water soluble salt product between the alkaline compound and the enteric coating polymer.
patent.the remaining claims all depend upon claim.claim,which the district court found obvious,recites 
the process according to claim,wherein the alkaline reacting compound is an alkaline salt of phosphoric acid,carbonic acid or silicic acid.
patent.the process adjusts the variables during the process to account for the particular enteric coatings.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the patent states that process parameters such as inlet air temperature,air flow,atomizer air flow and spraying rate are adjusted with respect to the equipment used for the process as well as the specific enteric coating polymer s.patent.for example,when using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate lf hpmcas lf for applying the enteric coating to a tablet,in the specification under examples,the patent states 
grams of core material was as described below the dispersion was fed with a rate of.inlet air temperature used was sic and flow was set to.atomizing airflow used was nm,obtained with a pressure of bar.
patent.after enteric coating,the specification also specifies an increase in the inlet air temperature to for approximately five minutes.id.
the patent issued in the united states on january,with priority back to the february,swedish application.however,in,before astra swedish filing,a korean company,the chong kun dan corporation ckd,began selling a form of omeprazole under the name omp in korea.ckd had filed an application ckd patent application with the korean intellectual property office kipo for its omp formulation.the ckd patent application became public at kipo on april.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.as a result,astra questioned ckd about infringement of its korean process patent for manufacturing omeprazole,a foreign sister to portions of astra astra korean patent,which issued on november.ckd denied infringement in reliance on its own unique and patents.ckd korean patent publications described compositions with no enteric coating processes.ckd maintained its enteric coating know how as a trade secret.
astra filed suit in korea against ckd for infringement.ckd initiated a proceeding in the kipo,called a negative confirmation of scope proceeding,seeking an advisory opinion that its process did not infringe astra korean patents.
this korean litigation and its associated kipo proceedings turned on whether ckd omp product contained a subcoating.ckd relied on its process to avoid astra korean patent.this referred to in the documents as method a,method no.ga or method ka ho collectively method a did not involve a separate third step to make a.ckd description of method a included core ingredients omeprazole,arginine,microcrystalline cellulose,sls,corn starch and magnesium stearate and enteric coating ingredients hpmcas,ethyl citrate,talc,and sorbitan sesquioleate,but no enteric coating process conditions.then,in september,ckd submitted a modified list of ingredients for the method a process,which added the coating agent hpmc grade,but still provided no enteric coating process conditions.the patent required a separate application of a subcoating.omeprazole i,d at.to verify ckd denials of any third application step,astra conducted various experiments on ckd product.astra investigations and testing of ckd batches and led astra to repeatedly conclude that ckd product in fact contained a subcoating.thus,the astra inventors continued to believe that ckd actually applied a conventional separating layer.
thereafter,in june,two of astra patent inventors,kurt lövgren and johan lundberg,postulated instead that neutralizing enteric coating materials may produce a reaction in situ.with this new theory and the conflicting ckd information as a backdrop,lundberg and lövgren conceived the idea of forming a separating layer from enteric coating material neutralized by the arc during the coating process.during their experiments to create an in situ separating layer,lundberg and lövgren did not know ckd process for its product.
after much experimentation,on december,lundberg developed the process conditions for making an in situ separating layer.using process conditions,which included lower inlet air temperatures than those used during previous failed experiments,the latest experiments revealed that a separating layer would surprisingly form at a lower temperature,than previously used.this work became the foundation of the patent.
then,on december,for the first time,lundberg received the process conditions for making ckd omeprazole product.ckd protocol for batch required an enteric coating inlet air temperature of a temperature that,in astra tests,did not form in situ subcoatings.testing also showed that batch differed from earlier produced ckd products and.then,in its december disclosure,ckd changed its september protocol.these changes added sorbitan sesquioleate and hpmc to its enteric coating recipe.
finally,on january,lundberg coated tablet cores with ingredients matching ckd batch record,employing his own process conditions,a processing inlet air temperature of,and not the temperature required by ckd protocol.in an pharmaceutical report,lundberg reported that all of the in situ separating layers from enteric coatings formed at inlet air temperatures of or lower.
on october,astra aktiebolag filed united states application number the application,later issued as the patent.on december,the united states patent and trademark office pto examiner issued an office action rejecting claims through of the application.on march,astra filed a preliminary amendment to claims through.in april,the pto examiner allowed claims through.then,on july,the applicants submitted a petition to withdraw the application from issuance and to submit an information disclosure statement.with the information disclosure statement,the applicants disclosed five documents with descriptions of the korean proceedings the korean information.after considering the korean information in september of,the pto examiner issued a notice of allowance on september.in the notice of allowance,the pto examiner indicated that the claims were all patentable over the korean prior art.
meanwhile,ckd consistently represented to astra,the applicant inventors,and the korean courts that its product did not have,or need,a separating layer because ckd used a large amount of the specialized alkaline compound,arginine.in making this representation,ckd relied on its testing of ckd batch and the report of an outside expert,kim,who viewed a production run for batch.the ckd patent application purports to disclose an omeprazole formulation whose stability relies on the zwitterionic amino acids like arginine in the core.the ckd patent application does not disclose any enteric coating process conditions or the basic details concerning enteric coatings.notably,the ckd patent application expressly disavows the presence of a separating layer.ckd told the korean court that its product also did not have a separating layer.
the district court found that andrx literally infringed astra patent.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.indeed,andrx admitted that its process met all but one portion of claim of the portion requiring in situ formation of a separating layer,slip op.at.regardless,andrx disagrees with the district court construction of a water soluble salt in claim.patent.
the infringement analysis proceeds as a process claim construction,followed by comparison of the claims to the accused device.am.container,plastipak packaging.this court reviews claim construction without deference,cybor fas,and infringement for clear error,power mosfet,siemens ag.
andrx argues that the district court erred in finding that its product infringes the patent because it does not have a water soluble separating layer,but instead a layer composed of almost talc.according to andrx,its separating layer with talc is not water soluble,but only disintegrates in water.andrx asserts that disintegration is not soluble.indeed,the and patents claim a subcoating which rapidly dissolves or disintegrates in water and a subcoating which is soluble or rapidly disintegrating in water,respectively.omeprazole i,d at.
the patent indeed claims a water soluble salt.patent.the district court correctly discerned that this language permits the inclusion of talc.the language of claim does not claim a separating layer that is water soluble.claim instead recites a salt product that is water soluble.the patent specification,under summary of the invention,describes the separating layer as comprising a water soluble salt of an enteric coating polymer.patent emphasis added.a sentence later,the patent specification states a separating layer comprising a water soluble salt of an enteric coating polymer is obtained.patent emphases added.in addition,example and of the patent employs an layer that contains hpmcas as well as triethylcitrate,sodium laurylsulphate,and talc.patent.thus,the district court correctly interpreted the patent claim to permit inclusion of talc in the separating layer.
the trial court did not err by referring to the omeprazole i opinion,which covered phase i,because it pointed to a portion of its opinion that discussed the water solubility of the salt of the enteric coating.in phase i,the district court found 
that the layer is and soluble or rapidly disintegrating in water as that phrase is used in the and patent claims and that the presence of talc does not affect this court finding that the subcoating is soluble in is expressly listed as an appropriate ingredient in the patents.citations to record omitted.
d at emphasis added.this finding applied correctly to the patent claims that do not require that the entire separating layer be water soluble,but only that the salt product be water soluble.in discussing the entire subcoating,the district court noted that the presence of talc does not affect the solubility of the salt.id.in addition,the district court found in phase ii,that p ersons skilled in the art would understand that each of those components such as talc are also present in the in situ layer generated by the claimed process,as well as in the layer.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.indeed,the district court received testimony in phase ii that the contents of the enteric coat would inevitably become a part of the separating layer salt because it is the result of a reaction between the hpmcp,which converts to a salt,in the enteric coat and the core,which contains an alkaline reacting compound 
davies explained that the salt layer is the result of a reaction between the hpmcp in the material and the dhp in the active layer.the talc from the spray remains in the layer when the hpmcp converts to the salt.davies tr.talc is placed on the product in the enteric coating layer.it is still present during the formation of the hpmcp salt layer the salt layer and the enteric coating layer both contain talc.
omeprazole i,d at.therefore,even though the district court was comparing andrx product to the and patent claims,those claims,likewise,recite a water soluble salt product despite the presence of a talc during its formation.in addition,the patent five preferred embodiments clearly state that they contain talc.as shown in testimony,the talc would still be present in the formation of the separating layer.thus,the district court did not err in its claim construction or its conclusion that andrx product infringed the patent.
the district court found that the ckd patent application anticipated claims,and of the patent.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the ckd patent application became public on april,slip op.at,and contained all of the elements claimed in the anticipated claims.that application also disclosed the exact proportions of the principal ingredients in the patent example.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the only limitation missing from the korean application is the language thereby forming in situ a separating layer.
anticipation requires disclosure of each and every claim limitation in a single prior art reference,either explicitly or inherently.int l milgraum.an anticipation analysis requires a comparison of the construed claim to the prior art.helifix.
astra asserts that the claim limitation,forming in situ a separating layer,is not found in the ckd patent application.astra also contends that the patent contains an additional limitation requiring performance of the claimed process at a temperature below.
at the outset,the asserted limitation is only an example from the specification.absent some clear intent to the contrary,this court does not import examples from the specification into the claims.constant advanced,e mbodiments and examples appearing in the specification will not generally be read into the claims.the limitation does not appear in the claims.moreover,the specification suggests variable temperatures,not a c requirement the process parameters such as inlet air temperature,air flow are adjusted with respect to the equipment used as well as the specific enteric polymer patent.thus,the district court did not err in refusing to read astra alleged limitation into claim of the patent.
the in situ formation of a separating layer limitation presents a more difficult issue.the ckd patent application does not explicitly recite this feature.therefore,anticipation turns on whether the ckd application inherently disclosed in situ formation.the ckd application disavowed a subcoating and disclosed no process conditions to form a separating layer in situ.
nonetheless,in finding inherent anticipation,the district court relied on and set out in its opinion the assertions astra made during the korean litigation and kipo proceedings 
that the ckd process method a claimed in the ckd patent application resulted in the in situ formation of a separating layer in ckd omp tablet,omeprazole iii,slip op.at 
that method a forms a separating layer,even though method a does not have a separate step of applying the separating layer,slip op.at 
that method a formed a separating layer and that such formation is inherent in the process of method a,slip op.at 
the construction of the inner coating layer formed in method a is exactly that of the inner coating layer claimed in the patent,slip op.at 
u ltimately method a contains the inner coating layer process,
the inner coating layer of the omp tablet is created instantly at the point of time when the substance of coating the enteric coating is sprayed,
according to the content of the expert opinion with the start of the process of the enteric coating of the omp tablet,hpmcas,which is an enteric coating substance,instantly reacts with the that is in the core and forms a thin membrane,an inner coating layer,
lövgren contended that the ckd process resulted in the formation of a separating layer,
rhodes,who astra relied on in the proceedings in korea against ckd,opined that the ckd product contained an in situ layer,id.
astra does not deny these statements.furthermore,as noted by the district court if astra had scientific proof with which to rebut or refute its prior admissions of inherency,it surely would have put on such proof.astra did not,slip op.at.furthermore,umesh banakar,andrx expert,testified that if a formulator followed the ckd process as described in the ckd patent application,the separating layer would form in situ each and every time,slip op.at.in addition,the district court accorded little if any weight to astra contrary expert testimony from robert langer testimony,in part because astra did not provide langer with any of the submissions including test results on which astra relied in korea to prove that the formation of a separating layer naturally results from the ckd process.id.the district court acting as factfinder found credible that evidence of inherent in situ formation,and we find no clear error in that determination.the district court did not settle for proof that in situ formation could result from the ckd process,as is suggested in the dissent rather,the district court credited evidence that in situ formation does result from the ckd process.
as noted,a prior art reference without express reference to a claim limitation may nonetheless anticipate by inherency.see in re cruciferous sprout.moreover,i nherency is not necessarily coterminous with knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art.artisans of ordinary skill may not recognize the inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior art.schering geneva,rejecting the contention that inherent anticipation requires recognition in the prior art.though lövgren and lundberg may not have recognized that a characteristic of ckd method a ingredients,disclosed in the ckd patent application,resulted in an in situ formation of a separating layer,the in situ formation was inherent.
the record shows formation of the in situ separating layer in the prior art even though that process was not recognized at the time.the new realization alone does not render that necessary prior art patentable.id.citing atlas powder,at t he discovery of a previously unappreciated property of a prior art composition,or of a scientific explanation for the prior art function,does not render the old composition patentably new to the discoverer.squibb ben venue,explaining that newly discovered results of known processes are not patentable because those results are inherent in the known processes verdegaal,union oil of,holding that the recognition of a new aspect of a known process is not a patentable invention of a novel process.despite ckd denials,lövgren and lundberg realized and explained that ckd omp tablet formation of a separating layer was a natural result flowing from the combination of certain ingredients listed in method a.that explanation,however,does not make that prior art patentable.the ingredients and protocols ckd gave to the kipo and astra in and necessarily resulted in in situ formation of a separating layer.thus,the trial court correctly found inherent anticipation.
claim of the patent is dependent on claim.claim claims the arc as an alkaline salt of phosphoric acid,carbonic acid,or silicic acid.the district court found that,in light of the ckd patent application,it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to substitute the alkaline salts called for by claim of the patent for the arginine disclosed in the ckd application.in other words,the district court concluded that it would have been obvious to substitute one arc for another.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.obviousness under is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual determinations.medichem,rolabo.
ckd patent application coats a core containing an amino acid or an alkali salt of omeprazole as the basic part or alkali reaction component.id.the district court and the korean appellate court found that the ckd application lists arginine as the basic part of the core and,alternatively,as an alkali substance.id.at korean appellate trial court decision at,in re omeprazole patent,appeal.before the appellate court in korea,astra conceded that is generally known as an alkaline reactive compound,astra supplement of the reasons for the request for appeal to korean appellate court,at.astra also acknowledged that its patented invention could easily substitute alkaline reactive compounds for the in method id.at.
the record shows that banakar testified that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art of pharmaceutical formulation to replace the arginine in the ckd application with an alkaline salt of phosphoric acid,carbonic acid,or silicic acid.as banakar noted,all such substances are arcs that can stabilize omeprazole.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the district court noted that banakar testimony is corroborated by astra own admissions that arginine is just like other arcs and it is easy to substitute arginine for another arc.id.
astra countered that these statements in the korean proceedings addressed whether arginine can function as an arc stabilizing agent in the context of the korean sister the patent at issue.however,astra still admitted that an arc could easily replace ckd.therefore,this court finds no clear error in the district court factual findings and no error in its conclusion that it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to substitute one arc for another.therefore,claim of the patent would have been obvious at the time of invention.
andrx argues the district court erred in declining to find the patent unenforceable through inequitable conduct and fraud on the pto and in denying its claim for attorney fees under.andrx also states in its brief that it is entitled to a ruling on its counterclaims and that the district court must rule on the inequitable conduct and fraud claims for the determination of attorney fees under.appellant br.at.the district court did not entertain andrx inequitable conduct and fraud defenses because it considered them mooted by its rulings that each of the asserted claims of the patent is invalid.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the district court did consider andrx unclean hands argument,but found no evidence to support a finding of unclean hands,slip op.at.this court reviews an ultimate inequitable conduct determination for abuse of discretion and the underlying determinations including materiality and intent under the clearly erroneous standard.molins plc textron.andrx bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that astra acted with unclean hands.see generally donald chisum,chisum on patents a treatise on the law of patentability,validity,and infringement.
andrx unclean hands,fraud,and inequitable conduct arguments were much more limited before the district court than as presented to this court.before the district court,andrx raised an inventors oath argument claiming that the inventors were not truly the inventors of the process claimed in the patent.on inequitable conduct during prosecution of the and patents,the district court stated 
after a complete review of the hundreds of pages of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by andrx in support of its unclean hands theory,the court is utterly unpersuaded.
omeprazole iii,slip op.at.as evidence of unclean hands,andrx asserted delay of trial affirmative use of tainted evidence and withholding significant documents until after the phase i and ii trials were completed,slip op.at.the district court attributed delay equally to andrx and astra.furthermore,the trial court noted that andrx,not astra,requested that the patent be tried with the and patents,slip op.at.now before this court,andrx hopes to argue that astra inventors misrepresented facts to the pto and deliberately failed to disclose the korean litigation and kipo proceedings to the pto.this court need not reach issues andrx did not raise properly in proposed findings before the district court.viskase am.can.
the district court stated that it would not make detailed findings concerning andrx additional defenses pertaining to the patent,which are mooted by this court rulings that each of the asserted claims of the patent is invalid.omeprazole iii,slip op.at.the inequitable conduct claim was not technically moot,because it would have rendered the entire patent unenforceable,rather than just the claims that were held invalid.nonetheless,the court ruling on mootness did not prejudice andrx,because the record contains no support for andrx argument that the patent inventors conduct before the pto constituted inequitable conduct.instead,the inventors disclosed the korean litigation and kipo proceedings.the pto examiner had the benefit of this information before allowance of the patent.furthermore,the record shows that ckd consistently represented to the patent inventors that their omeprazole product did not have a separating layer.thus,those inventors had every reason to believe that they had invented the process disclosed in the patent.as a result,nothing in the record would support a finding that the inventors engaged in inequitable conduct.the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in finding that andrx did not show fraud,unclean hands,or inequitable conduct.without a finding of inequitable conduct in the first instance,andrx can not possibly prevail with its new contentions of infectious unenforceability against all patents in suit,including the and the which were held valid and infringed.
lastly,in august,after it issued its opinion on the two phases on appeal here,the district court found astra,not andrx,the prevailing party.in re omeprazole patent litigation,bsj,mdl docket,wl,costs order.in the words of the trial court,astra is the prevailing party because its successes on its affirmative claims far outweigh any gains defendants made on their counterclaims.costs order,wl,at.

in phases i and iii of this litigation,the district court found most of the asserted claims infringed defendant genpharm,genpharm literally infringed claims,and of the patent genpharm literally infringed claims,and of the patent three other defendants,referred to collectively as cheminor,literally infringed claims,and of the patent cheminor literally infringed claims,and of the patent andrx literally infringed claims,and of the patent andrx literally infringed claims,and of the patent.omeprazole i,d at.the district court entered an injunction prohibiting all defendants from marketing their generic omeprazole product through.costs order,wl,at.also,though the district court also found claim of united states patent the patent invalid as anticipated,it found the asserted claims of the and patents not invalid.d at.the district court found that the pylori patent of much less significance than the formulation and patents.costs order,wl,at.moreover,in phases ii and iv,the district court also found that andrx literally infringed claims,and of the patent.final judgment,slip op.at.therefore,this court finds no clear error in the district court conclusion that this case was not exceptional,and finds no error in the district court conclusion that astra was the prevailing party.the district court properly applied the proper standards.because section allows an award of attorney fees only to the prevailing party,the district court conclusion that andrx can not recover attorney fees is not an abuse of discretion.
in conclusion,this court affirms the district court judgment finding that andrx literally infringed claims,and of astra patent,but that claims,and of the patent are anticipated and that claim of the patent is obvious.this court also affirms the district court conclusion that andrx counterclaims were mooted,that there was no inequitable conduct,fraud,or unclean hands in astra prosecution of the patent,and that astra and patents are not unenforceable through infectious unenforceability.
each party shall bear its own costs.
i concur in the court ruling that the claims are infringed if valid,as well as the rulings on the issues of inequitable conduct,fraud,unclean hands,and attorney fees.however,i can not agree that the claims of the patent are invalid,for the findings of inherent anticipation and obviousness are based on incorrect premises of law.
applying a novel theory of inherent anticipation,the court invalidates astra patent on a newly discovered chemical process a process involving known ingredients but different and previously unknown reaction conditions and achieving a different result.based on a flawed analysis of the law of inherent anticipation,the court invalidates the patent on astra previously unknown process for producing an in situ polymeric sublayer for omeprazole.the court apparently reasons that because the ingredients were known,it is irrelevant that a significant change in conditions produces a result that is different from that achieved under the conditions of the prior art.such a view of inherency is contrary to legal as well as scientific principles.
the court explanation and citation of authority suggest that my colleagues have confused the law governing patentability of a newly discovered use of a known composition,which is achieved by process claim with the unpatentability of the known composition itself.the claims at issue are not directed to a composition they are directed to a process for forming a sublayer from known ingredients 
claim.a process for preparing an oral pharmaceutical formulation comprising the steps of 
forming a core material comprising a proton pump inhibitor and at least one alkaline reacting compound,wherein the concentration of the alkaline reacting compound is about dry ingredients in the alkaline containing part of the core material,and 
applying an enteric coating polymer layer so as to surround the core material thereby forming in situ a separating layer as a water soluble salt product between the alkaline compound and the enteric coating polymer.
the astra process is not described in the prior art,although astra admitted that it believed that the korean company chong kun dan corporation ckd had made such a product.it is not disputed that such a sublayer does not form under the conditions in the ckd patent application.no such reaction is described in ckd korean patent application,nor the conditions that could have produced such a product.nonetheless,my colleagues rule that the process discovered by astra is inherently anticipated by the ckd application.that is not the law of either anticipation or inherency.i must,respectfully,dissent.
anticipation means lack of novelty 
novelty is fundamental to patentability.lack of novelty,or anticipation in,means that the subject matter was previously known in terms of while some properties and uses of known compositions may indeed be inherently anticipated in that their existence would have been known to persons in the field of the invention,even if unpublished,that is not this situation.no prior art describes the astra process,and there is no evidence that a person of ordinary skill would have known of its existence.what is unknown can not anticipate.
anticipation requires that each element of the claim at issue is found,either expressly described or under the principles of inherency,in a single prior art reference or that the claimed invention was previously known or embodied in a single prior art device or practice.kalman.see int l milgraum,to anticipate,a single reference must teach every limitation of the claimed invention any limitation not explicitly taught must be inherently taught and would be so understood by a person experienced in the field in re baxter travenol,the dispositive question is whether one skilled in the art would reasonably understand or infer that a reference teaches or discloses all of the elements of the claimed invention continental can monsanto,to anticipate,every element of the claims must appear in a single prior art reference,or if not expressly shown,then demonstrated to be known to persons experienced in the field of technology in re samour,ccpa the key question is whether a single prior art reference publicly discloses every material element of the claimed subject matter.
the principle of inherency,in the law of anticipation,requires that any information missing from the reference would nonetheless be known to be present in the subject matter of the reference,when viewed by persons experienced in the field of the invention.however,anticipation by inherent disclosure is appropriate only when the reference discloses prior art that must necessarily include the unstated limitation,or the reference can not inherently anticipate the claims.transclean bridgewood,emphasis in original hitzeman rutter,consistent with the law of anticipation,an inherent property must necessarily be present in the invention described by the count,and it must be so recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the art in re robertson,that a feature in the prior art reference could operate as claimed does not establish inherency.
thus when a claim limitation is not explicitly set forth in a reference,evidence must make clear that the missing descriptive matter is necessarily present in the thing described in the reference,and that it would be so recognized by persons of ordinary skill.continental can,at.it is not sufficient if a material element or limitation is merely probably or possibly present in the prior art.trintec.see gore garlock,at anticipation can not be predicated on mere conjecture respecting the characteristics of products that might result from the practice of processes disclosed in references in re oelrich,ccpa to anticipate,the asserted inherent function must be present in the prior art.
applying these principles,it is incorrect to hold that the ckd application inherently anticipates the invention.the panel majority contravenes this vast body of precedent,for it is not disputed that no reference explicitly or inherently teaches the process that astra found to produce an in situ polymeric sublayer.the requirements of inherent anticipation were not met.
anticipation also requires enablement 
to anticipate,the identical subject matter must not only be previously known,but the knowledge must be sufficiently enabling to place the information in the possession of the public.in seymour osborne,wall,the supreme court explained 
patented inventions can not be superceded by the mere introduction of a prior art reference unless the description and drawings contain and exhibit a substantial representation of the patented improvement,in such full,clear,and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art of science to which it appertains,to make,construct,and practice the invention to the same practical extent as they would be enabled to do if the information was derived from a prior patent.mere vague and general representations will not support such a defense,as the knowledge supposed to be derived from the publication must be sufficient to enable those skilled in the art or science to understand the nature and operation of the invention,and carry it into practice use.whatever may be the particular circumstances under which the publication takes place,the account published,to be of any effect to support such a defense,must be an account of complete and operative invention capable of being put into practical operation.

all parties agree that the closest prior art is the korean ckd application.it was not disputed that the ingredients of the astra and the ckd omeprazole formulations are the same standard enteric ingredients.several references describe the use of microcrystalline cellulose plus an compound to formulate pharmaceuticals for drug delivery.however,no reference describes the conditions by which astra produced an in situ interior sublayer.no reference suggests formulation temperatures at or below,or that such a sublayer might form at such low temperatures.
andrx expert witness banakar agreed that it was not possible to know,from the ckd korean application,how or if the reaction conditions could be changed so as to produce an in situ sublayer.although the panel majority states that testified that if a formulator followed the ckd process as described in the ckd patent application,the separating layer would form in situ each and every time,on banaker admitted that he had conducted no experiments and his conclusion was without verification.he stated that his sole basis for each and every time was the astra argument in the korean proceedings,the argument that was negated by the evidence in the korean court,including the testimony of professor chung,the korean expert.in all of the proceedings,in korea and in the united states,it was never disputed that the ckd application does not disclose a separating sublayer,and that such a sublayer does not form in the conditions described for the ckd process.ckd testified
