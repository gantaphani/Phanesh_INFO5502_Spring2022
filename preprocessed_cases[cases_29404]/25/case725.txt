corporation and schering corporation schering appeal the judgment of the united states district court for the district of new jersey,finding united states patent patent infringed and not invalid.boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,boehringer,the assignee of the patent,based on the district court claim construction.we find that substantial evidence supports the verdicts on invalidity and infringement,and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome prrs also known as mystery swine disease or swine infertility and respiratory syndrome,swept through commercial pig herds in the.a previously unknown disease,prrs had its most pronounced effect on young and newborn piglets.up to thirty percent of the piglets in litters from infected sows were stillborn,and up to eighty percent of piglets in infected herds died before weaning.patent,cols.the financial consequences to the commercial pig industry were severe.
researchers seeking a cause for prrs could not identify any known pathogen behind the epidemic hence the name mystery swine disease.scientists at boehringer were the first to solve the mystery,discovering that a previously unknown virus was responsible for the disease.starting with tissue samples from diseased animals,boehringer scientists added extracts from the tissue samples to mammalian cell lines grown in culture and looked for evidence of viral growth in the cell cultures.
as described in the patent,boehringer began with a homogenate of lung,brain,spleen,liver,and kidney tissues from an infected piglet.samples of this combined homogenate were then added to a panel of different cultured mammalian cell lines.while viruses themselves are too small to see without the aid of an electron microscope,a viral infection often gives rise to morphological changes in the host cell.an observable change in a host cell due to viral infection is known as a cytopathic effect,or cpe.these changes may include cell rounding,disorientation,swelling or shrinking,death,or detachment from the culture surface,and are visible with ordinary microscopes as perturbations of the cultured cell monolayer.boehringer scientists found evidence of a virus present in animals when they observed a cpe in cultured embryonic monkey kidney cells,one of the cell lines inoculated with prrs homogenate.
continued propagation of a virus requires that the virus be passaged,which entails removing an aliquot of the culture and adding it to a fresh culture of cells.boehringer scientists passaged the prrs virus eight times on cells,and deposited a sample of the virus from the eighth passage with the american type culture collection atcc,which assigned it deposit number.see boehringer ingelheim animal health.
the patent claims this process for growing and isolating the prrs virus inoculating cultured monkey cells with the prrs virus,and incubating the inoculated cells until a cpe is observed.boehringer suit against schering for infringement of the patent arises from schering production of its primepac vaccine against prrs.schering,like boehringer,developed a vaccine against prrs by attenuating the prrs virus in cell culture.attenuation is a process wherein a virus is repeatedly passaged on a cultured cell line,sometimes under altered culture conditions such as lowered temperature.variant viruses that are better adapted to grow on the cultured cell line will grow faster than the original virus after many serial passages,such a variant will completely replace the original in the culture.frequently,however,those variants adapted to grow in a particular environment such as cultured monkey kidney cells are to grow or cause disease in the original environment a live pig.if the attenuated virus will not productively infect pigs,but retains enough structural similarity to the original virus such that an immune response mounted against the attenuated virus will protect the pig against the original virus,then the attenuated virus may be used as a vaccine to protect against prrs.both boehringer and schering developed attenuated viruses effective as vaccines against prrs.
boehringer filed suit against schering in the district court for the district of new jersey,alleging that schering vaccine virus,which is also grown on monkey kidney cells,was prepared by a process that infringed the method claimed by the patent.upon boehringer motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court conducted a markman hearing and construed the claim terms isolating,swine infertility and respiratory syndrome virus,and incubating until cpe is observed.boehringer.at.the court construction of the until cpe is observed limitation precluded a finding of literal infringement,because schering vaccine production process measures the incubation period by time,rather than by level of cpe achieved.boehringer ingelheim animal health,d.however,this construction left open the possibility of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.id.at.
while the district court did not find that schering inequitable conduct defense posed an obstacle to boehringer request for a preliminary injunction,boehringer.at,the district court held that boehringer had not met its burden of showing that schering obviousness challenge lacked substantial merit.id.at.nor had boehringer established irreparable harm.id.at.the district court therefore denied boehringer motion for a preliminary injunction.
following the denial of various motions for summary judgment,boehringer,d at,the district court severed schering inequitable conduct defense from the infringement and obviousness issues,and in a ruling which schering has not appealed,held that boehringer had not engaged in inequitable conduct during prosecution of the patent.boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,d.the issues of infringement pared down to two questions of equivalence and obviousness were submitted to a jury,which found for boehringer on both issues.the district court denied schering motions for jmol or a new trial,boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,d,and entered judgment for boehringer.the district court also issued an injunction prohibiting schering not only from selling the accused vaccines,but also from literally or equivalently infringing the patent or directly or indirectly using the method of claim of the patent.
schering appeals the denial of its motion for jmol,asserting that the district court incorrectly construed the claims and that the jury verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.boehringer,contending that the district court construed the until cpe is observed limitation too narrowly.we exercise jurisdiction over the appeals pursuant to a.
we review the district court claim construction de novo,as a matter of law.cybor fas,en banc.claim is the only claim at issue in this case,and depends from claim 
a method of growing and isolating swine infertility and respiratory syndrome virus,which comprises inoculating the virus on a full or partial sheet of simian cells in the presence of serum in a suitable grown medium and incubating the inoculated cell sheet at about to until cpe is observed.
the method as recited in claim wherein the simian cell line is.
the first dispute over claim construction concerns whether the term isolating recited in the claim preamble imposes a limitation on the claim.while schering,as we shall see,argues that the district court construed isolating too broadly,boehringer asserts that the district court erred by treating isolating as a claim limitation at all.according to boehringer,isolating,as well as growing,are mere recitations of purpose and as such do not impose any limitations on the method defined by the balance of the claim.
boehringer is correct in that a preamble simply stating the intended use or purpose of the invention will usually not limit the scope of the claim,unless the preamble provides antecedents for ensuing claim terms and limits the claim accordingly.bard.neither growing nor isolating is required to provide antecedent basis for subsequent claim language.
anintended use or purpose usually will not limit the scope of the claim because such statements usually do no more than define a context in which the invention operates.but as we explained in griffin bertina,preamble language will limit the claim if it recites not merely a context in which the invention may be used,but the essence of the invention without which performance of the recited steps is nothing but an academic exercise.id.at,at.this principle holds true here,as it frequently does for method claims growing and isolating are not merely circumstances in which the method may be useful,but instead are the raison of the claimed method itself.divorced from the process of growing and isolating virus,the claimed method reduces to nothing more than a process for producing cytopathic effects in sheets of cultured process whose absence of fathomable utility rather suggests the academic exercise.gauging the effect of preamble language based on the claim as a whole,see bell communications research,vitalink communications,it becomes apparent that claim is in fact directed to a process for growing or isolating viruses.accordingly,the district court properly recognized isolating as part of the definition of the claimed subject matter and thereby a limitation of the claim.
having concluded that the district court correctly read isolating as imposing a limitation on the claim,we also conclude that the district court gave the term its proper construction.essentially adopting boehringer interpretation,the district court held that the virus is isolated not only when the virus is cultured from tissues of an infected animal the initial recovery of the virus,but also during subsequent serial passages of the virus,when the virus is cultured from an aliquot of an infected cell culture.boehringer.at.in other words,prrs virus is isolated according to claim each time the virus is propagated into a fresh tissue culture bottle,not just when the virus is initially isolated from an infected pig.
schering,however,contends that isolating can refer only to the initial growth of virus from an infected tissue sample or other natural source,and not to subsequent passages in culture.under such a construction,schering would escape infringement because schering isolated the virus from infected pigs in,before the patent issued.moreover,while schering grows its attenuated vaccine virus on cells,schering initially isolated the prrs virus on cultured porcine lung cells,rather than the simian cells required by the claims.
the first step in claim construction is to determine the ordinary and customary meaning,if any,that would be attributed to the term by those skilled in the art.rexnord laitram.dictionary definitions frequently are useful in this process.digital,telegenix,and in support of its construction the district court cited a common definition of isolate found in the random house college dictionary to set or place apart,detach or separate.boehringer.at.from this definition,the district court concluded that the prrs virus was isolated in each serial passage,when the virus was separated from the infected cells.
according to schering,however,the district court reliance on this definition was erroneous.because a term ordinary meaning is that which it assumes in the field of the invention,toro white consol,schering contends that the district court should have looked instead to narrower definitions found in dictionaries of microbiology and molecular of which define isolation as the process of obtaining a pure culture from a naturally occurring population.under such a definition,serial passaging of a virus during cell culture would not constitute isolating.
boehringer points out that schering technical definitions were not introduced into the record at trial,nor,apparently,were they in any way presented to the district court.like trial judges,we are free to consult dictionaries regardless of whether they have been offered by a party in evidence or not.digital,at,at.nonetheless,parties are obliged to make their claim construction arguments in the first instance to the district court,and we will rarely give weight to arguments that rely on sources brought forth for the first time on appeal.but schering technical dictionary definitions would carry little weight even if they had been first presented to the district court.schering leads off its argument with the following technical definition of isolation 
microbiol.any procedure in which a given species of organism,present in a particular sample or environment,is obtained in pure culture.
dictionary of microbiology and molecular biology ed emphases added.plainly,this definition does not require that the organism originate in a sample containing a natural or mixed population,and therefore easily encompasses propagation of a virus during serial passage,in which the virus is obtained from a culture comprising viruses,uninfected cells,infected cells,and dead cells.and while some of schering technical definitions do refer to obtaining organisms from natural populations,the remainder establish that the customary meaning of isolating in the field of the invention is broader than schering maintains.the district court therefore properly determined that the ordinary meaning of isolating encompasses more than the initial isolation of a virus from an infected tissue sample.
while there is a strong presumption that the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim term governs its construction,this presumption may be overcome by evidence from the specification or prosecution history showing that the patentee employed the term in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning.teleflex,ficosa am.schering contends that both the patent specification and prosecution history show reliance on a narrower meaning of isolating,but its arguments are not persuasive.under the heading isolation,the specification discloses both the culturing of tissue homogenate from infected animals,and several subsequent passages of the virus in culture.patent.thus,to the extent that the specification uses a form of the verb isolate,the specification supports the broader meaning of isolating advanced by boehringer rather than the narrower construction advocated by schering.schering also points to the fact that the specification uses the word recovered as a synonym for isolated,and uses the term recover only when referring to culture of the virus from tissue samples.but this observation strengthens boehringer position,not schering the use of a different word to describe the isolation of prrs virus from infected tissue samples recover suggests that isolate does not refer solely to this process.
schering prosecution history argument is similarly unavailing.during prosecution,boehringer submitted several publications to the patent and trademark office to establish that was the virus that caused prrs.because these references use the words isolate and isolation to refer to the recovery of the virus from tissues of infected animals,schering contends that the term isolating in the claims should be so limited.but while references submitted during prosecution may shed light on the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim term,a patentee does not renounce the ordinary meaning of a term merely by submitting a reference that employs a different meaning.absent a reliance on the narrower meaning by the patentee during prosecution,the references use of isolating in a narrower sense does not preclude the claim term from also encompassing steps subsequent to the initial isolation.the district court construed this term correctly.
the next claim term in dispute is swine infertility and respiratory syndrome virus,which describes the virus employed in the method of claim.the term derives simply from the deposit of the virus with the american type culture collection atcc,which assigned the accession number to the virus upon receiving boehringer deposit.patent,ll.the district court construed this term to mean the specific strain of prrs deposited with the atcc.boehringer.at.schering argues that the term should be limited to viruses only,which would exclude schering attenuated strain.boehringer,in contrast,argues that the term should be expanded to cover any prrs virus,or not,although boehringer does not explain exactly what any prrs virus would mean.we conclude that the district court again correctly chose the middle ground between the parties contentions.
schering argument simply seeks to add another limitation to the claim,and such arguments rarely succeed.the district court claim construction already specifies a virus,since the viral strain deposited with the atcc will indeed cause prrs.presumably,schering seeks to add an explicit limitation so that it may argue that a finding of equivalence would vitiate this limitation entirely.we are not persuaded.the specification,as schering points out,does state that will cause disease when administered to pigs.see patent,ll.however,the specification also refers to modified or attenuated live atcc,id.at,indicating that the term does not by itself demand pathogenicity.at bottom,schering argument is based on a simple fallacy given the premise that all prrs is caused by,all must therefore cause prrs.because such an argument is logically unsound,the district court correctly rejected schering attempt to add an additional limitation to the claim.
boehringer,on the other hand,urges that the district court erred by construing too narrowly the district court construed the term to mean the particular strain of prrs virus that boehringer deposited with the atcc,boehringer.at,although the district court did not explain exactly what properties must be shown to establish that an accused virus meets this definition.boehringer argues that this construction was erroneous,and that the term should be understood as a prototype or generic term for all prrs viruses,rather than as a reference to the deposited strain.
we find boehringer arguments no more persuasive than schering on this point.boehringer chose to claim its virus using the term,a term on its face referring to a particular atcc deposit.boehringer did not use the broader term prrs virus,nor did boehringer attempt to claim the virus in terms of the more general functional and structural properties disclosed by the specification.boehringer did not choose to define the term in the specification,nor did boehringer state that was a generic or prototype virus,nor did boehringer assert that viruses related to but not identical to the isolated strain were within the scope of the invention.these choices must be held against it.we therefore conclude that the district court properly construed to refer to the strain of virus deposited with the atcc.
incubating until cpe is observed 
claims and require,after a sheet of simian cells has been inoculated with a viral sample,that the cell sheet be incubated at a defined temperature range until cpe is observed,that is,until viral growth manifests itself in an observable perturbation of the cultured cells.the dispute over construction of this limitation is whether it defines only the minimum period for which the cells must be incubated,or whether it also establishes an ending point beyond which incubation is not permitted.before the district court,boehringer argued that this term requires that the incubation period continue long enough for cpe to be observed,but that the process need not be stopped immediately after the first observation.boehringer.at.that is,under boehringer interpretation,all the claim requires is that incubation continue at least up to the point where some degree of cpe is observed.schering,however,argued that until cpe is observed means that the incubation is stopped immediately upon first observation of cpe,and any incubation that continues longer does not infringe.schering would presumably escape infringement under such a construction,even under the doctrine of equivalents,because schering timed incubation continues well past the point at which cpe first becomes observable.
the district court agreed with schering that until cpe is observed requires the incubation period to stop upon observation of cpe.drawing an analogy to a recipe for cooking a turkey,the court reasoned that an instruction such as cook the turkey until the skin is browned necessarily implies that the cook should stop once the skin is browned else the turkey would be singed and blackened rather than browned.id.likewise,the court concluded that an instruction to incubate the cell sheet until cpe is observed requires that incubation be stopped once cpe is observed.
the district court recognized,however,that in the embodiments disclosed in the specification,incubation does not halt immediately upon the first observation of cpe,but rather continues until good or cpe is observed.see,patent,ll,ll.to avoid a claim interpretation inconsistent with these embodiments,the district court interpolated the word significant into the claim incubation must proceed until there is a significant degree of cpe.boehringer.at emphasis added.while this claim construction precluded boehringer from establishing literal infringement,because schering incubates its cells for a defined period of time rather than until a particular level of cpe is observed,it left open the possibility that schering timing mechanism could meet this limitation by the doctrine of equivalents.boehringer,d at.
we think the untenability of the district court claim construction is exposed by the court need to interpolate significant into the claim to save its construction.while incubation must be stopped at some point to recover the virus for subsequent passages,and undoubtedly the yield of viral recovery may be optimized by stopping the incubation at a particular point,the claim does not include any language or limitation relating to degree of viral recovery if any.the claim retains its utility even if incubation is continued past the point of significant cpe or good viral recovery.rather than insert an additional limitation into the claim,the better course is to rely on a construction of until cpe is observed that does not require such an interpolation.we hold that this limitation merely defines the minimum period for incubation of the inoculated cell sheet.
boehringer argues correctly that because the claim language is open,employing the preamble term comprising,the claimed method is open to additional steps.thus,while the claim requires a minimal incubation time proceeding until the observation of cpe,additional periods of incubation after that point are not excluded.to use the district court meleagrine analogy,one may add an additional step to the recipe continuing to cook the turkey until the skin is burned to a crisp.such an additional step is permissible from the structure of the open claim language,and the district court rejection of such a step was based on the premise that the claim object is defeated if cooking proceeds too long.because the utility of claim is not premised on a particular stopping point,there is no barrier to additional incubation periods.
this error,the only one we find in the district court thorough and skillful management of this case,was nonetheless harmless.as we explain below,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that schering process satisfies this claim limitation under the doctrine of equivalents,even under an overly narrow claim construction.the question of whether schering process would literally infringe under the correct claim construction need not be resolved.
a finding of literal infringement having been precluded by the district court construction of the claim limitations until cpe is observed and,see boehringer,d at,the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was presented to the jury.the jury was asked to render verdicts on the following two questions 
did boehringer prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the swine infertility and respiratory syndrome virus,as used in schering process for the production of its primepac vaccines is equivalent to the swine infertility and respiratory syndrome virus,as used in claim of the patent 
did boehringer prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the incubation period of hours hours as used in schering process for the production of its primepac vaccines is equivalent to the timing device of until cpe is observed as used in claim of the patent 
the jury answered yes to both questions,and the di
