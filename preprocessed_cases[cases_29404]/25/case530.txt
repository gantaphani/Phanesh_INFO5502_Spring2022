duramed pharmaceuticals,duramed appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york granting summary judgment of noninfringement to paddock laboratories,paddock.duramed.paddock,d.because the district court did not err in holding that prosecution history estoppel bars duramed allegations of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,we affirm.
background 
duramed owns patent patent,which claims conjugated estrogen pharmaceutical compositions for use in hormone replacement therapies.the claimed conjugated estrogens are extremely water sensitive and thus highly susceptible to moisture degradation during storage.see patent ll.accordingly,duramed developed a formulation for conjugated estrogens that includes a moisture barrier coating mbc to inhibit the absorption of moisture and reduce degradation.see id.ll.
duramed filed a patent application on its formulation on july.original independent claim recited a conjugated estrogen pharmaceutical composition coated with a moisture barrier coating.original dependent claim limited said moisture barrier coating to one that comprises ethylcellulose.the examiner rejected both claims as obvious,but during an interview advised that he would allow the application if duramed amended claim to include,inter alia,the limitations of claim.in a response received december,duramed amended claim to recite pharmaceutical compositions with a moisture barrier coating comprising ethylcellulose.claim of the issued patent,the patent only independent claim,accordingly reads as follows 
a pharmaceutical composition in a solid,unit dosage form capable of oral administration for the hormonal treatment of,menopausal and disorders in a woman comprising 
conjugated estrogens coated onto one or more organic excipients forming a powdered conjugated estrogen composition where said composition is substantially free of inorganic excipients and further comprises about organic excipient and about forming organic excipient by weight and having less than about free water by weight and greater than total water wherein said solid unit dosage form is coated with a moisture barrier coating comprising ethylcellulose.
patent claim emphasis added.
in march,duramed filed suit against paddock under e,alleging infringement of the patent based on paddock abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic version of duramed hormone replacement therapy product,cenestin.duramed alleged infringement of claims,and under the doctrine of equivalents,because paddock proposed generic product uses a polyvinyl alcohol pva mbc,marketed as opadry amb.paddock moved for summary judgment of noninfringement,arguing that duramed was barred by prosecution history estoppel from alleging that pva met the moisture barrier coating comprising ethylcellulose limitation of the asserted claims.
in its motion for summary judgment,paddock relied on several references,including an international patent application filed by colorcon pursuant to the patent cooperation treaty the colorcon pct.the colorcon pct,published on january,discloses formulations of mbcs,including opadry amb,but also,in a section entitled description of the prior art,notes several technical drawbacks of using pva as an mbc.paddock also relied on patent the groppenbächer patent,which issued in and discloses the use of pva in tablets an article in the december issue of manufacturing chemist that tests pva mbcs and concludes that opadry amb is a highly effective moisture barrier formulation three scientific articles on pva mbcs authored for distribution at scientific conferences in may,may,and november and invoices indicating sales of opadry amb by colorcon before september.
the district court granted paddock motion for summary judgment of noninfringement,holding that prosecution history estoppel barred duramed infringement allegations.duramed,d at.the district court first held that duramed amendment adding the ethylcellulose limitation was substantially related to patentability and narrowed the scope of the asserted claims,thus triggering the presumption under festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,en banc festo ix,that duramed had surrendered all territory between the original and amended claim scope.duramed,d at.
the district court then held that duramed had failed to rebut the festo presumption based on an argument of,inter alia,the unforeseeability of the use of pva as an mbc in a pharmaceutical formulation.id.at.rather,the court held that pva mbcs were foreseeable at the time of duramed narrowing amendment based on the colorcon pct description of pva as a moisture barrier coating for pharmaceutical tablets and the like and its disclosure of the opadry amb formulation used in paddock proposed generic product.id.at.the court noted that several other facts reinforced this decision the invoices for the sale of opadry amb and the groppenbächer patent,which teaches coating tablets with pva to ensure moisture tight ness and insolub ility in the gastrointestinal tract.id.at.finally,the court rejected duramed argument that the colorcon pct disclosure of pva mbcs technical drawbacks raised serious questions about pva effectiveness as an mbc,concluding that even if the effectiveness of pva was unknown in,that would not mean that pva mbcs were unforeseeable.id.at.
duramed timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,reapplying the same standard applied by the district court.iovate health,bioengineered supplements nutrition.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
under the doctrine of the equivalents,a product or process that does not literally infringe the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there is equivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention.warner jenkinson hilton davis chem,citing graver tank linde air prods.however,the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel prevents a patent owner from recapturing through the doctrine of equivalents subject matter surrendered to acquire the patent.see festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,festo viii.
because during prosecution duramed narrowed the scope of the patent claims in response to a prior art rejection,a presumption of prosecution history estoppel applies.see festo ix,at.nonetheless,duramed may rebut that presumption by showing,inter alia,the alleged equivalent would have been unforeseeable at the time of the amendment and thus beyond a fair interpretation of what was surrendered.id.at quoting festo viii,at.a n alternative is foreseeable if it is disclosed in the pertinent prior art in the field of the invention.in other words,an alternative is foreseeable if it is known in the field of the invention as reflected in the claim scope before amendment.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,festo x.foreseeability is a question of law based on underlying issues of fact.id.at.
on appeal,duramed argues that the district court applied the wrong legal test for foreseeability and thus held that any mention of an alleged equivalent in the prior art makes that equivalent foreseeable as a matter of law.but,according to duramed,an equivalent is not foreseeable if it was not understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for use in the invention as originally claimed.and,in this case,duramed asserts,the relevant art did not disclose either pva or opadry amb as suitable mbcs for pharmaceutical compounds,like conjugated estrogens.
paddock responds that the district court applied the correct foreseeability standard,which requires only that pva be foreseeable as an mbc for pharmaceutical applications at the time of duramed narrowing amendment.in this case,according to paddock,the colorcon pct alone renders pva mbcs foreseeable,but this conclusion is bolstered by colorcon commercialization of opadry amb,the groppenbächer patent,and the other references not considered by the district court.
we agree with paddock
