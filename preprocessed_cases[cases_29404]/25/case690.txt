housey is the owner by assignment of patents,and,all of which are titled method of screening for protein inhibitors or activators.concerning the limitation inhibitor or activator of a protein,the parties treat the use of the limitation in claim of the patent as representative,and we do likewise 
a method of determining whether a substance is an inhibitor or activator of a protein whose production by a cell evokes a responsive change in a phenotypic characteristic other than the level of said protein in said cell per se,which comprises 
a providing a first cell line which produces said protein and exhibits said phenotypic response to the protein 
b providing a second cell line which produces the protein at a lower level than the first cell line,or does not produce the protein at all,and which exhibits said phenotypic response to the protein to a lesser degree or not at all 
c incubating the substance with the first and second cell lines and 
d comparing the phenotypic response of the first cell line to the substance with the phenotypic response of the second cell line to the substance.
patent,ll.emphasis added.
the patented method is an assay,or test,to determine whether a substance,often a candidate for a pharmaceutical product or drug,is an inhibitor or activator of a particular protein the protein of interest or poi in a cell.steps a and b of the method require the existence of two different cell lines.one cell line produces more of the poi,and the other produces less,or none,of the poi.the cell line producing more of the poi is sometimes referred to as the test cell line,and the cell line producing less or none of the poi is sometimes referred to as the control cell line.additionally,the two cell lines are differentiated by the fact that the increase in the amount of the poi in one of the cell lines modifies some characteristic in that cell line.in the language of claim of the patent,the relevant characteristic of each of the cell lines is labeled a phenotypic response to a different concentration of the poi,and the difference between the relevant characteristic in the two cell lines presumably caused by the increase in the poi is a responsive change in a phenotypic characteristic.in step c of the method,the substance being screened is added to each of the cell lines.step d requires comparing the effect that the substance has on the phenotypic response to the poi in each cell line.
in housey words,the method requires treating the two cells with a test substance to determine whether that substance inhibits the cellular functioning of the poi as measured by modulations of the responsive change in the phenotypic characteristic of one cell,compared with the modulations of the same responsive phenotypic characteristic,if any,in the other cell.the method is allegedly valuable because if the substance being screened impacts the phenotypic response of the cell with an increased concentration of the poi and does not affect the cell containing less or none of the poi in the same way,a logical guess is that the substance has this differential impact because the substance has an effect on the poi.this knowledge is valuable if a poi is believed to be implicated in a certain disease,and a substance is known to affect that poi,then the substance is more likely to have some value in treating the disease than another substance which does not affect the biological activity of the poi.
the district court conducted a markman hearing and construed five claim terms disputed by the parties,including inhibitor or activator of a protein,which was held to mean a substance that has a greater effect on the phenotype of cells that express the protein of interest at a higher level than on the phenotype of cells that express the protein of interest at a lower level or not at all.
the district court considered and expressly rejected housey argument that an activator or inhibitor of a protein was limited to substances that directly interact with,bind to,the target protein.the interpretation adopted by the district court includes within an inhibitor or activator of a protein substances that affect the test cell responsive change in a phenotypic characteristic through the concept to which housey argues the term is absolutely limited.in addition,however,it is broader it includes substances that operate through other indirect concepts of molecular interaction.for example,under the district court interpretation,a substance being screened may still be an inhibitor or activator of a protein if it binds to and alters the metabolic functioning of a molecule other than the poi that is essential to either a biochemical pathway required to produce the poi in the first place or a biochemical pathway in which the fully formed poi participates in the cell in order to trigger the phenotypic response.in other words,the district court definition includes within the scope of an inhibitor or activator of a protein substances that inhibit or activate the biological activity of the poi in the cell without binding to the poi itself.
housey stipulated that,based upon the court construction of the claim limitation inhibitor or activator of a protein,and subject to its right to appeal the court claim construction and any final judgment based thereon,that the court may enter an order stating that the patents in suit are invalid and not infringed.housey and the defendants,however,reserve d all of their claims,counterclaims,arguments and defenses if the court determinations on issues of claim construction related to inhibitor or activator of a protein are reversed or modified on appeal such that the matter is remanded for further consideration.based on the stipulation,the district court entered final judgment in favor of the defendants.
housey appealed to us,and we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to a.
we review the district court claim construction de novo.cybor fas,en banc.claim construction begins with the language of the claims.johnson worldwide,zebco.when construing patent claims,there is a heavy presumption that the language in the claim carries its ordinary and customary meaning,ccs fitness,brunswick,amongst artisans of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of the invention,lansa.dictionaries and treatises may provide insight into a term ordinary meaning thus defined.digital,telegenix.however,a claim must also be considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence,namely the claims,the specification,and the prosecution history.rexnord laitram.if there is a discernable plain and ordinary meaning of the claim language,then this meaning usually defines the scope of the claims unless the patentee has explicitly disclaimed or clearly disavowed this meaning in the specification or prosecution history.medrad,requiring words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction before broad terms in a claim will be read narrowly in light of a narrow specification quoting teleflex,ficosa am,middleton.mining,this court also considers the prosecution history to determine whether the applicant clearly and unambiguously disclaimed or disavowed any interpretation during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance.quoting standard oil am.cyanamid,alteration in original.for example,the patentee may act as his own lexicographer and expressly define the term in the specification.see.digital,at rexnord,at.
the language of claim of the patent clearly supports the district court construction and is inimical to any narrower construction.the claim recites a method of determining whether a substance is an inhibitor or activator of a protein.patent,ll.the steps of the method in turn permit a determination of whether substances affect phenotypic response to the poi in the test and control cells differently.thus,if a substance has a greater effect on the phenotype of cells that express the protein of interest at a higher level than on the phenotype of cells that express the protein of interest at a lower level or not at all,the substance is,as defined by the claimed method itself,an inhibitor or activator of the protein of interest.
furthermore,the specification expressly defines an inhibitor or activator of a protein as a substance that yields a positive response to the claimed method,just as the district court did.see id.at,ll.substances which specifically inhibit or inactivate sic the poi may be distinguished from substances which affect cell morphology or growth by other mechanisms in that they will have a greater effect on the test lines than on the control line.id.at,ll.inhibitors or activators are identified by their greater effect on the phenotype of the higher producing cell line.
housey argues that the district court construction confuses the method of distinguishing activators or inhibitors with the definition of activators or inhibitors.we disagree.the claim addresses a method of determining whether a compound is an inhibitor or activator that is conducted by observing whether a particular event occurs when the method is performed.it is therefore logical to construe an inhibitor or activator of a protein as a substance that precipitates that event,especially given that the specification,too,defines an inhibitor or activator in the same way.
housey principal argument on appeal with respect to the construction of inhibitor or activator of a protein is the same one that was rejected by the district court housey argues that this limitation is properly construed to mean substances that interact with,bind to,the poi in order to exert their inhibiting or activating effect on the cellular functioning of the poi.we do not agree that,as used in the patent,an inhibitor or activator of a protein is limited to substances that achieve their effect on the biological activity of the poi through a particular reaction mechanism,namely binding to the poi.a substance need only have a greater effect on the phenotype of cells that express the protein of interest at a higher level than on the phenotype of cells that express the protein of interest at a lower level or not at all to be an inhibitor or activator of a protein,and an inhibitor or activator of a poi may alter the biological activity of the poi through a direct mechanism or an indirect mechanism.the word bind or binding appears nowhere in the patent in conjunction with an inhibitor or activator of a protein.
at oral argument and thus on the late side of things,housey produced definitions of inhibitor and activator from technical dictionaries to argue for the first time on appeal that the plain meaning of an inhibitor or activator of a protein is limited to a substance that binds to the protein.with respect to an inhibitor or activator of an enzyme,these definitions do include a limitation.see chambers dictionary of science and technology defining activator as o f an enzyme,a small molecule which binds to it and increases its activity henderson dictionary of biological terms ed defining inhibitor as a substance which prevents the normal action of an enzyme by binding to the active site or by binding to other parts of the enzyme.however,the claim language is an inhibitor or activator of a protein,not of an enzyme and the dictionaries also include a more appropriate general definition of both activator and inhibitor that requires only an effect on the biological activity of the protein,regardless of the mechanism used to achieve that effect.see chambers dictionary of science and technology defining activator as a ny agent whose presence stimulates biochemical or physiological changes henderson dictionary of biological terms defining inhibitor as any agent which checks or prevents an action or process.thus,according to the evidence submitted by housey,the plain meaning of inhibitor or activator of a protein does not support the inclusion of the concept as a limitation on the claimed method.
the intrinsic evidence of the patent does not clearly disavow this broad plain meaning.in fact,even if the plain meaning were considered to be ambiguous,supporting both a narrower definition limited to inhibitors and activators that bind to the poi and a broader definition of inhibitors and activators that need only affect the biological activity of the poi,the district court was correct because the specification and prosecution history affirmatively demonstrate that housey intended the broader meaning that is not limited to direct binding.
the specification foresaw the possibility of a substance affecting the responsive change in a phenotypic characteristic in the cell line with the greater amount of poi without the substance binding to the poi.see patent,ll.c ell lines will be sensitive in their growth properties in the their relevant phenotypic characteristic to chemical agents which are capable of binding to,or modifying the biological effects of,the poi.emphasis added the specification also expressly defines the terms inhibitors and activators in terms of the biological activity of the poi the term inhibitors includes both substance s which reduce the activity of the poi and th o se which nullify it altogether.id.at ll.the term activators,as used herein,includes both substances necessary for the poi to become active in the first place,and substances which merely accentuate its activity.
housey statements in the prosecution history of the patent also support this conclusion.in distinguishing prior art during prosecution,housey repeatedly characterized his invention as one that could determine whether a substance interacted with the biological pathway in which a particular protein functioned the prior art did not provide the target pathway specificity of the present invention.because biological pathways usually involve more than one protein,a substance can clearly interact with the poi biological pathway without binding with the poi itself,and housey stated as much in the process of distinguishing another prior art reference 
substances identified or characterized using the teachings of the housey patents will be found to interact directly with the target protein itself with other proteins in which the target protein also interacts in the form of dimeric or multimeric complexes.in this fashion,the approach disclosed in the housey patents provides a specificity between a target protein and its attendant biochemical pathways within the cell that is impossible to achieve with other assay systems.
housey argues that an inhibitor or activator is limited to substances that bind to the poi because the claim language specifies an inhibitor or activator of a protein.the fact that the biological activity of a protein is affected by a screened substance,however,lends no insight into whether the effect must be attributed to binding to the protein or some other type of influence on the biological pathways through which the protein is created and in which the protein functions.
similarly,housey argues that the recurring presence of the terms specific and specifically in the specification and the prosecution history conclusively demonstrates that the inhibitor or activator operates by binding with the poi.see,patent,ll.in particular,the invention is concerned with a method of screening for substances which specifically inhibit or activate a particular protein.emphasis added id.at,ll.describing the invention as having a specificity for detecting an active agent exceeding that of the prior art assays id.at ll.t he method which we describe herein involves the generation of a cell line purposefully engineered to detect both stimulatory and inhibitory agents which are absolutely specific for any given protein which affects the cultural of morphological characteristics of a cell.emphasis added id.at,ll.stating that the method was screening for substances which may contain biologically active agents specific to the poi emphasis added.leaving aside the absence of the word specific in the claim language and our repeated warnings not to import limitations from the specification that are not present in the claims,amgen hoechst marion roussel,the danger of improperly importing a limitation is even greater when the purported limitation is based upon a term not appearing in the claim,this language from the specification does not lead to a strong inference of direct binding to the poi.as the sections of the prosecution history demonstrate,the use of specific suggests equally as strongly that the biological activity of the poi is affected,through a direct or indirect mechanism,when the biological activity of other proteins in other biochemical pathways is not.furthermore,the specification,too,equates specificity with the biological effect of the inhibitor or activator,not with any particular mechanism of action.see patent,ll.substances which specifically inhibit or inactivate the poi may be distinguished from substances which affect cell morphology or growth by other mechanisms in that they will have a greater effect on the test lines than on the control line.emphasis added 
finally,housey points to language at the end of one of the specific embodiments in the specification and argues that it demonstrates that the patented assay must be able to detect substances that bind to the poi t his work establishes,for the first time,the fact that stable overproduction of a protein in mammalian cells can result in a novel cellular phenotype s which can be directly modulated by chemical agents which interact with the protein.id.at,ll.emphasis added.first,this passage does not indicate that the interaction between the agent being screened and the poi must be in the form of direct binding another protein or cellular component may provide the mechanism through which the agent interacts with the poi.second,not only does this passage describe only a single embodiment and limitations on specific embodiments are not to be imported into the claims,see electro med,cooper life,but it describes an embodiment in which there is a direct relationship between the molar amount of inhibitor or activator required to prevent or stimulate the phenotypic response and the molar amount of the poi present in each cell line.patent,ll.this additional fact notes a direct relationship between the amount of poi overexpressed in the test cell and the amount of inhibitor or activator required to eliminate the responsive change in a phenotypic characteristic.if true,this fact may or may not permit one of skill in the art to use the claimed method to divine that the inhibitor or activator binds directly to the poi,but it unquestionably is not a claimed limitation in the method of determining whether a substance is an inhibitor or activator of a protein of claim of the patent.
housey invokes two canons of claim construction to support limiting an inhibitor or activator of a protein to a substance that binds to that protein,but neither is persuasive.first,housey cites athletic alternatives,prince manfacturing,for the proposition that in the event of a tie between a broader and narrower meaning,the notice function of patent law requires that the narrower meaning prevails.housey misreads athletic alternatives.in that unusual case,one patent applicant made two contradictory and irreconcilable affirmative representations of the contested limitation.in those circumstances,we held that the narrower interpretation trumps the broader interpretation.in this case,there are no contradictory and irreconcilable choices for the meaning of inhibitor or activator of a protein.second,housey relies on the axiom that c laims should be so construed,if possible,as to sustain their validity.rhine casio,quoting carman,wahl.here,we have not been asked to review validity,and the district court did not pass on validity.housey stipulation of invalidity alone is insufficient to invoke this canon.in any event,the canon lacks dispositive effect in this case.see,at u nless the court concludes,after applying all the available tools of claim construction,that the claim is still ambiguous,the axiom regarding the construction to preserve the validity of the claim does not apply.
we agree with the district court construction of the activator or inhibitor of a protein limitation,and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
it is time to restore the law of claim construction to a more apt wisdom and more usable simplicity.the only issue in this case is the construction of the phrase inhibitor or activator of a protein.my colleagues approach to construction is based on confusing recent pronouncements of panels of this court,contravening earlier statements of precedent,thus adding to the confusion.
the panel majority propounds the rule that the plain and ordinary meaning of the claim language should be used to define the scope of the claims unless the inventor has explicitly disclaimed or clearly disavowed this meaning.op.at.the panel majority states that absent such disclaimer,claims are inimical to any narrower construction.op.at.precedent is exactly contrary a claim is inimical to any broader construction than the invention set forth in the specification,and reliance on dictionaries,even technical dictionaries,without due consideration of the context of the invention may lead to absurd results 
indiscriminate reliance on definitions found in dictionaries can often produce absurd results.words are used in many senses and often have diametrically opposed meanings,depending upon the sense in which they are used.one searching for the dictionary definitions of effectively or effect will find among the numerous definitions listed many which are indisputably inapplicable to the instant use of the word effectively.but the words in which a claim is couched may not be read in a vacuum.one need not arbitrarily pick and choose from the various accepted definitions of a word to decide which meaning was intended as the word is used in a given claim.the subject matter,the context,will more often than not lead to the correct conclusion.
liebscher boothroyd.see also,netword,llc centraal,the claims are directed to the invention that is described in the specification they do not have meaning removed from the context from which they arose.toro white consol,w ords of ordinary usage must nonetheless be construed in the context of the patent documents.thus the court must determine how a person of experience in the field of this invention would,upon reading the patent documents,understand the words used to define the invention.renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,a common meaning,such as one expressed in a relevant dictionary,that flies in the face of the patent disclosure is undeserving of fealty t he interpretation to be given a term can only be determined and confirmed with a full understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to envelop with the claim.claims to an invention that is not described in the specification are an anachronism.many inventions concern complex and detailed technology,and the terse style of the patent claim is not a replacement for the elaboration in the written description.the claims are the concluding portion of the specification,and their statutory function is particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.a claim has no meaning out of the context of the invention that is described,enabled,and prosecuted.
this case again illustrates the conflict generated in the court recent jurisprudence of claim construction.the panel majority reinforces the recently created dominance of general definitions
