in august,weider notified merck that it was no longer interested in forming a joint venture to market mthf in the united states,explaining that the advertising expenses associated with such a project were too high.weider stated,however,that it would like to purchase two kilograms of mthf on a basis.weider explained that i n order to complete the transaction,it needed information on the price for the product.weider also informed merck that it would like to handle the purchase of mthf in a way that was simplest for both companies.
in response,on september,roland martin,a manager in merck health,cosmetic and nutrition business unit,sent weider a signed fax stating 
w e would like to handle your purchase of mthf very simpl y.
therefore please send the order to my attention and i will arrange everything.in addition we need the exact delivery.

here,because merck does not challenge the district court determination that mthf was ready for patenting by september,district court decision,d at,our focus is on whether there was an invalidating commercial offer to sell the product prior to the critical date april.in making this determination,we apply traditional contract law principles.allen eng g bartell,see also grp.one,at explaining that the offer must meet the level of an offer for sale in the contract sense,one that would be understood as such in the commercial community.only an offer which rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale,one which the other party could make into a binding contract by simple acceptance assuming consideration,constitutes an offer for sale under b.grp.one,at.
by august,weider had decided that it did not wish to enter into a partnership with merck to market mthf in the united
