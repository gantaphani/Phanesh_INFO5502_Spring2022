richelle pafford pafford alleges that her dtap,mmr and opv vaccinations resulted in the onset of systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pafford sec y of health human,wl trial court decision.because the special master correctly interpreted and applied the relevant statutory test for proving causation in cases,this court affirms.
on march,pafford received a series of vaccinations from her doctor,jay schmidt schmidt.trial court decision,wl,at.the vaccinations administered by schmidt during this office visit included a dtap vaccination,pafford fourth opv vaccination,and a second mmr vaccination.id.pafford had received routine childhood immunizations prior to this.both her first and second dtp,opv,and hib vaccinations were normal id.however,she developed a faint maculopapular rash approximately seventeen days after receiving her third dtp and opv vaccinations and her first mmr vaccination.id.
earlier that month,on march,schmidt had treated pafford for a cold and diarrhea.approximately one week later,on march,pafford was seen by schmidt for inflamed tonsils with white patches on them and a fever of degrees fahrenheit.id.she tested negative for strep.id.at her march,visit,schmidt examined pafford and noted that the tonsillitis had cleared.id.as was the case throughout her early childhood years,schmidt concluded that pafford was showing normal growth and development without any unusual medical problems.id.
on april,pafford developed a fever and complained of neck pain.id.the fever resolved itself,but the neck pain continued.id.schmidt saw pafford on april,for her neck pain.id.by that time,she had developed a diffuse,pink,macular rash,whitish spots on her tongue.id.she also complained of limb pain.id.schmidt diagnosed her with a rash and recommended that she avoid exposure to others for five days.id.on april,pafford was taken to a local hospital emergency room with a fever,vomiting,pain on being touched and a rash on her hands,legs,chest,and upper abdominal area.id.at.the hospital doctor,bell,noted that t he rash was very viral in character and i did not feel it was related to her immunizations but suggested a cbc to see if it supported the viral picture.id.pafford was admitted and her symptoms quickly dissipated.id.she tested positive for a bacterial infection known as mycoplasma which bell determined to be the cause of pafford symptoms.id.she was released from the hospital the next day because her rash and fever had disappeared.id.on april,bell saw pafford for a recurrence of her symptoms.bell diagnosed pafford with systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,also known as still disease.id.
pafford parents,on behalf of pafford,brought a claim under the national childhood vaccine injury act,to,in the court of federal claims.they alleged that their daughter development of still disease was a result of the vaccinations she received on march.id.at.on july,special master richard abell issued a decision denying pafford claim.id.special master abell determined that a vaccine can cause still disease but that pafford had not sufficiently demonstrated that in her case the vaccine did cause the development of still disease.id.
following an appeal,court of federal claims judge lawrence block issued an opinion sustaining the special master decision.pafford hhs.pafford filed a motion for reconsideration alleging legal error with regard to standards of proof and the allocation of burdens which was denied on march.
this court reviews the united states court of federal claims review of the special master decision without deference.hines sec y of health human.thus,this court examines the special master legal determinations under a not in accordance with law standard and factual determinations under an arbitrary and capricious standard.munn sec y of health human.
generally a petitioner can obtain compensation under the vaccine injury program in two ways.see id.at.in a table case,the petitioner has an initial burden to prove an injury listed in the vaccine injury table within the prescribed time period under the requirements of a.see capizzano sec y of health human,citations omitted.upon satisfying this initial burden,the petitioner earns a presumption of causation.at that point,the burden shifts to the respondent to prove that a factor unrelated to the vaccination actually caused the illness,disability,injury,or condition.a a,b.
the other avenue for compensation does not involve the presumption of causation conferred by the table.in an case also known as a claim,the petitioner can not obtain a presumption of causation.rather,the petitioner in an case has the burden to prove the vaccination in question caused the illness,disability,injury,or condition.a,c c ii i.pafford does not allege she suffered a table injury.thus,pafford must prove or that the vaccine was actually the cause of her injuries.
under this court precedent,pafford must prove by preponderant evidence both that her vaccinations were a substantial factor in causing the illness,disability,injury or condition and that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of the vaccination.shyface sec y of health human,we adopt the restatement rule for purposes of determining vaccine injury,that an action is the legal cause of harm if that action is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm,and that the harm would not have occurred but for the action.this court recently articulated an alternative test.to show causation in fact,the petitioner must show 
a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury 
a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury and a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and injury.
capizzano,at citing althen sec y of health human.of course,as noted in shyface,these prongs must cumulatively show that the vaccination was a cause of the harm,rather than just an insubstantial contributor in,or one among several possible causes of,the harm.
the special master applied the tests of althen and shyface correctly in this case.specifically,the special master indicated 
first,a petitioner must provide a reputable medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury.in fine,can the vaccine s at issue cause the type of injury alleged second,a petitioner must also prove that the vaccine actually caused the alleged symptoms in her particular case.
trial court decision,wl,at emphasis in original.the first prong of the special master test is identical to the first prong of the althen test.capizzano,at citing althen,at.the special master inquiry also gave effect to the logical sequence of cause and effect at the heart of the second prong of the althen test.trial court decision,wl,at discussing levin testimony linking pafford march vaccinations to the onset of still disease.most importantly,the second prong of the special master test in this case restates correctly that the petitioner must show that the vaccine was the but for cause of the harm according to shyface,or in other words,that the vaccine was the reason for the injury as stated in the second prong of the althen test.finally,the special master also required proof of a proximate temporal relationship between pafford vaccinations and the onset of still disease commensurate with the third prong of the althen test.trial court decision,wl,at the link missing from petitioner argument was the lack of any defined time period in which one would expect to see the onset of still disease subsequent to a triggering event.thus,this court perceives no significant difference between the special master test and that established by this court in althen and shyface.
this court turns next to the evidence of record on.notably,the causation evidence of record consists primarily of testimony from two of pafford experts,levin and geier,and scientific literature on which their testimony was based.as discussed below,this court finds it was not arbitrary and capricious for the special master to conclude on this record that pafford did not prove causation by preponderant evidence.
applying the causation test to the facts before the court,the special master determined that pafford proved only one of the two prongs of his test by preponderant evidence.specifically,the special master noted,while it is biologically plausible that one or more of the vaccinations at issue could cause the onset of still disease,trial court decision,wl,at,pafford did not prove that the vaccinations were a cause of her contracting still disease,pafford failed to satisfy the prong of the shyface test,id.at.the special master was particularly troubled by the lack of evidence demonstrating any defined time period in which one would expect to see the onset of still disease subsequent to a triggering event.id.
to the special master,the absence of temporal linkage evidence prevented him from finding that a vaccination was the reason for the injury rather than other contemporaneous events unrelated to the vaccinations.id.at a bsent an appropriate time frame,the court can not find the mere temporal proximity of the vaccination and injury dispositive.these contemporaneous events included a positive test for mycoplasma a type of bacteria showing a thickening of the sinus membrane consistent with a sinus infection an earlier bout of tonsillitis and an earlier cold accompanied by diarrhea.id.at.thus,according to the special master,pafford did not prove by preponderant evidence that one or more of her vaccinations were a cause of her contracting still disease.
on appeal,pafford argues t he special master placed an untoward and legally impermissible burden on petitioners as part of the inquiry to prove it was the vaccinations rather than the other contemporaneous events that triggered her still disease.brief for pafford at,pafford sec y of health human,wl petitioner brief see trial court decision,wl,at ruling out other potential causes is an essential element but does not itself establish causation.pafford argues that t his is contrary to the express terms of the statute,whereby a b contemplates the grant of compensation unless alternate causation by known factors is shown by a preponderance.petitioner brief at emphasis in original.pafford relies primarily on two of this court cases,shyface and grant as interpreted by shyface for the proposition that a petitioner need not rule out alternative causes in proving actual causation.
contrary to pafford reading,shyface and grant do not stand for this premise.shyface was a vaccine injury case involving an infant april,dpt vaccination shyface sec y of health human,wl,at,rev.four days after inoculation,the infant was taken to a hospital with a fever hovering between and f tragically the infant died from the fever the same day.id.at.subsequent tests revealed the presence of a bacterial infection that could not be ruled out as the cause of death.id.thus,at trial,petitioners expert theorized the dpt vaccination caused the infant fever,which was then significantly exacerbated by the infection.id.at.in other words,petitioners expert argued there were two causes,the vaccination and the infection,each of the causes being a substantial factor in the infant death.when presented with this theory,the special master found preponderant evidence linking the dpt vaccination to the infant death,but still rejected petitioners claim because it is impossible to know with any degree of confidence,which source is the predominant cause of death.id.at.
on appeal,this court reversed.shyface,at.this court held that,in order to establish a prima facie case,the petitioners had to show that the dpt vaccine was both a cause of and a substantial factor in the infant death.id.the court went on to explain that,while the vaccination must be a substantial factor in the infant death,it need not be the sole factor or even the predominant factor.id.at.thus,the court reversed the special master decision in favor of respondent the special master should have awarded compensation to the petitioners who had proven the dpt vaccine was both a cause of and a substantial factor in the infant death.id.at.
unlike shyface,the petitioner here never established that the vaccinations were a cause of her contracting still disease.thus,this case does not feature several causes,one of which is a vaccination.rather,the special master concluded he was unable to tell whether any of the vaccinations made any contribution to her contracting still disease due,in part,to the absence of evidence indicating an appropriate time frame in which still disease will manifest subsequent to a triggering event.trial court decision,wl,at.without such a defined time period,the link between the vaccinations and the injury is tenuous.id.at.as noted earlier,this reasoning applies properly the tests of althen and shyface.
evidence demonstrating petitioner injury occurred within a medically acceptable time frame bolsters a link between the injury alleged and the vaccination at issue under the prong of the causation analysis.see capizzano,at finding medical opinions that explain how a vaccine can cause the injury alleged coupled with evidence demonstrating a close temporal relationship are quite probative in proving actual causation.if,for example,symptoms normally first occur ten days after inoculation but petitioner symptoms first occur several weeks after inoculation,then it is doubtful the vaccination is to blame.in contrast,if symptoms normally first occur ten days after inoculation and petitioner symptoms do,in fact,occur within this period,then the likelihood increases that the vaccination is at least a factor.strong temporal evidence is even more important in cases involving contemporaneous events other than the vaccination,because the presence of multiple potential causative agents makes it difficult to attribute causation to the vaccination.after all,credible medical expertise may postulate that any of the other contemporaneous events may have been the sole cause of the injury.thus,it was entirely proper for the special master to require pafford to prove causation,including some showing of temporal relationship between the vaccination s and the onset of injury.
moreover,the special master requirement for strong temporal evidence is consistent with the third prong of the althen test demonstrating a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the injury.see althen,at.again,without some evidence of temporal linkage,the vaccination might receive blame for events that occur weeks,months,or years outside of the time in which scientific or epidemiological evidence would expect an onset of harm.
turning to the evidence of record,neither of pafford two experts,levin and geier,provided sufficient evidence for the special master to conclude the onset of still disease occurred within the medically acceptable time frame.levin explained that the dtap,mmr and opv vaccines can,in some individuals,trigger an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that causes the release of cytokines which in turn cause the symptoms of still disease.trial court decision,wl,at.levin did not,however,provide any evidence about a medically acceptable time frame for the onset of the disease following the vaccination.transcript of record at,pafford sec y of health human,wl trial transcripts emphasis added.levin also did not discuss in detail the other contemporaneous events unrelated to the vaccinations.thus,the special master properly concluded,under our arbitrary and capricious standard of review,that levin testimony standing alone was not sufficient to prove the medically acceptable time frame or to link the onset of still disease to the vaccinations in this case.
in addition to levin,geier sought to provide testimony on this point.specifically,geier testified about the medically acceptable time frame for arthralgia episodes and joint syndromes generally.trial transcripts at petitioner brief at.the special master found geier testimony and the scientific literature on which his testimony was based insufficient for at least two reasons.in the first place,the special master noted correctly that evidence about the temporal relationship for arthralgia episodes and joint syndromes in general does not show the specific temporal relationship for still disease.trial court decision,wl,at.the special master also questioned geier qualifications because he is not certified in the areas of rheumatology,pathology,or immunology.id.at.notably,this court accords great deference to a special master determination on the probative value of evidence and the credibility of witnesses.see lampe sec y of health human,noting that the probative value of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are matters within the purview of the fact finder.on this record,the court can not discern any reversible error in the special master findings that geier did not prove the temporal relationship between still disease and the vaccination.
without credible testimony from either geier or levin on the medically acceptable time frame,the record contains little evidence linking still disease to the vaccinations in this particular case and leaves pafford without adequate evidence to show causation under this court causation standards.see trial court decision,wl,at petitioners provide no objective evidence indicating an appropriate time frame in which still disease will manifest subsequent to a triggering event.without a link between still disease and the vaccinations,the special master properly introduced the presence of the other unrelated contemporaneous events as just as likely to have been the triggering event as the vaccinations.id.at.hence,petitioner did not show it was more likely that the vaccinations were a cause of and a substantial factor in her contracting still disease.
in her final argument,pafford alleges the special master committed a due process violation by raising the medically accepted time frame issue sue sponte at the close of trial,without providing her a full and fair opportunity to present evidence on this issue.the record,however,shows that the petitioner knew of the medically accepted time frame issue well before the end of the trial and chose to rely on geier to provide the required evidence.response to order to show cause motion for inclusion in omnibus rubella arthritis cases at,pafford sec y of health human,asserting the onset of still disease appears to fit within the bounds of biological plausibility and medically significant temporal relationship to vaccination in view of literature associating the condition with rubella vaccine petitioner brief at petitioners had determined the y would rely on geier to address the time frame element.while geier did not supply sufficient admissible evidence to satisfy this critical portion of the causation test,pafford admitted reliance on geier in this regard impeaches her due process argument.
in summary,the special master did not err in requiring specific evidence about a medically acceptable time frame linking the onset of still disease to the vaccinations at issue.in the absence of such evidence,the court can not say the special master finding that pafford failed to prove causation by preponderant evidence was arbitrary and capricious.thus,this court affirms.
each party shall bear its own costs.
the majority today holds that petitioners seeking compensation under the national childhood vaccine injury compensation program the vaccine act must establish,as essential elements of a prima facie showing of causation in cases,both a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccinations and the onset of injury,ante at and an absence of alternative causes of the injury.ante at.while there are some unfortunate dicta in our cases that might support the majority approach,our earlier holdings and the statute itself are to the contrary.the majority interpretation of the vaccine act approves the efforts of the special masters to impose unwarranted tests for causation under the statute.i respectfully dissent.
this case involves the test for causation in cases announced by the chief special master in stevens secretary of the department of health and human services,wl.that test required petitioners to establish medical plausibility confirmation of medical plausibility from the medical community and literature an injury recognized by the medical plausibility evidence and literature a temporal relationship between the vaccination and the onset of the alleged injury and the elimination of other causes.id.at.we have already held that prongs and of this test are inconsistent with the statute.althen sec y of health human.we have also held invalid a sixth rule requiring petitioners,in order to demonstrate causation in fact in cases,to supply at least one of four types of evidence epidemiologic studies rechallenge presence of pathological markers or genetic predisposition or general acceptance of the causal relationship in the scientific and medical communities capizzano sec y of health human.this case for the first time presents the issue of the validity of prongs and of the stevens test.the special master in this case rejected the petitioners claim based on these two requirements.see pafford sec y of health human,wl,at.july.
here,the petitioners put on substantial evidence of causation.their expert,levin,testified that it is generally accepted in the medical community that the symptoms of still disease are caused by cytokine expression.levin and the government expert agreed that vaccines induce cytokine production.see id.at.as to richie pafford case,levin stated that immune activation caused by dpt vaccinations is in turn caused by the release of the very cytokines that are elevated in still disease,and that although the medical field had yet to develop testing sophisticated enough to identify specific cytokines in patients,indirect tests performed on richie correlate d with the clinical symptomatology.id.at.levin concluded that the only factor that seems associated with the development of this disease process in richie pafford is the vaccination.id.the government did not introduce evidence to establish causation by any factor unrelated to the vaccinations.id.at.
acknowledging that it was a close case,the special master painstakingly looked for the feather in petitioners argument that would tip the scales as to causation in fact,but concluded that the lack of any defined time period in which one would expect to see the onset of still disease subsequent to a triggering event,and the petitioners failure to rule out causation by other contemporaneous events,required denial of compensation.see id.at.the majority holds that this was proper.
prong of the stevens test requires evidence of a medically acceptable temporal relationship between the vaccination and the onset of the alleged injury which is defined through literature stevens,wl,at.to meet this requirement,petitioners must satisfactorily prove that the onset occurred within a time frame deemed medically appropriate according to the scientific or medical evidence id.the chief special master relied on no decision from this court for the requirement,but rather on other special master decisions and reports issued by the national academy of sciences institute of medicine iom.see id.at.
the majority states that the special master also required proof of a proximate temporal relationship between pafford vaccinations and the onset of still disease commensurate with the third prong of the althen test.ante,at.the majority relies on the statement in althen,at,that the medically acceptable temporal relationship requirement is merely a recitation of this court precedent.the precedent to which althen was referring was apparently lampe secretary of health and human services,shyface secretary of health human services,hodges secretary of health human services,and grant secretary of health human services.these cases were cited in the althen opinion.
in fact,the precedent cited in althen merely stands for the proposition that the temporal relationship between vaccination and injury may be a pertinent factor to consider in determining causation.in lampe,for example,we stated only that t he passage of time between an event and the consequences that are alleged to flow from it is often significant,not that a medically significant time interval is required.at.and in hodges,we did not suggest that evidence of a temporal relationship is held only that where the petitioners failed to pro
