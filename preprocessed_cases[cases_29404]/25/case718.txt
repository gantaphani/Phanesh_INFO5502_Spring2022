abbott laboratories and central glass company,collectively,abbott,appeal the district court grant of baxter pharmaceutical products,and baxter health care baxter motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.abbott labs baxter pharm,wl.because the district court erred in construing the asserted claims,this court vacates the district court decision and remands for further adjudication.
abbott owns patent the patent,filed january,and issued november.the patent claims compositions and methods of preventing the degradation of sevoflurane anesthetic by adding an effective amount of certain specific lewis acid inhibitors.abbott filed the patent application after discovering that these lewis acid inhibitors protected the shelf life of sevoflurane.lewis acids attack sevoflurane at its ether and halogen linkages,thereby releasing hydrofluoric acid hf into the anesthetic.because hf corrodes skin and mucous membranes,its presence in an anesthetic is harmful.hf also etches glass,and thus,exposes sevoflurane in glass vessels to additional lewis acids and glass particles.therefore,the patent improved the storage and use of sevoflurane.
baxter filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration fda proposing to market generic sevoflurane.baxter proposed product is a composition containing sevoflurane anesthetic with not more than ppm water.baxter also proposes to contain the composition in an aluminum vessel coated with an epoxyphenolic resin liner.in its application to the fda,baxter made a paragraph iv certification that its proposed generic sevoflurane product does not infringe the patent.thereafter,abbott filed this suit alleging infringement of the patent.at issue are independent claims,and of the patent emphases added

providing water in an amount sufficient to prevent degradation by a lewis acid of said quantity of sevoflurane 
combining said quantity of sevoflurane and said water in an amount sufficient to prevent the degradation by a lewis acid of said quantity of sevoflurane.
during prosecution of the patent application,abbott filed an information disclosure statement ids with the united states patent and trademark office uspto.the ids listed a reference indicating that at least one year before the filing date of the patent,abbott sold sevoflurane in glass bottles with a water content up to ppm.baxter seized upon this disclosure as a limit on the scope of the claims.therefore,baxter asserted that its generic sevoflurane with a water content of no more than ppm falls within the prior art and does not infringe the patent.
the district court agreed.specifically,the district court construed the claim terms amount effective and amount sufficient of independent claims and to mean amounts above ppm of water.citing the patent at column,lines,and,the district court noted that the specification teaches that an effective stabilizing amount of lewis acid inhibitor that can be used or is believed to be about w.the district court acknowledged n othing in the specifications sic inherently requires the amount of water to be ppm or more.the district court said it was prepared to decline to limit its interpretation of the terms effective or sufficient amount to ppm or greater but for baxter argument that the prosecution history of the patent shows a prior sale which must limit the claims of the patent,lest it be invalid under b.abbott,wl,at.accordingly,the district court limited the claim terms effective amount and amount sufficient to water content above ppm.
based on this construction,the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement to baxter.the district court held that baxter product did not literally infringe the claims because baxter did not propose a sevoflurane product with more than ppm water.reasoning that disclosure to the uspto of the prior sale of sevoflurane by abbot surrendered the subject matter of the sale,the district court found no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.based on prosecution history estoppel,therefore,the district court declined to address infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.abbott appealed to this court,which has exclusive jurisdiction.a.

effective amount 
the primary issue on appeal is the district court construction of the claim term effective amount.at the outset,this court notes that the term effective amount has a customary usage.under this usage,the term would mean the amount of lewis acid inhibitor that will prevent the degradation of sevoflurane by a lewis acid.see.mining chemque,affirming the district court construction of the claim term effective amount to mean a sufficient amount of the specified component to form an encapsulant having the specified properties under the specified conditions,if any.
moreover,the specification teaches that an effective amount of any given lewis acid inhibitor will vary depending upon the conditions to which sevoflurane is subjected.the term effective amount is broadly described in the summary of the invention as an effective stabilizing amount of lewis acid inhibitor that prevents the degradation of the fluoroether compound by a lewis acid.patent,ll.the specification teaches that degradation of fluoroether anesthetics,such as sevoflurane,vary depending upon the environment of the anesthetic.for example,the amount of lewis acid inhibitor needed to prevent degradation of sevoflurane increases with increasing temperature.patent,ll.similarly,type iii glass,normally inert to sevoflurane,activates in some anhydrous,acidic environments.activated glass exposes sevoflurane to lewis acid reactive sites.patent,ll.examples in the patent inhibit degradation of sevoflurane by activated type iii glass by adding ppm water.
type i glass,chemically distinct from type iii glass,activates in the presence of mg aluminum oxide,a known lewis acid.again,the specification addresses this degradation hazard by adding ppm water.patent,ll,figure.the patent thus explains that many different factors interact to dictate an effective amount of lewis acid inhibitor to stabilize sevoflurane in a specific environment.because the patentee did not deviate from the accustomed meaning of the disputed claim term,the term effective amount is construed in view of its ordinary and customary meaning.ccs fitness,brunswick,stating that claim terms are afforded a heavy presumption that their ordinary and customary meanings apply.at a minimum,the patent provides support for defining an effective amount of inhibitor to be the amount of lewis acid inhibitor needed to stabilize sevoflurane housed in a particular glass vessel under a given set of environmental conditions.thus,the specification supports the concept that the amount of lewis acid inhibitor depends on many environmental considerations.
these principles also explain the relevance of the prior sale disclosed in the ids.particularly because the prior sale involved sevoflurane in a specific glass container with a water content of no more than ppm,abbott disclosure to the uspto did not disavow or relinquish all water concentrations below ppm in other conditions.in the context of this invention,abbott disclosure did not expressly disavow claim scope.see york,cent.tractor farm family,u nless altering claim language to escape an examiner rejection,a patent applicant only limits claims during prosecution by clearly disavowing claim coverage.in york,for example,this court found no surrender of claim scope because the file history of the asserted patent did not contain a single statement that the inventors conceded any coverage based on the the prior art,and the mere invocation of prior art does not necessitate limiting claim scope.id.indeed,this court recently reiterated the rule that only a clear disavowal of subject matter divests claims of broader scope.teleflex,ficosa am.in teleflex,this court stated w e conclude that claim terms take on their ordinary and accustomed meanings unless the patentee demonstrated an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim term by redefining the term or by characterizing the invention in the intrinsic record using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction,representing a clear disavowal of claim scope.id.at.
in this case,the district court incorrectly limited the term an effective amount of water to ppm,despite the absence of a clear disavowal of water at lower amounts.simply disclosing a previous sale of sevoflurane to the uspto,without saying or doing anything more,does not disavow or relinquish all water concentrations below ppm.as the patent itself discloses,the effective amount of lewis acid inhibitor depends on the specific storage conditions of the sevoflurane.moreover,mere submission of an ids to the uspto does not constitute the patent applicant admission that any reference in the ids is material prior art.according to patent office rules,t he filing of an information disclosure statement shall not be construed to be an admission that the information cited in the statement is,or is considered to be,material to the patentability defined in b.h.while valid prior art may be created by the admissions of a party,these admissions are generally characterized by statements made during prosecution describing certain work as prior art.see in re nomiya,ccpa in re fout,ccpa.under certain circumstances,even an express representation that a reference cited in an ids is prior art to pending claims is not sufficient to create prior art by admission.riverwood int l jones.thus,with the mere listing of references in an ids,the applicant has admitted no more than that references in the disclosure may be material to prosecution of the pending claims.a see dick burroughs.
although abbott sold sevoflurane having water content levels of no more than ppm several years before filing the patent application,abbott made no express representations about the relevance of these prior sales to the claims.moreover,the examiner did not reject the claims over the disclosed prior sales of sevoflurane.the mere disclosure of potentially material art to the uspto does not automatically limit the claimed invention.as noted,the examiner did not consider the sale relevant and the applicant did not distinguish the claims over the disclosed sale.thus,this court concludes that the district court incorrectly relied on the ids disclosure to limit the term effective amount.
in reaching this conclusion,this court notes three instances in the specification where the applicant states an effective amount of water ranges from about ppm to saturation level.patent,ll.contrary to the district court characterization,these references are not part of the summary of the invention.instead,these column references fall within the detailed description of the invention.thus,these references refer to the preferred embodiments of the invention.because these references refer only to narrow preferred embodiments and not the invention as a whole,the specification passages do not support the limitation imported into the claims by the district court.the specification simply does not indicate that abbott restricted its claims to the preferred embodiments.instead,the specification refers to the water content in these preferred embodiments as amounts that can be used or is believed to be an appropriate lewis acid inhibitor.these descriptions in the specification are far from an express disavowal of other effective amounts.
this court interprets patent claims in light of the specification,but this axiom does not mean that everything expressed in the specification must be read into all the claims.teleflex,at.claims are not necessarily and not usually limited in scope simply to the preferred embodiment.rf pac.keystone.thus,the specification does not require the claims to be limited to the preferred embodiments.this court declines to so limit the claims in this regard.
neither does the prosecution history of the patent limit the disputed claim terms.early in the prosecution,the examiner cited patent issued to moilliet as anticipating the subject claims under.moilliet discloses a fluoroether anesthetic composition containing water vapor.in response to this rejection,abbott noted that moilliet merely indicates that water vapor may be present in the disclosed anesthetic composition without specifying the amount of water present in the composition.at no time during this proceeding did abbott reference the examples in its specification as the only specified water amounts that are effective to inhibit lewis acids.in fact,abbott never expressly represented that a particular concentration range of lewis acid inhibitor was critical to distinguishing its claimed invention over moilliet.rather,abbott overcame moilliet by simply differentiating the trace amounts of water vapor taught in that reference from the claimed amount of water effective as a lewis acid inhibitor in sevoflurane.at best,abbott disavowed trace amounts of water as being effective in stabilizing sevoflurane.thus,this prosecution history does not support limits on the terms effective amount or amount sufficient.
markush grouping of lewis acids 
asserted claims and recite a list of lewis acid inhibitors presented in the form of a markush group.citing kcj kinetic concepts,abbott argues that the recitation of a lewis acid inhibitor in claims and is understood to mean that more than one inhibitor would still fall within the claim boundaries.in arguing this construction,abbott does not account for the markush groups in claims and.
a markush group is a listing of specified alternatives of a group in a patent claim,typically expressed in the form a member selected from the group consisting of a,b,and therefore,if wherein r is a material selected from the group consisting of a,b,c and is a proper limitation then wherein r is a,b,c or shall also be considered proper.in re harnisch,ccpa containing an appendix describing patent office practice see manual of patent examining procedure mpep h ed.see also robert faber,landis on mechanics of patent claim drafting,ed.a markush group is a sort of homemade generic expression covering a group of two or more different materials elements,radicals,compounds,mechanical elements,or process steps,any one of which would work in the combination claimed.it is well known that members of the markush group are alternatively usable for the purposes of the invention.in re driscoll,ccpa.moreover,a markush group,incorporated in a claim,should be closed,it must be characterized with the transition phrase consisting of,rather than comprising or including.stephen becker,patent applications handbook ed.thus,members of the markush group are used singly.see meeting held to promote uniform practice in chemical divisions,pat.trademark off.soc y,listing practices approved by the primary examiners of the uspto chemical group.
