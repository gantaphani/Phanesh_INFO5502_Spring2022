when substances aimed at the treatment or prevention of disease are marketed,their regulation by the food and drug administration fda commonly turns on the nature of the claims made about the substance.items to be sold with drug claims,including foods and dietary supplements,are subject to extensive testing foods or dietary supplements that merely make health claims pass muster far more easily.this case turns primarily on whether the fda faithfully applied the federal food,drug and cosmetic act ffdca,et,in its analysis of a petition by julian whitaker and others for simplicity sake,whitaker to approve their intended marketing of saw palmetto,an extract from the pulp and seed of the dwarf american palm,serenoa repens,under a label that they argued was a health claim.
whitaker proposed a label stating consumption of mg daily of saw palmetto extract may improve urine flow,reduce nocturia and reduce voiding urgency associated with mild benign prostatic hyperplasia bph.petition,may.bph is a enlargement of the prostate that affects almost half of men over.the fda denied the petition.in explaining the decision,it drew a distinction between claims regarding use of a product to maintain health and to prevent disease,on the one hand,and claims that a product could treat a disease,on the other.the former could qualify as health claims,but the latter would always be considered drug claims.may,fda letter fda letter at.as bph is classified as a disease despite its comparative ubiquity,and the proposed label indicated an intent to treat it,the fda decided that saw palmetto could not be marketed under that label without approval as a drug.whitaker challenged the fda decision in district court on statutory and first amendment grounds.the district court granted the fda motion to dismiss,whitaker thompson,d,and whitaker appealed.we affirm.
the statutory claim 
the ffdca definition of drug includes articles intended for use in the diagnosis,cure,mitigation,treatment,or prevention of disease,g b,which would seem by its plain terms to cover the marketing of a substance intended to mitigate the symptoms associated with bph.but that apparent simplicity is undermined by language added in by the nutrition labeling and education act nlea,pub,stat,which created a separate procedure authorizing health claims for food or for dietary supplements classified as food.the general purpose of the nlea appears to have been to allow the to a regulatory approval certain dietary and health information on food products without requiring that those products be regulated as drugs.specifically,the nlea amended the ffdca to authorize the sale of dietary supplements pursuant to health claims that characterize the relationship of any nutrient to a disease or condition,id.r b,so long as the dietary supplement is subject to a procedure and standard,respecting the validity of such claim,established by regulation of the secretary,id.r d.whitaker insists,with some justification,that the label he proposed fits within the plain terms of the health claim definition.
thus,although the consequences of classification as a drug claim or a health claim are quite substantial,congress has given definitions that at least partially overlap.and it has given little guidance as to how the fda should sort out claims that seem to fit both definitions.on the one hand,as the fda points out,the statutory definition of dietary supplement plainly contemplates that dietary supplements may fall under the g definition of drugs it says that a dietary supplement shall be deemed to be a food e xcept for purposes of g,which defines drugs and counterfeit drugs.ff.on the other hand,the last sentence of g,which defines drugs,explicitly states that a dietary supplement for which a health claim under r is made is not a drug solely because the label or the labeling contains such a statement.id.g.this is the statutory provision most directly relevant to the relationship between health claims and drug claims,but there are at least three ways it might be read,all of them problematic.
first,the last sentence of g might mean that a r health claim can not by itself establish that a product is intended to cure,mitigate,prevent,or treat disease,but such a statement may be used in conjunction with other evidence to establish such intent.under this view,a health claim would be relevant but not sufficient to establish that a product is a drug.though this construction provides a grammatically plausible reading of solely it is not pressed by any of the parties in practice it might not make sense,as a product label may often be the only readily available evidence of the product intended use.
second,the sentence in question might mean that a product for which a drug claim is made under g is not automatically exempt from drug regulation just because the product label also makes a separate health claim under r.this view,urged by amicus american herbal products association,founders on the broad definition of health claims advanced by whitaker.such claims appear coextensive perhaps even broader than g drug claims.the amicus own brief demonstrates the problem.the amicus seeks to illustrate its reading of the solely language,saying that it means only that use of an authorized health claim on the label of a dietary supplement,folate reduces the risk of neural tube defects does not give a manufacturer blanket immunity to include other claims for the product that would otherwise be classified as drug claims,folate cures cancer.but if r covers anything that characterizes the relationship between a nutrient and a disease,then folate cures cancer is just as much a health claim as folate reduces the risk of neural tube defects.amicus interpretation of solely is sensible only if there are drug claims for foods or dietary supplements that are not also health claims,but whitaker broad interpretation of health claims,and indeed the literal wording of r b itself,foreclose that possibility.
finally,the solely language in g might mean that while a claim that would qualify as a health claim may be considered a drug claim,such a claim is not necessarily a drug claim.under this reading,in other words,the statute allows some health claims to be exempted from the drug claim definition but as this class is not defined,it implicitly leaves the choice to the fda.this interpretation,urged by the fda,is plausible,but it too is problematic.the statute on its face supplies no guiding principle for determining which health claims should be exempt,and nowhere else evinces an intent to give the fda unfettered discretion to make so drastic a choice.
because we are reviewing an agency interpretation of the statute it is entrusted to administer,and the agency reached its interpretation after a relatively formal process with public notice and comment,united states mead,d expressing assumption that congress contemplates administrative action with the effect of law when it provides for a relatively formal administrative procedure,we review under the familiar framework established by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.we first ask whether,applying the traditional tools of statutory construction,id.at.at,we can discern the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,id.at.at.if the statute is ambiguous,then we defer to the agency interpretation so long as it is reasonable.id.at.at.
as the discussion above suggests,we see no basis for finding any unambiguously expressed intent of congress.we thus turn to the fda rationale for classifying certain types of health claims as drug claims in order to decide whether the fda approach is reasonable in light of the statute structure,history,and purposes.
the fda gave several reasons for classifying claims regarding cure,mitigation,or treatment of an existing disease treatment claims as drug claims and for exempting only health claims that concern reducing the risk of contracting a disease prevention claims.first,the agency reasoned that the legislative history of the nlea demonstrated an understanding that the health claim provision was intended for claims of prevention rather than ones of treatment.the agency noted statements in th
