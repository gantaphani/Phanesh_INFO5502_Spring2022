cumberland pharmaceuticals,owns patent,which describes and claims acetylcysteine compositions substantially free of chelating agents.it is listed in the food and drug administration approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations the orange book as covering cumberland formulation of acetadote,an intravenous antidote for overdoses of acetaminophen.when mylan institutional llc filed an abbreviated new drug application to market its own acetylcysteine formulation,cumberland brought this action in the northern district of illinois against mylan institutional llc and mylan hereafter mylan,individually or jointly.mylan stipulated to infringement but asserted invalidity on two grounds derivation of the claimed invention from someone at the fda and obviousness.the district court rejected both challenges after a bench trial.in particular,the court found that mylan proved neither that anyone at the fda conceived of the claimed invention before the inventor nor that there was a reasonable expectation that the claimed formulations,without any chelating agents,would succeed.cumberland,mylan institutional llc,supp.we affirm.
at the priority date relevant here august,acetylcysteine was known in the art as an antidote for acetaminophen overdoses.patent,lines.it also was known to have a stability problem heavy metal ions,whether inherent in the formulation or found as contaminants,catalyze the oxidation of acetylcysteine in solution,causing it to degrade,lines see cumberland,supp.at.a response to the stability problem was to include edetate disodium edta or edetate in an acetylcysteine formulation.patent,line,through,line.edta,a chelating agent,surrounds and binds to heavy metal ions,preventing them from acting as catalysts that oxidize acetylcysteine.id.such formulations of acetylcysteine were considered safe,despite potential negative side effects,lines.
cumberland patent declares it has been surprisingly found that an aqueous composition containing acetylcysteine,sterilized water,and a agent,is stable without the addition of a chelating agent,lines.the patent claims such compositions.every claim in the patent requires a stable composition that is free of chelating agents,line,through,line,and the district court construed the term to mean l acking one or more chelating agents,cumberland,supp.at.
the facts central to the dispute over the patent validity date from,when the fda was considering cumberland application for permission to market the original formulation of acetadote,a formulation previously approved in other countries.on december,the fda sent cumberland a letter,in which the fda gave cumberland the following instructions among others.provide scientific and regulatory justification for the inclusion of edetate as a component in the drug product.in addition,provide a description of the pharmacological properties for edetate in this drug product.six days later,representatives of the fda and cumberland spoke by telephone.notes of the call state regarding item c,the division explained that data should be provided to support any justification for the inclusion of edetate,since a amount is included in the formulation.
on december,cumberland formally responded to the fda in a letter written by leo pavliv,who was the cumberland official responsible for acetadote and who is the named inventor on the patent the letter explained that edta was included to stabilize the formulation and stated if no or lower concentrations of edetate are capable of ensuring product stability,lowering or removing edetate would raise questions of how the safety and efficacy of the product would be effected.pavliv ultimately testified at trial that,shortly after writing this letter,he had the idea of testing the stability of an acetylcysteine formulation without edta.
on march,cumberland asked the fda to schedule a call for further discussion of its december,response.with respect to question,cumberland proposed to discuss the following cumberland believes the use of edetate as a component in the drug product is justified both from a scientific as well as a regulatory point of view.does fda agree.there is no written record of the occurrence or content of the requested call.at trial,however,pavliv testified that the call took place that fda representatives indicated on the call that they were not prepared to say whether they considered edta inclusion justified and that pavliv then stated his idea to perform a stability study.according to pavliv,at least one fda representative on the call approved of his idea to do a study and asked him to put the proposal in writing.
cumberland did so in a july,letter,stating as requested by fda,upon product approval,upon fda approval of the formulation,cumberland pharmaceuticals intends to initiate studies to determine the impact on product stability of both decreasing and completely removing edetate disodium from the formulation.the fda issued its chemistry review of the formulation on january.that document states the sponsor reported that,as requested by the fda upon drug approval,an independent study will be initiated to determine the impact on drug product stability of both decreasing and completely removing the amount of edetate sodium.see id.at referring twice more to cumberland commitment to a study.the fda approved the product on january,with the approval letter reminding cumberland of its commitment to evaluate the potential benefit of edetate disodium on the stability of the drug product,the study to include a comparison of the current concentration of edetate to a formulation with a lower concentration and no concentration of edetate.id.at.
cumberland then arranged by contract for testing to be done by bioniche pharma group,mylan predecessor company.cumberland,supp.at.the protocol,proposed by pavliv and approved by the fda without change,included testing a formulation that turned out to be the claimed invention,a formulation containing neither edta nor any other chelating agent on november,three months into the study,pavliv received encouraging stability data.on august,having received further encouraging stability data for a longer period,cumberland filed its application for what became patent,the parent of the patent at issue here.
cumberland gave the fda the final results of the stability study,containing data for months,on august.it then set about securing approval to market an version of acetadote.the fda approved that product in january.
on december,mylan filed an abbreviated new drug application seeking permission to market a generic version of cumberland acetylcysteine product.shortly thereafter,on february,cumberland filed the divisional application that became the patent.when the patent issued on april,mylan sent cumberland a certification pursuant to j a vii iv that the patent was either invalid or not infringed by mylan proposed product.
on may,cumberland sued mylan for infringement of the patent pursuant to e a.the patent issued on march,and cumberland then amended its complaint to add allegations of infringement of the patent.on august,mylan stipulated to infringement of claims of the patent should they be held valid and enforceable.cumberland withdrew its claims regarding the patent on september.
at the bench trial,mylan argued that the patent had been derived from someone at the fda,on the theory that it was someone at the fda,not pavliv,who first had the idea to remove edta from the formulation,and the invention would have been obvious in light of certain communications from the fda.the district court held that mylan had not proved that anyone at the fda conceived of the invention before cumberland inventor did,cumberland,supp.at,and there was no reasonable expectation that a formulation without any chelating agents would be successful,given the prevailing view that chelating agents were necessary to prevent degradation of acetylcysteine,id.at.the court entered a final judgment of validity and infringement on november.we have jurisdiction under a.
while the ultimate question of whether a patentee derived an invention from another is one of fact,the determination of whether there was a prior conception is a question of law,which is based upon subsidiary factual findings.price symsek,fed.cir.citations omitted.obviousness is a question of law based on underlying questions of fact.allergan,sandoz,fed.cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.id.
mylan derivation challenge invokes the rule that an applicant is not entitled to a patent if he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be patented.f more specifically,it invokes the familiar requirement that a challenger asserting this ground show that there was a prior conception of the claimed subject matter and communication of the conception to the named inventor.price,at see creative compounds,llc starmark,fed.cir.eaton rockwell int l,fed.cir.gambro lundia ab baxter healthcare,fed.cir.to show derivation,the party asserting invalidity must prove both prior conception of the invention by another and communication of that conception to the patentee.the conception requirement of derivation borrows from the conception standard for prior invention.creative compounds,at relying on the conception analysis from a discussion of priority earlier in the opinion as sufficient in the discussion of derivation.conception is keyed to the claimed invention a conception must encompass all limitations of the claimed invention.singh brake,fed.cir.see taurus ip,llc daimlerchrysler,fed.cir.slip track,fed.cir.brown barbacid,fed.cir.conception requires more than a general goal or research plan it requires a definite and permanent,specific,settled idea,namely,the idea defined by the claim at issue.burroughs wellcome barr,fed.cir.see reg synthetic fuels,llc neste oil oyj,fed.cir.
in inventorship disputes,the inventors named on the issued patent are presumed to be correct and a person seeking to add his name must meet the heavy burden of proving its case by clear and convincing evidence.shum intel,fed.cir.quoting eli lilly aradigm,fed.cir.we apply the same approach in the derivation context here.amax fly ash united states.cl,cited with approval in hess advanced cardiovascular,fed.cir.
in this case,as the derivation issue was litigated,it suffices to focus on the fact that the required complete conception had to include the specific idea to remove edta from acetadote or a similar product that met all the other claim elements and not add another chelating agent.it was that idea which mylan had to show,by clear and convincing evidence,was conceived by someone at the fda and communicated to pavliv.see amax fly ash,at.
the district court found that mylan did not carry that burden.after considering the surprising paucity of direct evidence,cumberland,supp.at,the district court concluded that while the evidence does not establish a precise date of conception by pavliv,mylan has failed to persuade the court that anyone other than pavliv ever conceived of a definite and permanent idea of an acetadote formulation,id.at.given the claim language requiring that the product be free of chelating agents,patent,lines,not just edta,and the district court several references to that particular claim requirement,cumberland,supp.at discussing the claim limitation free of chelating agents id.at same,we think it clear that the district court finding refers to a formulation of acetadote that simply removes edta,without adding another chelating agent in its place.the court thus found that mylan did not prove that an fda person conceived of that formulation,or communicated it to cumberland,before pavliv thought of it.
the evidence supports the finding.the court could properly view the fda december,letter,which simply requested justification for the inclusion of edta in the drug product,as not showing the prior conception needed here.c provide scientific and regulatory justification for the inclusion of edetate as a component in the drug product.in addition,provide a description of the pharmacological properties for edetate in this drug product.a different view is not required by the notes of the december,call,which add only that the fda wanted data to support the justification.regarding item c,the division explained that data should be provided to support any justification for the inclusion of edetate,since a amount is included in the formulation.a request for justification of the inclusion of edta,supported by data,is not the same as a suggestion to remove it,let alone to remove it and not replace it with another chelating agent.
mylan argues that the request for data to support the inclusion of edta required cumberland to undertake research that would have inevitably led it to the invention.that is not enough for derivation.we have held that derivation is not proved by showing conception and communication of an idea different from the claimed invention even where that idea would make the claimed idea obvious.gambro lundia,at.we also have made clear that a general goal or research plan does not constitute the definite and permanent idea required for conception,burroughs wellcome,at,and that a bare hope of a result never before achieved here,the claimed stable compound is not sufficient for conception,hitzeman rutter,fed.cir.see cumberland,supp.at.the kind of general research suggestion at issue here,whatever its role in an obviousness analysis,does not establish the conception required for derivation.
the evidence dating from after december likewise does not compel a finding contrary to the district court.in particular,even when documents go beyond discussing a study of whether edta inclusion is justified and mention removing edta,they do not make clear either that all chelating agents were to be avoided or that even the idea whether or not a substitute was to be added came from someone other than pavliv.all of those documents postdate the conversation pavliv had with fda representatives,in which,he testified,he was the one who introduced the idea of testing an product.
thus,several cumberland documents,starting with the july,letter quoted above,refer to the fda as having requested the study.but that language can be read as focusing on the fda request for a study implementing the idea already suggested by pavliv.see cumberland,proposed study protocol as part of a post approval marketing commitment,the fda requested cumberland investigate whether edta has a beneficial impact on stability and if so whether the level could be reduced.cumberland,final report from stability study the fda expressed a potential safety concern with edta in the formulation and as such,requested cumberland investigate whether edta provided a stability benefit or could be reduced or removed from the product.cumberland may,draft clinical study protocol for acetadote the fda expressed a potential safety concern with edta in the formulation of acetadote and requested that the manufacturer investigate whether edta provided a stability benefit or could be reduced or removed from the product.cumberland may,citizen petition from the outset,fda wanted cumberland to investigate reducing or removing edta from acetadote because the agency was concerned with the safety of edta.the agency should not now approve an anda for acetadote that relies on the discontinued formulation that is less safe than the formulation that fda specifically requested cumberland investigate developing,and that is currently on the market.
indeed,the fda january,chemistry review,after stating that t he sponsor reported that,as requested by fda,an independent study will be initiated to determine the impact on drug product stability of both decreasing and completely removing the amount of edetate sodium,adds that the study was applicant proposed.as that document confirms,it is entirely possible for cumberland to have first proposed the idea of studying edta removal,as pavliv testified,and for the fda to have requested that cumberland actually perform that study.and,as with the december communications,none of these documents establish that the fda specifically conceived of removing edta from the acetadote without adding any other chelating agents,as required by the claim language.
mylan gets no further help in reversing the district court fi
