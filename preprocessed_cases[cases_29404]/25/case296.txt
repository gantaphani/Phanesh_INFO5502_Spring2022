false claims act 
in a qui tam suit under the false claims act,the panel affirmed the district court dismissal of the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction dismissed as moot the defendant appeal from the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment reversed the district court denial of the defendant motion for attorneys fees and remanded the case to the district court.
the plaintiff alleged that by committing fraud against the united states patent and trademark office in a patent application,the defendant obtained an illegal monopoly over a drug and then knowingly overcharged the united states.the panel held that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint was based on public disclosures in the form of allegations of fraud,as well as allegations of the underlying facts,in a prior patent infringement suit.in addition,the plaintiff did not show that it was the original source of the information on which its allegations were based.the panel held that the plaintiff did not show both that it had direct,firsthand knowledge of the alleged fraud and that it obtained this knowledge independently.
reversing the denial of attorneys fees under the provision of the false claims act,the panel held that the district court had authority to award attorneys fees after the dismissal of the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.agreeing with the tenth circuit,the panel held that the provision provides an independent grant of jurisdiction.in addition,the defendant was a prevailing party.the panel concluded that the supreme court opinion in crst van expedited,effectively overruled the holding of branson nott,cir,that a defendant that wins because the action is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never a prevailing party.the panel remanded for resolution of the attorneys fees issue.
we must decide whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over a corporate qui tam action under the false claims act that accuses a competing company of committing fraud against the united states.
this saga began in the early,when aventis pharma,aventis a french pharmaceutical enterprise developed a plan to sell the drug enoxaparin in the united states under the brand name lovenox.enoxaparin is a blood thinner that was patented in europe in the as european patent.eventually,european authorities invalidated as lacking novelty.
in june,aventis applied to the patent and trademark office uspto for a patent to cover a supposedly new version of enoxaparin product aventis filed a new drug application nda with the food and drug administration fda a month later.
the initial versions of the nda were rejected in part as being obvious in view of the prior art,including.aventis acknowledged that was prior art,but claimed that the product was a different drug from the drug produced by following product.after several subsequent rejections,aventis submitted a revised nda in supported by the expert declaration of andre uzan,a french scientist.uzan claimed that data in example of the patent application,included in the revised nda,clearly demonstrate d that the product has a longer relative to the product,and thus was novel.
the uspto then approved the revised application and issued patent number patent for the product in,in large part because of uzan statements regarding example.however,it turned out that uzan sworn declarations were incorrect.uzan had based his claim of a difference by comparing a dose of the product with a dose of the product,but had not disclosed that different dosages were used in the uspto submissions.a comparison would have shown that the difference between the products was not statistically significant.this error went undetected for years.meanwhile,after the patent was issued,aventis listed it in the fda orange book,which invokes the protections of the act.j b iii requiring a generic drug competitor to certify that the patent is either not infringed or invalid.
amphastar pharmaceuticals,amphastar a generic pharmaceutical firm founded in by yong feng zhang,decided that enoxaparin would be a good prospect for a generic product,believing it might be possible to develop a generic version by utilizing information from.development work began in and included experiments performed from to experiments.the exact nature of the experiments is disputed,but they led to amphastar being able to manufacture a generic enoxaparin.amphastar then submitted an abbreviated new drug application anda to the fda on march.
aventis responded to amphastar anda by bringing suit five months later,alleging that amphastar and teva pharmaceuticals were infringing on the patent.amphastar filed its amended answer and counterclaim and made no mention of the example error or the experiments.
after discovery was underway,amphastar filed a motion to amend its answer and counterclaim,stating,based on facts recently developed in this litigation,amphastar has added new affirmative defenses and several antitrust claims to its answer and counterclaims.amphastar additions included an affirmative defense alleging inequitable conduct by aventis in obtaining the patent.after aventis filed a motion to strike the amendments,amphastar responded by asserting as to the unenforceability of the patent based on inequitable conduct,all of the facts and evidence upon which this affirmative defense is based are in the possession and control of aventis.amphastar did not mention the experiments when it listed the evidence on which it based its inequitable conduct defense.amphastar also alleged antitrust violations.
amphastar eventually prevailed in its patent infringement litigation battle with aventis by the end of the litigation the federal circuit had affirmed the district court conclusions that aventis made material nondisclosures and false representations to the uspto regarding the patent application and aventis intended to deceive the uspto.amphastar was thus able to produce generic enoxaparin without fear of infringement the patent was found to be unenforceable on the ground of inequitable conduct.however,amphastar antitrust counterclaim was dismissed.
amphastar then brought this qui tam action against aventis amphastar duly sent the statutorily required letter to the united states department of justice,notifying it of its intent to bring this action.amphastar then filed its sealed complaint on january,alleging that by committing fraud against the uspto,aventis obtained an illegal monopoly over enoxaparin and then knowingly overcharged the united states.by committing such fraud,amphastar further alleged,aventis knew the patent was invalid and thus knowingly defrauded the united states.the complaint was unsealed and the case proceeded in october,after the government declined to join the litigation.
on november,the district court ruled that amphastar complaint was based on public disclosures,and therefore amphastar had to show it was the original source of the information on which the allegations are based.e.thereafter,aventis filed a motion for summary judgment contending amphastar had failed to meet the original source exception to the jurisdictional bar.to be an original source of information underlying the complaint,amphastar needed to meet the disclosure and direct and independent knowledge requirements.
aventis first argued that amphastar had failed to disclose enough information in its disclosure letter.the district court denied aventis summary judgment motion on this issue in a may ruling,but certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal,which aventis brought in.
the district court then proceeded to the direct and independent knowledge issue it held a evidentiary hearing to determine if amphastar had direct and independent knowledge of any of the information underlying its allegations.the district court made various factual findings amphastar had no knowledge of example being false before the aventis i litigation began zhang amphastar ceo was not a credible witness amphastar had engaged in inconsistent actions regarding whether it had known of the example error before the aventis i litigation,and such inconsistent actions undermined its argument.the district court also concluded that amphastar did not produce enoxaparin by following in its experiments,but copied key information from patent.for all these reasons the district court held that amphastar had neither direct nor independent knowledge of any of the elements of fraud supposedly committed by aventis.the district court then dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.aventis moved for attorneys fees,which motion was denied.
amphastar timely appealed the dismissal of its qui tam suit.aventis timely the denial of attorneys fees.
on appeal,amphastar contends that the district court erred in dismissing its qui tam suit for lack of jurisdiction it argues specifically that the district court erred in concluding that the allegations of fraud had been publicly disclosed and further erred in concluding that amphastar was not an original source of aventis allegedly fraudulent actions.e.
the relevant portions of section e of the false claims act state 
e a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
if amphastar allegations are based on publicly disclosed information,the jurisdictional bar applies unless amphastar is an original source.to be an original source,amphastar must demonstrate that it had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which it based its allegations,and it satisfied the disclosure requirements by providing the necessary information to the government before filing an action.amphastar bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.alcan,at.
was the public disclosure bar triggered 
transactions or allegations are disclosed if they can be found in pleadings or other public filings.hagood sonoma cnty.water agency,cir.our circuit interprets allegations to refer to direct claims of fraud,and,we interpret transaction to refer to facts from which fraud can be inferred.united states ex rel.mateski raytheon,cir.we have adopted the reasoning of united states ex rel.springfield terminal railway quinn,which states that when a critical mass of the underlying facts or of the allegations in the qui tam complaint have been disclosed prior to the qui tam complaint being filed,the public disclosure bar applies.mateski,at citing,cir.
the mateski court explained that if x y z,z represents the allegation of fraud and x and y represent its essential elements.id.quoting united states ex rel.found.aiding the elderly horizon,cir,amended on denial of reh g,cir.if the fraud allegations z are disclosed,the bar applies.id.if enough of the underlying facts making up the elements of fraud are disclosed,the bar applies.id.i n a fraud case,x and y inevitably stand for but two elements the misrepresented facts x and the true facts y.id.quoting found.aiding,at.
amphastar argues that the allegations of fraud were never publicly disclosed before it filed this qui tam action.it concedes that general allegations of fraud were made in its aventis i amended answer and counterclaim,but says these past allegations never mentioned any false claims submitted to or paid by the federal government and state governments.instead,its current allegations concern the fact that false claims were submitted to one or another government,allegations which were never made in any prior publicly disclosed document.
however,a n allegation need not include an express reference to the false claims act for the public disclosure bar to apply.alcan,at.nor does a disclosed allegation need to contain every specific detail to constitute a disclosure.id.rejecting an argument the relator new allegations are meaningfully different because the old allegations did not mention the false claims act and did not include details of the violations.alcan involved a situation where the publicly disclosed allegations did not mention any overcharging,or any other specific fraud on the government.id.like alcan,this is not a case where the prior allegations concerned a very different problem than the qui tam allegations.see mateski,at discussing the substantially similar spectrum quoting found.aiding,at.
amphastar amended answer and counterclaim in the patent infringement case made nearly identical allegations to those made here.it accused aventis of obtaining an invalid patent due to misrepresentations.it also claimed that,despite knowing about these misrepresentations,aventis has attempted to maintain or obtain a monopoly over others by doing things such as improperly listing the patent in the orange book.finally,it alleged that aventis has wrongfully derived,and will continue to wrongfully derive,income and profits from this conduct.the only new allegation amphastar makes in the instant case is that the government also bought the drug while aventis held its illegal monopoly,but this is an obvious inference based on the publicly disclosed allegations.the allegations in this case are so substantially similar to the prior allegations that we are satisfied the public disclosure bar applies.see mateski,at.
while the fraud allegations being disclosed are enough to trigger the bar,amphastar also failed to demonstrate that both the misrepresented facts and the true facts were not disclosed.this is also enough to trigger the bar on its own.the misrepresented facts presented to the government via the uspto are that the product differed from the product because the of the products was different,and thus aventis held a valid patent and,the true facts actual state of the world are that example was false and thus aventis held an invalid patent,and this invalid patent allowed aventis unlawfully to charge monopoly prices to customers.in this case the information publicly disclosed contained the material facts underlying the relator allegation of fraud.ambulance,california,cir.see also found.aiding,at asking if the true state of the world was disclosed the defendant substandard care and if the misrepresented facts were disclosed the false statements to the government.
the evidence that the misrepresented facts and the true facts were actually disclosed is overwhelming.the qui tam complaint alleges that aventis intentionally made material misrepresentations to the uspto regarding whether the product was novel relative to prior art,such misrepresentations allowed it fraudulently to obtain the patent,aventis then improperly listed the patent in the fda orange book,and such listing allowed aventis to overcharge the government.the allegations that were publicly disclosed included all of these facts,except,instead of mentioning overcharging the government,they mentioned overcharging in general.while the amended answer and counterclaim did not specifically mention example,it did allege material misrepresentations regarding studies of the pharmacological properties of prior art compounds,including half life.
amphastar also argues that the district court erred because it recited the public disclosure standard is not intended to be difficult to meet.hagood,at noting that courts often treat the based upon public disclosure step as a quick trigger to arrive at the more exacting original source inquiry.amphastar,aventis pharma,no,wl,at cal,aventis v.mateski specifically rejected a defendant argument that the quick trigger language of hagood means the courts should avoid substantively analyzing a public disclosure issue.at stressing the need to analyze the issue with some specificity.
even assuming the district court committed legal error by failing to analyze this issue in enough detail,any error would be harmless.we are satisfied that enough of the fraud allegations,or alternatively,enough of the underlying facts,were publicly disclosed such that the public disclosure bar should have been triggered.
since the public disclosure bar was triggered,did amphastar qualify as an original source 
the first prong of the original source analysis asks whether amphastar can show it had knowledge that is both direct and independent.devlin,at.to prove direct knowledge,amphastar must show that it had firsthand knowledge of the alleged fraud,and that it obtained this knowledge through its own labor unmediated by anything else.alcan,at.to prove independent knowledge,relators have to show they had relevant evidence of fraud prior to the public disclosure of the allegations.devlin,at.
amphastar claimed it learned that example was false through its experiments direct and knew this information before the aventis i disclosures independent amphastar,aventis pharma,no,wl,at cal.july,aventis vi.specifically,amphastar argued that its experiments showed that it could create a bioequivalent enoxaparin with the same molecular weight and properties as the product by just following.id.thus,example,which showed a difference in between the two products,must be false,it argued.id.
so the crucial question is whether the district court factual findings derived from the july evidentiary hearing are clearly erroneous.the district court did a thorough job developing the record eight witnesses including four experts testified,exhibits were submitted,and the transcript for the hearing exceeds pages.the district court found that amphastar had no knowledge example was false before this fact was publicly disclosed in the aventis i litigation.aventis vi,wl,at.the court concluded that zhang testimony,that he knew example of the patent application was false before the aventis i litigation began,was not credible.id.it also concluded that amphastar had no direct or independent knowledge that aventis had made false reports to the fda about its manufacturing process.id.at indeed,in argument,amphastar acknowledged that its only witness regarding its supposed direct and independent knowledge,zhang,did not offer such evidence.
the district court rejected zhang testimony that he believed example was false before aventis i for several reasons.for example,there was no written documentation of this seemingly important discovery.the only proof zhang offered was a single statement in his deposition that he allegedly told two other people in passing,yet neither of these people testified to confirm these alleged conversations.id.at.the court also concluded that the experiments did not actually produce enoxaparin by following,and thus did not demonstrate that example was false despite zhang claiming this is how he first came to believe it.id.at.
additional evidence supporting the district court conclusion was the notebooks documenting the experiments they provided critical evidence that amphastar ended up relying on the patent to create a generic enoxaparin.id.at this greatly undermined amphastar argument that it was able to duplicate the product using just disclosures and thus proved to itself that something was wrong with the patent.amphastar even conceded that it is not challenging the court factual findings regarding its experiments.
the district court was also deeply troubled for good reason by amphastar inconsistent prior statements about when it discovered the example error.amphastar did not raise the example issue as a defense until a year after the aventis i litigation began.aventis vi,wl,at.when it did raise the defense,in its june,motion,it recited,based on facts recently developed in this litigation,amphastar has added new affirmative defenses and several counterclaims.id.emphasis added by district court.amphastar did not list the supposedly important experiments among the evidence in support of its june contentions.id.also,the disclosure letter written by amphastar in and sent to the government before aventis vi stated that d uring amphastar litigation against aventis,amphastar discovered that aventis has committed frauds against the united states,which have resulted in false claims.id.at emphasis added by district court.
all of amphastar legal arguments regarding direct and independent knowledge fail if the factual findings of the evidentiary hearing stand.amphastar argues the district court incorrectly required amphastar to show it had knowledge of example falsity and of aventis intent to deceive.furthermore,the district court does use the phrases false statement and knowledge of the alleged fraud interchangeably,which is problematic.see,id.at.amphastar only needed to prove it had direct and independent knowledge that example was false to be an original source the district court should have spoken with more precision.nevertheless,the factual conclusion that amphastar had no knowledge of the example issue before it was disclosed makes this argument moot.any error is harmless if amphastar fails to overturn the factual findings.
amphastar was required to offer compelling proof the district court erred to overcome the deferential clear error standard that governs factual findings.anderson city of bessemer,describing the clearly erroneous standard.yet,amphastar does not even directly challenge the district court factual findings,instead arguing that the district court did not adequately consider its march,experiment in considering whether amphastar knew about the example issue through its own labor however,the district court clearly concluded that no experiment provided amphastar this information.it discussed all of the issues with the experiments in general and then provided specific examples.the district court is not required to list all one hundred plus experiments and explain why each one did not provide this information,but instead it is presumed to have considered all the evidence unless something indicates otherwise.see pac.fisheries,ss president grant,cir.here,the district court considered the evidence and reached the not clearly erroneous conclusion that none of the experiments produced enoxaparin utilizing just disclosures.aventis vi,wl,at.
amphastar further argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing aventis to present an argument at the evidentiary hearing that it copied patent processes in its experiments.amphastar served interrogatories to aventis before the evidentiary hearing to disclose facts,witnesses,and other items supporting its arguments.aventis did not disclose that it would make an argument that amphastar copied the patent in response to the interrogatories or in its hearing brief.amphastar believes this theory,and any related contentions,should have been excluded under federal rule of civil procedure c,which states if a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by rule a or e,the party is not allowed to use that information unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.
however,amphastar waived this argument by failing to raise it adequately below.nowhere before the district court did amphastar make a rule c objection or ask that evidence relating to the copying theory be excluded.at the evidentiary hearing closing arguments amphastar did mention being caught by the copying theory,but got several facts wrong and never attempted to exclude the theory or raise a rule objection.amphastar did make a cursory rule b a ii request for sanctions and an objection in its brief,alleging that aventis failed to provide a full and complete disclosure of its contentions.but no citation to rule c was made.
assuming arguendo that this issue was not waived and the district court did err,any error was harmless.even if the copying theory were excluded,the record would still contain all of the other factual findings that indicate amphastar lacked direct and independent knowledge.the inconsistencies,the notebooks,zhang lack of credibility all would remain.amphastar would still bear the burden of prevailing on the jurisdictional bar issue.alcan,at.it has not come close to doing so 
in its,aventis contends that the district court erred in concluding it had no power to award attorneys fees to aventis,and we agree.the relevant provision states 
if the government does not pro
