background 
merck owns the patent.the patent,entitled method for inhibiting bone resorption,teaches a method of treating and preventing osteoporosis through administration of bisphosphonate compounds.patent,ll.the patent was filed on august,and merck stipulated at trial that it would not allege an invention date prior to july,for the claims at issue.merck,d at.
bisphosphonates are a family of chemical compounds that are known to selectively inhibit the bone destruction process that contributes to osteoporosis and other bone diseases.patent,ll.bisphosphonates include,among other compounds,alendronate,risedronate,tiludronate,pamidronate,ibandronate,zolendronate,and etidronate.id.at,ll,ll.at issue in this case are dosages of alendronate monosodium trihydrate.
bisphosphonates are not readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal gi tract.the medications thus require rigorous dosing instructions a patient must take the medicine on an empty stomach and remain upright and fasting for thirty minutes after ingestion.patent,ll.in addition,the compounds are known to have adverse gi side effects that physicians believed to be related,in part,to a irritation to the patient esophagus,or b the size of the dose.id.at,ll.
before the patent issued,standard osteoporosis treatments consisted of small daily doses of bisphosphonates to avoid gi complications.id.at,ll,ll.according to the patent,however,the adverse gi resulting from repetitive irritation to the gi tract were the primary concern in the field.id.at,ll.the inventors trumpeted the dosing schedule disclosed in the patent as decreasing the irritating effect of the compounds,as well as increasing patient compliance with the rigorous dosing instructions.id.at,ll,ll.
this case involves dependent claims and of the patent.at trial,the parties agreed to cast the text of these claims in independent form,incorporating all the dependent limitations

litigation 
in late,teva amended an existing anda and sought fda approval to market generic versions of merck fosamax supplement in mg and mg quantities merck,d at teva br.at.merck subsequently filed suit against teva under e a,alleging teva anda filing was an act of infringement 
according to the trial court,merck acted as its own lexicographer and through the specification redefined the ordinary meaning of about in claims and both parties agree has the ordinary meaning approximately to something quite different.merck,d at.thus,the district court concluded the terms about mg in claim and about mg in claim mean exactly or mg of alendronic acid 
relying on this construction of about,the district court dismissed teva allegations that the claims at issue were anticipated by a july lunar news article or rendered obvious by an april lunar news article combined with the july article the trial court found both articles qualified as prior art publications under a.merck,d at.the april article in lunar news recommends weekly dosages of alendronate to improve patient compliance 
o ne of the difficulties with alendronate is its low oral bioavailability.when taken with water in a fasting state,only about of the oral dose is bioavailable.even coffee or juice reduces this by,and a meal reduces it by.alendronate must be taken,after an overnight fast,minutes before breakfast.subjects should remain seated or standing a very small group of patients have reported some upper gastrointestinal distress if this is not done.this regime may be difficult for the elderly to maintain chronically.an intermittent treatment program for example,once per week,or one week every three months,with higher oral dosing,needs to be tested.

the july lunar news article further emphasizes the need for a dose of fosamax because s ome united states physicians are reluctant to treat patients with fosamax because of a side effects b difficulty of dosing and c high costs.the author suggests 
the difficulties with oral bisphosphonates may favor their episodic or cyclical one week each month administration.even oral alendronate potentially could be given in a or mg dose to avoid dosing problems and reduce costs 
update bisphosphonate,lunar news,july,at emphasis added.
regarding anticipation,the trial court held the july article does not expressly or inherently disclose the dosage amounts for alendronate in claims and because there was no evidence that mg and mg of alendronate contains the same number of alendronate core molecules as found in mg and mg,respectively,of alendronic acid.merck,d at.
as for obviousness,the district court concluded the suggestion of weekly treatment was not clinically useful or obvious in july because of the known gastrointestinal side effects associated with the daily formulation of fosamax.merck,d at.although it is undisputed that a dosage was known to be efficacious,the court determined that the lunar news articles could not overcome doctors concerns associated with higher dosages because the lunar news articles were not published in journals or authored by one skilled in the art.merck,d at.
finding the patent not invalid as anticipated or obvious,the district court delayed the effective date of the fda approval of teva anda until the patent expires and enjoined commercial sale of teva generic treatment.final judgment order at.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under a.

claim construction 
in finding that merck acted as its own lexicographer,the district court relied on the following passage from the specification 
because of the mixed nomenclature currently in use by those or sic ordinary skill in the art,reference to a specific weight or percentage of bisphosphonate compound in the present invention is on an active weight basis unless otherwise indicated herein.for example the phrase about mg of bone resorption inhibiting bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronate,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and mixtures thereof,on an alendronic acid weight basis means that the amount of bisphosphonate compound selected is calculated based on mg of alendronic acid.
patent,emphasis added.according to the district court opinion,the patentee uses the phrase about or mg to account for variations in the molecular weight of the different derivatives of alendronic acid and to deliver exactly or mg of alendronic acid.merck,d at.for example,the court noted that alendronate monosodium trihydrate,which is used in fosamax,requires an atom of sodium for each molecule.id.at.if a heavier metal were chosen,such as potassium,the weight of the derivative compound would have to increase to deliver exactly the same number of molecules of the active alendronate compound found in or mg of alendronic acid.id.at.the district court thus construed the term about or mg to mean the amount of the derivative compound that gives exactly or mg of the active compound.
we reverse the district court construction of about and hold that such term should be given its ordinary meaning of approximately.to properly construe a claim term,a court first considers the intrinsic evidence,starting with the language of the claims.vitronics conceptronic.generally claim terms should be construed consistently with their ordinary and customary meanings,as determined by those of ordinary skill in the art,llc intuitive surgical.while in some cases there is a presumption that favors the ordinary meaning of a term.digital telegenix,the court must first examine the specification to determine whether the patentee acted as his own lexicographer of a term that already has an ordinary meaning to a person of skill in the art.see,renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,at.
when a patentee acts as his own lexicographer in redefining the meaning of particular claim terms away from their ordinary meaning,he must clearly express that intent in the written description.see,bell atl.network servs.covad communications group.we have repeatedly emphasized that the statement in the specification must have sufficient clarity to put one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the inventor intended to redefine the claim term.see also elekta instrument sci.int l,absent an express intent to impart a novel meaning,claim terms take on their ordinary meaning.renishaw,at the patentee lexicography must,of course,appear with reasonable clarity,deliberateness,and precision before it can affect the claim.quoting in re paulsen,union carbide chems.plastics tech.shell oil,stating that the presumption in favor of the claim term ordinary meaning is overcome,however,if a different meaning is clearly and deliberately set forth in the intrinsic evidence.in the present case,the passage cited by the district court from the specification for merck definition of about is ambiguous.it fails to redefine about to mean exactly in clear enough terms to justify such a counterintuitive definition of about.
the phrase ambiguity arises from the fact that it can easily be read as teva a way of explaining what is meant by the use of the phrase alendronate acid active basis rather than as a way of radically redefining what is meant by about.the district court construed the phrase about or mg to mean that one should administer approximately or mg of the derivative compound,such that the end result is that the patient is administered exactly or mg of alendronic acid.in other words,the district court determined that the quantity specified in the claims or mg modifies the amount of the derivative compound rather than the active compound.under such a construction,the term about informs one of ordinary skill in the art to select whatever quantity of the derivative compound necessary to give exactly or mg of alendronic acid for alendronate monosodium trihydrate,the word about thus meant that mg or mg of that compound should be amount necessary to give exactly or mg of alendronic acid.
unlike the limiting definition of about adopted by the district court,teva interpretation of the paragraph in question would mean that or mg refers to the amount of the active compound to be administered rather than the amount of the derivative compound.the term about in the claims would then serve to modify the quantity of the active compound in a way consistent with its normal definition of approximately.under this construction,the modifying phrase about or mg would refer to approximately or mg of alendronic acid 
the claim construction urged by merck and adopted by the district court reads the sentence of the passage underlined above out of context.in the sentence before the highlighted sentence,the patentee informs those of ordinary skill in the art that,when the patent refers to a certain amount of a bisphosphonate compound,it is actually instructing them to administer a certain amount of the active component of the compound rather than the compound itself,that one should calculate the amount dispensed on an active weight basis.this preceding sentence thus acts to specify a common denominator to be used for all derivatives of alendronic acid.the underlined sentence merely gives a specific of an alendronate show what is meant by using the phrase active weight basis.
given that the passage that merck relies on is amenable to a second and more reasonable interpretation,we hold merck did not clearly set out its own definition of about with reasonable clarity,deliberateness,and precision,and thus failed to act as its own lexicographer.in re paulsen,at.
as further support for this conclusion,we note that other parts of the specification also suggest that about should be given its ordinary meaning of approximately.the specification repeatedly describes a range of acceptable dosage amounts,with the patentee emphasizing that unit dosages will vary.for example,the specification suggests that a dosage amount could contain anywhere from about mg to about mg of any alendronate compound on an alendronate acid active basis,with about mg and about mg being only two examples of a unit dosage 
for dosing,an oral unit dosage comprises from about mg to about mg of the alendronate compound,on an alendronic acid active weight basis.examples of weekly oral dosages include a unit dosage which is useful for osteoporosis prevention comprising about mg of the alendronate compound,and a unit dosage which is useful for treating osteoporosis comprising about mg of the alendronate compound.
patent,ll.emphasis added.in addition to the above passage,at another point in the specification the range for the normal unit dosage is further widened to about to about mg.patent,ll.stating that a unit dosage typically comprises from about mg to about mg of an alendronate compound on an alendronic acid active weight basis.the specification thus suggests the patentee contemplated a range of dosages,further compromising merck proposition that it acted as its own lexicographer in defining about to mean exactly.
finally,our construction of about eliminates the problem pointed out by teva that the district court construction of the term about renders other parts of the claim superfluous.as teva notes,the specification uses both the term about and on an alendronic acid basis at least times to describe a dosage strength.if,as merck urges,about or mg means exactly or mg of alendronic acid,then the phrase on an alendronic acid active basis would be unnecessary since such an understanding would be clear simply by using the term about.a claim construction that gives meaning to all the terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so.elekta,at construing claim to avoid rendering the degree claim limitation superfluous am.transp,rejecting the district court claim construction because it rendered superfluous the claim requirement for openings adjacent to the end walls.by construing about to mean its accepted and ordinary meaning of approximately,the phrase alendronic acid basis is no longer excess verbiage,but is instead necessary because it is the noun that about or mg modifies.
because the patentee did not clearly redefine about in the specification,and because the district court construed the claim term in a manner inconsistent with the specification,we reverse the district court claim construction.we thus hold that the term about should be given its ordinary and accepted meaning of approximately.
invalidity 
in light of the corrected claim construction we find reversible error in the district court obviousness analysis.a patent claim is invalid if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.a.the ultimate issue of obviousness turns on four factual determinations the scope and content of the prior art,the level of ordinary skill in the art,the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art,and objective indicia of nonobviousness.graham john deere,d.as explained below,we find clear error in the trial court findings on these underlying facts on reviewing these factual bases,we conclude the district court also erred in refusing to invalidate claims and for obviousness in view of the lunar news articles.
the central issue concerns the differences between the aspects of the invention claimed at claims and,and the teachings of the lunar news articles.as the district court necessarily recognized,there are more similarities than differences.these claims,and the july article,both teach administering alendronate once a week instead of once a day.these claims read in light of the specification,and the july article,both it has been conceded as known in the art at the time that for treating or preventing osteoporosis a dosage at seven times the daily dose would be as effective as seven daily doses.the patent,and both the april and july articles,explain the motivation for a dose as increasing patient compliance,by making it easier to take the drug and incur the inconvenience of the rigorous dosing regimen less frequently.although the claims teach or mg doses rather than the or mg doses disclosed in the july article,arthur of the on the against merck interest that a mg dose would be as effective as seven daily mg doses,and a mg dose would be as effective as seven daily mg doses,in preventing or treating osteoporosis.there was no great leap required of those skilled in the art to go from or mg once a week,the pills available at the time to treat patients with paget disease,to a or mg pill once a week.the district court conclusion that the claims are not obvious can not rest on any of these similarities between the claimed invention and the two lunar news articles.
the district court distinguished the two lunar news articles on grounds that they failed to explain how the dosing overcame concerns in the art with adverse gi side effects.merck,d at.we are left with the firm conviction that this distinction is misplaced.as noted,the district court found those in the art had identified two types of adverse gi problems with alendronate.the first,and most significant,involved esophageal injury or repetitive irritation of the esophagus.the district court,reviewing the october article by degroen in the new england journal of medicine,expressly recognized the literature taught that complications related to alendronate were due to prolonged contact of the drug with the esophagus.merck,d at.confronted with this problem,merck revised its dosing instructions and sent the clarifying materials to prescribing physicians in a march dear doctor letter.after merck sent this letter,the reported incidence of gi distress fell to almost nothing even as the number of patients being prescribed fosamax doubled by october.although the patent focuses on this adverse gi,it provides no additional motivation to overcome this problem beyond the motivation described in the two articles.the patent,both articles,and the prevailing knowledge of those skilled in the art,recognized that to the extent dosing problems were related to repetitive irritation of the esophagus from patients getting pills stuck in their throats,taking fewer pills each week could reduce the attending gi problems thus,the district court clearly erred in finding any significant difference between the claimed invention and the two articles as to this type of gi problem.
the district court found a second adverse gi related to the size of the dose,which merck argued gave rise to the expectation by physicians in the field during that alendronate sodium at doses over mg would not be in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.merck,d at see also id.at,discussing chesnut study.neither the patent nor the lunar news articles explain how a higher dosing regimen would avoid this set of adverse side effects.the patent sets forth no human clinical or laboratory data showing the safety and tolerability of the treatment methods claimed by the patent.the only data provided in the patent was generated in beagles,an experiment discredited at trial and disregarded by the district court in its decision.so while the district court may be correct in finding the lunar news articles may have invited skepticism based on concerns for gi problems,the claimed invention adds nothing beyond the teachings of those articles.thus,the district court clearly erred in finding any difference between the claimed invention and the articles on this point.
the district court only remaining distinction between the claimed invention and the two lunar news articles goes to the probative value of the articles.the trial court wrote that it was not persuaded that the two lunar news articles,not published in journals or authored by one skilled in the art,either alone or in combination,overcame the serious side effect concerns associated with higher dosage units of alendronate sodium.merck,d at.although these indicia of a study is,and the credentials of the go to weight when the trial court has not excluded evidence as unreliable and irrelevant,the district court reliance on these factors to distinguish merck claimed invention is,again,misplaced.first,as noted above,these factors provide no relevant distinction between the articles and the claimed invention because the patent also fails to explain how its higher dosing would overcome these.second,as explained below the district court finding the author of the lunar news articles not skilled in the relevant art is inconsistent with the court own definition of the relevant art.thus,the extent to which the district court discounts the probative value of the two articles based on the credentials of the author calls for closer scrutiny and casts doubt on the findings that depend on this reasoning.
in short,the district court clearly erred in distinguishing the claimed invention from the two lunar news articles offered as section prior art.contrary to the district court findings,these articles support the conclusion that merck claims and are invalid as obvious.
for similar reasons we find the district court characterization of the scope and content of the prior art favors invalidating claims and as obvious.the district court described its larger task as identifying a showing of the teaching or motivation to combine prior art references.merck,d at quoting in re gartside.but as shown above,in this case the lunar news articles contain the relevant teaching of the weekly dosing claimed in the patent.the specific combination of elements in claims and differs from the disclosure in the lunar news articles only in terms of a minor difference in the dosage without this difference,the lunar news articles would anticipate claims and under section.for the lunar news articles to render claims and obvious,the district court need only have found a suggestion or motivation to modify the dosages from those in the articles to those in the claims.see,sibia neurosciences,cadus pharm.but as noted above,merck own inventors admit the difference in dosing amount is obvious.if anything,concern over dosing amount suggests lowering the weekly to mg,and from to mg,just as merck did.the district court thus clearly erred to the extent it found lacking any motivation to combine existing knowledge with the lunar news articles to reach the claimed invention.
the district court failed to ascertain the required motivation to combine references to achieve the claimed invention,and it ignored the plain teachings of the lunar news articles.as the court stated,the issue is when viewing the mosaic of prior art,whether those of ordinary skill in the art would have had the motivation to formulate a daily dose of alendronate,despite safety concerns.merck,d at.
the lunar news articles had clearly suggested the dosing.they did so,as noted above,and as described in the patent,to avoid or minimize problems related to dosing frequency.and as shown above,the district court itself found this particular set of problems were of greatest concern in the art.indeed,to the extent the district court finds merck idea because it went against prevailing wisdom,the court must still explain why merck and not mazess should get credit for the idea.because merck idea added nothing to what came before,the district court answer comes down to nothing more than the credentials of the authors.in this case that difference is not enough to avoid invalidating the claims 
the district court answered its own question incorrectly,because its analysis of the prior art fails to credit its own distinction between the safety concerns from dosing frequency and dosing amount.as noted above,the claimed invention does not address the problems with the dosing amount,but only the more widespread problems of the dosing frequency.the court review of the scope and content of the prior art itself focuses on this concern with prolonged contact of the drug with the esophagus.merck,d at.this understanding of the prior art does not support a conclusion that the claimed invention as a whole was in view of the prior art.see sgs importers int l,in re kaslow.insofar as the district court relied on safety concerns related to dosing frequency,the prior art favors the conclusion that taking pills once a week was obvious.
thus,the scope and content of the prior art confirms that the invention claimed in claims and would have been obvious in view of the lunar news articles.to the extent the district court interpreted the scope of the prior art otherwise,that was clear error.
we likewise find clear error in the district court conclusion that mazess was not skilled in the relevant art.the district court failed to credit the evidence showing mazess lunar news was widely distributed among those working in the field of osteoporosis.moreover,while we recognize the importance academic or professional training plays in establishing expert qualifications or the probative value of a section reference,we think the district court failed to give proper credit to the fact that mazess was an expert in osteoporosis.in focusing on mazess academic training,the district court ignored its own finding that one of skill in the art would be someone working in the field of,or doing research on,osteoporosis.thus,the district court erred in dismissing or minimizing the probative value of the lunar news articles.
finally,the district court erred in its weighing of secondary considerations of.although the district court correctly found merck dosing of fosamax was commercially successful,in this context that fact has minimal probative value on the issue of obviousness.merck,d at.commercial success is relevant because the law presumes an idea would successfully have been brought to market sooner,in response to market forces,had the idea been obvious to persons skilled in the art.thus,the law deems evidence of commercial success,and some causal relation or nexus between an invention and commercial success of a product embodying that invention,probative of whether an invention was.see graham,at.such secondary considerations as commercial success,long felt but unsolved needs,failure of others,might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented.as indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness,these inquiries may have relevancy,perrigo.
that rationale has no force in this case.in graham the supreme court relied on the reasoning from a law review note discussing commercial success.see graham,at,citing note,subtests of nonobviousness a nontechnical approach to patent validity.the article suggested t he possibility of market success attendant upon the solution of an existing problem may induce innovators to attempt a solution.if in fact a product attains a high degree of commercial success,there is a basis for inferring that such attempts have been made and have failed.as our predecessor court explained in in re fielder,t hese rationales,presumably approved by the supreme court,tie commercial success and the like directly to the practical,financial source of impetus for research and development.but that chain of inferences fails on these facts.although commercial success might generally support a conclusion that merck claimed invention was in relation to what came before in the marketplace,the question at bar is narrower.it is whether the claimed invention is in relation to the ideas set forth in the lunar news articles.financial success is not significantly probative of that question in this case because others were legally barred from commercially testing the lunar news ideas.mazess,for example,could not put his ideas to practice in could only exhort merck to try it.they did.
in this case merck had a right to exclude others from practicing the of alendronate specified in claims and,given another patent covering the administration of alendronate sodium to treat osteoporosis,pat.issued,and its exclusive statutory right,in conjunction with fda marketing approvals,to offer fosamax at any dosage for the next five years.c d ii.because market entry by others was precluded on those bases,the inference of of,from evidence of commercial success,is weak.although commercial success may have probative value for finding of merck regimen in some context,it is not enough to show the claims at bar are patentably distinct from the ideas in the lunar news articles.thus,we conclude the district court misjudged this factor as confirming its conclusion of.
in short,we find the relevant graham factors establish claims and of the patent are obvious in view of the april and july lunar news articles.thus,we reverse the district court and hold claims and invalid.
iii.conclusion 
we reverse the district court claim construction and hold that about should be construed consistently with its ordinary meaning of approximately.in addition,we vacate the district court determination that the patent was not invalid as obvious.we hold claims and invalid as obvious and not infringed.the district court judgment of infringement is therefore 
this case shows the consequences of paying only lip service to the,but lexicographer rule and the basic jurisprudential principle of according trial courts proper deference.
elect the lexicographer option at your own risk 
with this court claim constructions wavering between the plain meaning rule often a subtle way for judges to impose their own semantic subjectivity on claim terms,see,salomon,permanent affixation of the wheels to the skate boot in the context of skates did not include a bolt that could only be reached by tearing apart the shoe and the specification über alles rule often a way for judges to import limitations not included in the claim,see,phillips awh,vacated,reh g en banc granted.july,a patent applicant might suppose that the best option to define the scope of the claim language might be the lexicographer rule.under the lexicographer rule,an inventor acts as an independent lexicographer and can even give claim terms a meaning inconsistent with its ordinary meaning.boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,citing teleflex,ficosa am,see also teleflex,at a n inventor may choose to be his own lexicographer if he defines the specific terms used to describe the invention with reasonable clarity,deliberateness,and precision.quoting in re paulsen.indeed,this court often acknowledges that an applicant,acting as a lexicographer,may define black as white.see hormone research,genentech,it is a axiom in patent law that a patentee is free to be his or her own lexicographer and thus may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more of their ordinary meanings.see also,int l rectifier ixys,patentee defining annular,which ordinarily means in the shape of a ring,to describe structures that are not circular or curved,but polygonal.in this case,the patentee used the lexicographer rule to define a lengthy phrase.in its definition,the patentee defined the phrase with precise values.the patentee definition,however,fell five letters short of success because the phrase included the word about.this court seized on that word,gave it an ordinary meaning,and cast aside the lexicographer rule without a convincing explanation.moreover,this court overturned the result of a lengthy district court trial for the sole reason that the trial court applied this court lexicographer rule.i find it hard to explain to the district court how it erred by following this court rules.
the disputed term in claim of the patent is the phrase about mg of alendronate monosodium trihydrate,on an alendronic acid basis.similarly,the disputed term in claim is the phrase about mg of alendronate monosodium trihydrate,on an alendronic acid basis.teva contends that this court should parse out one word in that phrase,about,and accord that single word its ordinary meaning of approximately.merck,on the other hand,contends that the term about is inseparable from the entire phrase,which it defines under the lexicographer rule to account for the variability in the active ingredient weight that would result from the use of a salt of alendronic acid.
the specification shows the proper interpretation of the disputed phrase.see vitronics conceptronic,the specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication.in the specification of the patent,the patentee exercised the lexicographer option and defined the disputed phrase as follows 
because of the mixed nomenclature currently in use by those o f ordinary skill in the art,reference to a specific weight or percentage of a bisphosphonate compound in the present invention is on an acid active weight basis,unless otherwise indicated herein.for example,the phrase about mg of a bone resorption inhibiting bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronate,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,and mixtures thereof,on an alendronic acid active weight basis means that the amount of the bisphosphonate compound selected is calculated based on mg of alendronic acid.
in a passage that classically invokes this court lexicographer doctrine,the patentee clearly,deliberately,and precisely defined the phrase about mg of a bone resorption inhibiting bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronate,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,and mixtures thereof,on an alendronic acid active weight basis.the patentee set forth that entire term with quotations,including the word about and then stated unambiguously that the phrase means that the amount of the bisphosphonate compound selected is calculated based on mg of alendronic acid.patent,ll.emphases added.the choice of the words phrase and means,combined with the use of quotation marks to set the phrase off from the rest of the sentence,unmistakably notify a reader of the patent that the patentee exercised the option to define the entire phrase without respect to its ordinary meaning as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention.see multiform desiccants,medzam.
to underscore the choice to define the phrase as a lexicographer,the patentee explains the reason that this phrase needs definition b ecause of the mixed nomenclature currently in use by those o f ordinary skill in the art.patent,ll.therefore,even a casual reader,let alone one with skill in this art,would immediately recognize that the patentee intended to avoid any ambiguity inherent in mixed nomenclature by explicitly defining the entire phrase.see paulsen,at where an inventor chooses to be his own lexicographer and to give terms uncommon meanings,he must set out his uncommon definition in some manner within the patent disclosure so as to give one of ordinary skill in the art notice of the change.quoting intellicall,phonometrics.
the language of this definition explains further the scientific reason that an express definition is necessary.alendronate monosodium trihydrate is a bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronic acid,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,and mixtures thereof.a salt or a mixture may require a different weight to achieve the same number of bisphosphonate molecules present in mg of alendronate.
the patentee did not leave this difference vague,however,but instructed that the precise dose in claim about mg of alendronate monosodium trihydrate,on an alendronic acid basis means that the amount of alendronate monosodium trihydrate is calculated based on mg of alendronic acid.similarly,the disputed language of claim about mg of alendronate monosodium trihydrate,on an alendronic acid basis means that the amount of alendronate monosodium trihydrate is calculated based on mg of alendronic acid.the word about in the defined phrase takes into account the variability of the weight of the active ingredient that would result from using different salts of alendronic acid in the tablets,instead of the acid itself.in other words,a heavier salt would require more by weight to achieve the same number of alendronate molecules.for example,about mg of alendronate sodium,on an alendronic acid active basis,contains the same number of molecules of alendronate as mg of alendronic acid,regardless of the actual weight of the alendronate sodium in the tablet.
with respect to the word about,the patentee included that word in the entire phrase expressly defined in the specification and set off by quotation marks.therefore,this court can not,without disturbing the patentee express definition of the entire phrase,abstract that term out of its context and supply an ordinary meaning.thus,by abstracting about out of the patentee express definition,this court opinion defeats the patentee choice of words,punctuation,and phraseology and instead extracts a single word from its context in the phrase.accordingly,the majority rewrites the express definition either by moving the word about outside of the quotation marks of the defined phrase or by inserting the word about into the definitional portion of the sentence so that it would read the amount of the bisphosphonate compound is calculated based on about mg of alendronic acid.if the patentee had chosen either of those two phraseologies,the majority opinion might be correct in its analysis.but because the patentee did not,this court can not give any principled reason that the district court erred in applying the lexicographer rule.contrary to this court rules,this opinion rewrites the specification and substitutes language not chosen by the patentee.see,chef,lamb weston,repeating the rule that courts may not redraft claims.
throughout the patent,the applicant remained faithful to the disputed phrases in claims and consistent with the specified lexicography,thus completely dispelling any notion of ambiguity in the term about.in particular,examples and corroborate the express definition.example states that t ablets containing about mg of alendronate,on an alendronic acid active basis,are prepared using the following weights of ingredients and lists alendronate monosodium trihydrate requiring a mass of mg.see patent,ll.similarly,example states that a liquid formulation containing about mg of alendronate monosodium trihydrate,on an alendronic acid active basis,per about ml of liquid is prepared using the following weights of ingredients and lists alendronate monosodium trihydrate having a mass of mg.id.at,ll.in these examples,the applicant supplied an exact weight that equates with about mg of alendronate on an alendronic acid active basis.accordingly,the district court did not err in construing the disputed claim terms about mg to mean the equivalent of mg of alendronic acid when taking into account molecular weight variances for its derivatives that carry accessories.merck,d at.the district court followed this court rules.
deference to trial courts time for truth in advertising 
this is the classic close case,so close in fact that ultimately two federal judges one of whom conducted an entire bench trial on this issue and the united states patent and trademark office agreed with merck,and two federal judges agreed with teva pharmaceuticals.the united states district court of delaware tried this case from march,then issued a opinion analyzing the claims and arguments in consummate and accurate detail.merck teva pharms.usa,d.this court received the typical briefs from the parties,an appendix containing selected portions of the record,and heard a total of approximately thirty minutes of argument by the parties on the issues before this court.despite the district court superior tools and time to evaluate the complete record,to hear and inquire from expert and fact witnesses,to delve into countless related details,to probe the scientific and semantic context,and to entertain argument as long as necessary for clarity,this court with its reading three briefs before its hearing becomes enamored with its own analysis of a very close issue and reverses the district court.
this court often hears criticism from district court judges that its reversal rate on claim construction issues far exceeds that of other circuit courts.see,symposium,the law,technology and the future of the federal circuit a panel discussion claim construction from the perspective of the district judge,case res.symposium i district judges discussing problems with this court high reversal rate on claim construction issues see gregory wallace,note,toward certainty and uniformity in patent infringement cases after festo and markman a proposal for a specialized patent trial court with a rule of greater deference,cal,discussing various studies regarding this court reversal rate on claim construction issues.in response,nearly every judge on this court has publicly professed to accord some level of deference to district courts regardless of this court de novo review of claim construction issues.see,symposium i at a district court judge stating i have certainly heard a number of federal circuit judges agree,that the cafc gives some deference to a opinion,as a practical matter symposium,the past,present and future of the federal circuit judicial constellations guiding principles as navigational aids,case res,judge of the federal circuit stating review is really not de novo after all.it is unfortunate that there is no label in between de novo and clear error review.functionally,claim construction falls in this middle ground.either the federal circuit accords deference in accordance with its public protestations or it does not in accordance with its legal standard barring any deference.if the former,this court has a truth in advertising problem.its actual practice clashes with its professed legal duty.if the latter,this court has a different kind of truth in advertising problem.
in this case,this court eschews all deference,a particularly striking choice in the face of a very close case and a district court whose diligent and intelligent process and resolution earned more respect than it received.i am not entirely sure which aspect of the truth in advertising problem this case illustrates,but it certainly makes any protestations of deference in fact sound rather hollow.
on appeal,teva does not challenge the district court determination that the patent is enforceable or that it would be infringed by teva proposed drug product.
teva filed one amendment for the mg dosage,and later filed another for the mg dosage.merck,d at.merck separately sued teva for infringement,under e a,based on each anda amendment.id.the district court consolidated those suits in the present action.
the present case relates to another action between the two parties involving merck daily formulation of fosamax.the district court found teva proposed generic daily alendronate compound would infringe merck patent on that drug,and this court affirmed that decision.merck teva pharms.usa.in this action the parties agreed to be bound by the judgment from this court on issues relating to the daily formulation.as a result,the only issues before the district court in this case related to the patent.merck,d at.
that is,the trial court construed the disputed claim terms about mg to mean the equivalent of mg of alendronic acid when taking into account molecular weight variances for its derivatives that carry accessories.merck,d at.
lunar news is a quarterly newsletter distributed to approximately to physicians and others in the medical art by lunar corporation,a manufacturer of bone densitometry equipment used to diagnose osteoporosis.merck,d at teva br.at.the author of each article is mazess,who has a doctorate degree in anthropology,but does not have formal training in pharmacology.id.teva points out,however,that mazess directed the bone mineral laboratory at the university of wisconsin,established bone densitometry as a diagnostic tool,founded the first manufacturer of bone densitometry measuring equipment lunar,was lunar first president,has participated in and designed clinical trials for osteoporosis treatment,and is widely published in the bone disease field.
teva argues that the mg and mg amounts were recommended because mg tablets of alendronate monosodium trihydrate were commercially available for those who suffer from paget disease,a bone disorder that also responds to bisphosphonate treatment.the standard daily dose of fosamax is mg or mg.exact multiples of the standard daily dose corresponding to the amount of fosamax administered in a week,mg or mg,were not commercially available at the time of the lunar news articles.thus,teva argues,the mg and mg dosages should be viewed as teaching the patent increase in daily dosages and mg,in terms of the mg doses on the market.
the dissent frames the dispute in terms of the entire phrase about mg of alendronate monosodium trihydrate,on an alendronic acid basis.post at.notwithstanding this contention,the district court identified the disputed claim terms as about mg.merck,d at.in its brief to this court,merck likewise stated the issue as whether the district court properly construed the aforementioned limitation not disputed term on grounds that the patent expressly defined about mg as calculated based on mg of alendronic acid.see appellee br.at statement of issues.we agree with merck,and the district court,that the dispute concerns the proper meaning of about.we thus understand the dissent to argue that meaning is fixed by the context of the claim and the language of the written is correct to look first to those sources for the meaning at issue.see vitronics,at.however,as is noted above when the intrinsic evidence does not clearly establish its own lexicography,it is proper to determine the ordinary meaning of the term.for that reason we ascribe about its ordinary meaning,the dissent pursues a philosophical argument as to the deference which should be given to the trial court.claim construction being a legal matter it is reviewed de novo and this is still the law notwithstanding the desire of some members of this court to consider creating an exception to that rule.see cybor,at plager,concurring id.at mayer,concurring in judgment id.at rader,dissenting.therefore,if we apply proper legal precedent as the majority has done in this case,the result is clear and obvious.
merck argues that the district court construction is supported by the fact that about was not used twice i
