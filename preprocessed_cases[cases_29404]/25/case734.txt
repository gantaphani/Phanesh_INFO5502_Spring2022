plaintiffs are the five adult children and mother of the decedent,patricia amonoo,who died following cardiac pacemaker surgery in.plaintiffs sued jude medical,jeremy kosel collectively,defendants,and others involved in the surgery for,among other things,wrongful death as a result of defendants negligence.the trial court granted jude motion for summary judgment,concluding defendants did not owe amonoo a duty of care with respect to the acts or omissions that allegedly caused her injury and death and that plaintiffs lack ed evidence that any acts or omissions by kosel breached his duty of care under the circumstances or proximately caused the injury or death.
plaintiffs appeal.they contend the court erred by granting summary judgment because they did not have a sufficient opportunity to conduct discovery to oppose the motion defendants did not satisfy their initial burden of production they raised a triable issue of material fact regarding whether defendants negligently undertook a duty to monitor amonoo during or after the surgery and the court improperly relied on kennedy medtronic kennedy 
factual and procedural background 
la viola,an employee of permanente medical group kaiser,implanted the cardiac pacemaker in amonoo on october,at dameron hospital in stockton.jude sold the pacemaker leads that la viola prescribed and implanted in amonoo.kosel,a jude employee,supplied the pacemaker leads and was present during amonoo surgery to operate jude pacing system analyzer psa,a device used to test the status and level of function of the pacemaker and leads.the implantation of the pacemaker perforated the right atrium and ascending aorta of amonoo heart,causing cardiac tamponade,or the accumulation of blood around her heart.amonoo died shortly after the surgery.
in august,plaintiffs filed a wrongful death and survival action against la viola,kaiser,dameron hospital association dameron,and various doe defendants.plaintiffs alleged t he infliction of the cardiac perforations themselves may or may not constitute medical negligence.but negligence is clear in that defendants contemporaneous and monitoring of amonoo must have been casual in the extreme for them to have failed to recognize and,for a considerable length of time,remained entirely unaware of,such substantial perforations and such major internal bleeding.had defendants recognized what was happening at any time during the first hour after the perforations occurred,and taken appropriate measures,amonoo chances of survival would have been very good.plaintiffs alleged each defendant was the employer,employee,coworker,supervisor of each of the other defendants,and was at all such times acting within the course and scope of such capacity or relationship,and each of the defendants is legally responsible for each of the wrongful acts and omissions alleged herein,and legally caused the injuries and damages to plaintiffs 
plaintiffs named jude and kosel as doe defendants in june.
defendants summary judgment motion 
in,defendants moved for summary judgment they argued they did not owe a legal duty to provide medical care to amonoo kosel did not assume a legal duty to provide medical care to amonoo or to monitor her medical condition for a complication of surgery and there was no evidence kosel was negligent,or that any such negligence caused amonoo death defendants claimed they owed no legal duty to surgically implant a pacemaker lead or diagnose a patient medical condition,or to monitor a patient medical condition for the purpose of diagnosing a complication from surgery.according to defendants,la viola selected the pacemaker and leads he wanted to implant.kosel did not implant the leads,nor did he direct or instruct la viola how or where to implant them.kosel operated the psa and reported the readings to la viola when la viola tested the pacemaker for signal strength.kosel did not undertake any responsibility to monitor amonoo during or after the surgery,because such monitoring would have been outside the scope of his employment as a sales representative for jude.defendants argued they were added as doe defendants solely because kosel was in the operating room during amonoo surgery,which is standard procedure and required by kaiser 
kosel submitted a declaration in support of defendants motion for summary judgment.in it,he averred he supplied the pacemaker that was sold to dameron and prescribed by amonoo physician to treat her heart condition as medical device vendors,neither jude nor its sales employees are licensed to practice medicine and the practice of medicine would be outside the scope of his employment as a sales representative for jude jude sales representatives do not provide medical care they support physicians by supplying measurements retrieved from devices and he did not voluntarily assume any duty to provide medical care to amonoo,including care to discern whether she was suffering from any internal injury resulting from her surgery.
defendants also submitted the deposition testimony of la viola and lee vang,the circulating nurse.la viola testified kosel is positioned watching a machine,and when i want to test the lead,then he will read the machine and give me numbers that i will use to know whether or not i am in a good place.when asked whether kosel job was to identify the location of the distress in the patient heart,la viola responded,no.his job is to read this machine that is called the psa,and when i hook up my lead to this machine,it will give numbers,and then he reports the numbers to me what he doing really does not have anything to do with the location but rather on the strength of the signal.it almost like moving around an antenna and getting a good signal.similarly,vang testified the doctor not kosel determines where to position the leads.
finally,defendants submitted excerpts from kosel deposition,where he testified he brings the equipment to the operating room and provides the physician with access to our analyzer and the data from our analyzer when the physician order s kosel to give him numbers based upon the electrical parameters of that lead,kosel provides it by p ushing a few buttons and then report s the numbers that the psa gives by telling the doctor the numbers showing the doctor the computer screen with the data.kosel testified he did not advise la viola on which leads to use,and he did not guide or direct la viola where to place the leads.in addition,kosel stated he did not know why la viola repositioned the leads and explained such repositioning was based on p hysician preference and physician discretion.according to kosel,doctors choose to do whatever they need to do regarding the lead position.sales representatives provide information.we do provide opinion.we do provide direction.we provide information we bring the products and provide the analysis.
plaintiffs opposition and defendants reply 
in opposition,plaintiffs claimed kosel was active in guiding la viola in the placement of the pacemaker lead and that la viola repositioned the lead u nder the guidance and direction of kosel.according to plaintiffs,kosel came under a duty of care to amonoo when he undertook to guide la viola placement of the insertion of the pacemaker leads into amonoo heart.plaintiffs contended kosel committed ordinary negligence and that defendants were liable under the negligent undertaking theory of liability formalized in section of the second restatement of torts.plaintiffs relied on artiglio corning cal th artiglio,a case describing the negligent undertaking theory of liability 
plaintiffs relied on virtually the same deposition testimony from la viola and vang as defendants.plaintiffs also submitted a field contact report prepared by kosel several months after the surgery,where he wrote i t is suspected that the perforations may have resulted during an attempt to electrically map with,and subsequently fixate,the active fixation lead.in addition,plaintiffs submitted the declaration of their expert witness,peter curran,the director of cardiovascular rehabilitation at mary hospital in san francisco.among other things,curran observed that one of the leads was placed and attachment was attempted in four different locations within the right atrium curran opined that more likely than not,the perforations of the atrium and a or ta occurred during the procedure implanting the pacemaker.
curran concluded la viola caused the lead to perforate the atrium and the aorta because he was not careful or attentive in his effort to reposition the lead curran explained that it was virtually impossible to puncture the aorta during surgery without knowing that you did so and that la viola knew or should have known or should have suspected that amonoo a or ta was at high risk for a puncture.according to curran,la viola performed below the standard of care by using an inordinate amount of pressure to reposition the lead and by failing to recognize the high risk of puncture.curran also faulted la viola for failing to monitor amonoo for a longer period of time after the surgery curran explained that there was a duty to consistently monitor the vital signs in a patient in fair condition with a severe systematic disease.curran opined that the perforation of the atrium and a or ta along with the failure to monitor both by la viola and the nurses led to amonoo death and fell below the standard of care.
in reply,defendants argued plaintiffs evidence did not raise a triable issue of material fact because curran opined that the actions of the doctor and the hospital employees not jude led to amonoo death there was no evidence kosel implanted the lead into amonoo heart or directed or instructed la viola where to implant the lead or how much force to use when inserting the lead plaintiffs presented no evidence kosel undertook any duty to diagnose or monitor amonoo medical condition after surgery there was no evidence kosel selected the lead or acted negligently and there was no evidence defendants alleged negligence caused amonoo death.finally,defendants contended there was no evidence supporting plaintiffs claim under section of the second restatement of torts.
the order granting summary judgment for defendants 
following a hearing,the court granted summary judgment for defendants.it determined defendants satisfied their burden of showing that plaintiffs lack evidence to establish that defendants had a duty of care to amonoo with respect to the acts or omissions that allegedly caused her injury and death,and also that plaintiffs lack evidence that any acts or omissions by kosel breached his duty of care under the circumstances or proximately caused the injury or death.the court determined defendants did not owe a duty of care to amonoo regarding the manner in which the pacemaker was inserted into her chest or the alleged failure to monitor her condition after surgery.
the court further concluded kennedy,supra,was on all fours because kosel had a limited role in connection with the procedure.kosel did not implant the pacemaker or leads and did not instruct la viola how or where to implant the leads.instead,he provided electrical performance measurements from the psa and did not undertake a duty to monitor amonoo medical condition or diagnose possible complications from the surgery.as the court explained,plaintiffs do not have evidence that any error in connection with the readings taken from the psa caused amonoo injury and death.instead,they allege that there may have been negligence in the perforation of the atrium and aorta during implantation of the pacemaker lead,and that the monitoring by the physician and hospital were negligent.finally,the court rejected plaintiffs characterization of la viola,vang,and kosel deposition testimony and sustained defendants objection to curran testimony that the leads were placed in amonoo heart under the direction and instruction of the jude sales representative kosel insofar as he was the only one who knew how to operate the testing device.
the court entered judgment for defendants and plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.citation.we make an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action by showing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.citation.once the defendant has made such a showing,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or as to a defense to the cause of action.citation.citation.howard entertainment,kudrow th,howard.in performing our de novo review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the losing parties.citation.in this case,we liberally construe plaintiffs evidentiary submissions and strictly scrutinize defendants own evidence,in order to resolve any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiffs favor.citation.id.at.
plaintiffs had an adequate opportunity to conduct discoverybefore opposing the motion for summary judgment 
plaintiffs repeatedly claim the court erred by granting summary judgment because they did not have a sufficient amount of time to conduct discovery.according to plaintiffs,they were unable to marshal a detailed factual case in opposition to defendants summary judgment motion,apparently because defendants made a series of maneuvers such as trying to prevent kosel deposition.this argument fails for three reasons.first,it is not supported by any authority.berger california ins.guarantee th,fn.omitted failure to support contention with authority constitutes a waiver of the issue on appeal.second,it is inaccurate because plaintiffs had ample time to conduct discovery to support their opposition.plaintiffs deposed la viola in may,over a year before defendants moved for summary judgment they deposed kosel in may,three months before defendants filed the motion.third,plaintiffs waived this argument by not moving to continue the summary judgment hearing pursuant to code of civil procedure,section,subdivision h,which allows a party to request a continuance to obtain facts essential to justify opposition to a motion for summary judgment.code civ,c,subd.h see also zamudio city and county of san francisco th,plaintiff waived objection to defendant apparent failure to produce discoverable documents by failing to seek a continuance of the hearing pursuant to code of civil procedure,section,subdivision h.as discussed below,the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment because plaintiffs could not even after conducting discovery produce admissible evidence supporting the elements of their claims.
the court properly concluded defendants met their burden of proof 
plaintiffs contend the court erred by granting summary judgment because defendants failed even to meet their initial burden of production.relying on scheiding dinwiddie construction th scheiding and several other cases,plaintiffs claim defendants did not satisfy their burden of production because they pointed to a lack of evidence supporting plaintiffs claims rather than offering any affirmative evidence.
plaintiffs reliance on scheiding is misplaced.in that case,a defendant in an asbestos case failed to engage in meaningful discovery as to the basis of the plaintiff claims.sheiding,supra,th at.the defendant moved for summary judgment,claiming the plaintiff had no evidence supporting a case against it.id.at.a division of this court reversed summary judgment granted for the defendant because the plaintiff had never been asked whether he had any evidence linking the defendant to the areas where he worked.the scheiding court explained that the duty to answer completely only extended so far as the reasonable ambit of the questions which were asked.the plaintiff had no duty to volunteer information that was not requested.id.at.
scheiding has no bearing here.here and in contrast to scheiding,defendants demonstrated through kosel declarati
