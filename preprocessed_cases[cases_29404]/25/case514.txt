genetics institute,llc,genetics appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the district of delaware dismissing its action under for lack of an interference in fact between certain claims of its patent the patent and certain claims of patents and the patent and the patent collectively,the novartis patents.novartis asserts that the expiration of the patent following the district court entry of judgment renders us without jurisdiction over genetics appeal.novartis also asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction over certain claims of the patent because its term extension under applied only on a basis.because the district court did not err in dismissing genetics action for lack of an interference in fact,and because we disagree with novartis jurisdictional arguments,we affirm.
background 
the district court opinion summarizes the science underlying the patented technology in this case,which relates to truncated forms of a protein called factor viii.genetics,llc novartis vaccines diagnostics,d.factor viii is an essential protein that circulates freely in the blood in an inactive state.factor viii becomes activated as part of a chain of reactions called the cascade,which causes the formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding from damaged blood vessels.defects in the gene encoding factor viii result in hemophilia a,a genetic disorder associated with prolonged bleeding.
the human factor viii protein is stabilized in the bloodstream by binding to von willebrand factor vwf,a large blood protein that prevents the degradation of factor viii.id.at.if factor viii is not able to form a complex with vwf,the of factor viii in plasma is reduced about.thus,while factor viii retains its procoagulant activity even without vwf binding,the association of factor viii with vwf is critical for the optimal regulation of blood coagulation.in addition,a factor viii protein that can not bind vwf may cause unwanted clots in areas such as heart vessels because unbound factor viii can bind blood platelets even when no injury has been detected.
the factor viii protein consists of amino acid residues the chemical building blocks of proteins.id.the protein contains several regions,or domains,each of which folds into a structure independent of the others.factor viii contains the following domains,b,and.the figure below depicts the locations of these domains in the factor viii protein.see br.of at see also br.at.the heavy chain or a domain portion of the protein consists of amino acids to and contains the and domains as well as two acidic regions known as and the b domain contains amino acids to.the light chain or c domain portion of the protein consists of amino acids to.it contains a third acidic region,as well as the,and domains.the acidic region,of particular importance to the dispute in this case,contains amino acids to.it is directly adjacent to the b domain.
treating patients with hemophilia a traditionally involved administering partially purified factor viii derived from porcine or human plasma.in the,however,human plasma sources had become contaminated with viruses,such as hiv and hepatitis,making treatment with factor viii dangerous.recombinant factor viii,produced from dna cloning,offered a safer and more abundant new source of therapeutic material.scientists raced to clone factor viii successfully for the first time.yet cloning factor viii proved to be an enormous technical undertaking,because the factor viii protein was nearly ten times larger than any protein previously cloned.the large size of the dna sequence encoding the factor viii protein also complicated the cloning process.id.at.
once the feat of cloning the factor viii protein was achieved,researchers focused their efforts on finding a smaller,more easily cloned recombinant protein that mimicked the biological activity of factor viii in humans.id.at.those efforts formed the basis of the patents at issue in this appeal.as described below,scientists discovered that portions of the factor viii protein were unnecessary for procoagulant activity,and they designed truncated factor viii proteins lacking these portions.scientists further found that the acidic region of factor viii is responsible for binding to vwf and is therefore critical to factor viii performance.
the patent is assigned to genetics,a wholly owned subsidiary of wyeth which itself was recently acquired by pfizer.genetics,d at.the patent,which issued on september,claims priority from an application filed april,and names john toole,as the sole inventor.the patent was set to expire on september,at the end of its term.in,however,genetics obtained a patent term extension under based on the time consumed by testing and regulatory review of its commercial recombinant factor viii protein,refacto.the united states patent and trademark office pto extended the term of the patent to february.
at issue in this appeal are claims,and of the patent.these claim,respectively,a recombinant dna whose expression results in a truncated factor viii protein a host cell containing the recombinant dna a method of producing the truncated factor viii protein by culturing the host cells and a truncated human factor viii protein.
the truncated factor viii protein of claims,and has the amino acid sequence for human factor viii protein except that,in the region between amino acid and amino acid,a number of amino acids are deleted the size of the deletion ranges from at least to all amino acids in this region the region eligible for deletion encompasses the inactive b domain amino acids to and the acidic region in the light chain amino acids to.claim claims a truncated factor viii protein having one of three specific deletions between amino acids to to or to 
novartis vaccines and diagnostics,novartis is the assignee of the and patents.both of the novartis patents claim priority from an application filed january.
at issue in the patent are claims,and.claim claims a nucleic acid expressing a truncated recombinant factor viii protein in which all or part of the b domain is deleted.the claimed recombinant protein retains the amino acids in the heavy chain amino acids to and the light chain amino acids to,including the acidic region with the requirement that these retained portions have at least sequence identity to the native human factor viii protein.the protein also optionally retains certain amino acids in the b domain up to amino acids contiguous to amino acid,and up to amino acids contiguous to amino acid claim claims a host cell containing nucleic acid capable of expressing the truncated recombinant factor viii protein,and claim claims a method of producing the truncated recombinant factor viii protein by culturing the host cell.
the only claim at issue in the patent is claim,which claims a composition comprising factor viii proteins consisting essentially of two polypeptides a first comprising an amino acid sequence of the heavy chain a domain,and a second comprising an amino acid sequence of the light chain c domain.at least sequence identity with each region is required 
on may,genetics sued novartis in the united states district court for the district of delaware to determine priority of invention under.genetics alleged that an interference in fact existed between the following claims claim of the patent and claim of the patent claim of the patent and claim of the patent claim of the patent and claim of the patent and claims and of the patent and claim of the patent.genetics asserted that all three patents are directed to the same subject matter,truncated factor viii proteins lacking all or part of the b domain while retaining procoagulant activity.
novartis moved to dismiss,arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the extension of the patent under applied to fewer than all of that patent claims.novartis further argued that there was no interference in fact between the asserted claims because the novartis patents unlike the patent are directed to truncated factor viii proteins that preserve the functional acidic region.
in a memorandum order dated february,the district court construed the disputed claim language of the patent.genetics,llc novartis vaccines diagnostics,slr,wl.in a memorandum opinion of the same date,the district court held that the patent term extension under applied to all claims of the patent.genetics,d at.the court also granted novartis motion to dismiss,holding that there was no interference in fact as to any of the allegedly interfering claims.id.at.the court entered its final judgment on february.on march,genetics filed a timely notice of appeal.
under a,we have jurisdiction over final judgments arising under the patent laws.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
as noted,the district court entered final judgment on february,and the extended term of the patent expired three days later,on february.on april,novartis filed a motion in this court to dismiss genetics appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in light of the expiration of the patent.in an order dated december,we denied the motion to dismiss genetics appeal,dismissed novartis related,and directed the parties to present arguments in their briefs on the issue of jurisdiction.genetics,llc novartis vaccines diagnostics,slip.op.at.
novartis disputes our jurisdiction over genetics appeal.novartis contends that we should dismiss genetics appeal because the expiration of the extended term of the patent following the district court entry of final judgment divested this court of jurisdiction.relying on albert kevex,novartis argues that invocation of section requires the rather unusual step of the court dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction after the filing of a complaint whenever it becomes apparent that there is no interference.br.at.
genetics argues in response that we have jurisdiction over its appeal despite the expiration of the patent.genetics contends that an interference action under may apply to any patent,including an expired patent.genetics contrasts with an interference action under,which by its terms is limited to unexpired patents.genetics further contends that the holding in albert is limited to disclaimed patents and does not extend to expired patents.
we have an independent obligation to determine whether subject matter jurisdiction exists over an appeal.litecubes,llc light,see also arbaugh y h,d.as we explain below,we conclude that we possess jurisdiction over the present appeal.
the dispute over appellate jurisdiction in this case boils down to the parties divergent interpretations of albert.that case,like this one,involved an interfering patents action under.section reads 
the owner of an interfering patent may have relief against the owner of another by civil action,and the court may adjudge the question of the validity of any of the interfering patents,in whole or in part.the provisions of the second paragraph of section of this title shall apply to actions brought under this section.
albert asserted,among other causes of action,that claims in his patent interfered with claims of a patent owned by kevex corporation.albert,at.albert also asserted that the claims of the kevex patent were invalid under b.subsequently,kevex filed in the pto a disclaimer of the claims in its patent that allegedly interfered with albert claims.the trial court held that the filing of the disclaimer mooted the interfering patents action.id.at.yet the trial court proceeded to evaluate albert invalidity contentions,ultimately granting albert motion for summary judgment of invalidity.id.
kevex argued on appeal that the existence of an interference in a action is jurisdictional,such that the district court was required to determine that the patents interfered before determining the validity of either.id.we agreed and held that after the entry of kevex disclaimer there were no interfering patents to support jurisdiction for an action under.id.at.we therefore vacated and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.
novartis seeks to enlarge our holding in albert to reach patent expirations.we reject this expansive reading,and we decline to extend albert holding beyond the effect of a patent disclaimer in a action.disclaimers of patent claims are provided for under,which provides in part that 
a patentee,whether of the whole or any sectional interest therein,may,on payment of the fee required by law,make disclaimer of any complete claim,stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent.such disclaimer shall be in writing,and recorded in the patent and trademark office and it shall thereafter be considered as part of the original patent to the extent of the interest possessed by the disclaimant and by those claiming under him.
id.emphasis added.disclaiming particular claims under effectively eliminate s those claims from the original patent.vectra fitness,tnwk.in other words,upon entry of a disclaimer under,we treat the patent as though the disclaimed claim s had never existed.id.this court has interpreted the term considered as part of the original patent in section to mean that the patent is treated as though the disclaimed claims never existed.
we held in albert that the court has no jurisdiction under unless interference is established.at i nterference between patents is a sine qua non of an action under.jurisdiction under thus requires the existence of an interference,and a claim that never existed,vectra,at,can not form the basis for an interference.because the disclaimer in albert precluded any basis for an interference between the patents in suit,we held that it also eliminated jurisdiction under.
unlike a disclaimed claim,however,an expired patent is not viewed as having never existed.much to the contrary,a patent does have value beyond its expiration date.in re morgan.for example,an expired patent may form the basis of an action for past damages subject to the limitation under.see,id.recognizing that an action for patent infringement may be filed up to six years after the patent expiration.there is no comparable statute providing any such rights in a disclaimed claim.
furthermore,the expiration of the patent does not deprive this action of meaning.in kimberly clark procter gamble distributing,in determining that jurisdiction in a action existed following the parties settlement of infringement liability issues,we noted in support of our holding that a declaration of priority and the subsequent elimination of an invalid patent that claims the same subject matter as claimed in one patent are relief under.similar reasoning applies here.genetics points out that the outcome of this action will have consequences,because genetics corporate parent,wyeth,has been sued for allegedly infringing the novartis patents in a related case in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas.reply br.at see also compl.at,novartis vaccines diagnostics,wyeth,cv,ecf.a determination that the patent interferes with and has priority over the novartis patents would directly affect the outcome of that infringement suit.
we also note an important distinction between and the statute governing interferences before the pto.whereas an interfering patents action under involves two interfering patents without qualification,a action,in contrast,is declared between one pending application and any pending application,or any unexpired patent.emphasis added.this meaningful difference in statutory language indicates that,unlike,is not limited to unexpired patents.that is but one essential difference between these two statutes.compare guinn kopf,holding that the disclaimer of an allegedly interfering claim did not divest the pto of jurisdiction over the interference,with albert,at holding that the disclaimer of the allegedly interfering claims divested the district court of jurisdiction over the interfering patents action.
in view of the substantial differences between a disclaimer and an expiration,we decline to extend the holding in albert to patent expiration situations.accordingly,we hold that the expiration of the patent following the district court final decision does not strip our court of jurisdiction over the present appeal.
ii.district court jurisdiction 
novartis alleges that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide whether certain claims of the patent and the novartis patents interfered.novartis argues that claims and of the patent are not entitled to an extended term because genetics,in its patent term extension application under d,identified only claims and of the patent as relating to its commercial product refacto.because patent term extensions apply only on a basis,novartis argues,claims and expired on september,following the original patent term.novartis also maintains that because claim,as construed by the district court,does not cover refacto,it too is ineligible for patent term extension under.citing albert,novartis argues that because expired claims can not support an interfering patents action under,claims,and of the patent were not properly before the district court.
genetics argues in response that the district court correctly held that a patent term extension under applies to the term of the patent as a whole,to all claims in the patent.genetics asserts that the plain language of compels this statutory interpretation.genetics further maintains that each of claims,and covers refacto.specifically,genetics argues that because claim of the patent covers refacto a point conceded by novartis,claims and must also cover this commercial product,since claim depends from claim,which in turn depends from claim.
we,like the district court,genetics,d at,reject novartis assertion that a patent term extension under applies on a basis.the plain language of refutes novartis argument.the title of this section is extension of patent term.emphasis added.subsection a dictates that the term of the patent,as opposed to specific claim s,shall be extended 
the term of a patent which claims a product,a method of using a product,or a method of manufacturing a product shall be extended in accordance with this section from the original expiration date of the patent 
a emphases added.
the text of subsection b,which sets forth the rights derived from any patent the term of which is extended under this section,id.b emphasis added,is equally clear that applies to the term of the patent,not individual claim s.the restrictions on the rights derived set forth in subsection b do not suggest otherwise.subsection b was intended not to restrict the extension to particular claims,but rather to limit the effect of the extension.id.stating,for example,that for patents that claim a product,the rights in the extended term are limited to any use approved for the product.as the accompanying house report explained i f a chemical is subjected to regulatory review for new drug uses,but is also marketed for other commercial uses,the patent term extension would apply only to the new drug uses for which regulatory review was required,at.
thus,neither a nor b supports novartis position that applies only to particular claims.a patent as a whole is extended even though its effect may be limited to certain of its claims.novartis nonetheless contends that the extension must apply on a basis because d requires an application for a patent term extension to identify each claim that claims the approved product or method of using or manufacturing the approved product.d b.yet subsection d merely lists the required contents of an application for a patent term extension.subsections a and b,on the other hand,set forth the legal effect of the patent term extension itself 
in sum,in light of the plain language of,and absent any indication that congress intended that the extension should apply only to particular claims,we decline to adopt novartis arguments.
to the extent novartis contends that the restrictions under b on the rights derived from the extension of the patent prevented genetics from asserting claims,and in this action,we also disagree.novartis concedes that claim covers refacto,the approved product for which genetics received the patent term extension.because claim depends from claims and,those claims must also cover refacto.see.regarding claim,novartis incorrectly asserts that the district court construed claim as not covering the active ingredient of refacto.br.at.in fact,the district court noted that,under its claim construction,refacto may not be encompassed by claim.genetics,d at emphasis added.the court thus did not make a factual finding on the issue of whether claim of the patent covers refacto,and we decline to do so for the first time on appeal.see sage,devon.
finally,we also reject novartis related argument that no patent extended under can form the basis of a interfering patents action.the statutory text does not suggest that rights afforded by are so limited.and,as the district court correctly noted,genetics,d at,the legislative history advises against novartis interpretation the house report discussing the hatch waxman act provides that all provisions of the patent law apply to the patent during the period of extension,pt,at emphasis added.
iii.interference in fact 
the patent laws recognize two types of actions involving interfering claims.an interference action under can be declared by the pto w henever an application is made for a patent which would interfere with any pending application,or with any unexpired patent.an interfering patents action under permits t he owner of an interfering patent to seek relief against the owner of another by civil action.this case is an appeal from an interfering patents suit under to determine the priority of invention between certain issued patents.see slip track,metal lite.
the first step in a interfering patents action is the determination whether an interference in fact exists between claims of the two patents.medichem,rolabo.this requires application of a test,which,as discussed below,involves underlying questions of anticipation and obviousness under.id.at.accordingly,the standards of review for an interference in fact mirror those of anticipation and obviousness inquiries.id.
anticipation and obviousness require the court to compare the properly construed claims to the available prior art.oakley,sunglass hut int l.if each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior art reference,then the claim is invalid under for anticipation.sanofi synthelabo apotex,internal quotation marks omitted.we review a finding of anticipation for clear error.zenon envtl,filter.obviousness under is a question of law based on underlying factual determinations.oakley,at.we review the legal conclusion of obviousness de novo and the underlying findings of fact for clear error.id.
an interference in fact under requires that the two patents claim the same or substantially the same subject matter.slip track,at.interfering subject matter is defined by courts in the same manner as in the pto by using the test.medichem,at.under the pto regulations,a n interference exists if the subject matter of a claim of one party would,if prior art,have anticipated or rendered obvious the subject matter of a claim of the opposing party and vice versa.a.in other words,for two claims to interfere,each claim must anticipate or render obvious the other failure of either claim to anticipate or render obvious the other defeats the test for interfering patents.medichem,at t here can be no without satisfaction of each leg of the test.
a.there is no interference in fact between the asserted claims of the patent and the patent 
genetics argues that the district court erred by failing to find that an interference in fact existed between the allegedly interfering claims.according to genetics,the court erroneously determined that all of the allegedly interfering claims of the novartis patents require binding to vwf,when in fact that is not an explicit claim limitation.moreover,genetics asserts,the court incorrectly applied the test in finding no interference in fact.
regarding the allegedly interfering claims in the and patents in particular,genetics maintains that the amino acid deletion claimed by the patent is subsumed entirely by the deletion claimed by the patent thus,the patent claims would have been prima facie obvious over the allegedly interfering claims of the patent.genetics further contends that the district court misunderstood the testimony of its expert,phillip fay,who stated that with knowledge of the deletion points claimed in the patent,amino acids and it would have been obvious to select the deletion points claimed in the patent,amino acids and because the latter points were known in vivo cleavage points of the factor viii protein.genetics does not allege error in the district court determination that the patent claims would not have anticipated the patent claims.as for the second leg of the test,genetics contends that the district court erred by failing to find that the patent claims anticipate the patent claims.
novartis responds that there is no interference in fact between the allegedly interfering claims of the patent and the novartis patents.novartis contends that the test is not satisfied because the broader range of deletions permitted by the claims of the patent does not anticipate or render obvious the narrower range claimed in the novartis patents.novartis asserts that only the claimed novartis proteins retain the region and possess the increased stability associated with vwf binding,and even if this increased stability was not known as of the priority dates of the novartis patents,that property may nonetheless support the claimed proteins.novartis then proceeds on a basis to demonstrate why,in its view,the district court correctly concluded that the claims of the patent do not interfere with the claims of the novartis patents.
as we shall explain,we agree with the district court determinations that claim of the patent would not have rendered obvious claim of the patent claim of the patent would not have rendered obvious claim of the patent and claim of the patent would not have rendered obvious claim of the patent.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that the test is not satisfied and that there is no interference in fact between these claims.
the district court started and ultimately ended by examining the first leg of the test,whether the claims of the patent,if prior art,would invalidate the claims of the patent.genetics,d at.the court noted that these claims differ in terms of the nature of the truncated factor viii proteins encoded by the nucleic acids.id.at.the court then proceeded to analyze the differences between the groups of proteins claimed in the two patents.
to summarize the district court analysis,the claimed truncated factor viii proteins in the and patents differ in terms of the size of the permitted amino acid deletions,the location of the permitted amino acid deletions,and the degree of allowable amino acid substitutions.in particular,the deletion in claim of the patent and,by extension,claims and ranges in size from to amino acids and is located between amino acids and whereas the deletion in claims,and of the patent ranges in size from to amino acids and is located between amino acids and.the patent claims permit substitution of up to of the amino acids,whereas the patent claims do not.importantly,it is undisputed that the patent permits deletion of amino acids in the region,whereas the patent does not.
in view of these structural differences between the proteins claimed in the and patents,the district court correctly required as part of the prima facie obviousness inquiry the identification of some reason that would have prompted a researcher to modify the prior art compounds in a particular manner to arrive at the claimed compounds.id.at see also takeda chem,alphapharm,in re dillon,en banc s tructural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter,proved by combining references or otherwise,where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions,creates a prima facie case of obviousness.emphasis added in re grabiak,to establish prima facie obviousness,there must be adequate support in the prior art for the change in structure.in re lalu,in determining whether a case of prima facie obviousness exists,it is necessary to ascertain whether the prior art teachings would appear to be sufficient to one of ordinary skill in the art to suggest making the claimed substitution or other modification.this principle was reaffirmed by the supreme court opinion in ksr international teleflex,which acknowledged the importance of identifying a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does,d.
the district court correctly found that genetics failed to establish any such reason for modifying the group of proteins claimed in the patent to produce the group claimed in the patent.genetics,d at.as of the priority date of the patent,those of skill in the art understood the inactive b domain of the factor viii protein to be essentially delimited by residues and,to include the amino acids in the region.id.quoting,john toole et,a large region kda of human factor viii is dispensable for in vitro procoagulant activity,proc.acad.sci.indeed,as the district court noted,randal kaufman,a former genetics scientist,confirmed this fact.during his deposition,he stated that,in,the amino acid region was understood to be part of the b domain.id.
genetics argues that amino acid was one of the known in vivo cleavage sites on the factor viii protein,and,on account of this fact,it would be readily apparent to make a truncated factor viii protein that retained amino acids in the region,contrary to the teachings of the patent.br.of at.in support of its position,genetics cites two articles published in that disclosed a number of in vivo cleavage cites on the factor viii protein,see also.yet genetics concedes that it was not known prior to the filing of the patent that amino acids were critical to maintain vwf binding.br.of at.and genetics offers no basis for its assertion that the mere existence of in vivo cleavage points between particular amino acid residues would have provided one of ordinary skill with a reason or motivation to make the particular truncated proteins claimed in the patent.genetics,d at.
indeed,those same in vivo cleavage sites were known as of the priority date of the patent,but the proteins claimed in the patent do not require retention of amino acids.that indicates the weakness of genetics position and supports the district court conclusion that mere knowledge of in vivo cleavage sites on factor viii would not have provided a sufficient reason for making the proteins claimed in the patent.id.
genetics arguments also run contrary to the research objectives of those in the field of truncated factor viii proteins.the district court found that research in the factor viii field focused on finding a smaller recombinant protein that mimicked the biological activity of factor viii in humans.id.at emphasis added.that is consistent with the disclosure of the patent,which is focused on making proteins which have procoagulant activity similar to that of factor viii c and also have substantially lower molecular weight.patent ll see also id.ll i contemplate that my compounds may be produced by recombinant dna techniques at a much lower cost than is possible for production of human factor viii.the host organisms should more efficiently process and express the substantially simpler molecules of this invention.emphasis added.genetics fails to explain why,with knowledge of the claimed range of proteins in the patent,one of ordinary skill would have sought out a range encompassing larger recombinant proteins,proteins having smaller amino acid deletions,such as the range of proteins claimed in the patent.thus,contrary to genetics arguments,the mere existence of an in vivo cleavage point,without more,would not have provided the requisite reason or motivation,dillon,at,to manipulate the claimed proteins of the patent at that cleavage point to make those claimed in the patent.
the dissent,in arguing for obviousness,relies on those claimed proteins of the patent that retain the region.dissent op.at.but the dissent selectively parses the prior art disclosure with impermissible hindsight.each disputed claim of the patent teaches deletion of the region in some variants,thus leading away from a requirement that that region be retained.viewed as a whole,the prior art would not have prompted one of ordinary skill to require retention of the region.see panduit dennison,a prior patent must be considered in its entirety,as a whole,including portions that would lead away from the invention in suit.
further,the dissent challenges law requiring the identification of some reason that would have prompted a researcher to substantially modify a prior art compound to produce the claimed compound.dissent op.at.while the dissent accepts that the prior art here provided no suggestion or stated need for further experimentation and no motivation to optimize for some value within the range of proteins disclosed by the patent,id.at,the dissent nonetheless contends that,because of structural similarity in the patented proteins,no reason for chemical modification need be shown.the dissent vastly oversimplifies the differences in the claimed proteins,however.one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the claimed truncated proteins vary enormously in structure for example,the region alone contains amino acid residues and has a relative molecular mass of about.in contrast,the homologs,analogs,and isomers referenced by the dissent typically differ,at most,by only a few atoms and even in cases involving such ostensibly minor chemical differences,prima facie obviousness is by no means inevitable.see,grabiak,at reversing the pto finding of prima facie obviousness even though the prior art compound differed from the claimed compound only by the presence of a sulfur atom instead of a particular oxygen atom.the dissent oversimplification violates our longstanding admonition that generalization is to be avoided insofar as specific structures are alleged to be prima facie obvious one from the other.in re jones,citing grabiak,at.on the facts of this case,the nontrivial differences in the proteins at issue compel the requirement of identifying a reason for the chemical modification.
genetics asserts that the district court conclusion of nonobviousness is contrary to in re peterson.according to genetics,peterson holds that a broad range necessarily renders obvious a narrower range falling within that broader range.that is incorrect.in peterson,we stated that a prima facie case of obviousness typically exists when the ranges of a claimed composition overlap the ranges disclosed in the prior art.id.at emphasis added.the facts here do not present the typical case contemplated in peterson,however.
first,we noted in peterson that we do not have here any assertion that the disclosed range is so broad as to encompass a very large number of possible distinct compositions,and that our reasoning did not necessarily extend to a disclosed range of such breadth.id.at.in this case,in contrast,about protein variants are encompassed by the claims of the patent.genetics,d at.genetics fails to acknowledge this important distinction.
moreover,in peterson our holding was based on the recognition that t he normal desire of scientists or artisans to improve upon what is already generally known provides the motivation to determine where in a disclosed set of percentage ranges is the optimum combination of percentages.at.as noted above,however,the only evidence of motivation in the present record is that of researchers to make smaller,truncated proteins to solve the cloning difficulties associated with the large size of factor viii.that motivation would not have supplied researchers with a reason to make the group of proteins claimed in the patent encompassing larger truncated proteins than those claimed in the patent.simply put,the typical desire of scientists to find an optimum value within a narrow disclosed range,does not apply to the facts of this case.
the dissent also attempts to shoehorn the facts of this case into our holding in peterson.but the novartis inventors did not simply s elect a narrow range from within a somewhat broader range,as did the peterson inventors when selecting the range of about rhenium from the prior art range of rhenium.peterson,at.as noted,the patent contains truncated variants of a protein made up of amino acids,and the allegedly interfering inventions differ in terms of the size of the permitted amino acid deletions,the location of those deletions,and the degree of allowable amino acid substitutions.the facts here present a case where the disclosed range is so broad as to encompass a very large number of possible distinct compositions thus requir ing nonobvious invention,not a case,as in peterson,where prior art ranges that are not especially broad invite routine experimentation to discover optimum values.id.at.on this point the dissent appears to agree,conceding not only that the prior art patent claims a large breadth of possible protein variants,but also that there was no motivation to optimize for some value within the range disclosed by prior art.dissent op.at.viewed in context,our holding in peterson does not extend to the facts of this case.
we therefore hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the patent claims would not have been prima facie obvious over the patent claims.
we also reject genetics contention that the district court erred by crediting the unexpected results of the claimed invention in the patent as part of its obviousness analysis.genetics maintains that,because the importance of the region to vwf binding was not known as of the filing date of the patent,the retention of the region in the claimed proteins of the patent and their corresponding ability to bind vwf may not be relied upon to demonstrate the unexpected results of those proteins.we disagree.our case law is clear that the structure of a claimed compound and its properties are inseparable for purposes of.sanofi synthelabo apotex,for chemical compounds,the structure of the compound and its properties are inseparable considerations in the obviousness determination.in re papesch,ccpa from the standpoint of patent law,a compound and all of its properties are inseparable they are one and the same thing.
our law is equally clear that every property of a claimed compound need not be fully recognized as of the filing date of the patent application to be relevant to nonobviousness.knoll pharm.teva pharms.usa,there is no requirement that an invention properties and advantages were fully known before the patent application was filed,or that the patent application contains all of the work done in studying the invention,in order for that work to be introduced into evidence in response to litigation attack.for those reasons,we have held that evidence of unexpected results may be used to rebut a case of prima facie obviousness even if that evidence was obtained after the patent filing or issue date.id.evidence of unexpected results developed after the patent grant is not excluded from consideration,for understanding of the full range of an invention is not always achieved at the time of filing the patent application.in re khelghatian,ccpa holding the claimed invention nonobvious in view of evidence of an unexpected property not disclosed in the specification,while noting that the evidence wa s directed to that which would inherently flow from what was originally disclosed quoting in re zenitz,ccpa see also eli lilly zenith goldline,this court will not ignore a relevant property of a compound in the obviousness calculus.citing lalu,at.
the dissent,like genetics,misstates our precedent regarding secondary considerations of nonobviousness.dissent op.at.although the analysis remains properly focused at the time the invention was made,it would be error to prohibit a patent applicant or patentee from presenting relevant indicia of nonobviousness,whether or not this evidence was available or expressly contemplated at the filing of the patent application.see graham john deere,d.relevant secondary considerations often are not manifest even until well after the issuance of a patent.the dissent would require either an express prediction of unexpected properties in the patent specification or a showing of the inventors contemporaneous knowledge of such properties before the pto or any court could consider such probative evidence.our precedent contains no such requirement.see,in re chu,noting that evidence supporting nonobviousness need not be contained within the specification,and holding that the pto erred by failing to consider unexpected results even though the specification was virtually silent on the matter see also ksr,at the analysis is objective.even so,the dissent supposed requirement is an incorrect basis for rejecting the evidence in this case,where the patents expressly disclose the claimed proteins high stability and ability to bind vwf,patent ll,ll patent ll,ll,and where the parties do not dispute that the novartis inventors development of the claimed proteins used a technique that excluded any protein that did not bind vwf.
consequently,the district court did not err in its nonobviousness analysis by considering,as evidence of unexpected results,the ability of the claimed proteins to bind vwf,even if,as genetics contends,the role of the region was not appreciated as of the patent priority date.genetics,d at.
genetics alleges yet another error in the district court nonobviousness determination.genetics contends that novartis proffered unexpected results are not commensurate with the full scope of its claims because the novartis patents permit amino acid substitution that may reduce or eliminate vwf binding.again,we disagree.whether an invention has produced unexpected results is a question of fact,in re harris,and we do not perceive clear error in the district court decision to credit novartis evidence of vwf binding.the district court explicitly recognized that the claims of the novartis patents permit substitution,replacement of one amino acid with another in up to of the protein amino acids.genetics,d at.notwithstanding that finding,genetics points to an article published by leyte in demonstrating that the substitution of the amino acid phenylalanine for tyrosine at position in the region eliminated vwf binding but retained procoagulant activity in the resulting deleted protein.see anja leyte et,sulfation of tyr of human blood coagulation factor viii is essential for the interaction of factor viii with von willebrand factor,biological chem.based on this information,genetics asserts that the unexpected result of improved stability through vwf binding is not commensurate in scope with the claims of the patent,and therefore must be ignored.
the district court opinion did not explicitly address the leyte article.even taking genetics assertions as true,however,the leyte article demonstrates at most that one particular amino acid substitution at one particular position eliminates vwf binding in a claimed truncated protein of between and total amino acids.this solitary fact does not undermine the district court decision to credit the vwf binding properties of the proteins claimed in the novartis patents properties that genetics itself concedes are possessed by truncated factor viii proteins retaining the region.
while we have held that unexpected results must be commensurate in scope with the claims,we have not required absolute identity of scope rather,we have rejected unexpected results where the evidence was plainly disproportionate to the scope of the claim.see,peterson,at affirming obviousness where the applicant claimed an alloy with rhenium,yet presented unexpected results only for rhenium,and evidence suggested that rhenium possessed inferior properties in re grasselli,concluding that unexpected results limited to sodium only were not commensurate in scope with claims to a catalyst having an alkali metal in re greenfield,ccpa affirming the obviousness of a genus containing several hundred compounds,where unexpected results were proved for only one such compound in re glatt air techniques,stating that objective evidence of commercial success relating only to a single embodiment should be considered even if claim covers multiple embodiments.indeed,a rigid requirement of absolute identity that ignores relevant properties of claimed compounds would defy the mandate of requiring consideration of the claimed subject matter as a whole.on the facts of this case,it was not improper for the district court,in its nonobviousness analysis,to weigh novartis proffered evidence of unexpected results.
because on appeal genetics challenges only the district court conclusion of nonobviousness,we need not review the court determination that the patent claims would not,if prior art,anticipate the patent claims,genetics,d at.in view of our conclusion that the claims of the patent would not invalidate the claimed subject matter of the patent,we also need not consider whether the reverse is true.because the test was not met,we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that there was no interference in fact between claims,and of the patent and claims,and of the patent,respectively.
b.there is no interference in fact between the asserted claims of the patent and the patent 
genetics maintains that the district court erred by finding no interference in fact between the allegedly interfering claims of the and patents.genetics argues in general that the court committed the same errors as with the allegedly interfering claims of the and patents.as explained above,we reject those arguments.
regarding claim of the patent and claim of the patent,genetics additionally asserts that it would have been obvious to use the method of claim to make the composition of claim,because there is no patentable distinction between a method of making a protein and the protein itself.we need not address this argument,however,because it is premised on genetics flawed assertion the basis for which we rejected above that the court erred by finding a patentable distinction between the proteins of claim of the patent and those of claim of the patent.genetics does not contend on appeal that claim of the patent would anticipate claim of the patent.accordingly,at least the first leg of the test fails for the alleged interference in fact between claim of the patent and claim of the patent.genetics,d at.
regarding claim of the patent and claim of the patent,genetics contends that the district court erred because each claim,as prior art,would render the other obvious.we disagree.taking claim of the patent as prior art to claim of the patent,genetics again asserts that it would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the protein of claim of the patent to make the three proteins of claim of the patent.br.of at.as an initial matter,genetics,which describes the necessary modifications as smaller deletions,misconstrues the scope of claim.as the district court correctly determined,whereas claim of the patent deletes the complete b domain amino acids,claim of the patent claims three specific proteins,two of which have smaller deletions and amino acids and one of which has a larger deletion amino acids than the b domain.genetics,d at.the larger deletion ranges from amino acid to,which includes part of the acidic region.
as the district court noted,genetics failed to present evidence showing why one of ordinary skill would modify the protein of claim of the patent to make the three different proteins of claim of the patent.id.at.genetics alleges that obviousness of a chemical compound does not require evidence of some reason for modification.as we explained above,however,this reflects a misunderstanding of the law.moreover,genetics position is belied by the testimony of debra pittman,a genetics scientist who worked with toole on factor viii proteins.as explained by pittman,a researcher intent on designing a new truncated factor viii protein would first identify the amino acid regions he or she wished to delete,and only then would consider particular protein design strategies 
q.what steps were involved in going about making the deletion variants of factor viii that toole had in mind 
well,first,was to identify the regions that he wanted to delete,and then devising a scheme to make those deletions,using either restriction sites or oligonucleotides.
emphases added.common sense dictates that want ing to delete a particular amino acid region implies that a reason must exist for that deletion.pittman testimony thus corroborates what our case law requires for proving that a claimed compound would have been obvious the identification of some reason why one of ordinary skill would make the necessary chemical modifications to arrive at the claimed compound.takeda,at dillon,at.
we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that claim of the patent would not have rendered obvious claim of the patent.moreover,genetics does not contend that claim would have anticipated claim.because one leg of the test fails,we need not consider the second leg.medichem,at.
accordingly,we agree with the district court determinations that there is no interference in fact between claims and of the patent and claim of the patent.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court order granting novartis motion to dismiss due to the absence of an interference in fact between the allegedly interfering claims.in particular,we conclude that the expiration of the patent following the district court entry of final judgment did not divest our court of appellate jurisdiction that the patent term extension of the patent applied to all of the allegedly interfering claims and that there is no interference in fact between claim of the patent and claim of the patent,claim of the patent and claim of the patent,claim of the patent and claim of the patent,and claims and of the patent and claim of the patent.
i join parts i and ii of the majority opinion,but i respectfully dissent from part iii.in my view,the majority erred in holding that the asserted claims of the patent would not render obvious the asserted claims of the and patents collectively the novartis patents and in holding that there was,accordingly,no.
in the mid,the patent and the novartis patents were before the patent and trademark office pto.at the time,there was concern that pathogens,like the hiv and hepatitis virus,were contaminating the supply of hemophilia treatments made from human factor viii proteins.genetics and novartis thus competed to clone safer,synthetic forms of factor viii.because of the large size of factor viii,however,yields from the host cells expressing the gene were very low.the were directed to solving this problem by producing truncated forms of factor viii that would nonetheless maintain the same procoagulant i.activity of the protein.
by comparing human factor viii to porcine factor viii,genetics discovered that,while significant regions of human and porcine factor viii were homologous,the large b domain of human factor viii diverged greatly from the b domain of porcine factor viii.because porcine factor viii was nonetheless effective in treating human hemophilia patients,genetics deduced that the b domain was superfluous and could be excised without compromising factor viii procoagulant activity.this discovery led to the innovations of the patent.the truncated factor viii proteins of the patent have a substantially lower molecular weight,patent ll,but have similar procoagulant activity to the version of human factor viii,id.ll.these simpler molecules were advantageous because they could be produced at a much lower cost.id.ll.around the same time,novartis scientists were researching a more efficient way to clone factor viii.the objective of the novartis patents was,similarly,to design a truncated protein with activity equal to that of cloned factor viii.patent ll patent ll.
all of the are directed to truncated factor viii proteins in which the b domain is either partially or completely deleted.these proteins differ mainly in one respect while the novartis proteins retain the region,the proteins of the patent permit but do not require deletions in that region.as it turned out,years later,independent researchers discovered that the region had the previously unforeseen benefit of being able to bind to von willebrand factor vwf.though it had been known since the late that vwf had a stabilizing effect on factor viii,the location of vwf binding in the region was not known until at least,years after the novartis patents were filed,as the novartis witnesses themselves described.one novartis expert admitted that there was nothing in the scientific literature by april suggesting the importance of the region to interactions between factor viii and vwf.and one of the inventors testified that the novartis patents do not specifically tell you the location of the vwf binding sites within the factor viii protein,because that was not the intention of the patent,to specify the binding to von willebrand factor.the majority does not dispute this,stating that genetics concedes that it was not known prior to the filing of the patent that the region was critical to maintain vwf binding.op.at.
in my view,there are four fundamental flaws with the majority conclusion of.first,the majority holds that the novartis patents could not be obvious over the patent unless genetics could identify some reason that would have prompted a researcher to modify the patent to retain the region.id.at.however,a requirement for a motivation to retain the region should not be the test where,from an objective standpoint,no inventor including the novartis inventors themselves could have been aware of the benefits of retaining the region at the time of the invention.rather,we should look to whether there was enough structural similarity between the to make a prima facie case of obviousness,given what was known to the inventors at the time of the invention.
our precedent has established that s tructural relationships may provide the requisite motivation or suggestion to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds.in re deuel.moreover,such structural similarity,an established structural relationship between a prior art compound and the claimed compound can give rise to a case of prima facie obviousness.id.thus,a known compound may suggest its homologs,analogs,or isomers because such compounds often have similar properties and therefore chemists of ordinary skill would ordinarily contemplate making them to try to obtain compounds with improved properties.id.in in re jones,we acknowledged that particular types or categories of structural similarity,without more,have,in past cases,given rise to prima facie obviousness.citing in re dillon,and,cert.denied,d in re may,ccpa stereoisomers in re wilder,ccpa adjacent homologs and structural isomers in re hoch,ccpa acid and ethyl ester in this case,the truncated factor viii proteins of the patent and the truncated factor viii proteins of the novartis patents are not merely homologs,analogs,or isomers they are all variants of the exact same protein,exhibiting the exact same procoagulant functions.here,the majority found that the differed in terms of the size of the permitted amino acid deletions,the location of the deletions,and the degree of allowable amino acid substitutions.however,these differences are of no consequence to the core procoagulation function of the proteins.this is so because the main innovation of the is the discovery that the b domain is completely unnecessary to procoagulation.consequently,it does not matter whether the deletions are large or small or whether the deletions begin at one amino acid or another.any deletion in the b domain,ipso facto,would retain the procoagulation function of factor viii.the similarities in structure and function would provide the requisite motivation to modify the proteins of the patent to obtain the proteins of the novartis proteins.see in re dillon,t he fact that the claimed and the prior art compounds possessed the same activity were added factors in the establishment of a prima facie case.
second,under our prior authority,a prima facie case of obviousness can also exist if the range of an earlier patent incorporates the range of later patents that is the case here where it is clear that the range of retentions in the patent fall within the range of retentions of the novartis patents,as discussed above.our case law has held that a prima facie case of obviousness typically exists when the ranges of a claimed composition overlap the ranges disclosed in the prior art.in re peterson.e ven a slight overlap in range establishes a prima facie case of obviousness.id.at see also in re geisler,finding prima facie obviousness where range of prior art reference angstroms overlapped the claimed range angstroms in re woodruff,ccpa holding a claimed invention obvious because claimed range more than to about carbon monoxide abutted range of prior art about carbon monoxide in re malagari,ccpa finding prima facie obviousness where the claimed range of the prior art reference carbon overlapped the claimed range carbon.significantly,when the claimed ranges are completely encompassed by the prior art,the conclusion of obviousness is even more compelling than in cases of mere overlap.peterson,at here,as in peterson,the range of retentions or deletions in the novartis patents overlap significantly with the range of the patent,and are,in my view,prima facie obvious.
the majority,nevertheless,concludes that the compound here was not the typical case contemplated in peterson,op.at quoting at,pointing to a footnote in peterson that opined 
although ranges that are not especially broad invite routine experimentation to discover optimum values,rather than require nonobvious invention,we do not have here any assertion that the disclosed range is so broad as to encompass a very large number of possible distinct compositions.we thus do not need to decide whether a disclosed range of such breadth might present a situation analogous to our cases involving the failure of a very broad disclosed genus of substances to render prima facie obvious specific substances within its scope.
at emphases added.because the majority found that the patent claims encompassed a very large number of possible distinct compositions nearly truncated variants it declined to extend the reasoning in peterson to a disclosed range of such breadth.op.at.
however,as the court in peterson made clear,it is the facts of a particular case that will render it typical or not.at.an expansive range of variants should not per se defeat a prima facie case of obviousness.moreover,the court concern in peterson was less the breadth of the claims,than the ability to conduct routine experimentation to discover optimum values.id.at.narrower ranges would presumably invite more routine experimentation and motivate scientists to determine where in a disclosed set of ranges is the optimum combination,see id.at,while broader ranges would presumably discourage such experimentation.here,there is no suggestion or stated need for further experimentation to discover some optimum range.as the majority acknowledges,the typical desire of scientists to find an optimum value within a narrow disclosed range,does not apply to the facts of this case because the only evidence of motivation in the present record is that of researchers trying to make smaller,truncated proteins to solve the cloning difficulties associated with the large size of factor viii.op.at emphasis added internal citations omitted.because there was no motivation to optimize for some value within the range of possible retentions,the large breadth of possible protein variants is of no consequence.in sum,i would find that the claims of the novartis patents are prima facie obvious in view of the overlapping ranges of the patent.the burden of proving nonobviousness should thus have shifted to the holder of the patent,in this case,novartis.peterson,at.
third,the majority appears to suggest that the ret ention of amino acids in the region was contrary to the teachings of the patent.op.at.this is wrong on the facts.the majority ignores that some variants of the patent actually retain the region and therefore have the ability to bind to vwf.for instance,claim of the patent claims a truncated factor viii protein having one of three specific deletions,two of which are the deletions of amino acids and.see ll.these two deletions clearly retain the region amino acids.retention of the region is also within the scope of retentions allowed by claim of the patent therefore,many of the variants claimed in the patent actually conserve the region necessary for vwf binding.if,as the majority concludes,the structure of a claimed compound and its properties are inseparable for purposes of,it seems inconsistent to credit the region in the novartis compounds for giving rise to vwf binding while not doing the same for the compounds of the patent.op.at citing sanofi synthelabo apotex,for chemical compounds,the structure of the compound and its properties are inseparable considerations in the obviousness determination.in re papesch,ccpa from the standpoint of patent law,a compound and all of its properties are inseparable they are one and the same thing.
the majority also urges that some variants of the patent teach away from retaining the region.the majority,however,ignores the fact that certain variants of the novartis patents also teach away from keeping the region intact,with the result that vwf binding is not achieved.in particular,the novartis patents allow up to percent of the amino acids in the factor viii protein to be substituted,including substitutions in the region 
u sually not more than,more usually not more than,preferably not more than about of the amino acids in the chains will differ from the amino acids naturally present in the factor viii c domain conservative substitutions include phe nylalanine tr yptophan tyr osine.
patent ll.with the substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine in the region that is,a conservative substitution expressly taught in the novartis patents vwf binding would be completely abolished.see anja leyte et,sulfation of tyr of human blood coagulation factor viii is essential for the interaction of factor viii with von willebrand factor,biological chem,available at vwf binding was completely abolished when tyr osine in the region was replaced by phenylalanine.in this respect,the patent and the novartis patents all teach some variants that retain the region and some variants that teach away from retaining the region necessary for vwf binding.
finally,the majority found that the,undisclosed benefits of retaining the region qualified as unexpected results to help defeat the prima facie case of obviousness,even though the role of the region was not appreciated as of the novartis patents priority date.i disagree.the majority finding of nonobviousness is based entirely on hindsight and happenstance,and not on what the inventors knew at the time the novartis patents were filed.see a stating that an invention can not be patented if the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made emphasis added.the supreme court has never suggested that it is permissible to look beyond the inventor knowledge at the time of patent filing in determining unexpected results.to the contrary,the supreme court has characterized such knowledge as an afterthought,ball socket fastener kraetzer,and has declined to give it weight in determining patent validity.for example,in graham john deere,d,the supreme court rejected the patentee argument that his patented plow had the unexpected result of additional flex over the prior art,noting that n o flexing argument was raised in the patent office.see also lincoln eng g stewart warner.if this new feature were so vital an element it is strange that all mention of it was omitted in the specification.
similarly,our court and our predecessor court have rejected knowledge as supporting unexpected results.early cases from the court of customs and patent appeals ccpa have gone so far as to hold that unexpected results must be described in the specification itself contrary to the majority suggestion,op.at,i do not propose such a stringent requirement.but i do think that unexpected properties must either be set forth in the specification or contemporaneously known to the inventors,rather than being discovered long after the fact.
in more recent ccpa cases,the court has suggested that a new,undisclosed feature must inherently flow from the indicated use of the invention.in re zenitz,ccpa emphasis added see also in re khelghatian,ccpa allowing an unexpected result to overcome an obviousness rejection where
