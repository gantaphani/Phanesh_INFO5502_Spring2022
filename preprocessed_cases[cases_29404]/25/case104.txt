innomed labs,llc innomed appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,following a jury trial.innomed and alza corporation alza entered into a distribution and supply agreement the distribution agreement that gave innomed the right to distribute alza patented pharmaceutical products,in return for,royalty,and supply payments.innomed alleges that alza committed price discrimination,in violation of the act,a,by charging innomed prices that were higher than those alza charged the other distributor of alza product.innomed also claims that alza termination of the distribution agreement in march constituted a breach of the agreement cure provisions,and that the termination tortiously interfered with innomed attempt to assign its rights under the agreement to another distributor.the district court dismissed the bulk of innomed breach of contract claims and its claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage on summary judgment.following a trial,the jury found against innomed on its act claim.
on appeal,innomed contends that two aspects of the district court jury instructions regarding innomed act claim were erroneous,necessitating a new trial.innomed argues that the court erred in instructing the jury that the act would not apply to the distribution agreement if the jury found that the agreement primarily concerned the right to distribute a patented product,and that the court defined the antitrust injury necessary to establish entitlement to treble damages too narrowly.innomed also challenges the district court summary judgment dismissal of its claims for breach of contract and tortious interference,arguing that disputed issues of material fact warrant a trial on these claims.we dispose of innomed arguments with respect to the summary judgment decision,and its challenges to a number of the district court discovery and evidentiary rulings,in a summary order issued in conjunction with this opinion,and address only innomed challenges to the jury instructions here.
we hold that the court erred in charging the jury that the act would not apply to the distribution agreement if the jury determined that the agreement was primarily a contract for the right to distribute a patented product,but this error was not fundamental and does not warrant a new trial and the court instruction on the antitrust injury necessary to establish innomed entitlement to treble damages was harmless error.
background 
alza entered into the distribution agreement with innomed parent company,hogil pharmaceutical corporation,in.hogil immediately assigned its rights under the distribution agreement to innomed,an entity hogil created to perform the contract.under the terms of the distribution agreement,innomed was to be a distributor of three types of pills containing alza patented pharmaceutical technology,which innomed would distribute as a cold medicine under one of hogil trademarks.alza,for its part,would manufacture the pills and supply them to innomed for distribution.
the distribution agreement obligated innomed to make three types of payments to alza.innomed was to make an payment of million,and two milestone payments of million each after alza first two deliveries of pills innomed was also to purchase certain minimum quantities of the pills from alza each quarter,at a supply price of between and per pill for each product.finally,at the end of each quarter,innomed was to pay to alza royalties totaling of innomed aggregate net sales for the first million of net sales,and of aggregate sales exceeding million.
innomed subsequently defaulted on several of its scheduled payments,failing to make one of the milestone payments and to pay the supply price for roughly worth of pills that it ordered and received.in march,the parties modified the distribution agreement to allow innomed to cure its default by making monthly payments of,as well as quarterly royalty payments totaling of its net sales.despite these modifications,innomed again defaulted,making only in monthly payments and failing to pay royalties.
on november,after repeatedly demanding payment,alza notified innomed of its intent to terminate the distribution agreement.alza invoked c of the distribution agreement,which gave either party the right to terminate the distribution agreement on days prior written notice to the other party,if such other party is in material breach of this agreement,and such breach is not cured within days after the date after such notice.alza notification of its intent to terminate the contract triggered the cure period,giving innomed until january,to cure its default.
section c also provided that if the breach was of a nature such that it can not be cured within days despite diligent efforts,then such day period shall be extended for a longer period as is reasonably necessary to cure such breach using diligent efforts.rather than negotiating its entitlement to this provision or making the payments necessary to cure its default,however,innomed served alza with a complaint and moved for a preliminary injunction on january,five days before the end of the cure period.on january,the parties entered into the first of what would later be termed standstill agreements.memorialized in a letter from innomed counsel to alza counsel,the standstill agreement provided that alza will not be terminating the agreement on january,as was stated in alza earlier correspondence on this issue.instead,alza has agreed that it will not terminate the contract before february.both parties also agreed that they would not institute legal proceedings before february.
on january,innomed and alza orally agreed on a means by which innomed could cure its default.although this agreement the january agreement was never memorialized in writing,it is undisputed that innomed principal,howard wendy,represented to alza that he had a deal with american home products ahp,in which innomed would assign its rights under the distribution agreement to ahp,in return for million and a royalty on gross sales.alza agreed that innomed could cure its default by sharing the proceeds from the assignment with alza,but only if innomed was able to finalize the assignment agreement quickly.
although wendy represented to alza on january that the ahp assignment agreement was effectively final,contingent only upon ahp satisfactory conclusion of due diligence,the actual status of the assignment agreement was sharply disputed before the district court.wendy testified that as of january,he believed that the ahp agreement was binding and final in all material respects.in contrast,ahp vice president,gregory bobyock,testified that as of january,ahp had not reached agreement with innomed on any of the principal terms of the assignment.ahp had yet to perform the market research that would determine how much it was willing to pay innomed in return for the assignment,and the parties therefore had not yet agreed on a price term.consequently,ahp did not consider itself contractually bound in any way.
shortly after the standstill agreement expired on february,the parties executed another standstill agreement,which was to expire on march.meanwhile,on february,innomed,alza,and ahp entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate ahp ability to conduct due diligence with respect to alza.in the beginning of march,however,alza advised innomed that it had not yet been contacted by ahp regarding the due diligence,and demanded a more thorough explanation of what due diligence ahp has undertaken,as well as an update on the status of innomed discussions with ahp.although innomed response to this request is not memorialized,ahp soon thereafter scheduled a due diligence visit to alza for april.
alza and innomed subsequently extended the standstill agreement to march.on march,alza was acquired by johnson johnson j j,a competitor of ahp in the drug market.two days later,on march,alza notified innomed that it would not extend the standstill agreement further,and that the distribution agreement was terminated,effective march.innomed filed this lawsuit shortly thereafter.
innomed initial complaint alleged that alza had breached the termination and cure provisions of the distribution agreement by terminating the contract on march alza had breached the january agreement by terminating the distribution agreement before innomed had sufficient time to finalize the assignment of the distribution agreement to ahp and alza had tortiously interfered with innomed prospective business relations with ahp by terminating the distribution agreement and leaving innomed with nothing to assign to ahp.alza,in turn,asserted a breach of contract counterclaim against innomed,seeking damages in the amount of innomed default under the distribution agreement.in may,innomed sought and obtained leave to amend its complaint to include a claim for price discrimination in violation of the act,a.innomed alleged that although alza agreement with,the other distributor of alza cold products,involved one of the same products as the agreement and was comparable to the distribution agreement in structure,it contained significantly more favorable price terms than the agreement.innomed also amended its complaint to allege that,inter alia,alza had breached the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing in the distribution agreement and the january agreement,and had fraudulently induced innomed execution of the distribution agreement.
in november,the district court dismissed the majority of innomed breach of contract claims in response to alza motion for summary judgment.shortly thereafter,the remainder of innomed claims and alza counterclaims were tried before a jury.before submitting the case to the jury,the court granted a directed verdict in favor of alza on innomed claim for tortious interference,for reasons not clearly stated on the record.the jury found against innomed on its act claim and its fraudulent inducement claim.it also found that innomed had breached the distribution agreement,and that it was liable to alza for approximately million.
innomed now appeals.
discussion 
on appeal,innomed challenges two of the court jury instructions with respect to its act claim.specifically,innomed contends that the district court erroneously instructed the jury that if the dominant purpose of the distribution agreement was to grant innomed the right to distribute alza patented products,the contract would not be covered by the act and if alza was found to have violated the act,innomed could recover only for injuries resulting from contract payments it had actually made to alza.although we find that both challenged jury instructions were erroneous,we hold that neither error warrants a new trial.
when a challenge to a jury instruction has been preserved for appeal by a timely objection at trial,we review the instruction de novo.see lnc,first fid.bank,cir.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.anderson branen,cir.where,however,a party has forfeited a challenge to an instruction by failing to object at trial,we review the instruction only for fundamental error.see shade hous.auth.of new haven,cir.an error is fundamental if,in addition to contravening an established rule of law,see united states parcel of property,cir,it is so serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.shade,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.we may grant a new trial for fundamental error only if the charge deprived the jury of adequate legal guidance to reach a rational decision,werbungs und commerz union austalt collectors guild,cir,or completely misled the jury as to the governing law,see jin metro.life ins,cir.
i.the dominant nature instruction 
the act prohibits price discrimination that may have the effect of hindering competition in the marketplace,or inflicting economic or competitive injury on specific market actors.the act provides that i t shall be unlawful for any person either directly or indirectly,to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities where such commodities are sold for use,consumption,or resale within the united states,and where the effect of the discrimination is.a.innomed alleged that alza entered into similar distribution agreements with both innomed and,and that although the two agreements concerned a common alza product,the agreement contained significantly lower supply prices,as well as lower milestone and royalty payments,than the innomed agreement.
the act prohibition on price discrimination extends only to transactions involving commodities.id.courts have strictly construed this term,holding that it denotes only tangible products of trade.may dep t store graphic process,cir citing baum investors diversified,cir see also ambook enters.time,cir referencing the strict view of the meaning of the term commodities taken by other circuits,and holding that sale of retail newspaper advertising was not a transaction involving commodities.when the subject of a contract is a combination of both tangible goods and intangible rights or services,the contract is covered by the act if its dominant nature or purpose is the sale of tangible products rather than the transfer of intangible rights or services.see broad,united press int l,cir applying dominant nature test to transfer of broadcasting rights,where information to be broadcast was to be transferred in the form of written reports see also ambook,at citing cases that employ the dominant nature test.
because the distribution agreement provided not only that innomed would buy certain quantities of alza pills,but also that innomed would gain the right to distribute the pills on a basis,alza argued below that the dominant nature of the distribution agreement involved the sale of intangible rights,rather than commodities.specifically,alza argued that the milestone and royalty payments for which innomed was responsible represented payments for the right to distribute products using alza patented technology.alza correctly refrained from arguing,however,that the fact that the pills contained patented technology meant that they were not commodities within the meaning of the act.see,george haug,rolls royce motor cars,cir applying act to contracts for the sale of car parts.thus,the thrust of alza argument was that the right to distribute was itself an intangible that could change the dominant nature of the contract,and that the right to distribute constituted a more significant aspect of the contract because the pills contained patented technology.
the district court submitted the issue of the dominant nature of the distribution agreement to the jury,instructing it as follows 
to determine whether the transaction involved the sale of commodities,you must look to the dominant nature of the transaction.if the dominant nature of the transaction involved the sale of commodities or physical goods,the act applies.
if you find the dominant nature of the transaction was the sale of physical goods or commodities,you must find that innomed has proven this element of its price discrimination claim.if you find the dominant nature of the transaction was the sale of intangible items,such as services or the right to distribute a patented product,then you must find for the defendant and against innomed on the claim.again,the dominant nature of the transaction,that is,what the transaction was primarily directed towards,is pivotal with respect to this element.trial tr.at emphasis added.
innomed now challenges this instruction,arguing that the italicized language effectively eviscerated the act protections both with respect to distribution contracts that give a purchaser the exclusive right to redistribute the purchased product,and with respect to distribution contracts involving products that happen to be patented.thus,innomed contends,the district court should not have suggested that the inclusion of the right to distribute in the contract,as well as the patents appended to the pills,could alter the dominant nature of the transaction.
alza defends the instruction by arguing that contracts primarily concerned with the right to distribute a product whether patented or not are properly excluded from the coverage of the act.moreover,alza argues that even if the inclusion of the distribution right itself is not sufficient to render the contract predominantly intangible in nature,the inclusion of the right to distribute a patented product certainly renders the transaction predominantly concerned with the intangible right to exploit the product and its appended intellectual property.thus,alza argues that the district court was entirely correct to treat the applicability of the act as an issue of fact,and the jury was entitled to find that the distribution agreement was intangible in nature if it concluded that the grant to innomed of the right to distribute,and the existence of the patents,predominated over the tangible elements of the transaction.
alza also contends that innomed failed to object to the court charge before it was given,and has therefore not preserved this issue for appellate review.because we may review the charge for error even if innomed did not object at trial,we first consider whether the charge was erroneous,and then determine whether such error was serious enough to warrant a new trial under the appropriate standard of review.see jin,at stating that,in reviewing a challenge to a jury charge,the court first determines whether the charge was erroneous,and then considers whether the error must be reviewed under the fundamental error standard because the objection was forfeited below.
the district court charge suggested that if the primary object of the distribution agreement was to grant to innomed the right to distribute a patented product,then intangible rights rather than commodities would be the dominant element of the contract.the instruction thus contained two intertwined implications.first,the instruction suggested that,in a general sense,the exclusive right to or distribute a tangible commodity whether or not patented is an intangible right that can itself predominate over the portions of a contract devoted to the sale of the tangible commodity.second,the instruction suggested that the fact that the pills at issue had patented elements could render the exclusive right to distribute them predominant in the contract.in other words,innomed contract payments may have included the right to exploit the intellectual property appended to the tangible product,and this right could affect the nature of the transaction as a whole.we find that both assertions are incorrect.more fundamentally,an analysis of the charge language and its errors leads to the conclusion that the district court was wrong to instruct the jury that the dominant nature test applies to contracts that include only the right to distribute a patented product on an exclusive basis.because the exclusive right to distribute a patented product can not create an issue of fact as to whether the contract is covered by the act,the court should not have submitted the issue of the act coverage to the jury.
the district court instruction reflects the assumption that when a contract not only transfers a tangible product,but also gives the purchaser the exclusive right to distribute that product,the inclusion of the exclusive right to distribute alters the nature of the contract.thus,the exclusive right to distribute may predominate over the sale of the product itself,such that it becomes necessary to apply the dominant nature test to determine whether the act applies.an examination of the evolution of the dominant nature test,however,as well as the contracts to which courts have applied the act and the context in which the act was passed,indicates that contracts involving both the transfer of a product and the right to distribute that product are,as a matter of law,properly considered commodities contracts.
the dominant nature test was developed in the context of contracts in which tangible and intangible elements were inseparable because they were fus ed together.first comics,world color press,cir quoting frederick rowe,price discrimination under the act.in these transactions,either the sale of a product simply facilitates the transfer of an intangible right,or the purchaser receives a finished product that combines the input of both goods and services by the seller.thus,where a broadcaster purchases the right to broadcast copyrighted information,and the information is transmitted to the broadcaster in the form of tangible written news reports,the factfinder must determine whether the written reports constitute the dominant element of the contract or whether the reports are simply the tangible incidents of an intangible intellectual property right.see,at see also freeman chicago title trust,cir finding that transfer of title insurance was not commodities contract,despite use of paper to memorialize insurance rights.similarly,where a purchaser supplies a seller with artwork and the seller transforms the artwork into another medium through a process that involves the input of both additional tangible goods and labor,the contract dominant nature is an issue of fact.see may dep t store,at first comics,concluding that comic book publishing transaction predominantly involved services rather than goods,and questioning whether dominant nature should always be decided as a matter of law.
in these transactions,the tangible and the intangible elements are fused because they do not form independent or separate elements of the product that the purchaser buys,or because the two elements can not be separated within the contract itself.thus,the parties would not have entered into a contract for raw materials without also contracting for the services involved in making the product,or for the intangible information without providing for its physical embodiment or transfer.see shale prods.struck constr,cir noting that seller would not have sold brick to buyer unless the materials were woven into the larger construction contract.it would therefore make little sense to attempt to parse a contact price for a finished product into separate charges when the parties themselves have agreed that the tangible and intangible elements are but two aspects of the product that is the object of the contract.see id.refusing to separate sale of bricks from the rest of the construction contract aviation specialties,united techs,cir stating that sale of parts was woven into the repair agreement,which also included labor.the question then becomes whether the tangible or intangible element is the true focus of the bargain for which the parties have contracted.see,at holding that united press written news reports,provided as a supplement to its broadcast,were incidental to the contract purpose of allowing the right to its news information.the dominant nature test is simply the means by which to determine whether the tangible element is incidental to the intangible object of the contract,or vice versa.
in a contract selling a commodity with the appended right to distribute the commodity exclusively,however,the tangible product and the intangible element are not fused together.it is clear that the purchaser has contracted for two separate items the commodity itself and the exclusive right to distribute that commodity.the question is not what the true nature of the item or right is,but whether the inclusion of the distribution right renders the act inapplicable,despite the fact that the contract involves the transfer of a commodity.because the tangible and intangible elements of the contract are not intertwined,the dominant nature test,with its emphasis on the buyer intent in contracting and the actual nature of the object contracted for,has no application in the context of commodity distribution contracts.metro communications ameritech mobile communications,cir stating that the dominant nature test is applicable only when the purchased goods and services are not separable.accordingly,no case has ever applied the dominant nature test to a transaction involving the sale of a commodity and the exclusive right to distribute that commodity.see,stelwagon tarmac roofing,cir assuming that an exclusive distribution contract for roofing materials was covered by the act.
the inclusion of the exclusive right to distribute in a commodities contract does not remove the contract from the ambit of the act.the object of the contract is to transfer the commodity from the manufacturer to a company that is capable of distributing the product on a wider scale.while some manufacturers and distributors may deem it advantageous to enter into exclusive or distribution contracts,that fact does not render these contracts materially different from contracts between manufacturers and distributors,which are unquestionably covered by the act.see a prohibiting discrimination in price between different purchasers of commodities for resale.moreover,the right to distribute is a right that concerns the commodity and the purchaser exploitation of the commodity itself the grant of the right does not diminish the fact that the parties have bargained for the transfer of the commodity.although some portion of the contract payments presumably represents the value of the right to distribute on an exclusive or basis,this element of the contract does not change the basic object of the contract,because the distribution right would be meaningless without the transfer of the commodity itself 
indeed,other circuits have assumed that contracts involving the grant of an exclusive distribution right,in addition to the transfer of the commodity,are covered by the act.thus,in city of kirkwood union,cir,the court noted that the city had a distribution contract with an electricity producer,see id.at,and then considered whether electricity was a commodity within the meaning of the act,see id.at.after concluding that electricity was a commodity,the court remanded for consideration of whether the city had established a prima facie case of price discrimination under the act.id.at.the fact that the city presumably paid the defendant not only for the electricity itself,but also for the distribution right,did not alter the court analysis.see also,vanco beverages,falls city,cir affirming jury verdict on exclusive distributor act claim after reviewing the application of the act to the conduct at issue,aff in relevant part,d hartley parker,florida beverage,cir holding that distributor had stated act claim against manufacturer and other distributor.the assumption that the act applies to exclusive distribution contracts reflects the fact that the existence of the exclusive distribution right does not affect the nature of the commodity transferred and can not render the subject of the contract predominantly intangible.
this view of exclusive distribution contracts is supported by the act historical context and congress intent in passing the act.the act was drafted amid fears that the rise of integrated chain stores would overpower the traditional distribution model and its reliance on wholesale distributors and retailers to move products from manufacturers to consumers.rowe.chain stores combined the distributive functions of wholesalers with the local sales of retailers,and were able to move large volumes of commodities by relying on their own independent distribution apparatuses.they often obtained lower prices from manufacturers than did wholesale distributors,enabling them to undersell their more traditional competitors by passing on their savings to consumers.id.at.the act was therefore intended to prevent chain stores from obtaining purchasing advantages from producers and to ensure that chain stores competitive advantages arose purely from the economies inherent in integration.id.at.accordingly,the act senate report stated that the purpose of the legislation was to preserv e equal opportunity to all usefully employed in the service of distribution comportably with their ability to serve the consuming public,at,reprinted in the legislative history of the federal antitrust laws and related statutes part i the antitrust laws,at earl kintner,the antitrust laws see also,pt,at,reprinted in the antitrust laws,at see also standard motor,ftc,cir discussing history and intent of act.
the act was therefore intended to apply to all commodities distribution contracts,in all positions in the distribution chain.there is no evidence that congress intended that some distribution contracts would be exempted from the act simply because the purchaser bought not only the commodity but also the right to distribute it on an exclusive or basis.applying the dominant nature test to distribution contracts merely because they include the right to distribute exclusively would render the act coverage dependent on the manner in which the parties have structured their contractual relationship,and on the market forces that determine whether an exclusive distributorship is suitable and the value of the distribution right in relation to the commodity price.such an arbitrary result would contravene the act purpose of creating even competition throughout the market,at all levels of the distribution chain.a commodities contract transfer of the exclusive right to distribute does not create an issue as to whether the contract is a commodities contract within the meaning of the act.
the existence of patented elements within the transferred product does not alter this conclusion.the district court instruction suggested that even if the grant of the exclusive right to distribute can not in itself exempt the contract from the act,the patent appended to the product creates an issue as to whether the right to distribute renders the sale of that product a transaction primarily for the intangible right to exploit the patent.a product that is patented,or that contains patented elements,remains a commodity for purposes of the act,however.under the first sale doctrine,the purchaser ability to exploit the product itself,including by or using that product,is not limited by the inclusion of patented technology within the product.see glass equip,besten,the first sale doctrine stands for the proposition that,absent unusual circumstances,courts infer that a patent owner has given up the right to exclude concerning a patented article that the owner sells.where the product transferred is patented,therefore,that fact alone does not require potential exclusive distributors to bargain for any additional rights than if the product were not patented.see jazz photo int l trade comm n,the fact that an article is patented gives the purchaser neither more nor less rights of use and disposition.at the same time,a purchaser that has obtained the physical product,absent more,has not also received the right to exploit the patent itself in any way.see id.thus,contracts that do not explicitly transfer any intangible patent rights to the buyer in addition to the product itself are commodities contracts because the patent does not change the nature of the product itself or of the transaction,and the exclusive right to distribute a patented product is no broader or narrower than the exclusive right to distribute an unpatented product,contracts that transfer the exclusive right to distribute a patented product,without more,are covered by the act as a matter of law.
the district court therefore erred in instructing the jury that if the dominant nature of the contract involved the right to distribute a patented product,the act would not apply.more fundamentally,the court also erred in instructing the jury that the dominant nature test applied to contracts in which the only intangible involved is the exclusive right to distribute the product,and in submitting the issue of whether the distribution agreement was covered by the act to the jury because it is undisputed that the pills that alza sold to innomed are commodities within the meaning of the act,and that alza retained all patent rights to the pills technology,the distribution agreement is a commodities contract as a matter of law.
alza argues,however,that innomed failed to object to the district court charge,and that the charge does not constitute the fundamental error necessary to grant a new trial despite the lack of a timely objection.we agree.innomed itself requested that the jury be instructed on the dominant nature test,and never argued to the district court that the distribution agreement involved commodities as a matter of law.m
