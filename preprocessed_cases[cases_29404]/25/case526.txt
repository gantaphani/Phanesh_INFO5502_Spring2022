this patent infringement suit involves pharmaceutical antibodies used to treat arthritis.the patent owners,centocor ortho biotech,and new york university collectively,centocor sued abbott laboratories,abbott bioresearch center,and abbott biotechnology collectively,abbott,alleging that abbott humira antibody infringes claims,and the asserted claims of patent patent.after a trial,the jury found abbott liable for willful infringement.the jury rejected abbott argument that the asserted claims were invalid,and awarded centocor over billion in damages.
abbott moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol on invalidity,noninfringement,damages,and willfulness.the district court granted abbott motion for jmol of no willful infringement but denied abbott other jmol motions.abbott appeals the district court denial of its jmol motions.because the asserted claims of the patent lack written description under,we need not reach abbott other invalidity arguments,its infringement arguments,or the question of damages.we reverse the district court denial of jmol on this ground and hold the asserted claims invalid for failure to meet the statutory written description requirement.
background 
the technology in this case involves antibodies to human tumor necrosis factor Î±.overproduction of can lead to various autoimmune conditions,including arthritis.although antibodies have the potential to reduce the harmful activity caused by excess,the human body does not typically make antibodies to human.as a result,pharmaceutical companies have been keenly interested in engineering antibodies that can neutralize human for use as a drug.
was identified long before centocor and abbott began developing therapeutic antibodies.in fact,by,many researchers had produced antibodies to human.these antibodies were typically produced in mice and were not suitable for use in human patients for several reasons.first,many of the antibodies did not have sufficient binding affinity for human.the antibodies must stick to human to work,their binding ability is important.a high affinity sticks better than an antibody that binds with low affinity.if an antibody affinity is too low,it will not be a viable drug.second,many of the known antibodies did not have the desired neutralizing activity.while such antibodies do bind to,they do not bind to a place on that reduces the harmful activity.since such antibodies do not reduce activity,they can not be used to produce the desired therapeutic effect.in other words,the activity of an antibody is related to both how tightly the antibody sticks as well as the specific location on where the antibody binds.third,human patients frequently have immunological reactions when they are treated with antibodies produced in mice or other species.this is because the human immune system recognizes foreign proteins and attacks them.by engineering foreign antibodies to look more human,scientists try to trick the human immune system and prevent this undesirable immune response.given these therapeutic limitations of the known antibodies,pharmaceutical companies sought to develop an antibody with high affinity,neutralizing activity,and reduced immunogenicity.
in developing their therapeutic antibodies,centocor and abbott pursued very different strategies.centocor path began by identifying a mouse antibody to human that had both high affinity and neutralizing activity the mouse antibody.while this antibody had two of the key properties,the mouse antibody was of limited therapeutic use because it would produce an undesirable immune response in humans.to tackle this immunogenicity problem,centocor decided to use known techniques to modify its mouse antibody to make it look more human.by keeping the parts of the mouse antibody that are responsible for the affinity and the neutralizing activity and changing the less critical portions of the antibody to make these portions more human,scientists sought to preserve the activity of the antibody while reducing its immunogenicity.
for purposes of discussion in this appeal,antibodies basically consist of two regions a constant region and a variable region.as centocor inventor explained to the jury,the variable regions are really what determines what the antibody is.the variable region is the portion responsible for sticking to.the variable region is also the portion of the antibody that determines where on the antibody will bind.making changes in the variable region can thus have a dramatic effect on the affinity and activity of the antibody.even a small change in the variable region can result in an antibody that does not bind to or fails to have neutralizing activity.centocor avoided the potential pitfalls associated with modifying the variable region by focusing on the constant region.by exchanging the mouse antibody mouse constant region with a known human constant region,centocor produced a chimeric antibody with a mouse variable region and a human constant region.see,chiron genentech,discussing antibody structure and chimeric antibodies.the resulting chimeric antibody was less immunogenic than the mouse antibody because it contained significantly less mouse protein.at the same time,centocor chimeric antibody possessed similar binding and activity to the mouse antibody because they both had the same variable region.because the chimeric antibody contained a mouse variable region,it was not considered to be fully human.a chimeric antibody still contains foreign protein,so it is more likely to elicit an immune response than a antibody.
centocor filed a patent application disclosing both its mouse antibody and the chimeric antibody in.the application discussed the immunogenicity problem and the difficulties associated with making a antibody to a human protein like.the application presented chimeric antibodies as the solution to these problems.the application included eighteen examples detailing methods for making a mouse antibody with high affinity and neutralizing activity and making a corresponding chimeric antibody based on the mouse antibody.the application included claims to centocor mouse antibody and chimeric antibodies.
centocor subsequently filed a series of cip applications.in,the patent and trademark office pto rejected certain pending claims in a cip application because they encompassed antibodies with less than an entire mouse variable region.the pto asserted that the specification only enabled antibodies with variable regions.instead of responding to the rejections,centocor filed a new cip application and abandoned the pending application.in due course,the pto issued the same rejection.again,instead of responding,centocor abandoned its application and filed three substantially identical cip applications in.these cip applications added new matter that centocor now relies on as evidence of written description to support the asserted claims.although centocor made these few additions,it did not present claims to human variable regions when it filed the cip applications.
while centocor focused its efforts on making a chimeric antibody,abbott pursued an alternative path and sought to engineer a antibody.as discussed above,there is a progression from making a mouse antibody to obtaining the corresponding chimeric antibody.this is because the two antibodies contain the same variable region.in contrast,no corresponding progression exists with respect to making a antibody.comparing the process of constructing a chimeric antibody from a mouse antibody with the process of making a human antibody.one of skill in the art can not look at a mouse variable region and know how to turn it into a human variable region with the same affinity and activity as the mouse antibody 
abbott decided to work with collaborators to construct a antibody from scratch.first,abbott collaborators created an enormous phage display library containing a spectrum of human variable regions.they searched this library for variable regions that bind to human.in the process,they developed a technique known as guided selection to help identify variable regions from the library that bind in a specific place so the variable regions have neutralizing activity.after identifying human variable regions that bind to human,they used various techniques including chain shuffling and affinity maturation to improve the binding affinity of the variable regions.these human variable regions were combined with known human constant regions to create antibodies.by,abbott had created the therapeutic antibody humira.abbott filed a patent application disclosing this high affinity,neutralizing,antibody to human in.see patent.the pto granted the patent in,and abbott obtained regulatory approval to market humira in.
after the grant of abbott patent and after regulatory approval of humira,centocor filed its claims to antibodies.because the patent family disclosing centocor own chimeric antibody was still pending in,centocor filed the claims as part of a thirteenth application in the family,explicitly claiming human variable regions and antibodies.asserted claim and the claim from which it depends are illustrative

centocor application,which contained a priority claim to its earlier applications,issued as the patent in.shortly thereafter,it filed this action against abbott,alleging that abbott humira antibody infringes the asserted claims of the patent.at trial,abbott argued that the asserted claims were invalid.the jury rejected abbott arguments and found willful infringement of the asserted claims.the jury also found that the asserted claims were not invalid for anticipation,lack of enablement,or lack of written description.abbott moved for jmol on the issues of infringement,willfulness,and validity.the district court granted abbott jmol motion regarding willfulness and denied the other motions.abbott now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

the pivotal issue in this case concerns whether the patent provides adequate written description for the claimed human variable regions.as noted above,centocor first sought claims to human variable regions and antibodies in.at that time,abbott had already discovered and patented a antibody to that had high affinity and neutralizing activity.to ensnare abbott with claims,centocor must use a priority date from an earlier application.because abbott application was filed in,centocor relies on a priority claim to the cip applications.thus,in order for centocor to prevail,the asserted claims must be supported by adequate written description in the cip applications.
the asserted claims cover antibodies that possess the same therapeutic properties as centocor chimeric antibody,high affinity,neutralizing activity,and binding at a specific place on human.accordingly,the cip applications must provide written description for an antibody to human with a human constant region,a human variable region,high affinity for human,neutralizing activity,and the ability to bind to in the same place as centocor mouse antibody specificity.
at trial,abbott expert,james marks,testified about the disclosure in the cip applications and explained why a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have understood that centocor had possession of a high affinity,neutralizing,specific,antibody.on appeal,abbott emphasizes that marks provided the only expert testimony that the jury heard about written description.to underscore the inadequacy of centocor written description,abbott points out that the specification does not disclose any,high affinity,neutralizing,specific antibody.moreover,the specification does not disclose a single human variable region.abbott argues that the only described antibody is the chimeric antibody,which has a mouse variable region.abbott also argues that centocor has merely disclosed tools that might be used in an attempt to make the claimed,that centocor disclosure is no more than a mere wish or plan for how one might search for a antibody that satisfies the claims.finally,abbott points to testimony from centocor inventor indicating that the disclosure did not include examples about making a human antibody because it was never centocor intention to make a human antibody.abbott contends that centocor is attempting to claim as its own the fruit of abbott innovative work.
in response,centocor points to specific disclosures in the cip applications identified by inventor john ghrayeb as evidence that the asserted claims are adequately described and enabled.centocor presented no expert testimony on written description at trial and instead chose to rest on the patent specification and the testimony of its inventors.without directly relying on the pto written description guidelines or what it refers to as dicta in noelle lederman,centocor contends on appeal that the patent does much more than what the guidelines and noelle suggest,in that it not only describes the antibodies by their binding affinity for,but further describes the antibodies by specifying that they competitively inhibit binding of the mouse antibody to.centocor also argues that the written description requirement demands neither actual reduction to practice nor working examples to claim an invention.
we turn to the four corners of the cip applications to assess whether their disclosure provides adequate written description for the asserted claims.because the pertinent disclosure from the applications appears in the patent as issued,we refer only to the patent for clarity.
contrary to centocor assertions,very little in the patent supports that centocor possessed a high affinity,neutralizing,specific antibody that also contained a human variable region.the overwhelming majority of the patent describes the mouse antibody and the single chimeric antibody that centocor made based on mouse variable region.the specification describes the structure and characteristics of the chimeric antibody in great detail,indicating that it binds to with high affinity,has neutralizing activity,and is mirrored by the critical claim limitations in the asserted claims.the specification also includes the sequence of the human protein,references to cell lines that produce the mouse and chimeric antibodies,and numerous examples describing making and using the chimeric antibody.patent.as for describing suitable variable regions,the application only provides amino acid sequence information a molecular description of the antibody for a single mouse variable region,the variable region that the mouse antibody and the chimeric antibody have in common.id.at.however,the mouse variable region sequence does not serve as a stepping stone to identifying a human variable region within the scope of the claims the undisputed trial testimony indicated that the sequence of centocor mouse variable region was very different from the sequence of a human variable region like the one in abbott antibody.
in marked contrast to the detailed description of the claimed chimeric antibodies,ghrayeb was able to point to only a few sentences sprinkled throughout the patent that mention human antibodies or human variable regions at all.id.at.marks testified that the mere fact that the words appear does not reasonably suggest to one of skill in the art that centocor was in possession of such antibodies.further,while the specification notes that antibodies can potentially be produced by human b lymphocytes,it does not disclose any b lymphocytes that actually produce a high affinity,neutralizing,specific antibody.id.at 
in addition,ghrayeb highlighted a single reference to an article describing using phage display technology to make low affinity,human antibodies.id.at.marks,the author of the article,testified at trial that it teaches low affinity antibodies to red blood cells.he stated that the antibodies coming out of these early phage libraries were very low affinity and explained that there no teaching in this paper about how to make tnf antibodies.ghrayeb likewise testified that the article describes using a phage library to identify antibodies that bind to red blood cells.the article does not discuss making antibodies to human,nor does it discuss making antibodies that bind in a specific place like the claimed specific antibodies.marks testified that references in the patent addressing phage display describe very general library technologies that could be used to make antibodies,including human antibodies,but they do not teach how to isolate or use such antibodies.the fact that a antibody could be made does not suffice to show that the inventors of the patent possessed such an antibody.
besides pointing to these limited references to antibodies,none of which relate to the specific critical limitations in the asserted claims,centocor suggests that written description for the asserted claims comes from the limitations described in the claim language itself.however,this specific claim language was not added until and is not part of the cip applications as filed.
thus,while the patent broadly claims a class of antibodies that contain human variable regions,the specification does not describe a single antibody that satisfies the claim limitations.see eli lilly,at.it does not disclose any relevant identifying characteristics for such antibodies or even a single human variable region.see id.nor does it disclose any relationship between the human protein,the known mouse variable region that satisfies the critical claim limitations,and potential human variable regions that will satisfy the claim limitations.see id.there is nothing in the specification that conveys to one of skill in the art that centocor possessed antibodies or human variable regions that fall within the boundaries of the asserted claims.
at bottom,the asserted claims constitute a wish list of properties that a,therapeutic antibody should have high affinity,neutralizing activity,and the ability to bind in the same place as the mouse antibody.the specification at best describes a plan for making antibodies and then identifying those that satisfy the claim limitations.but a mere wish or plan for obtaining the claimed invention is not sufficient.see id.at.at the time the cip applications were filed,it was entirely possible that that no antibody existed that satisfied the claims.because centocor had not invented a,high affinity,neutralizing,specific antibody in,a reasonable jury could not conclude that it possessed one.
although it does not fully endorse those positions,centocor suggests that our decision in noelle and the pto written description guidelines support the view that fully disclosing the human protein provides adequate written description for any antibody that binds to human.that suggestion is based on an unduly broad characterization of the guidelines and our precedent.
the current pto written description guidelines include an antibody example.referencing only an immunology text published in,the pto guidelines indicate that a functional claim reciting an isolated antibody capable of binding to protein x is adequately described where the specification fully characterizes protein if there are no working or detailed prophetic examples of actual antibodies that bind to protein,written description training materials revision march,at available at hereinafter pto guidelines.the antibody example presumes that the applicant is disclosing a novel protein and then claiming both the protein and an antibody that binds to it.the pto guidelines characterize production of antibodies against a antigen as conventional and routine,given well developed and mature antibody technology.id.at.the pto guidelines conclude that characterization of the protein alone may be sufficient under circumstances where one of skill in the art would have recognized that the disclosure of the adequately described protein x put the applicant in possession of antibodies which bind to protein id.in other words,an applicant can claim an antibody to novel protein x without describing the antibody when the applicant fully discloses the novel protein and generating the claimed antibody is so routine that possessing the protein places the applicant in possession of an antibody.
in noelle,we discussed the pto antibody example.at.the case focused on antibodies to a protein called.noelle claimed an antibody that specifically binds.id.at.this broad claim covered antibodies that bind from any species.noelle also claimed an antibody that specifically binds human,yet the specification only disclosed the mouse protein and an antibody to that protein,id.at.the specification did not describe any antibodies to human or from any other species,nor did it describe any protein from any species except mouse.id.we concluded that noelle specification did not provide adequate written description for such broad claims.
while our precedent suggests that written description for certain antibody claims can be satisfied by disclosing a antigen,that reasoning applie
