the chicago district council of carpenters welfare fund carpenters sued caremark,and its parent company caremark rx,collectively caremark for breach of fiduciary duties under b of the employee retirement income security act of erisa the district court determined that caremark was not an erisa fiduciary and therefore granted caremark motion to dismiss.we affirm.
we take the facts as presented in the complaint.carpenters provides healthcare benefits to the members of a labor union.one of the benefits provided is prescription drug coverage which entitles the union members to obtain brand name or generic prescription drugs for a small.carpenters pays the rest of the cost.in order to manage this benefit,carpenters entered into a series of contracts with caremark,one of the nation largest pharmaceutical benefit management pbm companies there are three such contracts in the record,signed in,and.each covers a period.the first two contracts are between caremark and carpenters directly we will refer to these as the contract and the contract respectively.the third agreement was executed in two parts first is a contract between caremark and midwest employee benefit fund coalition,an organization of which carpenters was a member.in the second part,carpenters entered into a participating group agreement with caremark that set specific terms for services covered and prices.together we will refer to those last two agreements as the contract.
the parties disagree about the nature of caremark obligations under the contracts.carpenters portrays caremark as its fiduciary,responsible for,among other things,negotiating prices with retail pharmacies and drug manufacturers on behalf of carpenters.caremark claims only to have agreed to provide the stated benefits at prices determined via arm length negotiations between caremark and carpenters.carpenters attached to the complaint the three contracts at issue,and under the federal rules of civil procedure,those contracts are considered parts of the pleading.fed.civ.pro.c venture assocs.zenith data,cir.we may thus turn to the contracts to determine the nature of the agreement.to the extent that the contracts contradict the complaint,the contracts trump the facts or allegations presented in the complaint.flannery recording indus.of,cir thompson illinois of regulation,cir perkins silverstein,cir in determining the sufficiency of the complaint,the court may rely on exhibits to the complaint whenever the allegations of the complaint are materially inconsistent with those exhibits.under each of these contracts,caremark was obliged to provide a variety of services to the covered union members.for example,caremark was obliged to provide a mail service pharmacy,access to a network of retail pharmacies,claims processing,a formulary program,customer service phone lines,and maintenance of records.caremark contracts with retail pharmacies and operates four automated and nineteen pharmacies in order to process prescriptions for its clients.each contract also provided that caremark was not a fiduciary as that term is defined by erisa,and that carpenters possessed the sole authority to control and administer the plan.
nonetheless,carpenters alleges that,under the three contracts,caremark has discretionary authority over the management and administration of carpenters drug benefit plan and also exercises discretion and control over carpenters assets.this discretionary authority gives rise to fiduciary duties under erisa,carpenters reasons.in particular,carpenters alleges that caremark has discretion and therefore fiduciary duties in four specific areas in negotiations with drug retailers over drug prices in negotiations with drug manufacturers over rebates and other discounts in the management of the formulary program and in the management of the drug switching program.we turn to the contracts to set out the terms in each of these areas.

contract,ex.a,section.
there are a number of defined terms in these provisions that require explanation.awp refers to the average wholesale price for a prescription drug as reported in first data bank or other nationally available reporting service of pharmaceutical prices.usual and customary price refers to the retail price charged by a participating pharmacy for the particular drug in a cash transaction on the date the drug is dispensed as reported by the participating pharmacy to caremark.hcfa is the health care financing administration,a federal agency that administers medicare and medicaid services.it is now known as the centers for medicare and medicaid services.mac is the maximum allowable cost that the federal government will pay under medicare and medicaid for a generic drug.hcfa did not list a mac price for every available generic drug.carpenters avers in its complaint that the phrase hcfa mac,as expanded by caremark obligated caremark to calculate the price for these unlisted generic drugs using the formula that hcfa used to generate mac pricing and offer carpenters at least as favorable a price as an hcfa calculation would yield.according to carpenters,these provisions gave caremark the duty and the discretion to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate the prices carpenters would pay retailers for filling union members prescriptions.
the contract provided that caremark would pay carpenters a rebate for each mail order prescription and a rebate for each retail prescription filled.caremark would be relieved of this obligation if caremark was no longer eligible to receive rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate programs.under the contract,caremark was similarly obliged to pay carpenters a rebate for mail order prescriptions and a rebate for retail prescriptions filled except that no rebates were due for generic prescriptions.as in the contract,caremark was not obliged to pay the rebate if the manufacturers were no longer allowing caremark to participate in a rebate program.additionally,the contract provided that caremark would hold all contracts relating to rebates with the pharmaceutical manufacturers and that carpenters agreed not to enter into contracts directly with drug makers relating to the services provided under the contract.the contract changed the amount due as rebates for each mail order and retail prescription filled,removed the exception for generic drugs mentioned in the contract,and retained the language explaining that caremark would hold all contracts with drug makers relating to rebates and that carpenters would not enter into contracts directly with those manufacturers.in the formulary program provisions,the contract also stated that 
caremark may hold contracts with the manufacturers of products covered under this agreement and in connection with such contracts,caremark may have a financial relationship with such manufacturers and may receive rebates from such manufacturers.
nothing in the contract relieved caremark of the duty to pay rebates to carpenters,even if the manufacturers deemed caremark ineligible to receive rebates.carpenters argues that these various rebate provisions delegated to caremark discretionary authority over the negotiations of drug purchase agreements with drug manufacturers on carpenters behalf.this discretion gave rise to fiduciary duties,according to carpenters.moreover,carpenters contends that the provisions gave caremark control over carpenters assets,namely over the portion of rebates paid by drug makers that belongs to carpenters.this control over assets,carpenters contends,also gave rise to fiduciary duties.
formulary programs 
carpenters also argues that caremark is a fiduciary because it exercises discretion in the management of its formulary program,including control over the content of the formulary and over the program.the contract specifies that,among other services,caremark shall 
provide a supply of caremark prescription formulary brochures which list caremark preferred product in each of a number of therapeutic categories and requests the covered member to provide the formulary to his or her prescriber to assist the prescriber in making prescribing decisions.caremark shall contact prescribers,as appropriate,to obtain approval for substitution of formulary drugs.
the contract again required caremark to provide a supply of formulary brochures but this time the brochures were to be distributed directly to prescribers.caremark also agreed to contact prescribers,as appropriate,to obtain approval for substitution of formulary drugs.the contract required caremark to provide the same formulary services as the contract and additionally required caremark to provide the formulary brochures to the insured union members upon request.the contract contained additional provisions in the formulary program section.we have already quoted part of this paragraph in relation to the rebates,and we repeat it here to place it in context 
carpenters acknowledges that carpenters has the sole discretion and authority to determine the formulary for the plan.caremark may hold contracts with the manufacturers of products covered under this agreement and in connection with such contracts,caremark may have a financial relationship with such manufacturers and may receive rebates from such manufacturers.in addition,caremark may contact covered members regarding therapeutic compliance,therapeutic education or similar programs,at no additional expense to carpenters.on an aggregate basis,caremark therapeutic interchange program tip shall result in net savings to carpenters.a covered member shall not pay a higher copayment due to caremark tip program.caremark may receive compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for certain of these services.
drug switching program 
as we noted above in the formulary program discussion,each contract obliged caremark to contact prescribers,as appropriate,to obtain approval for substitution of formulary drugs.carpenters refers to this as the drug switching program.in addition to the sections quoted above,carpenters relies on another provision in the contract under the mail service pharmacy section to demonstrate caremark duties under the drug switching program.this provision obliges caremark,subject to prescriber approval and applicable law,to provide pharmaceutical cost containment services,including generic and therapeutic substitutions.according to carpenters,under these provisions,caremark bears the sole responsibility of deciding whether to try to persuade a prescriber to switch a prescription to a different,therapeutically similar drug.because of the discretion granted to caremark in determining how to implement this provision,carpenters contends that caremark is its fiduciary under erisa.
caremark moved to dismiss the erisa claim on the ground that the company was not an erisa fiduciary under any of the three contracts.the district court noted that,in order to be considered an erisa fiduciary,caremark must either exercise discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting the management of the plan exercise any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets or have any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan.the court stated that caremark was a fiduciary only to the extent that it exercised discretionary authority and thus it was possible that caremark could be a fiduciary for some purposes and not for others.the court first held that,because each contract specified that nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to confer upon caremark the status of fiduciary as defined in erisa,caremark was not a fiduciary.the court then explored whether caremark could nonetheless be a fiduciary for the four purposes alleged by carpenters in negotiating with retail pharmacies the prices that the plan pays for drugs in negotiating with drug manufacturers the prices that the plan pays for drugs and the rebates obtained for those drugs in determining which drugs will comprise the formulary and in determining how to administer the drug switching program.the complaint alleged that caremark breached its fiduciary duties by charging carpenters a higher price than caremark negotiated with retail pharmacies,and by choosing drugs for the formulary that were more expensive so that caremark could pocket extra rebates it obtained from drug makers.
the district court found that nothing in the contracts required caremark to pass through cost savings to carpenters.instead,the court ruled,the retail pharmacy provisions obligated caremark to charge carpenters a set price for each drug,a price that could only be changed after further negotiations and agreement.because the prices set in the contracts were the result of arm length negotiations between carpenters and caremark,the court held that caremark could not be held liable for a breach of fiduciary duty related to retail pharmacy prices.as for caremark dealings with drug manufacturers,the district court found that nothing in the contracts required caremark to enter into agreements with drug manufacturers on behalf of carpenters or to negotiate with drug makers for the prices carpenters would pay for drugs.the court again pointed out that the contracts set the prices for drugs based on negotiations between caremark and carpenters,an arm length deal that did not give rise to fiduciary duties.
addressing issues related to the formulary and drug switching programs,the court noted that carpenters adopted caremark formulary in each contract.in each contract,a provision detailing carpenters duties under the contract expressly stated that carpenters had the sole authority to control and administer the plan.in addition to those general declarations of carpenters authority in each contract,the contract specified that carpenters had the sole discretion and authority to determine the formulary for the plan.because of these provisions giving carpenters the sole authority to control the plan and because of the negotiated drug prices in each contract,the court concluded that caremark did not breach any fiduciary duties with respect to the formulary program or the drug switching program.finally,turning to carpenters arguments about the rebates,the court noted that each contract specified a set rebate that caremark was to pay to carpenters for each prescription filled.nothing in any of the three contracts required caremark to pass along to carpenters any additional rebates issued by the drug manufacturers.therefore,the court held,the rebate provisions did not create any fiduciary duties for caremark.accordingly,the court dismissed carpenters claim for breach of fiduciary duty.carpenters appeals.
on appeal,carpenters argues that caremark is an erisa fiduciary because caremark has discretionary authority to negotiate with retailers the price that carpenters pays for prescription drugs on behalf of its members and to unilaterally adjust those prices to adapt to market changes to negotiate with drug manufacturers the prices that carpenters pays for drugs and to determine the amount of financial incentives from manufacturers that carpenters would share on its own purchases to advise carpenters on the initial content of its formulary and then to unilaterally alter the formulary and to manage the drug switching program.carpenters also contends that caremark disavowal of its fiduciary status in the contracts is ineffective and void as against public policy pursuant to statute 
the district court dismissed the claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,for failure to state a claim because caremark could not be an erisa fiduciary under the facts alleged.on appeal,we accept as true all facts,and drawing all inferences in favor of carpenters,we review de novo whether the complaint states a claim for which relief can be granted.baker kingsley,cir corporate receivables,cir.to make out a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,carpenters must show that caremark was a fiduciary as that term is defined in the statute and that caremark was acting in its capacity as a fiduciary at the time it took the actions that are the subject of the complaint.see a,b pegram herdrich,d baker,at.a person is a fiduciary for an erisa plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,direct or indirect,with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan,or has any authority or responsibility to do so,or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.a pegram,at.baker,at caremark may be an erisa fiduciary for some purposes and not for others.baker,at.
carpenters argues first that caremark has discretionary authority or discretionary control to negotiate and adjust on an ongoing basis the price carpenters pays for drugs that union members obtain from retail pharmacies.a thorough review of the contract provisions quoted above in section,however,reveals that,in each of the three contracts,carpenters agreed to pay set prices for the drugs,prices negotiated with caremark at arm length.see central states,se.sw.areas pension fund kroger,cir when a contract is unambiguous,the court may declare its meaning as a matter of law.in each contract,that price was tied to a number fixed by neither carpenters nor caremark.for example,the price depended sometimes on average wholesale prices awp as determined by a national index.in some instances,the price was based on a retailer usual and customary charge,that is,the retail price charged by a participating pharmacy for the particular drug in a cash transaction on the date the drug was dispensed as reported by the participating pharmacy to caremark.in the case of generic drugs,the price was often fixed by a schedule used by medicare and medicaid to determine how much those programs would pay for participants prescriptions the hcfa mac.there was no way for caremark to negotiate the awp reported on a national index.nor could caremark negotiate the usual and customary price that a pharmacy charged other customers in cash transactions.and finally,caremark was in no position to negotiate the prices the federal government was willing to pay for drugs for medicare and medicaid recipients.in each contract,carpenters agreed to pay prices based on those fixed numbers,sometimes with a percentage discount that carpenters and caremark negotiated at arm length,and in each instance with a fixed dispensing fee attached to each prescription.as the district court noted,nothing in any of the contracts required caremark to pass through any additional cost savings it managed to negotiate with retailers.
nor could caremark increase the prices unilaterally due to changes in the marketplace,as carpenters contends.although each contract provided that prices could be adjusted i n the event of changes in the marketplace beyond caremark control,every contract also required that any changes be made in a writing signed by both parties.the provision thus gave caremark the right to renegotiate prices during the contract term but not the right to change the prices unilaterally.
that brings us to the somewhat puzzling provision in each contract stating that caremark will use its best commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate these rates with existing pharmacies in carpenters network.the district court did not address what rates this provision covered or what this provision meant.carpenters cites this provision as a source of discretionary authority for caremark,resulting in fiduciary duties.as we noted above,caremark could not negotiate awp,usual and customary charges or hcfa mac.carpenters argues that caremark was to negotiate with the retailers the rates that caremark would pay on behalf of the plan,costs that were then reimbursed by carpenters.according to carpenters,caremark was to use its best efforts to negotiate the rates that carpenters was to reimburse caremark.this argument makes little sense given that carpenters negotiated to pay caremark fixed prices for the drugs based on indexes largely outside the control of either party to the contract.the only amounts within the control of caremark and carpenters were the percentage discounts and the dispensing fees,numbers that were negotiated between carpenters and caremark at arm length.the contract contained no mechanism for a of any additional savings caremark managed to negotiate with retailers.the contracts did not provide,for example,that carpenters would pay awp minus the highest percent discount that caremark could negotiate with retailers using its market power.without such a provision,caremark was free to negotiate with retailers to pay less than the amount carpenters would later reimburse it,allowing caremark to pocket the difference.this,of course,is the very conduct that carpenters alleges was a breach of fiduciary duty.given that this scheme was the very deal for which carpenters bargained at arms length,caremark owed no fiduciary duty in this regard.schulist blue cross of iowa,cir parties bargaining at arm length prior t
