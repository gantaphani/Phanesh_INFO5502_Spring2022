the collectively,shire own patent,which claims a oral pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammatory bowel diseases.shire markets these oral pharmaceutical compositions under the brand name lialda.after the collectively,watson submitted an abbreviated new drug application anda seeking approval to sell the bioequivalent of lialda,shire sued for infringement of the patent.after construing certain relevant claim language,the district court found that watson product infringed the patent.we conclude that the district court constructions of inner lipophilic matrix and outer hydrophilic matrix impermissibly broaden the ordinary meaning of the terms.accordingly,we reverse the district court claim constructions of inner lipophilic matrix and outer hydrophilic matrix,and subsequent finding of infringement,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the patent entitled mesalazine controlled release oral pharmaceutical composition concerns oral pharmaceutical compositions for treating inflammatory bowel diseases,such as crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.patent ll.the active ingredient in these compositions is aminosalicylic acid,which is also known as mesalazine or mesalamine hereinafter,mesalamine.mesalamine treats inflamed areas in the bowel by direct contact with the intestinal mucosal tissue.thus,mesalamine must pass through the stomach and small intestine without being absorbed into the bloodstream.and,it must be administered throughout the entire length of the colon so that the mesalamine contacts all affected tissues.given these requirements,the oral composition must contain a high percentage,by weight,of mesalamine.patent ll.
the patent teaches an inner lipophilic matrix and an outer hydrophilic matrix to address the limitations of the prior art systems according to the patent,the combination of a lipophilic and hydrophilic matrix in an matrix system,respectively,is advantageous because the matrix properties cause the mesalamine to be released in a sustained and uniform manner.patent ll.t he compositions of the invention provide a release profile of mesalamine more homogenous than the traditional systems.see also.the patent also teaches the advantageous characteristic of a composition with up to active ingredient by weight.patent ll.
shire asserts independent claim and dependent claim.claim recites 
oral pharmaceutical compositions containing as an active ingredient amino salicylic acid,comprising 
a an inner lipophilic matrix consisting of substances selected from the group consisting of unsaturated hydrogenated fatty acid,salts,esters or amides thereof,fatty acid mono,di or triglycerid e s,waxes,ceramides,and cholesterol derivatives with melting points below,and wherein the active ingredient is dispersed both in said the lipophilic matrix and in the hydrophilic matrix 
b an outer hydrophilic matrix wherein the lipophilic matrix is dispersed,and said outer hydrophilic matrix consists of compounds selected from the group consisting of polymers or copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid,alkylvinyl polymers,hydroxyalkyl celluloses,carboxyalkyl celluloses,polysaccharides,dextrins,pectins,starches and derivatives,alginic acid,and natural or synthetic gums 
c optionally other excipients 
wherein the active ingredient is present in an amount of to by weight of the total composition,and wherein the active ingredient is dispersed both in the lipophilic matrix and in the hydrophilic matrix.
patent ll.claim depends from claim and requires that the composition be in the form of tablets,capsules,or minitablets.patent ll.
the patent teaches a process to arrive at the claimed composition.patent ll.first,one or more low melting,lipophilic are mixed with mesalamine during heating.patent ll.second,the mixture is cooled to form the lipophilic matrix and then reduced in size into matrix granules containing the active ingredient.patent ll.third,the lipophilic matrix granules are mixed together with hydrophilic excipients and compressed to form tablets.patent ll,ll.
during prosecution of the patent,the examiner initially rejected the applicants claims as obvious in view of gb a franco obvious and anticipated in view of patent akiyama and obvious in view of the combination of patent sanghvi and patent straub.the examiner explained that franco taught a pharmaceutical composition with an active core,a lipophilic coating,and a hydrophilic film.
in response,the applicants stated that franco disclosed a reservoir system where the active ingredient is confined within a core which acts as a reservoir from which the active ingredient is released via the erosion of the outer coating.however,as to the present invention,the active ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic matrix,not in an isolated core.
the applicants then distinguished akiyama based on the claimed invention two matrices and high active ingredient concentration.the applicants argued that akiyama fail s to disclose or suggest the two matrices and the arrangement of the matrices as set forth in the claimed invention.the arrangement of the matrices in the present invention aid s in the combined release of an active ingredient via diffusion from a lipophilic matrix.the applicants also argued that akiyama composition contained the active ingredient in an amount much lower than that according to the claimed invention akiyama taught an active ingredient in granules in an amount ranging from by weight,but the applicants amended claim taught.
to distinguish sanghvi and straub,the applicants again focused on a lack of two separate matrices sanghvi fails to disclose a system containing two separate matrices.it merely discloses formulations obtained by mixing together hydrophilic and lipophilic substances into a single matrix.when discussing the combination of sanghvi and straub,the applicants explained that w hile the publications might teach the advantageous results of using a lipophilic matrix,the publications fail to disclose or suggest a composition comprising a combination of two separate matrices.in fact,there is no mention or suggestion of a composition utilizing different control mechanisms.
the examiner maintained her rejection of the pending claims as obvious in view of franco.the examiner also rejected the claims because the feature upon which applicant relies,the active ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic matrix is not recited in the rejected claims.further,the examiner explained that the active ingredient is at least partly inglobated does not limit the claim to active ingredient is dispersed in a lipophilic matrix as alleged by the applicant.
in response,the applicants maintained that franco taught a reservoir system,but that the claimed invention relates to a multimatrix system and not to a reservoir system.see also franco et do es not teach an inner lipophilic matrix or an outer hydrophilic matrix the composition taught by franco et is not based on an actual matrix.the applicants also amended their claims to state that the active ingredient is dispersed in the lipophilic matrix and added a markush for both the inner lipophilic matrix and the outer hydrophilic matrix.following an interview with the examiner,the claims were amended to require the mesalamine to be dispersed in the outer hydrophilic matrix and not just the lipophilic matrix.the claims were then allowed and the patent issued.
when watson submitted its anda seeking fda approval to sell the bioequivalent of lialda,shire sued watson for infringement of the patent.in january,the district court construed several disputed terms,including inner lipophilic matrix and outer hydrophilic matrix.see shire dev.llc watson,wl.
the district court held a bench trial in april and issued its opinion a month later,finding that watson anda product infringed claims and of the patent that the claims were not invalid under,and that shire was entitled to injunctive relief.shire dev.llc watson,wl,at.may.specifically,the district court determined that watson anda product met the limitations of the claims at issue.in considering the disputed limitations,the district court found that the mesalamine in watson product was dispersed in b
