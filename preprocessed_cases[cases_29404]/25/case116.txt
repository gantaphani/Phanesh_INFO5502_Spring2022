opinion of the court 
in november,wyeth wyeth entered into a nationwide class action settlement agreement the settlement agreement with the users of certain diet drugs linked to various health problems.the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania certified the settlement class and entered a order enjoining members of the class from suing wyeth for injuries related to those drugs.appellants carmen and ricky leon cauthen brought a lawsuit against wyeth in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,pennsylvania,seeking to redress cauthen injuries from primary pulmonary hypertension pph,a condition that she alleges was caused by the diet drugs.wyeth moved the district court to enjoin the suit,arguing that it did not qualify under the settlement agreement as a cause of action that could proceed despite the settlement.the district court agreed and enjoined the cauthens lawsuit.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
background 
class action suit and settlement agreement 
between and,american home products corporation,now wyeth,marketed and sold fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine,prescription weight loss drugs.after studies linked the drugs to valvular heart disease,and following a food and drug administration fda public health advisory,wyeth withdrew the drugs from the market in.thousands of individuals subsequently filed suit,alleging that they had been injured by the drugs.
in december,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation entered an order transferring all diet drug cases in federal court to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania for consolidated proceedings.nearly two years later,wyeth entered into a settlement agreement with users of the diet drugs in the united states and presented the agreement to the district court for approval.on august,the district court certified the class,approved the settlement agreement,and entered pre trial order pto.that order provided that the district court retains continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over this action and each of the parties,including wyeth and the class members,to administer,supervise,interpret and enforce the settlement in accordance with its terms.supplemental app.at.
aside from certain narrow exceptions,the settlement agreement enjoins class members from suing wyeth for all diet injuries.one of the exceptions is at issue in this case the settlement agreement allows class members to sue wyeth if they can demonstrate that they developed through the use of the diet drugs.to qualify for the exception,a class member must draw on m edical records to demonstrate the exclus ion of certain medical conditions.app.at.to exclude one such condition,which is referred to as greater than mild restrictive lung disease,a class member is required by.a c of the settlement agreement to produce pulmonary function tests pfts showing that the class member total lung capacity is greater than of predicted at rest.id.settlement agreement.a c.
b.the cauthens lawsuit 
in june,the cauthens filed a complaint in the philadelphia county court of common pleas,alleging that cauthen,a member of the settlement class,developed pph as a result of ingesting diet drugs.id.at.the cauthens produced a p ulmonary consultation note prepared by terry fortin id.at,a cardiologist certified by the american board of internal medicine.fortin stated in the consultation note that,based on a pft she had conducted,cauthen total lung capacity is,and fortin acknowledged that cauthen lungs clearly have some restriction.id.at.
because cauthen only pft showed that she had lung capacity of less than percent of predicted at rest,wyeth notified the cauthens that they were prohibited from bringing their claim,as cauthen did not satisfy.a c of the settlement agreement.the cauthens declined to drop the lawsuit.wyeth then filed a motion in the district court seeking to enjoin the cauthens state court lawsuit for failing to satisfy the precondition for suit provided by the settlement agreement.opposing wyeth motion,the cauthens submitted a declaration by fortin stating that,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,cauthen has primary pulmonary hypertension secondary to her use of one of the diet drugs in early.id.at.
in her declaration,fortin alluded to the requirement in.a c of the settlement agreement that lung capacity must be greater than percent of predicted at rest,and she said that i nsight into underlying pathophysiology can often be gained by comparing the measured values for pulmonary function tests obtained on a patient at any particular point with normative values derived from population studies.id.at.the percentage of predicted normal lung capacity,she continued,is used to grade the severity of the abnormality.id.she explained that the normative values used to calculate a patient percentage of lung capacity predicted at rest are based upon averages for persons of similar height,weight,age,ethnicity,id.according to fortin,the standard average reference used to calculate cauthen percentage of lung capacity was liters,a value taken from the duke modified guide at duke university.id.at.fortin further explained that,through a battery of tests conducted on april,she had determined that cauthen had a lung capacity of liters.dividing cauthen lung capacity by the average lung capacity of individuals matching cauthen demographic profile,yields cauthen percentage of lung capacity predicted at rest,percent.
fortin went on to downplay that result by challenging the accuracy of the denominator in the above equation.the figures used to represent average lung capacity by demographic characteristics,she asserted,are only averages and may vary in actual practice.id.at.the liter reference is only a reference value,she continued,and does not actually represent m s.cauthen total lung capacity t he liter reference value is just a predicted average of a wom a n total lung capacity who fits cauthen age,height,race and weight.id.at.in fact,fortin claimed,the value taken from the duke modified guide is just one of the many references available that are out there.id without providing any other reference,fortin concluded to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that we just do not know conclusively what the true reference value for cauthen should be.id fortin did offer,however,that,i f we were to use a reference value of,just less than the reference originally used,then cauthen total lung capacity percent predicted calculation would be.id.at.
fortin also asserted that comparing an individual lung capacity with the average capacity of persons having a similar demographic profile is important but not determinative in diagnosing pph.cardiologists,she assured the district court,know about the limitations of the percent predicted calculation on a pft and must rely on other methods in order to determine a specific patient true total lung capacity,such as radiology studies and an exam of the patient body habitus.id.at.in fact,fortin claimed,whether cauthen total lung capacity percent predicted calculation is or is clinically irrelevant id,and cauthen diet drug use was the cause of her pph id.at.without further explanation,fortin declared that,b ased upon her review of the april,pulmonary function test and other objective tests,she had ruled out any restrictive lung disease as a cause of cauthen pph.id.
unconvinced,the district court held that the cauthens had not produced a pft that supported their claim that cauthen does not have greater than mild restrictive lung disease,as required by.a c of the settlement agreement.id.at.fortin declaration did not alter the court conclusion for two reasons.first,the doctor acknowledged that cauthen only pft demonstrated that she has a total lung capacity of only percent of predicted at rest.cauthen thus did not meet the definition of pph provided in.a c.second,the settlement agreement requires class members who wish to make a claim related to pph to establish,through a pulmonary function test only,the absence of greater than mild restrictive lung disease.id.at.because fortin declaration is not the type of medical record contemplated in the settlement agr
