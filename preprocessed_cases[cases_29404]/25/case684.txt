background 
the central issue in this case is the meaning of the claim term hydrosol in the patent.
cyclosporin is an important immunosuppressant drug,typically administered to organ transplant patients to reduce the risk of rejection.the patent for cyclosporin itself has expired.the patent is directed toward solving a problem concerning administration of the drug.because it is not very soluble in water,cyclosporin is difficult to administer in a formulation that will be readily absorbed by the aqueous environment of the human body.
novartis addressed this problem by discovering a formulation for administering cyclosporin as a hydrosol.as explained in the patent,a hydrosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving cyclosporin in a solvent and then adding a comparatively large amount of water to that solution.this results in an aqueous dispersion of very small solid particles of the drug that is more readily absorbed by the body.in addition a stabilizing compound is added to keep those small solid particles from growing larger.novartis claimed this invention in the patent.all of the claims in the patent claim the invention as a hydrosol.claim is representative 
a hydrosol which comprises solid particles of a cyclosporin and a stabilizer which maintains the size distribution of said particles,wherein said cyclosporin has a water solubility below grams per milliliters,and said particles have a weight ratio of cyclosporin to water of about to about and a weight ratio of cyclosporin to said stabilizer of about to about.
novartis filed suit against eon for infringement of the patent.novartis concedes that eon does not sell cyclosporin in the form of a hydrosol.instead,eon manufactures capsules that contain cyclosporin dissolved in a small amount of ethanol.because there is no water in these capsules,and the cyclosporin inside is completely dissolved,the mixture contained in eon capsules is not a hydrosol.however,novartis contends that when one of eon capsules is ingested an infringing hydrosol is formed when the capsule mixes with the aqueous environment of the user stomach.novartis therefore alleges that eon is liable for indirect infringement arising from the use of its capsules.
after reviewing the parties claim construction briefs and expert declarations,the district court issued an order construing the claims on august.before the district court,novartis argued that the plain meaning of the term hydrosol was a dispersion of solid particles in an aqueous medium,and thus included a dispersion formed in a user stomach upon ingestion.the district court disagreed and construed hydrosol to require the following two elements 
a a synthetic pharmaceutical preparation,it does not encompass a dispersion of solid particles of cyclosporin which only forms in the stomach of a patient and 
b all the cyclosporin is in solid particle form and not in solution,excepting for a very small amount of cyclosporin which the water in the hydrosol can solubilize.

the key issue on appeal is whether hydrosol as it appears in all of the patent claims is limited to medicinal products prepared outside of the body or whether it also includes products formed within the stomach of a patient after a particular medicinal product has been ingested.novartis argues that the plain meaning of hydrosol includes products formed inside the stomach and that this definition controls the outcome of this case.we disagree.
neither party has suggested that hydrosol has a specialized meaning inconsistent with the ordinary dictionary definition,see br.for at urging definitions consistent with the definitions found in dictionaries br.for at urging a definition consistent with the dictionary definition,thus under our precedent,we begin our claim construction analysis with an examination of general purpose dictionary definitions.texas digital,telegenix,see also inverness med.switz.gmbh warner lambert.webster third new international dictionary webster defines the term hydrosol as a sol in which the liquid is water.webster at.in turn a sol is a dispersion of solid particles in a liquid colloidal solution.id.at the term solution has two pertinent definitions.these are a liquid containing a dissolved substance and a liquid and usu.aqueous medicinal preparation with the solid ingredients soluble.id.at.the first of these definitions is broad enough to include a solution,the liquid medium in which the solid particles are dispersed within the body,but,as explained below,the second definition is not 
medicinal means of or relating to medicine and the relevant definition of medicine is a substance or preparation used in treating disease.webster at.the oxford english dictionary,offers a similar definition of medicine as a ny substance or preparation used in the treatment of disease a medicament now commonly restricted to medicaments taken internally.the oxford english dictionary ed.medical dictionaries define preparation in terms of a substance that is made prior to being administered.see merriam webster defining preparation as something that is prepared specifically a medicinal substance made ready for use dorland at defining preparation as a medicine made ready for use stedman at defining preparation as s omething made ready,as a medicinal or other mixture,or a histologic specimen.thus,contrary to the suggestion in the dissent,post at,a medicinal preparation is a preexisting product that is administered to treat disease and therefore must necessarily be prepared outside the body.indeed,novartis the patentee conceded at oral argument that the normal connotation of medicinal preparation would lead you to believe it was something prepared outside the body.
our analysis of the dictionary definition of hydrosol therefore yields a range of possible meanings consisting of two competing definitions.the claim term hydrosol is either broadly defined to include a dispersion of solid particles in aqueous colloidal solution formed in a patient stomach,or limited to a medicinal preparation consisting of a dispersion of solid particles in an aqueous colloidal solution formed outside the body.
for more than years we,and our predecessor court,have looked to the intrinsic record to determine as a matter of claim interpretation which of the available,relevant definitions should be applied to the claim term at issue.as our predecessor court explained,o ne need not arbitrarily pick and choose from the various accepted definitions of a word to decide which meaning was intended as the word is used in a given claim.the subject matter,the context,will more often then not lead to the correct conclusion.liebscher boothroyd,ccpa see also,inverness,at w e must determine whether the specification or prosecution history clearly demonstrates that only one of the multiple meanings was intended.texas digital,at because words often have multiple dictionary definitions,some having no relation to the claimed invention,the intrinsic record must always be consulted to identify which of the different possible dictionary meanings of the claim terms in issue is most consistent with the use of the words by the inventor.renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,w here there are several common meanings for a claim term,the patent disclosure serves to point away from the improper meanings and toward the proper meaning.
in the present case,the specification describes the claimed hydrosol in terms of a pharmaceutical composition and makes no mention of the term in any other context.novartis concedes that the specification contains no description or examples of making hydrosols in the patient body.reply br.for at.rather,the abstract states that t he invention provides a hydrosol of a pharmacological active agent in an intravenous applicable,stabilised,pharmaceutically acceptable form.patent,abstract see also id.at,describing the hydrosol as comprising solid particles of the drug in an intravenously applicable,stabilised,pharmaceutically acceptable form.the specification repeatedly describes the invention as a pharmaceutical composition,see id.at,a method for preparation of a pharmaceutical composition,id.at,and a method of treatment using the corresponding pharmaceutical compositions,id.at,ll.since the dictionary defines pharmaceutical as a medicinal drug,webster at,these descriptions support adoption of the narrower definition of hydrosol.moreover,another aspect of the claimed hydrosol,an injectable solution is distinguished from the prior art on the ground that it was never previously proposed to use pharmacologically active agent particles in an aqueous hydrosol form for intravenous injection purposes.patent,ll,because an injectable hydrosol must necessarily be prepared outside the body,these statements further support adoption of the more limited definition of hydrosol as a medicinal preparation prepared outside the body.
the prosecution history of the patent points to the same conclusion.the examiner initially rejected novartis claims as obvious.novartis distinguished the prior art,arguing that its invention form ed finely divided solid drug compound particles in amorphous colloid form.app.at.novartis argued that this dispersion contains particles of such small diameters that they can be administered by intravenous injection.id.this description likewise supports the narrower definition of hydrosol as it clearly suggests that the hydrosol is a pharmaceutical composition that can be injected into a patient.
in light of the specification and prosecution history,we conclude that the narrower definition of hydrosol applies that is,the term hydrosol is limited to a medicinal preparation consisting of a dispersion of solid particles in a liquid colloidal solution prepared outside the body.while none of the statements in the intrinsic record is an explicit disclaimer of subject matter sufficient to vary the scope of the claim from its ordinary meaning these statements are helpful in guiding us to choose between competing dictionary definitions of a claim term.
in this regard,the present case is different from zenith laboratories,squibb,where we held that the claimed compound was not limited to its form.id.at.there the claim at issue was drafted to a specific chemical compound,cefadroxil monohydrate,in a crystalline form characterized by specific diffraction properties.see id.at.since the plain meaning of the claim language was clear and there was no express or implied limitation,we found no basis for so limiting the claim.thus,we held that while the claim is limited to the crystalline form of cefadroxil exhibiting the specified diffraction pattern,it is not limited to the compound in its form.id.at.however,in the present case the plain meaning of hydrosol is not clear,and nothing in zenith purports to change the precedent that we look to statements made in the specification and prosecution history to choose between competing dictionary definitions.
likewise our more recent decision in schering geneva pharmaceuticals,does not require us to construe the patent to encompass hydrosols formed only after ingestion.in schering the parties agreed that the claims at issue covered a metabolite of the drug loratadine,the compound formed in the patient body upon ingestion of that pharmaceutical.id.at.we held that these claims were anticipated by an earlier patent for the drug itself.id.at.this conclusion was based in part on the assumption that ingesting the earlier claimed pharmaceutical would create the metabolite and thus infringe the metabolite patent.id.at.however,in the present case there is no agreement that the claim encompasses the product formed after ingestion in schering the metabolite.here that is at the heart of the dispute.
having concluded that hydrosol as used in the patent is limited to an aqueous medicinal preparation prepared outside the body,we must determine if the accused product infringes prior to ingestion.novartis concedes that eon does not sell cyclosporin in the form of a hydrosol,and argues only that a hydrosol is formed after ingestion.br.for at.therefore,applying the appropriate construction of hydrosol there is no direct infringement of the patent.because there can be no induced or contributory infringement without an underlying direct infringement,see,epcon,at,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against the patentee on literal infringement.
novartis argues that even if the claimed hydrosol is limited to products prepared outside the body,the formation of a hydrosol inside the body infringes under the doctrine of equivalents.the district court granted summary judgment of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents in part because doing so would vitiate a claim limitation.we agree.
here the formation of a particulate dispersion inside the body can not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because this would vitiate the claimed requirement that the dispersion be prepared outside the body.infringement under the doctrine of equivalents requires that any difference between the claim elements at issue and the corresponding elements of the accused product be insubstantial.hilton davis chem,d.to extend the scope of the claims at issue to encompass a dispersion formed inside the stomach would necessarily read the hydrosol limitation out of those claims.see moore,standard register,i t would defy logic to conclude that a very antithesis of a be insubstantially different from a claim limitation requiring a majority,and no reasonable juror could find otherwise.see also conopco,may dep t stores,a conclusion that the formulation infringes a claim requiring a ratio of about under the doctrine of equivalents would eviscerate the plain meaning of that limitation.dolly,spalding evenflo,the doctrine of equivalents is not a license to ignore claim limitations.consequently,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment of under the doctrine of equivalents.
conclusion 
the plain meaning of the claim term hydrosol is ambiguous.the intrinsic record in this case leads us to adopt the narrower definition of that term as a medicinal preparation consisting of a dispersion of solid particles in an aqueous colloidal solution prepared outside the body.the doctrine of equivalents can not here expand the claim so as to include particle dispersions formed within the body.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment of
