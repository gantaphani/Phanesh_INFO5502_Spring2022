the patents at issue claim a of taxol,a cancer chemotherapeutic agent.the inventors method involves modifying iii with an acetyl group and adding a,side chain the side chain through an esterification reaction.several hydroxyl groups,located on both the and side chain molecules,readily react to form other unwanted products.to overcome this problem,the inventors devised a method of utilizing protecting groups to prevent particular hydroxyl groups on the core and side chain molecules from reacting in side reactions and thereby preventing the formation of taxol.first,starting with,a group is introduced at the hydroxyl position on the molecule to form the protected intermediate.second,an acetyl group replaces the hydrogen atom that is bonded to the oxygen atom at the position on the molecule,forming protected baccatin iii.third,the side chain is protected by a group at its position and then esterified or coupled with the protected baccatin iii at its position.lastly,the groups at the position of the bacacatin iii core and the position of the side chain are deprotected removed to form taxol of particular significance in this appeal is that the subject patents stemmed from a scientific article,written by the named inventors of the patents,entitled a highly efficient,practical approach to natural taxol,which was eventually published in the journal of the american chemical society the jacs article 
on approximately november,the inventors submitted a draft of what became the published jacs article to jacques pilard,a patent agent in the employ of rpr in france.the draft jacs article,written in english,stated that the conversion of to taxol could be successfully achieved only with specific protecting groups and under unique reaction conditions.emphasis added.it also explained the limitations of several protecting groups as follows 
a methoxymethyl mom protecting group at could not be removed following esterification footnote of the jacs article.
the trimethylsilyl tms group could also be selectively introduced at,but it proved unstable to the subsequent esterification conditions footnote of the jacs article.
the tbdms group could not be cleanly introduced at footnote of the jacs article.
on approximately november,pilard recommended to one of the inventors that the draft publication should or could be the subject of a patent application.in a letter sent to pilard dated january,simon of rpr grants and licenses department suggested that a patent application covering the inventors of taxol be filed in consideration of an exclusive license to rpr.on or about march,two of the inventors provided pilard their resumes and an invention disclosure,entitled modes operatoires,which described their of taxol in detail.consistent with the draft jacs article,the modes operatoires also explained the limitations of several protecting groups.specifically,it stated the following 
the regioselective protection of the hydroxyl at of was also obtained with tms.however,this tms group proved too fragile in the esterifying reaction with the protected side chain.
the protecting reaction does not go forward with the tbdm chloride.english translation of french original 
moreover,the modes operatoires stated the hydroxyl function of the side chain was protected with a wide variety of protective groups,such as the mom group,but it did not state that mom could be removed.
on march,pilard began drafting a french patent application for the of taxol.in claim of the draft patent application,pilard claimed the process as one in which is a group and in which is a group,without specifying any limitation as to the groups that could be used in the process.in claim of the draft application,pilard claimed the process according to claim in which is chosen from mom and other compounds and is chosen from trialkylsilyl groups in which each alkyl portion contains one to three carbon atoms.the patent application is an english translation of the french application.not only did pilard specify that mom and tms were permissible groups in claim,but he also stated in the specification of the draft patent application that denotes,more especially,a mom and other compounds radical and that p referably,is a tms radical.
on approximately march,pilard sent his draft of the french patent application to two of the inventors asking them to carefully review it and add all the complements and modifications they deemed necessary.they made no substantive changes to either the specification or the claims.pilard filed the french patent application on april.the journal of the american chemical society received the draft article on april,and it was published on august.
in march,pilard sent a copy of the french application and a search report dated november,generated by the french national institute of industrial property,to kemp company for translation into english and forwarding to ellsworth mosher,rpr united states patent attorney.the search report did not list the jacs article and pilard did not send a copy of the jacs article,the modes operatoires,or any of the inventors test results to kemp company or mosher.
on april,mosher filed the patent application with the united states patent and trademark office pto.the filed patent application,except for the abstract,is an english translation of the french patent application previously prepared and filed by pilard.mosher,who never received a copy of the jacs article from pilard,did not disclose it to the pto.
at some point during the prosecution of the patent,the examiner assigned to the patent application asked the pto scientific library to perform a computer search of chemical abstracts using the chemical structure of claim as the subject matter to be searched.the generated search report listed the jacs article as answer of and identified,among other attributes,its year of publication.the search report also listed another article,authored by two of the inventors of the patent and published in,as answer of.the examiner listed the article on a notice of references cited form.however,the examiner did not place his initials next to either of the listed articles on the search report.he placed the search report in the file history.on may,the pto issued the patent.
on approximately january,pilard wrote to the european patent office and withdrew the claims previously drawn in the counterpart european patent application.he replaced those claims with a single claim similar to claims of the patent for the inventors process.
on june,pilard sent frederick calvetti,a united states patent attorney in a different law firm than the one employing mosher,a letter by fax and post about filing a reissue patent application with additional claims directed to the disclosed but unclaimed intermediates of formulas iv and v of the patent pilard letter attached a copy of the patent and the jacs article with footnote circled,although it is unclear who circled the footnote.on june,calvetti replied to pilard letter stating that the jacs article would not affect the grant of the original patent because the journal publication was filed less than one year prior to the filing of the patent application in compliance with,and that a reissue patent application could be filed 
on approximately june,calvetti wrote pilard supervisor at rpr stating that the intermediate of formula v was likely patentable,but expressed reservations about the patentability of the intermediate of formula iv because it was derived from modifying a naturally occurring compound,which may not be considered nonobvious.pilard response to calvetti attached a document that discussed the reasons he believed the intermediates were patentable and included a draft of the proposed additional claims.the relevant portion of pilard letter stated 
the protecting group at has to be stable under the acetylating conditions and to the subsequent esterifying conditions.furthermore,the elimination of the protecting groups has to be made under conditions which do not conduct to an epimerisation at the or at the even if protecting groups are known,it is difficult to select an appropriate protecting group without undue experimentation.
on november,calvetti filed the reissue patent application.in addition to all the claims in the patent,the reissue application claimed three intermediates in the prior patent.calvetti did not disclose the jacs article to the pto upon filing the reissue application.during prosecution of the reissue application,the examiner assigned to review the patent application,the same examiner who had reviewed the patent application,requested a computer search of the newly claimed intermediates.that search result identified the jacs article.calvetti,however,did not disclose the jacs article to the pto during any of his interactions or communications with the agency at this point in time.
on approximately july,pilard sent a letter to calvetti identifying prior art and references published between the filing dates of the original patent application and the reissue patent applications.with regard to the latter category,pilard identified seven documents,including the jacs article,and stated a ccording to our evaluation,these references are irrelevant.on october,calvetti interviewed with the examiner regarding the reissue application.on or around december,calvetti filed a response to an official action by the examiner,but did not submit the jacs article to the pto.
by letter dated december,calvetti filed an information disclosure statement with the pto citing and providing a copy of the jacs article,pursuant to pilard instructions.a receipt stamp of the pto on the information disclosure statement bears the date january.in february,subsequent to indicating that the reissue application would be allowed,the examiner reviewed the information disclosure statement that listed the jacs article as a reference.on june,the pto issued the patent.
in october,bristol filed suit against rpr in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking a declaratory judgment that it does not infringe the reissue patent and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable.rpr subsequently filed suit against bristol in the united states district court for the district of delaware asserting infringement.the suit was transferred and consolidated with bristol new york case.in march,the district court held a evidentiary hearing on claim construction and interpretation of the jacs article the court issued an opinion finding by clear and convincing evidence that the inventors failed to provide material information by not providing the pto with the jacs article during the prosecution of the patent and that the examiner did not review the article prior to issuing the patent.thereafter,in november,the court held a bench trial on the issue of rpr intent.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that rpr procured the and patents by inequitable conduct by intentionally withholding material information from the pto with intent to mislead and,therefore,held that the patent is unenforceable.the court also denied rpr motion for summary judgment on infringement under f and,and subsequently declared the case exceptional and awarded bristol costs and reasonable attorney fees to be determined by the court.
rpr filed a timely appeal and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

on appeal,rpr challenges the district court findings as to both materiality and intent to mislead.
we first review the district court materiality finding.materiality is not limited to prior art but embraces any information that a reasonable examiner would be substantially likely to consider important in deciding whether to allow an application to issue as a patent.gfi,at,at emphasis in original.the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that the inventors failed to provide material information by not providing the jacs article to the pto during the prosecution of the patent and that the examiner did not review the article prior to issuing the patent.
we conclude that the district court finding that the jacs article was material to the prosecution of the patent from the standpoint of a reasonable patent examiner is not clearly erroneous considering the examiner obligation to review the application for enablement under.the legal question of enablement involves an assessment of whether a patent disclosure would have enabled one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the application was filed to make and use the claimed invention without undue experimentation.hybritech monoclonal antibodies,uspq.the patents specifically recommend using the tms and mom groups in the esterification process,but the jacs article,from which the patent application stemmed,reports that the tms group was unstable in the esterification process and that the mom group could not be removed after esterification.moreover,the evidence supports the district court finding that a reasonable patent examiner reviewing the subject patent application would have expected the use of tms and mom groups to yield more than trace amounts of taxol,but that a review of the jacs article would have raised doubts that the use of tms and mom would produce taxol in more than trace amounts.the patent application emphasizes the importance of taxol and states,t his process may be used to produce taxol in good yield.however,the jacs article declares limitations with regard to the use of tms and mom in producing taxol from.footnote of the jacs article,which relates the difficulties associated with using tms,was consistent with testimony at the hearing that tms historically was known not to be very useful.in addition,bristol expert,elias corey,testified that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand footnote of the article to mean that the inventors had unsuccessfully examined mom as a possible protecting group.moreover,one of the inventors testified that using mom would result in something between a very bad yield and zero.no expert witness testified that a person of ordinary skill in the art would see the tms or mom failures reported in the article as related to just one experiment or that such a person would know that tms or mom could be made to work under other experimental conditions.in addition,there was no testimony by any of the inventors suggesting how further experimentation with tms or mom could be carried out or how a person of ordinary skill in the art would know what to do to make these protecting groups work efficiently.under the circumstances,a reasonable examiner would have wanted to know whether the unsuccessful use of mom and tms discussed in the jacs article affected the ability of a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention,which specifically taught the use of mom and tms,without undue experimentation.therefore,the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the limiting statements in the jacs article with regard to the unsuccessful use of tms and mom in producing taxol would have raised an important issue in a reasonable examiner mind as to whether the inventors had broadened the patent beyond that legally permissible based on the examiner review of the application for enablement.
in affirming the district court decision,we reject the four arguments raised by rpr on appeal challenging the finding of materiality.rpr essentially asks this court to substitute its view of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses for the district court careful and thorough fact finding.we can not provide such relief because our task as a reviewing court is not to make factual determinations in the first instance,but to review the district court factual findings for clear error.brasseler,at,at.rpr first argues that the examiner must have determined the jacs article was immaterial because he likely considered the article during the patent prosecution and still allowed the patent according to rpr,applying the statutorily mandated presumption of patent validity assumes that the examiner performed his job properly or regularly and leads to the conclusion that the examiner must have read all the references on the search report requested by him.see am.hoist derrick sowa sons,uspq,noting that imposition of presumption of validity standard is related to presumption that pto does its job properly.the examiner did not initial any of the items on the search report,which listed the jacs article as answer of,but the examiner listed answer of from the report on a form.rpr contends that the lack of the examiner initials on the computer search report is consistent with his regular practice and does not rebut the presumption of or the logical conclusion that the examiner in fact considered every listing on the search report,including the jacs article,to determine what to list on the form.
we uphold the district court finding that the examiner did not review the jacs article during the patent prosecution because the mpep and the record evidence belie rpr insistence that the lack of the examiner initials next to the listing of the article on the search report supports a finding that he reviewed the article.the mpep ed.states that an examiner should indicate which publications on a search printout were reviewed by initialing and dating the copy of the printout in the left margin adjacent to each reviewed publication.thus,had the examiner been performing his duties regularly,he would have initialed and dated answer of on the search report and the jacs article if he read it.those are not the facts presented.rather,the file history does not contain a copy of the jacs article and the examiner did not initial and date the listing of the article on the search report,a copy of which he placed in the file history moreover,the district court did not find convincing or credible the opinion of rpr expert that the examiner had reviewed the article despite the provisions of the mpep because he had the discretion to initial and date listings on the search report.see refac int l,lotus dev,stating that the district court is best suited to make credibility determinations and we accord such determinations deference.the lack of any objective evidence that the examiner reviewed the article in connection with his review of the patent application supports the court finding that the jacs article was not before the pto in its review of the patent application.see rohm haas crystal chem,uspq,concluding that a presumption that an examiner was able to find,with his expertise and adequate time,the critical data when he was presented with a mountain of largely irrelevant data ignores the real world conditions under which examiners work.
rpr next argues that materiality is lacking because it is undisputed that the examiner considered the jacs article during the reissue prosecution,but did not reject any claims because of it.in support of its argument,rpr notes this court statement in an opinion on rpr petition for a writ of mandamus in an earlier phase of this case that it is by no means clear that will ultimately prevail in making a showing of fraud sufficient to render the patents unenforceable to be sure,the fact that the jacs article was disclosed to the examiner in the reissue prosecution but did not lead the examiner to reject the application is relevant evidence favoring rpr with regard to the issue of materiality.in re rorer,table.
we conclude,however,that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the jacs article was material notwithstanding the examiner decision to issue the reissue patent after rpr disclosed the jacs article to the pto.first,rpr reliance on this court previous mandamus order is misplaced because the court was not deciding the issue of materiality favorably to rpr on the limited record then before it.indeed,this court also recognized that the district court had made explicit findings adverse to rpr on the issues of materiality and this court was not persuaded that those findings were clearly wrong.id.second,although the examiner allowance of the reissue patent after considering the jacs article is probative evidence,that does not end the materiality inquiry.molins,at,at stating that the result of a pto proceeding that assesses patentability in light of information not originally disclosed can be of strong probative value in determining whether the undisclosed information was material.this court has articulated the materiality criterion as follows 
t he standard to be applied in determining whether a reference is material is not whether the particular examiner of the application at issue considered the reference to be important rather,it is that of a reasonable examiner.nor is a reference immaterial simply because the claims are eventually deemed by an examiner to be patentable thereover.
at citation omitted perseptive biosystems,pharmacia biotech,stating that a patent may be valid and yet be rendered unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.indeed,in molins,the court affirmed a finding of inequitable conduct,notwithstanding that the withheld reference was later cited in a reexamination and the claims were allowed to issue.
we recognize that the withheld references were cited eventually to the pto and that the examiner initialed them and passed the reexamination application to issue thereafter.however,the references were not cited when they should have been.
rpr further contends that the record contains other evidence that weighs against a finding of materiality.specifically,rpr relies on pilard characterization of the article in as irrelevant,and calvetti statement in that the article did not affect the patent.rpr further argues that the inventors understood that tms and mom would work in their claimed process and were justified in describing tms and mom as preferred.rpr contends that the jacs article reports results under specially developed reaction conditions,which are not required by the patent claims,and further notes that the article footnotes do not state that tms and mom would never work.according to rpr,the inventors understood,and a person of ordinary skill in the art reviewing the subject patent would have understood,that under conditions other than those in the jacs article,tms and mom would work.in support,rpr notes that in a footnote of the district court opinion the court stated,t he inventors may have had a basis to think that mom could be used to produce taxol and that an inventor testified that tms and tes with which successful results were reported in the jacs article are very similar molecules.
having considered the evidence relied upon by rpr to support its argument that the jacs article is immaterial,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the jacs article was material for three reasons.first,the district court did not find pilard statement,that the article is irrelevant,persuasive or credible.rather,the district court found that given pilard extensive chemical engineering background,he would have known that a person of ordinary skill in the art would read the statements in the jacs article either to apply to tms and mom at any yield or,at the very least,to be unclear.specifically,the district court could not reconcile pilard knowledge that the protecting group at has to be stable to the subsequent esterifying conditions with his position that the statement in the jacs article,tms proved unstable to the subsequent esterification conditions,was not adverse.likewise,the district court was unable to reconcile pilard statement that the elimination of the protecting groups has to be made under conditions which do not conduct to an epimerisation at the with his position that the statement,a mom protecting group at the could not be removed following esterification,was not adverse.also,calvetti assessment of the article was limited to whether or not he thought the jacs article was prior art.
second,it is the explicit statements in the jacs article that made the article material to the prosecution of the subject patents,not the information that could have been included in the article.in the same footnote referred to by rpr above,the district court stated that although one of the inventors successfully deprotected mom,albeit in poor yield,from deacetyl taxol,the inventors did not claim the results in the article.rather,the article stated that the authors were unsuccessful at using tms or mom to yield taxol in anything other than poor yield.indeed,as discussed above,no expert testified that a person of ordinary skill in the art would see the tms or mom failures in the article as related to just one experiment or that such a person would know how to make tms or mom work as protecting groups under other experimental conditions.
third,materiality is determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable patent examiner,molins,at,at,and not the subjective beliefs of the patentee.to the extent that the opinion of the inventors as to how a reasonable examiner would have viewed the article sheds light on materiality,the district court did not find the testimony persuasive because it was the testimony of an interested witness and was supported by neither objective evidence nor by the testimony of any independent expert.see refac int l,at,at.the court instead found persuasive what the inventors explicitly stated in the article as compared to what was claimed in the subject patent and stated in the specification.
lastly,rpr argues that the district court holding on inequitable conduct is contradictory to its holding denying bristol motion for summary judgment for lack of enablement pursuant to.specifically,rpr contends that the district court finding that the jacs article is material to enablement because a person of ordinary skill in the art would read the article to mean that tms and mom were unsuitable to produce taxol is directly contradicted by the declaration of bristol expert,corey,that the use of tms and mom was known and obvious.
we conclude,however,that the district court holding on inequitable conduct is not contradictory to its holding on enablement.the issue of whether a reference would be considered important by a reasonable examiner in determining whether a patent application is allowable,including whether the invention is enabled,is a separate issue from whether the invention is actually enabled.corey testified that based on the explicit statements made by the inventors in the article,a person of ordinary skill in the art in reading the article,specifically footnotes and,would have concluded that tms and mom were unsuitable or unsatisfactory protecting groups to use in the described process for producing taxol.that testimony illuminates how such a person would interpret the jacs article,but does not expound upon whether the subject invention is in fact enabled.the district court denied bristol summary judgment motion for lack of enablement because it failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be required to engage in undue experimentation to practice the full scope of the claimed invention.in so doing,it relied partly on corey declaration that certain claims in the patent were obvious.as the district court later explained,it rejected bristol counsel argument that corey affidavit should be construed more narrowly in view of his earlier testimony in the trial proceedings because bristol was relying on counsel argument rather than providing an affidavit from corey to that effect.thus,to the extent an inconsistency existed,it was with regard to bristol position that the patent was obvious and its position that the patent was not enabled,not in the district court holdings on materiality and enablement.
in sum,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the jacs article was material to the prosecution of the patent.we next review the district court intent finding.
intent to mislead does not require direct evidence,and is typically inferred from the facts.gfi,at,at brasseler,at,at stating that intent may be inferred when a patent applicant knew,or should have known,that withheld information could be material to the pto consideration of the patent application merck danbury pharmacal,stating that intent is most often proven by a showing of acts the natural consequences of which are presumably intended by the actor.further,where withheld information is material and the patentee knew or should have know of that materiality,he or she can expect to have great difficulty in establishing subjective good faith sufficient to overcome an inference of intent to mislead.akron polymer container exxel container,gfi,at,at.
the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that pilard intentionally drew the patent more broadly than warranted by the information he possessed he was aware of the jacs article at the time he drafted the patent application and at the time he provided mosher materials for filing the patent he was aware of the pto duty of disclosure and his attempted justifications for not disclosing the jacs article were insufficient grounds for not supplying it to the pto examiner and were not credible these findings led the court to conclude that pilard intentionally withheld the jacs article from mosher and the pto with an intent to mislead the examiner and that this inequitable conduct was not cured during the prosecution of the reissue application.
we conclude that the district court finding that pilard intentionally withheld the jacs article in an attempt to mislead the pto in connection with the prosecution of the patent is not clearly erroneous.the evidence established that pilard prepared the french patent application based on the invention disclosure,modes operatoires,provided by the inventors,which included the information in footnotes and.the evidence also established that he read the draft jacs article and had it in his possession at the time he drafted the application.although these two documents explicitly asserted the limitations of using tms as a protecting group and mom as a protecting group,the patent application did not disclose these limitations none of the inventors testified that they recalled any communication with pilard informing him that and could be defined as any group,that was preferably mom,or that was preferably tms.moreover,at his deposition,pilard could not recall any support whatsoever for having claimed in the application that tms or mom could be used to produce taxol or for stating that they were the preferred protecting groups.pilard was responsible on behalf of rpr for providing mosher all information relevant to the filing of the patent application,and there is no dispute that he understood the pto duty of disclosure.yet,despite being aware of the information in the jacs article from which the patent application stemmed,he did not p
