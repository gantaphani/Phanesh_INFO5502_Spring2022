schwarz pharma,and schwarz pharma ag collectively,schwarz appeal from the order of the united states district court for the district of minnesota entering summary judgment of noninfringement of patent the patent in favor of paddock laboratories,paddock.because the district court did not err in its conclusion that prosecution history estoppel bars resort to the doctrine of equivalents in this case,we affirm the entry of judgment of noninfringement.
background 
paddock filed abbreviated new drug application the anda at the food and drug administration,pursuant to j section j of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,for approval to market generic tablets the paddock drug containing moexipril hydrochloride mh and magnesium oxide mgo.the anda certified,pursuant to j a vii iv,that the claims of the patent are invalid not infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the products for which approval was sought.
the patent,issued on may,is entitled stabilized compositions and relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors combined with stabilizers to prevent certain types of degradation.ace inhibitors are prescribed for the treatment of hypertension high blood pressure.without the stabilizers,the ace inhibitors may degrade through cyclization,discoloration through oxidation,and hydrolysis.the patent generally teaches use of an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate to inhibit cyclization and discoloration.the patent expired on february.
llc owns the patent,and schwarz held an exclusive license under it with respect to the ace inhibitor moexipril.mh is the hydrochloric acid salt of moexipril and the active ingredient in schwarz univasc branded drug.schwarz has alleged that paddock infringed claims,and of the patent by filing the anda.claims and are the only independent claims in the patent,and claim of the patent reads as follows 
a pharmaceutical composition which contains 
a a drug component which comprises a suitable amount of an ace inhibitor which is susceptible to cyclization,hydrolysis,and discoloration,
b a suitable amount of an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate to inhibit cyclization and discoloration,and 
c a suitable amount of a saccharide to inhibit hydrolysis.
patent emphasis added.claim of the patent reads as follows 
a process for stabilizing an ace inhibitor drug against cyclization which comprises the step of contacting the drug with 
a a suitable amount of an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate and,
b one or more saccharides.
id.at ii.emphasis added.
paddock filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on june.the district court heard oral argument on the motion on august,and issued its memorandum opinion and order granting the motion on october.schwarz stipulated at oral argument that the paddock drug did not literally infringe the patent,so the district court was only required to determine if there were genuine issues of material fact with respect to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
the district court determined as a matter of law that arguments made by the inventors and amendments to each of the independent clams in response to an obviousness rejection by the examiner during the prosecution of the application leading to the patent did not result in estoppel,but did result in estoppel.originally,the independent claims recited a metal containing stabilizer and an alkali or alkaline salt,respectively,but,following the rejection,each was amended to instead recite an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate.the court held that the change in claim language was a narrowing amendment and presumptively surrendered all metal containing stabilizers and alkali or alkaline earth metal salts except alkali and alkaline earth metal carbonates.the court also held that schwarz had failed to rebut the presumption of surrender because magnesium oxide was a foreseeable equivalent of magnesium carbonate and because there was no objectively apparent reason for the narrowing amendment not directly related to the use of magnesium oxide.the court thus concluded that the paddock drug could not infringe because schwarz was estopped from claiming that the magnesium oxide used by paddock was the equivalent of an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate.
in response to a motion to alter or amend the judgment,the district court issued a second memorandum opinion and order on november,that affirmed its prior conclusion of noninfringement and explained its reasoning in even greater detail.
schwarz timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
paddock asserts as a preliminary matter that schwarz lacks standing to bring this appeal because,the patent owner,did not appeal the district court adverse judgment.paddock argues that schwarz is merely an exclusive licensee of the patent who does not possess all substantial rights in the patent,and paddock joined in the suit in the district court as a matter of necessity.paddock further argues that the same jurisdictional rule applies on appeal and that,without,schwarz therefore lacks standing for its appeal.paddock adds that it would be inappropriate for this court to permit joinder during the appeal to cure that defect because,although was a participant in the case below and well aware of its rights,it consciously chose not to appeal.
schwarz responds that there is no need for to participate in the appeal for schwarz to have standing to appeal.schwarz notes that the requirement that an exclusive licensee join a patent owner in an infringement suit is a prudential rather than a constitutional one.schwarz argues that it continues to have constitutional standing and that the purposes of the prudential standing requirement have already been served by the joinder of in the case below.schwarz also states that if is a necessary party to the appeal,then its joinder can be ordered by this court.
although we have stated the necessity of joining a patent owner in an action for infringement brought by an exclusive licensee a number of times,propat int l rpost,intellectual prop,tci cablevision of,the particular question presented here appears to be an issue of first impression before this court.the parties have not cited and we have not located any case directly on point,and we therefore turn to the principles underlying the requirement for joining a patent owner when an exclusive licensee does not possess all substantial rights in the patent.
we conclude that,when a patentee joins an exclusive licensee in bringing a patent infringement suit in a district court,the licensee does not lose standing to appeal even though the patentee does not join in the appeal.the requirement to join the patent owner,and the ability to compel that joinder if necessary,can be traced back to independent wireless telegraph radio of america.the supreme court stated in that case 
t he owner of a patent,who grants to another the exclusive right to make,use,or vend the invention,which does not constitute a statutory assignment,holds the title to the patent in trust for such a licensee,to the extent that he must allow the use of his name as plaintiff in any action brought at the instance of the licensee in law or in equity to obtain damages for the injury to his exclusive right by an infringer,or to enjoin infringement of it.
id.at.the court also stated 
the presence of the owner of the patent as a party is indispensable,not only to give jurisdiction under the patent laws,but also in most cases to enable the alleged infringer to respond in one action to all claims of infringement for his act,and thus either to defeat all claims in the one action,or by satisfying one adverse decree to bar all subsequent actions.
id.at.this court has interpreted the independent wireless joinder requirement to be one of prudential rather than constitutional standing.propat,at.
one of the reasons for requiring joinder of the patent owner discussed by the independent wireless court was the possibility that the alleged infringer would be subject to multiple actions.there is no such danger here,as has already been joined in the infringement action,and,if not joined
