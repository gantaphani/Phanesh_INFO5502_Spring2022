the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia granted summary judgment invalidating the claims of several patents for nonstatutory double patenting.geneva,glaxosmithkline,plc,d geneva i,geneva ii d geneva iii.because the district court correctly found that these patents are invalid,this court affirms.
the invalidated patents all originated in patent application the application,now abandoned filed almost thirty years ago on april.the united states patent and trademark office pto issued a restriction requirement in the application,asking the applicants to choose from one of eight distinct inventions that the pto identified by groups of claims.this action separated the applications into two leading to patents granted in,the other to patents granted in,as shown by the table below.the record shows no terminal disclaimers in any of the patents.the appendix contains a diagram of the relationships amongst the patents and their parent applications.
glaxosmithkline,plc,smithkline beecham corporation,smithkline beecham plc,and beecham group plc collectively gsk own the and patents,which relate to the antibiotic clavulanic acid and its salts.one of these salts,potassium clavulanate,is an active component of a commercially successful antibiotic that gsk markets as augmentin.augmentin contains a second active component,the antibiotic amoxycillin.amoxycillin is the primary antibiotic in augmentin.
some bacteria produce,a compound that deactivates some antibiotics and makes them less effective against the bacteria.while potassium clavulanate has some antibiotic activity,its main function in augmentin is to inhibit.by inhibiting,potassium clavulanate prevents deactivation of amoxycillin in patients with bacteria producing.thus,amoxycillin and potassium clavulanate act synergistically against these bacteria to generate greater antibiotic activity.
the following are representative claims of the and patents 
the patent issued june,
a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating bacterial infections in humans and animals which comprises a synergistically effective amount of clavulanic acid and an antibacterially effective amount of amoxycillin,in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
the patent issued july,
a method of effecting inhibition in a human or animal in need thereof arising from a producing bacteria which comprises administering to said human or animal a inhibitory amount of clavulanic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
the patent issued,
a pharmaceutical composition for treating bacterial infections in humans and animals which comprises a synergistically effective amount of clavulanic acid,or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,and an antibacterially effective amount of a penicillin,or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof.
the patent issued,
a solid pharmaceutically acceptable salt of clavulanic acid.
the patent issued,
clavulanic acid free of penicillin n carboxylic acid and acid.
the patent issued,
purified clavulanic acid.
a inhibitor comprising purified clavulanic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
the patent issued,
a pharmaceutical composition useful for effecting inhibition in humans and animals which comprises inhibitory amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of clavulanic acid,in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
the appellees collectively geneva are generic drug makers seeking to market generic versions of augmentin.geneva applied for regulatory approval to market this compound from the food and drug administration fda.see.that application for fda approval constitutes infringement.see e.thus the generic pharmaceutical companies initiated three separate lawsuits,later consolidated into this case,seeking a declaratory judgment that the and patents are invalid.
on february,a magistrate judge limited discovery in the consolidated case to the contents of geneva abbreviated new drug applications andas.in geneva i,the district court granted gsk motion for partial summary judgment that the patent is not invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over the patent,and granted geneva motion for partial summary judgment that the patent is invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over the patent.in reaching this result,the district court found that a examiner interview interview in the application did not show that the pto issued a restriction requirement.therefore,would not shield the patent against invalidity over the patent.
in geneva ii,the district court granted geneva motion for partial summary judgment that the,and patents are invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over the patent.the district court concluded that the interview summary did not require the applicant to file separate patents for the relevant claims.because the applicant could have avoided the multiple filings,the district court applied the obviousness test.accordingly,the district court ruled that the,and patents claims are not patentably distinct from the patent claims and are thus invalid for nonstatutory double patenting.
in geneva iii,the district court ruled that the and patents are invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over patent crowley patent,and that the patent is invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over patent fleming patent.gsk owns the crowley and fleming patents because gsk has merged with the original assignees of those patents,beecham group,and glaxo laboratories.the district court heard testimony from three experts,sanders and benet for geneva,and schofield for gsk.in reaching its obviousness ruling,the district court found that geneva experts were more credible than gsk expert.
gsk timely appealed the discovery order and the three decisions to this court,which has jurisdiction under a.on appeal,gsk contends that the district court erred in geneva i and geneva ii because should shield the patents against nonstatutory double patenting over the patent.gsk contends that the district court erred in geneva iii because application of double patenting in light of the crowley and fleming patents should not render the,and patents invalid.gsk also contends that the district court abused its discretion by limiting discovery to the andas.

turning first to the district court geneva i and geneva ii decisions,this court examines the holding that the patents are invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over the patent a patent.this question,in turn,leads to an examination of the district court ruling that does not shield the patents against double patenting.
in,title precludes more than one patent on the same invention.see.accordingly,an applicant may obtain a patent for an invention.in re lonardo.section,however,only prohibits a second patent on subject matter identical to an earlier patent.id.thus,applicants can evade this statutory requirement by drafting claims that vary slightly from the earlier patent.
this court predecessor,the united states court of customs and patent appeals,recognized this problem and fashioned a doctrine of nonstatutory double patenting also known as double patenting to prevent issuance of a patent on claims that are nearly identical to claims in an earlier patent.this doctrine prevents an applicant from extending patent protection for an invention beyond the statutory term by claiming a slight variant.see id.with nonstatutory double patenting,a terminal disclaimer may restrict the slight variation to the term of the original patent and cure the double patenting rejection.in re longi.
this case asks this court to examine whether shields the patents from double patenting rejections in light of the patent because the latter resulted from a divisional of a common parent,the application.the patent claims priority to patent application application.if the application is a divisional of the application,then would prevent the patent from erecting a nonstatutory double patenting bar against the patents.section states a patent issuing on an application with respect to which a requirement for restriction under this section has been made shall not be used as a reference either in the pto or in the courts against a divisional application or against the original application or any patent issued on either of them.thus,if the patents and the patent trace their lineage back to a common parent which was subject to a restriction requirement,then intervenes to prevent a nonstatutory double patenting rejection.
during reexamination proceedings for the,and patents over the patent,the pto detected a common ancestry and a restriction requirement.the pto concluded that shielded the,and patents.the district court examined the record and disagreed,finding no restriction requirement that enables to act as a shield against the patent.
in this case,gsk faces two hurdles to reach protection.first,the original application the parent to the patents and the patent did not contain the method of use claims that later appeared in the patent.second,the examiner did not issue a formal restriction requirement relating to the claims at issue in any document in the record.
when the pto requires an applicant to withdraw claims to a patentably distinct invention a restriction requirement,shields those withdrawn claims in a later divisional application against rejection over a patent that issues from the original application.the pto manual of patent examining procedure warns examiners to apply restriction requirements carefully to avoid issuing two patents to the same,patentably indistinct invention 
since requirements for restriction under are discretionary with the commissioner,it becomes very important that the practice under this section be carefully administered.notwithstanding the fact that this section of the statute apparently protects the applicant against the dangers that previously might have resulted from compliance with an improper requirement for restriction,it still remains important from the standpoint of the public interest that no requirements be made which might result in the issuance of two patents for the same invention.
ed.this passage recognizes that if an examiner issues a restriction requirement between patentably indistinct claims,two patents may issue and prolong patent protection beyond the statutory term on obvious variants of the same invention.this prolongation would occur because would immunize the restricted application against nonstatutory double patenting rejections.
at the outset,gsk argues that does not require that the claims later sought to be shielded must appear in an application before restriction.section indicates otherwise.the first clause states if two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in one application emphasis added.this clause notes that the restriction requirement applies to a single application that formally claims two or more distinct inventions.this indicates that the earlier application must contain formally entered claims that are restricted and removed,and that claims to the second invention reappear in a separate divisional application after the restriction.the text of does not suggest that the original application merely needs to provide some support for claims that are first entered formally in the later divisional application.
pto regulations at the time also limited restrictions to cases where the examiner enters claims to a separate invention 
subsequent presentation of claims for different invention.
if,after an office action on an application,the applicant presents claims directed to an invention distinct from and independent of the invention previously claimed,the applicant will be required to restrict the claims to the invention previously claimed if the amendment is entered,subject to reconsideration and review as provided in and.
emphasis added.section thus implies that there can be no restriction unless the claims are presented and entered.section also requires that the claims must have been pending before any restriction requirement 
requirement for restriction.
a if two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in a single application,the examiner in his action shall require the applicant in his response to that action to elect that invention to which his claim shall be restricted,this official action being called a requirement for restriction also known as a requirement for division.
b claims to the invention or inventions not elected,if not canceled,are nevertheless withdrawn from further consideration by the examiner by the election,subject however to reinstatement in the event the requirement for restriction is withdrawn or overruled.
by referring to the examiner action as an official action,the regulation instructs examiners to document restriction requirements.the regulation also plainly refers to claims that were entered in an application.unless the relevant claims have been entered or are otherwise pending,there would be no need to cancel,withdraw,or reinstate the claims.
in the application,the method of use claims were not entered.therefore,those claims could not have been subject to a restriction requirement.if the applicants sought the benefit of,the applicants should have requested entry of the claims so that the pto could issue a formal restriction requirement under.
even if claims could be restricted,the prosecution history in this case does not document a restriction requirement.the examiner issued no document referring anywhere to restriction.gsk relies on the interview summary,which states 
agreed that simple inhibition compositions are proper in this case,but that method of use claims will go in a goldberg divisional.
the interview summary does not explain why the compositions were proper and the method of use claims were not.this brief text also does not describe the subject matter of the method of use claims.
the pto issued two formal restriction requirements in the application the ultimate parent of the and patents.in april,the examiner required restriction between four groups of claims as follows 
group i claims and clavulanic acid,its salts and esters,methods of use,and compositions thereof 
group ii claims methods of preparation of clavulanic acid from bacteria 
group iii claims methods of of esters of clavulanic acid 
group iv claims methods of esterification of clavulanic acid 
in june,the applicants filed a response amending the claims.the response acknowledged a may examiner interview and noted that it was agreed at the interview to reorder the restriction requirement into eight groups.in a subsequent official action dated august,the examiner issued another restriction requirement with the identical groups that appeared in the applicants response 
group i claims,and clavulanic acid,its salts and esters,methods of use,and compositions thereof 
group ii claims microbiological preparation of clavulanic acid and esters 
group iii claims and methods of of esters of clavulanic acid 
group iv claims methods of esterification of clavulanic acid 
group v claims,and clavulanic acid esters 
group vi claim acceptable salt of clavulanic acid 
group vii claims and compositions of clavulanic acid or its salts with penicillins or cephalosporins,and methods of use thereof 
group viii claim compositions of clavulanic acid or its salts with amino cephalosporins and other antibiotics 
at oral argument,gsk counsel conceded that the interview summary does not refer to groups of claims set forth as separate inventions as required by an earlier pto restriction requirement.indeed,the record does not show that the interview summary refers to groups of claims that the examiner considered patentably distinct in the restriction requirements quoted above,or any other formally issued restriction requirement.the restriction requirements quoted above clearly set forth the subject matter and the specific claims that the pto considered patentably distinct.both restriction requirements group composition claims together with corresponding method of use claims,groups i and vii.no separate groupings correspond to the simple inhibition compositions and method of use the subjects referred to in the interview summary.gsk contends that the interview summary refers to a restriction requirement made orally at the interview.the record does not support that contention.
section shields claims against a double patenting challenge if consonance exists between the divided groups of claims and an earlier restriction requirement.symbol,opticon,consonance requires that the line of demarcation between the independent and distinct inventions that prompted the restriction requirement be maintained where that line is crossed the prohibition of the third sentence of section does not apply.quoting gerber garment,lectra.if a restriction requirement does not clearly set forth the line of demarcation,then challenged claims could not satisfy the consonance requirement.therefore restriction requirements must provide a clear demarcation between restricted subject matter to allow determination that claims in continuing applications are consonant and therefore deserving of protections.
gsk does not meet its burden to show that the record provides a clear demarcation of the allegedly restricted subject matter.in the first place,the record makes the substance of the documented interview uncertain.for example,the interview summary does not state what specific subject matter the allegedly restricted claims cover.the interview summary description refers generally to simple inhibition compositions and method of use claims.while the interview summary refers to method of use claims in the plural,gsk entered only one claim in the application.this record provides no clear line of demarcation.
the term restriction does not appear in the july,response that the applicants filed to examiner berch after the interview in the application.that response essentially parrots the interview summary 
i t was agreed that simple inhibition composition claims,new claims through,are proper in the present case but that method of use claims,that is a method of effecting inhibition in humans and animals would not be proper in the present case and therefore an appropriate set of method of use claims corresponding to new claims to will be presented in divisional application,serial.
the quoted passage does not state that the examiner required restriction between those two sets of claims.moreover,the passage does not state that any claims are patentably distinct.the passage refers to composition claims,but provides no further details about the method of use claims other than that they would correspond to claims.
as to the application,the applicants filed an amendment on april,adding a single method of use claim.the application was under examination by a different examiner examiner goldberg.in the amendment,the applicants state for the first time that the examiner berch considered the added claim separate and distinct from the claims of the application 
t he examiner in held that the instant claim was separate and patentably distinct from the compound,simple compositions and methods employing clavulanic acid and indicated that the claim should be submitted in the instant divisional application.
examiner goldberg was not at the interview and therefore could not personally corroborate that statement.the record shows no examiner response to the statement.thus,applicants uncorroborated and statement does not adequately document with sufficient clarity that the pto required restriction.
this court notes that the pto reexamined three of the patents the,and patents in light of the application and concluded that shielded the patents against the application.but in confirming the claims under reexamination,the examiner relied on flawed reasoning expressed in the corresponding notices of intent to issue reexamination certificate nirc.in each reexamination,the examiner relied on the ambiguous interview summary to substantiate the alleged restriction requirement.the reexamination examiner stated that the present series of application sic has been consistent with the patentable distinction of compounds and simple compositions thereof and their methods of use.that statement is plainly inaccurate.as explained above,the issued restriction requirements in this case grouped compounds,compositions,and methods of use together.
gsk took about a to prosecute the and patents to issue.this record does not explain that delay.in any event,the effect of that delay could potentially extend patent protection for the invention in the original application.for that reason as well,this thin and insufficient record simply does not operate to shield these patents under against double patenting rejections.section can extend the patent term for inventions that are not patentably distinct,as apparently would be the case here.given the potential windfall such patent term extension could provide to a patentee this court applies a strict test for application of.specifically,only applies to a restriction requirement that is documented by the pto in enough clarity and detail to show consonance.the restriction documentation must identify the scope of the distinct inventions that the pto has restricted,and must do so with sufficient clarity to show that a particular claim falls within the scope of the distinct inventions.in other words,requires a record that shows a discernable consonance.
this record is deficient.accordingly,does not shield the patents against the patent.without a patentable distinction,the patents are invalid for nonstatutory double patenting.thus,the district court correctly discerned that the allegedly restricted claims were not pending at the time and that the alleged restriction requirement was not sufficiently memorialized to show consonance.
in geneva iii,the district court held that the claims of the and patents are invalid for nonstatutory double patenting over the crowley patent.the table below shows claim of the crowley,and patents paragraphing added.
as this table shows,the earlier crowley claim is basically a species of the and compositions packaged in a closed container with a desiccant.overall,the and claims recite limitations that are either broader than or obvious variants of corresponding limitations in the crowley claim.the parties do not dispute that it would have been an obvious variation of the crowley claim to omit the enhanced storage stability,the closed container,the packaged,the weight ratios,and the desiccant.moreover,clavulanic acid would have been an obvious variant of crowley potassium clavulanate.amoxycillin and penicillin are generic to crowley amoxycillin trihydrate.
small differences in a few limitations prevent crowley from being a pure species of the and claims.if the crowley claims were purely a species of the broader genus claimed in the and claims,the latter would be anticipated outright.a claim can not be patentably distinct over anticipatory subject matter.eli lilly barr,see also in re goodman,an earlier species claim anticipates and therefore is not patentably distinct from a later genus claim.with the crowley claim so similar to the later claims,gsk focused its efforts to find a patentable distinction on a single limitation.
thus,to escape the problem of substantially overlapping subject matter,gsk emphasized that the possible point of patentable distinction is the and claims synergistically effective amount limitation.the corresponding limitation in crowley is mg to mg of potassium clavulanate.the district court found the term synergistically effective amount of clavulanic acid ambiguous.relying on a definition in the specification to resolve the ambiguity,the district court construed the term to mean mg to mg.the district court buttressed this conclusion with its finding that geneva two experts,sanders and benet,were more credible than gsk expert,schofield.based on t
