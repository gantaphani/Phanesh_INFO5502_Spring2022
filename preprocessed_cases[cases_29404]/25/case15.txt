this appeal arises from several pharmaceutical antitrust actions that were consolidated and transferred to the united states district court for the district of rhode island by the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.
defendant warner chilcott warner is a drug manufacturer that owns the patent covering the oral contraceptive loestrin fe loestrin.after defendant watson pharmaceuticals,watson notified warner that it would seek to introduce a generic version of loestrin,warner sued watson for patent infringement.the parties settled on conditions that watson delay entry of its generic version of loestrin and,in exchange,watson entered into favorable promotional deals with warner and received promises that warner would not introduce its own generic version of loestrin,among other things.shortly thereafter,defendant lupin pharmaceuticals,lupin announced that it would introduce a generic version of loestrin.warner brought a patent infringement suit against lupin.again,the parties settled on terms that lupin wait to introduce its generic loestrin in exchange for attorneys fees and warner agreement to enter into favorable side deals with lupin.
two putative classes of plaintiffs the direct purchaser plaintiffs dpps,a group comprised of corporate entities that purchased loestrin directly from warner,and end payor plaintiffs epps,which consist of health and welfare benefit plans that have indirectly purchased,paid for,and provided reimbursement for their members purchase of loestrin,and individuals who purchased or paid for some or all of the purchase price of loestrin subsequently brought antitrust claims that the settlement agreements were violations of of the sherman act,they contend that these agreements constitute illegal restraints on trade under ftc actavis,
d,which subjected certain patent settlement agreements between generic drug and drug manufacturers to antitrust scrutiny where they involve reverse payments.as described in more detail herein,a reverse payment typically arises where a drug manufacturer pays the generic manufacturer to delay entry of its generic equivalent,thereby protecting the brand market from generic competition.
specifically,this antitrust case queries whether,following actavis,such settlement agreements are subject to federal antitrust scrutiny where they do not involve reverse payments in pure cash form.the district court found that actavis only applied to monetary reverse payments and dismissed on the basis that the epps and dpps had alleged the existence of reverse payments only.because we disagree with the district court limited reading of actavis,we vacate and remand.we begin with the relevant statutory and legal background,which provides the framework for understanding the facts in this appeal.
regulatory background 
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat,commonly known as the hatch waxman act,stipulates the process by which pharmaceutical firms may gain approval from the food and drug administration fda to bring medications to the public marketplace.the supreme court in actavis identified four key features of the relevant framework under the hatch waxman act.
first,to market a new prescription drug,a drug manufacturer must submit a new drug application nda to the fda and undergo a laborious and expensive approval process.b see actavis.at.among other things,the nda must include the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug or which claims a method of using such drug.b.upon receiving fda approval,the brand manufacturer must publish a description of any patents associated with that drug in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations,commonly known as the orange book.see caraco pharm,novo nordisk,d.
second,the hatch waxman act promotes the availability of cheaper generic alternatives by allowing generic drug manufacturers to bypass certain aspects of the nda process.instead of filing an nda,a generic manufacturer may file a less cumbersome abbreviated new drug application anda specifying that the generic has the same active ingredients as,and is biologically equivalent to,the drug.actavis.at quoting caraco pharm.at j.but,b ecause the fda can not authorize a generic drug that would infringe a patent,the timing of an anda approval depends on the scope and duration of the patents covering the drug.caraco pharm.at.
third,the hatch waxman act establishes procedures for resolving patent disputes between brand and generic drug manufacturers.j a vii actavis.at.when seeking fda approval,the generic manufacturer must certify that it will not infringe the brand manufacturer patents.j a vii actavis.at.it can make this certification in one of four ways 
it can certify that the manufacturer has not listed any relevant patents.it can certify that any relevant patents have expired.it can request approval to market beginning when any patents expire.or,it can certify that any listed,relevant patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the drug described in the anda.
actavis.at quoting j a vii iv.
the fourth alternative,also known as the paragraph iv route,counts as patent infringement and often means provoking litigation by the brand manufacturer.id.citation omitted quoting caraco pharm,at.at.should the brand manufacturer bring a patent suit within days of the generic manufacturer making a paragraph iv certification,the fda may not approve the generic manufacturer anda for a period.j b iii actavis.at.paragraph iv litigation between generic and drug manufacturers is particularly relevant here as it has led to the settlement arrangements identified in actavis.
fourth,the hatch waxman act provides incentives for the first generic manufacturer to file an anda through the paragraph iv route the generic will receive a day period of exclusivity during which no other generic can compete with the drug.actavis.at j b iv.this exclusivity period is potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the generic manufacturer.see actavis.at that said,the generic manufacturer may still face competition from a generic version of the drug produced by the brand manufacturer,also known as an authorized generic ag,at any time,including during the exclusivity period.see teva pharm.indus.crawford,citing j b iv.
ii.actavis 
we turn to actavis,where the supreme court analyzed settlement agreements arising from paragraph iv litigation with terms requiring company b,the claimed infringer,not to produce the patented product until the patent term expires,and company a,the patentee,to pay b many millions of dollars.actavis.at.these types of settlements led to concerns that a brand manufacturer may be paying the generic manufacturer to abandon its patent challenge,thereby insulating the brand market from competition and preventing consumers from accessing a more affordable generic version of the drug.the court described this arrangement as a reverse payment,explaining that the basic question here is whether such an agreement can sometimes unreasonably diminish competition in violation of the antitrust laws.id.
the supreme court answered in the affirmative.it rejected the argument that a settlement involving reverse payments is immune from antitrust scrutiny so long as any anticompetitive effects of the settlement fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent,otherwise known as the scope of the patent test.id.at quoting ftc watson,cir the court reasoned that paragraph iv litigation does not begin with the baseline assumption that a patent is valid because t he paragraph iv litigation put s the patent validity at issue,as well as its actual preclusive scope.id.at.
the supreme court acknowledged the general legal policy in favor of settlements but determined that five sets of considerations weighed in favor of subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny.id.at.specifically,the court explained 
a reverse payment,where large and unjustified,can bring with it the risk of significant anticompetitive effects one who makes such a payment may be unable to explain and to justify it such a firm or individual may well possess market power derived from the patent a court,by examining the size of the payment,may well be able to assess its likely anticompetitive effects along with its potential justifications without litigating the validity of the patent and parties may well find ways to settle patent disputes without the use of reverse payments.
id.at.while the supreme court declined to adopt the federal trade commission ftc suggestion that reverse payments be considered presumptively unlawful,it determined that the potential anticompetitive effects of a reverse payment are subject to the rule of reason test.the rule of reason is a means of evaluating a restraint on trade and determining whether under all the circumstances of the case the restrictive practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition.arizona maricopa cty.med.soc y,d.to satisfy the rule of reason test,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the alleged agreement involved the exercise of power in a relevant economic market,that this exercise had consequences,and that those detriments outweighed efficiencies or other economic benefits.stop shop supermarket blue cross blue shield of,cir accord sterling,nestl√©,cir.
nevertheless,the supreme court acknowledged that actavis left many questions unanswered as to how these cases would be litigated and le ft to the lower courts the structuring of the present antitrust litigation.actavis.at.
in reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss,we recount the facts as alleged in the operative complaint s.ruivo wells fargo bank,cir.this appeal involves two operative complaints that allege substantially the same facts,filed by the epps and dpps,respectively.
loestrin contains the active ingredients norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol,both of which the fda has approved as oral contraceptives since the.previous versions of loestrin,including loestrin and loestrin,contain tablets taken on a daily basis.the patient would then take a week of placebo pills or skip tablets for a week,depending on the version of loestrin.
studies conducted in the examined whether taking loestrin tablets for a longer duration than the day period decreased the incidence of intermenstrual bleeding,or spotting,a common of oral contraceptives.the studies yielded inconsistent results as to whether taking loestrin tablets for longer periods actually reduced intermenstrual bleeding.nevertheless,patent the patent,entitled low dose oral contraceptives with less breakthrough bleeding and sustained efficacy,was granted for a method of female contraception characterized by a reduced incidence of breakthrough bleeding by administering a combination of estrogen and progestin for consecutive days of a day cycle.
defendant currently owns the patent and,on april,submitted an nda for approval to market the dosing regimen later known as loestrin.on february,the fda approved loestrin and the patent was listed in the orange book as covering loestrin.as suggested by the patent,loestrin purports to reduce the incidence of intermenstrual bleeding by having the patient take the pills for,as opposed to,consecutive days.
watson litigation and settlement 
only several months after the fda approved loestrin,on june,defendant watson sent warner a notice letter that it had filed an anda to market a generic of loestrin.the notice letter contained a paragraph iv certification that the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of watson generic loestrin would not infringe any valid claim of the patent.predictably,warner filed suit against watson,alleging that watson generic product would infringe the patent by doing so,warner triggered the stay of fda approval of watson anda for generic loestrin.the stay was scheduled to expire in january.
in january,just before the expiration of the stay,watson and warner entered into a stipulation of dismissal and exclusion payment agreement.under the agreement,watson agreed that it would delay selling its loestrin generic until the earliest of the following i january,ii days before warner gave a third party the right to market a loestrin generic in the united states iii the date another version of a loestrin generic entered the market or iv the date on which a third party obtained a final,judicial order that the patent is invalid,unenforceable,or not infringed by the third party generic loestrin.in exchange,warner agreed to several provisions 
warner agreed not to market,supply,or license an ag version of loestrin during watson first days of marketing,otherwise known as a agreement.
warner granted watson a,fully paid,worldwide,irrevocable license to market loestrin as of january.
warner would pay watson annual fees and a percentage of net sales in connection with watson of femring,a warner hormone therapy product,beginning in.
warner gave watson the exclusive right to earn brand sales of a warner oral contraceptive in development at the time of the agreement,now known as generess fe.
warner would not grant a license to any other manufacturer to produce a generic version of loestrin until at least days after watson entered the market 
warner agreed to permit watson to enter the market before january,should another manufacturer enter the market with a generic loestrin before watson.this acceleration clause allegedly was intended to deter other generic manufacturers from entering the marketplace before watson 
lupin litigation and settlement 
six months after the announcement of warner and watson agreement,on july,defendant notified warner that it had filed an anda to market a generic version of loestrin.the notice letter contained a paragraph iv certification.as expected,in september,warner sued lupin,alleging infringement of the patent.again,by virtue of warner filing suit within days,the fda was prevented from approving the lupin anda for thirty months.
before the close of discovery,in october,warner entered into a agreement with lupin and dismissed the suit.under the agreement,lupin forfeited its challenge to the patent and agreed to delay entry of its generic loestrin until july,the month that the patent was set to expire and six months after watson was scheduled to enter the market with its loestrin generic.in exchange,warner agreed to the following provisions 
warner granted lupin a license as to femcon fe,another warner branded oral contraceptive,which allowed lupin to market an ag of femcon fe in the united states the earlier of i days after teva pharmaceutical industries,the femcon fe first filer entered the market with its femcon fe generic,or ii january.
warner gave lupin the right to purchase and sell in the united states a generic version of asacol,a branded medication for inflammatory bowel disease,to be supplied by warner,if a generic asacol was launched by another manufacturer in the united states.
warner paid lupin an undisclosed amount toward attorney fees 
iv.procedural background 
in their complaint,the dpps allege that warner and watson agreed to keep watson generic loestrin off of the market until january,in exchange for payments that warner made to watson when,absent the agreement,watson could have introduced a generic loestrin as early as.the dpps contend that this anticompetitive conduct insulated loestrin from generic competition,which would typically be priced far below the brand and eventually lead to reduced brand prices.in this way,warner and watson conduct allegedly caused antitrust harm by subjecting the dpps to artificially inflated prices.
the epps allege violations of of the sherman act as to both the warner watson and warner lupin agreements.they contend that the agreements required that warner make payments to watson and lupin in exchange for watson and lupin promise not to market their versions of generic loestrin until january,and july,respectively.in addition,the epps bring state claims for unjust enrichment and allege that the warner watson and warner lupin agreements constituted unlawful restraints of trade in violation of various state antitrust laws.
the defendants filed two motions to dismiss,one as to the dpp complaint and the other as to the epp complaint,under federal rules of civil procedure b and c.the defendants contended that actavis was limited to reverse payments in cash.nevertheless,they argued that the district court need not reach this question,as neither the dpps nor the epps had plausibly pled the existence of a large and unjustified reverse payment under the pleading standards announced in bell atl.twombly,d,and ashcroft iqbal,d.the defendants also asserted that the dpps and epps had failed to allege monopoly power in a defined antitrust market as required under the rule of reason test and that their actions were barred on statute of limitations grounds 
the district court granted the motions to dismiss in a single opinion and order on the basis that actavis was limited to reverse payments in pure cash form.in re loestrin fe antitrust,d in re loestrin.scouring the language of actavis,the district court noted that t he discussion of patent settlements in actavis fixates on the one form of consideration that was at issue in that case cash.id.at.the district court also took into account the five considerations contemplated by the supreme court in its determination that subjecting reverse payments to antitrust scrutiny outweighed the benefits of settlement.in the district court view,these considerations guide the inquiry as to whether a settlement payment satisfies the rule of reason,and require,on the part of the plaintiff,and ultimately the reviewing court or the jury,an ability to assess or calculate the true value of the payment made by the patentee to the generic competitor.id.at.whereas a court can measure the value of a cash settlement,a settlement,particularly one that is multifaceted and complex,is almost impossible to measure against these five factors.id.at.in addition,the district court noted that a cautious approach was warranted as actavis marked a dramatic departure from the approach of the courts of appeal,and an important shift in the common law.id.at.
nevertheless,the district court candidly conceded that it had significant reservations about its holding if antitrust scrutiny is limited to reverse payments in cash,pay for delay arrangements are likely to evade sherman act scrutiny so long as pharmaceutical companies take the obvious cue to structure their settlements in ways that avoid cash payments.id.at.the district court noted that the plaintiffs have asserted,in two robust complaints,facts demonstrating illegal contracts or combinations in restraint of trade undertaken by the defendants.id.however,because the district court dismissed the case on the basis that the reverse payments were not in cash form,it did not address the subsequent question of whether the individual provisions of the settlement agreements including the agreement,the acceleration clause,and the various side deals would have been adequately alleged as unlawful reverse payments were actavis to extend to payments.
the district court entered final judgment as to the dpps claim under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,noting that their case was immediately appealable as their complaint has been dismissed in its entirety.the district court entered final judgment as to the epps federal antitrust claims under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and stayed their remaining claims.the dpps and epps timely appealed the district court decision,and the parties now dispute whether the district court erred in determining that actavis was limited to cash and,if so,whether the plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the agreements,acceleration clause,and side deals constituted unlawful reverse payments.

actavis and non cash payments 
as the district court addressed only the question of whether actavis reached reverse payments,today we choose to limit ourselves to that query as well.for the reasons discussed herein,we conclude that the district court erred in determining that reverse payments do not fall under actavis scope.
the district court reasoned that the reverse payments alleged in actavis involved only cash payments,but that is not so in actavis,it was alleged that the reverse payments involved side deals in which the generic manufacturers agreed to promote the brand name drug at issue in exchange for dollar payments from the brand manufacturer.at watson,at describing the terms of the settlement agreements.this fact alone demonstrates that the supreme court recognized that a disguised deal,in which a brand manufacturer effectively overpays a generic manufacturer for services rendered,may qualify as a reverse payment subject to antitrust scrutiny and militates against limiting the supreme court decision to pure cash payments.
the district court also analyzed the language of actavis,noting that the supreme court was fixated on cash.but the district court overstates its case.indeed,the court in actavis explained that,in substance,the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants many millions of dollars to stay out of its market.at emphasis added.this language acknowledges that antitrust scrutiny attaches not only to pure cash reverse payments,but to other forms of reverse payment that induce the generic to abandon a patent challenge,which unreasonably eliminates competition at the expense of consumers.moreover,this approach is consistent with antitrust law,which has consistently prioritized substance over form.see,am.needle,football league,d w e seek the central substance of the situation and therefore we are moved by the identity of the persons who act,rather than the label of their hats.quoting united states sealy,d copperweld indep.tube,d the sherman act is aimed at substance rather than form.podiatrist ass la cruz azul de,cir describing the antitrust inquiry as a functional one.as the district court itself acknowledged,a narrow construction of actavis will give drug manufacturers carte blanche to negotiate anticompetitive settlements so long as they involve reverse payments 
many observers welcomed actavis as a necessary step in confronting the scourge of pay for delay agreements that they contend benefit the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of consumers.but,ultimately,actavis can only serve as the solution to anticompetitive pay for delay arrangements insofar as it encompasses both cash and these increasingly prevalent settlements.of course,it is of relatively little import whether a payment for delay is made in the form of cash or some other form of consideration.

true,actavis does contain references to money.see actavis.at describing reverse payment settlements as an arrangement in which a,the plaintiff,pays money to defendant b purely so b will give up the patent fight id.explaining that,in reverse payment settlements,a party walks away with money simply so it will stay away from the patentee market.but the key word used throughout the opinion is payment,which connotes a much broader category of consideration than cash alone.black law dictionary ed defining payment as the performance of an obligation by the delivery of money or some other valuable thing accepted in partial or full discharge of the obligation and the money or other valuable thing so delivered in satisfaction of an obligation emphases added.as the third circuit observed,
t he thrust of the court reasoning is not that it is problematic that money is used to effect an end to a patent challenge,but rather that the patentee leverages some part of its patent power to cause anticompetitive,elimination of the risk of competition.
king drug of florence,smithkline beecham,cir see also id.at holding,that a agreement is subject to antitrust scrutiny under the rule of reason.
nor are we the peals to have addressed this question,the overwhelming majority have declined to limit actavis to cash payments.see king drug of florence,at we do not believe actavis holding can be limited to reverse payments of cash.in re actos end payor antitrust,cv ra,wl,at,this court shares the majority view that actavis holding is not limited to payments made in cash.in re aggrenox antitrust,d,a settlement agreement may be very simple or tremendously complex,and it may involve all manner of consideration and if,when viewed holistically,it effects a large and unexplained net transfer of value from the to the alleged,it may fairly be called a settlement.united food commercial workers teikoku pharma usa,d,rejecting theory that actavis only applies to cash reverse payments as t here are many plausible methods by which plaintiffs may calculate the value of terms in re effexor xr antitrust,pgs lhg,wl,at,the common use of the term payment is described as something given to discharge a debt or obligation and does not require the payment to be in the form of money.time ins.astrazeneca ab,d,in my opinion,reverse payments deemed pursuant to actavis may take forms other than cash payments.in re lipitor antitrust,d,finding that actavis covers situations where the payment can be converted to a reliable estimate of its monetary value in re niaspan antitrust,d,holding that the term reverse payment is not limited to a cash payment in re nexium esomeprazole antitrust,d,this court does not see fit to read into the opinion a strict limitation of its principles to arrangements alone.
to be sure,the district court was correct that the language of actavis emphasizes that the value of a reverse payment is a key component in determining whether it is unlawful.in discussing how to apply the rule of reason analysis to reverse payments,the supreme court explained,the likelihood of a reverse payment bringing about anticompetitive effects depends upon its size,its scale in relation to the payor anticipated future litigation costs,its independence from other services for which it might represent payment,and the lack of any other convincing justification.actavis.at.such language emphasizes that the size of the reverse payment,particularly as it relates to potential litigation expenses,is central to the antitrust query and requires that the reviewing court or factfinder assess the value of the payment.
similarly,as the district court noted,the five considerations set forth by the supreme require that the court or factfinder measure the payment size.the supreme court stated that a reverse payment may be justified where it reflects traditional settlement considerations,such as avoided litigation costs or fair value for services.id.at.and,for the market power inquiry,the court explained that the size of the payment from a branded drug manufacturer to a prospective generic is itself a strong indicator of power.id.internal quotation marks omitted.again,both statements assume that the value of the reverse payment is ascertainable.
on this basis,the district court determined that it was almost impossible to measure settlements such as those that these considerations were proffered only as justifications for why subjecting reverse payments to antitrust scrutiny outweigh the public policy in favor of settlements.we agree with the dpps that the five considerations should not overhaul the rule of reason,nor should they create a new framework in antitrust cases.
we note,however,that there is overlap between the five considerations and the preexisting elements of the rule of reason.for example,the first circuit rule of reason analysis queries,among other things,whether the agreement involved the exercise of power in a relevant economic market.stop shop supermarket,at.in that same vein,actavis explains how to evaluate the market power question the size of the payment from a branded drug manufacturer to a prospective generic is itself a strong indicator of power.actavis.at internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,the first circuit rule of reason includes as an element the anticompetitive consequences of the alleged agreement,and the first of the five considerations articulated by the supreme court explains that a reverse payment may have significant anticompetitive effects where it amounts to a purchase by the patentee of the exclusive right to sell its product.id.at.at issue here.in re loestrin,d at.although the value of reverse payments may be much more difficult to compute than that of their cash counterparts,antitrust litigation often requires an elaborate inquiry into the reasonableness of a challenged business practice and,as a result,is extensive and complex.maricopa cty.med.soc y,at.in other words,antitrust litigation already requires courts to make intricate and complex judgments about market practices.
we agree with those courts that,rather than rejecting wholesale actavis applicability to payments,have required that the plaintiffs plead information sufficient to estimate the value of the term,at least to the extent of determining whether it is large and unjustified.in re actos end payor antitrust,wl,at.consistent with twombly,which declined to require heightened fact pleading of specifics,twombly,at,we do not require that the plaintiffs provide precise figures and calculations at the pleading stage,in re actos end payor antitrust,wl,at.requiring such a high burden would impose a nearly insurmountable bar for plaintiffs at the pleading stage because very precise and particularized estimates of fair value and anticipated litigation costs may require evidence in the exclusive possession of the defendants,as well as expert analysis.in re aggrenox antitrust,d at.nevertheless,the plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to support the legal conclusion that the settlement at issue involves a large and unjustified reverse payment under actavis.see in re niaspan antitrust,d at describing twombly applicability to the actavis inquiry.
on appeal,the defendants do not strenuously argue that actavis should be limited to cash payments,instead focusing their briefing on whether the plaintiffs adequately pled that the provisions at issue in the warner watson and warner lupin settlement agreements are unlawful reverse payments under actavis.as the district court did not address these issues,we remand for the district court to evaluate these remaining questions in the first instance.the supreme court acknowledged that actavis had opened the door to a new landscape of litigation and le ft to the lower courts the structuring of the present antitrust litigation.actavis.at.at this juncture,we feel that the most prudent course is to proceed one step at a time,and we therefore leave for another day the question of whether the epps and dpps adequately alleged that the individual provisions of the settlement agreements warranted antitrust scrutiny as unlawful reverse payments.
vi.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.no costs are awarded.
