background 
this litigation arose from mylan and impax filings of andas for,oxybutynin formulations.oxybutynin is a drug used to treat urinary incontinence.dosing provides the usual benefits of convenience,and in addition,possibly reduced absorption of a metabolite that leads to.claim of the patent is representative.
a oxybutynin formulation for oral administration to a patient in need of treatment for urge incontinence comprising a therapeutic dose of an oxybutynin selected from the group consisting of oxybutynin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt that delivers from to mg in to hours,from mg to mg in to hours,from to mg in to hours,and mg to mg in to hours for treating urge incontinence in the patient.
ll.emphasis added.
the district court construed the patent claims in its markman order,reported at alza mylan,d alza i.the court construed the word deliver to refer to the rate of in vivo release in the gastrointestinal gi tract.see id.at.
alza did not present direct evidence that mylan anda formulation released drug in the gi tract at the rates claimed by the patent.however,it did offer two other types of evidence the rate at which the generic product released oxybutynin in an in vitro dissolution apparatus,and the rate at which the anda product resulted in the accumulation of oxybutynin in the bloodstream.
the district court found that alza had failed to meet its burden of proof on infringement.the district court also found the asserted claims of the patent to be invalid as both anticipated and obvious in light of the prior art.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the invalidity holding on obviousness grounds,and consequently,we do not need to reach alza arguments regarding anticipation.we also affirm the holding of noninfringement.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
infringement is a question of fact that,after a bench trial,we review for clear error.see,ferguson controls,div.of dover,mega,llc.under the clear error standard,a reversal is permitted only when this court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court was in error.medichem,rolabo.
as for obviousness,a claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.a in re kahn,citing graham john deere,d.obviousness is a question of law,reviewed de novo,based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear error following a bench trial.ruiz chance.these underlying factual inquiries includ e the scope and content of the prior art the level of ordinary skill in the prior art the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art and objective evidence of nonobviousness.in re dembiczak.similarly,t he presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact,in re gartside,accord winner int l royalty wang,as is the presence or absence of a reasonable expectation of success from making such a combination,medichem,rolabo.because a patent retains its statutory presumption of validity,see,the movant retains the burden to show the invalidity of the claims by clear and convincing evidence as to underlying facts.mcginley franklin sports,internal quotations omitted.
in graham,the court held that that the obviousness analysis begins with several basic factual inquiries the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.at.after ascertaining these facts,the court held that the obviousness vel non of the invention is then determined against th e background of the graham factors.id.at.emphasis added.clearly,the court recognized the importance of guarding against hindsight,as is evident in its discussion of the role of secondary considerations as serv ing to guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue.id.at.
the court of appeals for the federal circuit and its predecessor motivation to combine requirement likewise prevents statutorily proscribed hindsight reasoning when determining the obviousness of an invention.kahn,at t he requirement protects against the entry of hindsight into the obviousness analysis.in re fridolph,i n considering more than one reference,the question always is does such art suggest doing the thing the inventor did.according to the test,a court must ask whether a person of ordinary skill in the art,possessed with the understandings and knowledge reflected in the prior art,and motivated by the general problem facing the inventor,would have been led to make the combination recited in the claims.kahn,at citing cross med,medtronic sofamor danek.
this requirement has been developed consistent with the supreme court obviousness jurisprudence as expressed in graham and the text of the obviousness statute that directs us to conduct the obviousness inquiry at the time the invention was made.as we explained in kahn,
the test picks up where the analogous art test leaves off and informs the graham analysis.to reach a driven conclusion as to whether a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have viewed the subject matter as a whole to have been obvious in view of multiple references,the board must provide some rationale,articulation,or reasoned basis to explain why the conclusion of obviousness is correct.the requirement of such an explanation is consistent with governing obviousness law 
at.we further explained that the motivation to combine requirement e ntails consideration of both the scope and content of the prior art and level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art aspects of the graham test.id.at.
at its core,our jurisprudence is a test that rests on the unremarkable premise that legal determinations of obviousness,as with such determinations generally,should be based on evidence rather than on mere speculation or conjecture.our court analysis in kahn bears repeating 
a suggestion,teaching,or motivation to combine the relevant prior art teachings does not have to be found explicitly in the prior art,as the teaching,motivation,or suggestion may be implicit from the prior art as a whole,rather than expressly stated in the references the test for an implicit showing is what the combined teachings,knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art,and the nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.however,rejections on obviousness grounds can not be sustained by mere conclusory statements instead,there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.this requirement is as much rooted in the administrative procedure act for our review of board determinations,which ensures due process and decisionmaking,as it is in.
at quoting in re kotzab,citations omitted emphases added.there is flexibility in our obviousness jurisprudence because a motivation may be found implicitly in the prior art.we do not have a rigid test that requires an actual teaching to combine before concluding that one of ordinary skill in the art would know to combine references.this approach,moreover,does not exist merely in theory but in practice,as well.our recent decisions in kahn and in cross medical products amply illustrate the current state of this court views.see kahn,at affirming the pto obviousness finding,explaining that a motivation to combine may be found in implicit factors,such as the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art,and what the nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art cross med,at reversing a district court ruling of nonobviousness and explaining that the motivation to combine need not be found in prior art references,but equally can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art such as knowledge of a problem to be solved.
in conclusion,our approach has permitted us to continue to address an issue of law not readily amenable to rules,as we recall and are guided by the wisdom of the supreme court in striving for a practical test of patentability.graham,at.
description of the technology 
the patent at issue is directed generally to an extended release form of oxybutynin.because the subject matter of the patent falls roughly under the rubric of pharmacology,we give a brief orientation to the field,based upon the record.in general,when a drug is swallowed,it is dissolved in the gastrointestinal gi tract absorbed from the gi tract into the bloodstream distributed from the blood into body tissues and metabolized and eliminated from the bloodstream.the gi tract includes the stomach,small intestine and the colon,and orally administered drugs pass through these portions of the gi tract in turn.drugs may be administered in different dosage forms which may include not only the drug itself but also ingredients intended to modulate the rate of release of the drug from the dosage form.
dosage forms may be described as,such as where the drug is quickly released in the stomach,or as,where the drug is slowly released as the formulation traverses the gi tract.the rate of absorption of a drug from the gi tract into the bloodstream may change as it passes through the gi tract.the rate of absorption for a dissolved drug in a given portion of the gi tract also varies from drug to drug.
after roughly hours a typical dosage form will reach the colon.if,hypothetically,a particular drug is simply not absorbed from the colon into the bloodstream,then it may make little sense to develop an dosage form that is capable of withholding the release of some fraction of that drug until it reaches the colon.in other words,under these hypothetical conditions,there may be little motivation to design an oral dosage form capable of releasing drug more slowly than over an approximately hour time course,because such drug would be released in the colon,where it is hypothetically not absorbed.
the patent claims an extended release oxybutynin formulation.alza argues that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have believed that oxybutynin could be absorbed in the colon.absent such absorption,alza contends that one of ordinary skill in the art lacked the motivation to make the claimed extended release formulation,and that the district court therefore erred in holding that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious over the prior art.for the reasons set forth below,alza arguments fail.
invalidity 
the district court based its invalidity holding both on anticipation and obviousness grounds.because we affirm its holding based on obviousness,we do not need to address the parties anticipation arguments.
in finding the asserted claims of the patent to be obvious,the district court considered,inter alia,the following prior art patent the baichwal patent the wong patent and the morella patent.
the morella patent discloses a pharmaceutical composition including an active ingredient of high solubility in water according to the specification,highly soluble drugs had posed special challenges for the development of sustained release forms,which the inventors had set out to solve.is defined as release of the active ingredient at a rate that maintains therapeutic,blood levels over an extended period of time to hours or greater.highly water soluble drugs were considered to be those having an aqueous solubility of at least roughly part in.the commercially available hydrochloride salt of oxybutynin is freely soluble at neutral the patent uses morphine as an example of an active ingredient that can be used in its compositions.figure demonstrates that one such composition is capable of dispensing morphine at what appears to be an approximately steady rate over the course of hours.claim of the patent claims genitourinary smooth muscle relaxants as one of several types of active ingredients to use in the dosage form identified in claim.the specification also identifies oxybutynin as a highly water soluble genitourinary smooth muscle relaxant.morella also teaches that the dissolution rate of the soluble drug at various ph can be modified at will.
the baichwal patent teaches a hour extended release oxybutynin formulation.these formulations use an polymer matrix similar to mylan accused product.it also teaches methods of modifying the dosage forms to slow the release rates.during prosecution of the patent,the inventor overcame an anticipation rejection by arguing that his invention had a release rate slower than those of the dissolution data presented in baichwal the examiner agreed and withdrew his rejection.
the wong patent teaches a bilayer osmotic pump dosage form the oros system used in the preferred embodiment of the patent.wong teaches that this system can be used to deliver any drug over a hour period,and figure of the patent discloses release rates falling within the claimed release rates of the patent.the wong patent does not specifically teach using oxybutynin with the claimed release technology,but it does teach using several categories of drugs of which oxybutynin is a member,such as,analgesis,muscle relaxants and urinary tract drugs.
in analyzing the obviousness issue,the district court first identified the level of ordinary skill in the art,finding the person of ordinary skill to have either an advanced degree in pharmacy,biology,chemistry or chemical engineering and at least two years of experience with technology or a bachelor degree in one or more of those fields plus five years of experience with such technology.second,the court examined whether there was a motivation in the prior art or elsewhere that would have led one of the ordinary skill in the art to combine references,alza ii,d at citing ruiz,at internal quotations omitted,and with a reasonable expectation of success,id.citing in re.third,the district court examined secondary considerations of nonobviousness.after making these factual determinations,it concluded that mylan had established a strong prima facie case of obviousness,which alza had failed to rebut through secondary considerations.the court concluded that mylan had demonstrated alza patent to be invalid for obviousness by clear and convincing evidence we agree.
while we have carefully considered all of the parties arguments,we discuss principally the dispute over satisfaction of one predicate to a finding of obviousness that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a motivation to combine the prior art to achieve the claimed invention and that she would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.as an initial matter,we agree with the district court that on a purely mechanical level,a person of ordinary skill in the art would have a reasonable expectation of success of manufacturing a hour oxybutynin formulation once motivated to use oxybutynin.id.at.for example,wong teaches a rate adjustable extended release dosing technology and release rates falling within the claimed parameters.baichwal and wong likewise teach ways of achieving slow rates of release,with baichwal actually teaching oxybutynin,although arguably not as slowly as is claimed in the patent 
indeed,alza principal argument is that no one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to adapt the morella,baichwal and wong technology to oxybutynin in the first place,because a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to expect that such an extended release oxybutynin f
