savient makes oxandrin,a drug used to treat weight loss.in the department restricted it to use in females,because of cheaper drugs for treatment of wasting in males.we refer to this as a delisting,although oxandrin remains listed for some uses.
savient filed a petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief to invalidate the delisting and to nullify the department contract with ramsell.the trial court rejected all of savient claims and savient timely appealed.
although we reject most of savient claims,we agree that the adap formulary is a regulation subject to the administrative procedures act,et,apa.accordingly,we reverse with directions.
factual and procedural background 
savient amended petition sought to undo oxandrin delisting and compel the adoption of regulations governing the formulary.savient sought refund of all rebates collected under the program and an order to set aside any contracts delegating any portion of the administration of the program.savient sought a declaration of the lawfulness of the department actions in administering the formulary and in contracting with ramsell.savient raised numerous theories,miscaptioned as purported causes of action.
the answers of the department and ramsell questioned savient standing and defended the program.
the department answer tendered the declaration of celia,a health program specialist i whose duties include primary liaison to the adap medical advisory committee mac and managing the formulary.because savient did not tender contrary facts,we accept as true the facts stated in her declaration.
the adap aids drug assistance program was created in and is separate from,with different eligibility criteria and benefits,including distinct drug formularies.funding comes from the state general fund,the federal ryan white care act and rebates paid by drug manufacturers,as required by section d.except for a few statutory mandates such as to provide antiretroviral drugs,there is no other state or federal requirement for specified drugs or classes of drugs to be provided on the adap formulary.on the other hand,must cover all drugs.
the mac evaluates aids drugs and recommends changes to the formulary,including any restrictions or medical access criteria these recommendations,combined with a departmental fiscal analysis,inform the department director when she or he makes changes to the formulary.because california adap is not an entitlement program,it must provide drugs within an existing budget and assure sufficient funds are available before adding any new drug to the formulary.therefore,given this budgetary criteria,a drug may be recommended by the mac yet never make it on the formulary due to cost constraints or because other drugs have a higher medical priority,antiretrovirals.there are currently drugs on the adap formulary and over adap clients who access these drugs annually.
oxandrin was added to the formulary in,restricted to use by women and persons with liver disease,due to the high cost of the drug and the availability of other,less expensive anabolic steroids for treatment of wasting in males.in the program budget increased and the restrictions were removed.by,due to increased client demand,a projected funding shortfall,and the recent availability of a new but very high cost antiretroviral drug,the mac recommended reinstating the restrictions,which was done.the decision was made based on the mac recommendation and the fiscal analysis by the department.the department contractor,ramsell corporation did not have any involvement in the analysis or leading to the restriction of the drug.furthermore,ramsell corporation exercises no discretion concerning what drugs are on the adap formulary,the criteria for determining eligibility of adap recipients,pricing of drugs or any aspect of the rebate program between the department and the drug manufacturers.
after a hearing the trial court denied relief on all legal theories.savient timely appealed from the ensuing judgment.
the principal statute 
section provides in part as follows 
a to the extent that state and federal funds are appropriated in the annual budget act for these purposes,the director shall establish and may administer a program to provide drug treatments to persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv,the etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids 
the director shall develop,maintain,and update as necessary a list of drugs to be provided under this program.
b the director may grant funds to a county public health department through standard agreements to administer this program in that county 
c the director shall establish a rate structure for reimbursement for the cost of each drug included in the program.rates shall not be less than the actual cost of the drug.however,the director may purchase a listed drug directly from the manufacturer and negotiate the most favorable bulk price for that drug.
d manufacturers of the drugs on the list shall pay the department a rebate equal to the rebate that would be applicable to the drug under the federal social security act plus an additional rebate to be negotiated by each manufacturer with the department,with exceptions.
e the department shall submit an invoice,not less than two times per year,to each manufacturer for the amount of the rebate required by subdivision d.
f drugs may be removed from the list for failure to pay the rebate required by subdivision d,unless the department determines that removal of the drug from the list would cause substantial medical hardship to beneficiaries.
g the department may adopt emergency regulations to implement amendments to this chapter made during the regular session,in accordance with the administrative procedure act,chapter commencing with section of part of division of title of the government code.the initial adoption of emergency regulations shall be deemed to be an emergency and considered by the office of administrative law as necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,health and safety,or general welfare.emergency regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall remain in effect for no more than days.
h reimbursement under this chapter shall not be made for any drugs that are available to the recipient under any other private,state,or federal programs,or under any other contractual or legal entitlements,except that the director may authorize an exemption from this subdivision where exemption would represent a cost savings to the state.
i the department may also subsidize certain requirements for persons otherwise eligible for the aids drug assistance program adap with existing drug coverage 
discussion 
failure to issue a declaration of rights 
savient first complains that the trial court failed to declare the rights of the parties.a plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of rights,even if the declaration is that the plaintiff has no rights as asserted in the complaint.western aggregates,county of yuba th,d.however,an appellate opinion memorializes the rights of the parties and savient procedural point,of itself,provides no basis for reversal.see haley county flood control dist.d.
ii.delegation of authority to ramsell 
savient asserts the department improperly delegated management to ramsell.the department asserts savient lacks standing to make this claim.
savient asserts that the trial court ruling on demurrer,finding it had stated some good causes of action,either precludes the department from challenging standing or means that the department had to file a.first,the respondent has the right to defend a favorable judgment without filing a.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.second,savient failure to cite authority forfeits the contention that standing can not now be considered.people gidney cal d,gidney.accordingly,we reach the standing question.
s tanding to seek a writ of mandate ordinarily requires that a party be beneficially interested code civ,have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citation.this standard,we have stated,is equivalent to the federal injury in fact test,which requires a party to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is both a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent people ex rel.of conservation el dorado county cal th,d.
the evidence shows that the department delisted oxandrin.nothing done by virtue of the ramsell contract hurt savient.because the contract did not specially aggrieve savient,it lacks standing to attack the contract.see sacramento county fire protection dist.sacramento county assessment appeals bd.th,d scfpd.savient does not claim that any exception to this general rule applies,the public interest exception or taxpayer standing,california state employees williams d.williams and has therefore forfeited any such claim.gidney,supra,cal d at,in re marriage of nichols th,fn,d.in any event,t here is no pressing need for savient to have standing here.this is not a situation where the issue raised will be removed from judicial review if standing is denied.scfpd,supra,th at,d.however,we will briefly address and reject savient claims on the merits.
statutory authorization 
savient asserts,the l egislature did not authorize respondents to contract adap civil service jobs to private contractors.apart from the civil service question we will discuss in a moment,we reject savient claim that the department lacked legislative authority to contract with ramsell.
section provides that certain conditions would apply in the event the department utilizes a contractor or subcontractor to administer any aspect of the program provided for under this chapter.thus,the legislature expressly contemplated that the department might elect to contract with an outside entity to administer some aspects of the program,specifically obtain and dispense the necessary drugs,in their approved forms according to the program formulary,process changes to the formulary within business days,verify prompt delivery of drugs to clients and so forth,subds.a k.
savient points to a different statutory provision which allows the department to grant funds to a county public health department through standard agreements to administer this program in that county,subd.b.savient asserts that this provision precludes the department from contracting with a private entity.we disagree.that provision authorizes the transfer of state funds to a county,under specified conditions.section contemplates administration of the program by a contractor,a private entity.we see no overlap or conflict between these two provisions.
civil service mandate 
savient claims the department violated the civil service mandate,art.vii by allowing ramsell to undertake work which savient asserts should be done by public employees.we disagree.
the relevant provisions of the california constitution do not explicitly prohibit contracting out,but do so by implication.california state employees state of california d.however,there are exceptions,as explained in professional engineers department of transportation cal th,at pages,d,
because of the largely implicit nature of the private contracting restriction,we must discern its scope from judicial decisions applying it in particular cases.early appellate decisions held that the civil service mandate forbids private contracting,whether for permanent or temporary services,skilled or unskilled,if those services are of a kind that persons selected through civil service could perform adequately and competently.citations.
later cases have affirmed the nature of the services restriction but have also indicated that the restriction is inapplicable if the state seeks to contract for private assistance to perform new functions not previously undertaken by the state or covered by an existing department or agency.citations.as williams,supra,d.observed,if the services can not be adequately rendered by an existing agency of the public entity or if they do not duplicate functions of an existing agency,the contract is permissible.citation.according to williams,the civil service mandate is aimed at protecting the existing civil service structure,and does not compel the state to fulfill every new state function through its own agency.original italics.
savient acknowledges that the civil service mandate does not cover new state functions,but argues that because the department managed the program from until,the program thereby became an historic state function.we disagree.savient has not provided any evidence that the provision of drugs is an historic state function,and the mere fact that the state performed such function for a few years,as savient states in its brief,does not make it an historic state function.
the key in such cases is whether a contract displaces the civil service.see department of transportation chavez th,d chavez williams,supra,d at.savient offers no evidence that the contract here had such effect.
indeed,the legislature has provided a mechanism to police encroachments on the civil service,subd.b,see chavez,supra,th at,d.apparently,nobody litigated the question now at issue and,as just stated,if there is any evidence that civil servants were displaced by the contract,savient failed to adduce it in this proceeding.
scope of delegation 
savient complains that the department delegated too much authority to ramsell.we disagree.
savient agrees that ministerial or administrative functions may be delegated.see sacramento chamber of commerce stephens cal.
ramsell is required by statute to administer grievance procedures,subd.k and the evidence shows ramsell exercises no discretion concerning what drugs are on adap formulary,the criteria for determining eligibility of adap recipients,pricing of drugs or any aspect of the rebate program between the department and the drug manufacturers.therefore,we reject savient factually bereft claims that improper delegation occurred.
iii.the formulary is a regulation 
a critical purpose of the apa is 
to establish basic minimum procedural requirements for the adoption,amendment,or repeal of administrative regulations.except as provided in section,the provisions of this chapter are applicable to the exercise of any power conferred by any statute heretofore or hereafter enacted,but nothing in this chapter repeals or diminishes additional requirements imposed by any statute.this chapter shall not be superseded or modified by any subsequent legislation except to the extent that the legislation shall do so expressly,subd.a.
under the apa a regulation is every rule,regulation,order,or standard of general application or the amendment,supplement,or revision of any rule,regulation,order,or standard adop
