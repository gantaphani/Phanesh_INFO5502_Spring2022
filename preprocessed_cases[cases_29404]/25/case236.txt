this case arises out of a complex set of contractual relationships between the wisconsin alumni research foundation,the entity for the university of wisconsin certain research scientists at the university and xenon pharmaceuticals,a canadian drug company.the foundation and xenon jointly own the patent rights to an enzyme that can lower cholesterol levels in the human body.the enzyme benefits were discovered and confirmed by scientists at the university whose research was sponsored in part by xenon.in,pursuant to an option agreement between the foundation and xenon,the foundation gave xenon an exclusive license to commercialize this discovery and market any resulting products in exchange for a share of the profits.
the foundation brought this suit against xenon alleging violations of its contract rights and seeking damages and declaratory relief.first,the foundation alleged that xenon sublicensed its interest in the patented enzyme to a third party but refused to pay the foundation a percentage of the sublicense fees as required under the license agreement.second,the foundation alleged that xenon wrongly asserted ownership over a set of therapeutic compounds developed from the jointly patented enzyme the foundation claimed that it owned rights to these compounds pursuant to its network of written agreements with xenon and the university researcher who confirmed the therapeutic benefits of the compounds.xenon counterclaimed against the foundation,and on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in the foundation favor on the claim and in xenon favor on the dispute over ownership of the compounds.a jury awarded million in damages for the breach of contract the foundation accepted after xenon successfully moved for remittitur.both parties appealed.
we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.the district court properly granted summary judgment for the foundation on the claim.xenon breached its license agreement with the foundation by granting a sublicense in the jointly patented enzyme to a third party without paying the foundation its share of the sublicense fees.a subsidiary issue is whether xenon breach triggered the foundation right to terminate the agreement.we conclude that the district court should not have voided the foundation attempt to do so the foundation was entitled to and properly terminated the agreement.we also conclude the district court erroneously entered judgment for xenon on the issue of the foundation claim to an ownership interest in the compounds.under the web of contracts at issue here,the foundation was entitled to a declaration of its ownership interest in the compounds.
background 
researchers at the university of wisconsin became interested in an enzyme called stearoyl coa desaturase scd because of its potential to help treat diabetes,obesity,and other diseases by lowering cholesterol.in the researchers discovered that suppressing scd levels in the human body lowered cholesterol levels.pursuant to university policy,the researchers disclosed their research results to the foundation and in january signed a memorandum agreement assigning all their rights in the discovery to the foundation.the next month,the foundation filed a provisional patent application for the discovery.
meanwhile,xenon,a canadian pharmaceutical company that was collaborating with the university on research into a separate enzyme,learned of the university discoveries and expressed interest in jointly pursuing scd research.the university and xenon entered into a series of research agreements referred to as research agreements,and in which xenon agreed to jointly sponsor various scd research projects with the university.each research agreement identified the scope of the research,the principal researcher,the expected cost,and the period of performance these agreements also referred to a separate sponsor option agreement between the foundation and xenon that governed ownership of any discoveries arising from the joint research program.the sponsor option agreement the contracts between the foundation and the individual university researchers requiring the researchers to assign to the foundation any property rights in the discoveries emanating from the research and gave xenon an exclusive option to license any resulting technology attached to the sponsor option agreement were the individual contracts between the foundation and the university researchers.
at the same time that xenon signed its first research agreement with the university,xenon also entered into a series of consulting agreements with individual researchers at the university who worked on scd projects.in exchange for consulting fees,these scientists undertook specific research projects for xenon and agreed to assign any discoveries arising from these consulting projects to xenon.
in february xenon and the foundation filed a joint patent application deriving from the provisional patent application the foundation had filed in.the application covered,among other things,the scd enzyme itself and a method called an assay of using the enzyme to identify compounds that lower scd levels.a patent issued for the assay,but the patent application covering the remaining claims is still pending.also in february,xenon exercised its option under the sponsor option agreement to an exclusive license for any discoveries arising from the scd research at the university.as a result xenon and the foundation entered into an exclusive license agreement giving xenon an exclusive right to make,use,and sell patented products under the joint patent application within the field of human healthcare.in exchange for these exclusive rights,xenon agreed to pay the foundation a percentage of any product sales,royalties,or sublicense fees it received.
after receiving the exclusive license,xenon worked with discovery partners,to help identify compounds that inhibit the scd enzyme.using the jointly patented assay,discovery partners screened thousands of compounds and identified a set of referred to as the ppa compounds with the potential to suppress scd levels.xenon shipped the ppa compounds to mark,a university researcher with whom it had a consulting agreement,for confirmatory testing.successfully confirmed the inhibitory potential of the ppa compounds and thereafter assigned any interest he had in the compounds to xenon.in xenon filed a patent application covering the ppa compounds.
the foundation objected,claiming that it had an ownership interest in the ppa compounds under the various interlocking agreements among the parties.more specifically,the foundation noted that had assigned all his rights in scd discoveries and any improvements to the foundation in his memorandum agreement.the foundation also noted that the sponsor option agreement between it and xenon specifically acknowledged that was required to assign his interest in any inventions arising from the jointly sponsored research to the foundation.alternatively,the foundation claimed it had title to the compounds under the act,et,because federal funds had been used in the research and development of the compounds.
relations between xenon and the foundation continued to deteriorate in when xenon signed a license agreement with novartis pharma ag novartis,a swiss corporation.this agreement gave novartis a license to the technology covered by the joint patent application and purported to transfer ownership of the ppa compounds.after learning of this agreement via a press release,the foundation demanded a percentage of the sublicense fees from xenon under the terms of the exclusive license agreement.xenon refused,claiming it had the right to license its undivided interest in the joint patent application without being subject to the terms of its license agreement with the foundation.
the foundation then brought this suit claiming that xenon violated the terms of the exclusive license agreement and owed the foundation a percentage of the sublicense fees it received from novartis.the foundation also claimed that it,not xenon,owned interest in the ppa compounds.the foundation sought damages and declaratory judgment.xenon responded with counterclaims against the foundation.the district court,on for summary judgment,entered a series of rulings on all issues except damages.the judge held that xenon breached the exclusive license agreement by granting a sublicense to novartis without notifying the foundation or conforming the sublicense to the terms set out in the license agreement.the judge also held that xenon owed royalties or sublicense fees to the foundation under the terms of the license agreement.the judge further held that in light of xenon breach,the foundation had a right to terminate the license agreement.
the court also ruled in xenon favor on several issues.first,the judge dismissed as moot the foundation claim that xenon breached its duty of good faith by failing to abide by the terms of the license agreement.second,the judge held that the foundation had not given xenon proper notice or an opportunity to cure before invoking its right to terminate the license agreement.third,the court denied the foundation claims to quiet title in the ppa compounds,for conversion of those same compounds,and for a declaratory judgment that purported assignment of his rights in the compounds to xenon was void.the court held that the foundation could not claim title to the compounds under either the memorandum agreement with,the sponsor option agreement with xenon,or the act.later,the court vacated its ruling regarding the foundation right to terminate the license agreement the judge agreed with xenon that the foundation had not properly developed this argument in its opening brief.
the case proceeded to a jury trial on the question of damages for xenon failure to pay royalties or sublicense fees.the jury awarded million,but on xenon motion for remittitur the court reduced the award to,which the foundation accepted.the parties from the judgment,challenging various of the district court rulings on summary judgment xenon also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on damages.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.clancy geithner,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.on review of for summary judgment,we view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party on each motion.see tate long term disability plan for salaried employees of champion int l,cir.for organization and ease of discussion,we divide the issues on appeal into two groups those that relate to the rights of the parties under the exclusive license agreement,and those that relate to the rights of the parties regarding the ppa compounds.
exclusive license agreement 
xenon transfer of rights to novartis 
we begin by addressing xenon contention that it did not violate the terms of the exclusive license agreement when it licensed its interest in the joint patent application to novartis without paying the foundation its share of the licensing fee.as a threshold matter,xenon argues that this dispute is resolved by federal patent law,not by contract law.the district court did not address the question whether xenon retained a federal statutory right to freely license its interest without regard to the foundation contract rights.the court resolved the parties disputes based solely on the terms of their various contracts,holding that xenon effectively executed a sublicense with novartis and that this transaction fell within the provision of the exclusive license agreement governing sublicenses.xenon contends that federal,it the right to freely license its undivided interest in the joint patent application without accounting to the foundation under the terms of the exclusive license agreement.we disagree.
federal law provides that joint patent owners,like the foundation and xenon,have control over the entire property,and each may freely use the patented technology without regard to the other.see.we have previously observed that under this principle of patent law,each is at the mercy of the other in that the right of each to license independently may,for all practical purposes,destroy the monopoly and so amount to an appropriation of the whole value of the patent.acf,cir quoting talbot oil ref,cir.this statutory rule is subject to an important exception,however joint patent owners may vary their rights by contract.the statute provides that i n the absence of any agreement to the contrary,each of the joint owners of a patent may make,use,offer to sell,or sell the patented invention without the consent of and without accounting to the other owners.emphasis added.the statutory default rule therefore controls unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
here,the foundation and xenon modified the statutory default rule by contract the exclusive license agreement plainly qualifies as an agreement to the contrary for purposes of.that agreement provides the foundation hereby grants to xenon an exclusive license,limited to the field of human healthcare,under the licensed patents to make,use and sell products.in exchange xenon agreed to pay the foundation a percentage of any payments,royalties,or sublicense fees it received by commercializing the technology itself or sublicensing the technology to a third party to commercialize.under the terms of the agreement,sublicenses are expressly xenon pays the foundation the specified percentage of any royalties or sublicense assignments are prohibited without the foundation prior written consent 
xenon argues that nothing in the exclusive license agreement explicitly revokes its statutory right to license its interest freely.true,but the agreement provision requiring that xenon pay the foundation a share of the fees derived from any sublicense plainly undermines xenon claim that it retained an unfettered right under to transfer its interest in the technology to third parties.so does the agreement provision prohibiting assignment of the license without the foundation consent.the exchange between the parties provided that the foundation would forego its right to separately license the patent in exchange for receiving a share of the profits from xenon commercialization of the directly or via a sublicense to a third party.xenon received a significant benefit from the exclusive right to exploit the technology protected by the joint patent application.xenon can not avoid paying royalties or sublicense fees to the foundation simply by labeling the novartis transaction a license rather than a sublicense.
accordingly,the terms of the exclusive licensing agreement,not,govern the parties rights and responsibilities here.under that agreement xenon held an exclusive license to develop the scd discovery for commercial purposes and a corresponding obligation to share proceeds with the foundation.the agreement gives xenon three options commercialize the technology directly and pay royalties to the foundation sublicense the technology to a third party and pay a percentage of the sublicense fees to the foundation or assign its exclusive licensing rights to a third party with the prior consent of the foundation.
xenon suggests in the alternative that it never actually gave novartis a license to the foundation interest in the jointly patented technology.the district court properly rejected this argument.the agreement provides that xenon grants to novartis an exclusive license to all xenon technology in the field of human and animal healthcare.xenon technology includes xenon interest in all patent rights in the field,as specifically described in schedule b,and schedule b prominently lists the joint patent application owned by xenon and the out of four listed patents.xenon argues unpersuasively that the phrase patent rights does not include rights it obtained through the exclusive license agreement.in the warranty clause of the agreement,xenon represents that it is the owner or licensee of all rights,title and interest in and to the xenon patent rights.emphasis added.accordingly,xenon granted novartis any interest it held in the joint patent application by specifically including it in schedule put another way,xenon effectively sublicensed its exclusive license rights in the jointly patented technology.the district court correctly concluded that the agreement is subject to the terms of the exclusive license agreement governing sublicenses.
sublicense fees 
after concluding that xenon granted novartis a sublicense in the jointly patented technology,the district court held that xenon violated the terms of the exclusive license agreement by failing to pay the foundation a share of the sublicense fees.xenon argues that it is not obligated to make payments to the foundation until products are actually brought to market and sold as a result of the sublicense.because no products have yet been sold,xenon claims it does not owe the foundation anything.again,we disagree.the exclusive license agreement requires xenon to pay the foundation license fees,milestones,and royalty payments as soon as they are received 
section of the exclusive license agreement,titled consideration,lays out the payment details and schedule.subsection b i of that section states for all products sold directly by xenon,xenon shall pay to the foundation a royalty calculated as a percentage of the selling price of products emphasis added.it goes on to specify that royalties are earned on either the date the product is actually sold,the date an invoice is sent,or the date the product is transferred to a third party for promotional comes first.the next provision most relevant to this 
for all products sold by xenon sublicensees,xenon shall pay to the foundation a percentage of any license fees,milestones,and royalty payments received by xenon as consideration for the sublicense granted to such sublicensees under section.the percentage shall remain fixed at a rate of ten percent for years one and two of this agreement and seven and percent thereafter until this agreement is terminated.
because both subsections begin with the phrase f or all products sold emphasis added,xenon argues that it does not owe the foundation any payments for the novartis sublicense until products are actually brought to market and sold.
we agree with the district court that section,read as a whole,requires payment of the foundation share of the sublicense fee independent of any actual sales of products.the apparent point of the prefatory phrase f or all products sold in each of the two subsections governing payment is to distinguish between payments required when xenon commercialized the technology itself and payments required when xenon issued a sublicense to a third party to do so.in the former circumstance,the payment due the foundation is a royalty based on products sold in the latter circumstance,the payment due the foundation is a specified percentage of the sublicense fee xenon receives,plus milestones and royalties.because the novartis transaction falls under the second subsection,payment is due on receipt of a sublicense fee,not on the occurrence of product sales.
this reading of the payment provision is the most plausible for several reasons.although both subsections use the same introductory phrase,the first subsection also says that payment is due upon actual product sale while the second not include similar language.instead,the second subsection states that xenon owes the foundation a percentage of any license fees and milestones,in addition to royalty payments,stemming from any sublicense.as the district court noted,sublicense fees and milestone payments are not contingent upon a sale they are paid immediately or on an ongoing basis by a licensee or sublicensee in exchange for the right to make sales of products developed in the future.finally,the parties agree that it generally takes about years to bring a drug product to market.yet the exclusive license agreement specifies that xenon must pay the foundation of any license fees,milestones,and royalty payments received during the first two years of the agreement and thereafter.this provision would make little sense if no payment was required on a sublicense until a product was brought to market.accordingly,the district court properly concluded that xenon breached the exclusive licensing agreement by failing to pay the foundation its share of the fee from the novartis transaction 
the district court entered summary judgment on liability damages were tried to a jury.xenon agreement with novartis purported to grant a license to the joint patent agreement the ppa compounds several other patent applications and xenon.novartis paid xenon million in cash and another million in stock as part of a separate stock purchase agreement signed the same day.the question for the jury was how much of this fee was payment for the sublicense and the ppa compounds as opposed to the other pieces of the package as we have noted,the exclusive license agreement stipulated that the foundation should receive of any license fees,milestones,and royalty payments received by xenon as consideration for the sublicense.emphasis added.in a special verdict,the jury awarded nothing for the sale of the ppa compounds and million for the under of the million in cash and equity xenon received from novartis.
xenon moved posttrial for remittitur,which the district court granted.the judge held that the jury had sufficient evidence to award plaintiff of the full that novartis paid in cash for defendant intellectual property.but the judge concluded there was insufficient evidence to support inclusion of a percentage of the million in stock,which the evidence suggested was part of a separately negotiated agreement.the district court offered the foundation a remittitur of of the million cash the foundation accepted.
on appeal xenon argues that the foundation did not provide sufficient evidence of damages to justify even a damages award.we review challenges de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and drawing all inferences in its favor.lopez city of chicago,cir.under wisconsin law a plaintiff must present enough evidence to provide a reasonable basis for calculating damages the evidence will be sufficient if it enables the jury to make a fair and reasonable approximation of damages.see olympia hotels johnson wax dev,cir brogan indus.cas.ins.co.
under this lenient standard,the evidence is easily sufficient to sustain the damages award.the foundation argued to the jury that the joint patent application was the only item in the package with any real value,and thus the price novartis paid reflected its fair market value.the foundation relied on a letter xenon sent to novartis offering to sell the technology covered by the joint patent application the letter made no mention of the ppa compounds or any other patented technology.the foundation also noted that the joint patent application is listed first in the novartis agreement,arguably demonstrating priority over the other listed patent applications.moreover,the foundation noted that xenon transferred only about grams of the ppa compounds to novartis left over material that was so insignificant that xenon did not price it or invoice it.finally,the foundation suggested that xenon was valueless because the phrase was defined in such a way as to include nothing beyond what was already covered under xenon patent rights.viewed in the light most favorable to the foundation,this evidence was sufficient to sustain the damages award.
xenon complains that the foundation did not adequately establish the precise market value of the sublicense for the joint patent application as compared to the other parts of the package.but wisconsin law provides that a contracting party that causes an uncertainty of proof can not demand a more precise measure of damages.see novo indus.nissen.xenon had a duty under the exclusive licensing agreement to make an accounting to the foundation on a quarterly basis,to disclose any payments received,and to explain how any amounts owed to the foundation had been calculated.it did not do so.under these circumstances the foundation was not required to establish a more specific measure of damages.
xenon also argues that proving damages in this case required the use of expert testimony,citing a number
