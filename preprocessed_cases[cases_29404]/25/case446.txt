himpp himpp appeals from the decision of the united states patent and trademark office pto board of patent appeals and interferences board in an inter partes reexamination affirming the central reexamination unit cru examiner decision not to reject claims and of patent the patent owned by hear wear technologies,hear wear.see himpp hear wear,wl july,board opinion.because the board did not err in holding that claims and would have been obvious,we affirm.
background 
hear wear owns the patent,which is directed to a hearing aid with three main parts a audio processing module,an module,and a connector between the modules.patent ll.
dependent claims and,directed to the connector between the modules,are the only claims on appeal and read as follows 
the at least partially module for a hearing aid of claim wherein said insulated wiring portion is terminated by a plurality of prongs that provide a detachable mechanical and electrical connection to an audio processing module.
the hearing aid of claim wherein said insulated wiring portion is terminated by a plurality of prongs that provide a detachable mechanical and electrical connection to said module.
during prosecution of the patent,the examiner initially rejected claims and because they would have been obvious.for claim,the examiner found that providing a plurality of prongs for the electrical connections or for the plugs is known in the art.hear wear never challenged the examiner finding of known in the art,but instead focused on the independent claims.all claims were allowed.
the pto then granted a third party request by himpp for inter partes reexamination of the patent.himpp argued in its request that claims and would have been obvious because such detachable connections were known at the time of the alleged invention as concluded by the examiner during prosecution.id.at.himpp also argued that modifying patent cooperation treaty publication number wo of shennib shennib,a primary reference,to include detachable connections for a signal cable would have been no more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions.id.at.the cru examiner refused to adopt himpp proposed rejection because himpp failed to provide evidence in support of that contention.the cru examiner ultimately maintained the patentability of claims and,inter alia.id.at.
after the cru examiner issued the right of appeal notice in the inter partes reexamination,himpp filed a request for ex parte reexamination of claims and.himpp asserted that one basis for the ex parte reexamination was patent of prentiss prentiss,which himpp contended explicitly taught all of the features recited in claims and.himpp tried to merge the inter partes reexamination with the ex parte reexamination,but the pto declined to merge the two proceedings,noting that the inter partes reexamination had already advanced to the appeal stage.
hear wear appealed to the board from the inter partes reexamination under b and a and himpp under c and b.board opinion at.only himpp of claims and in the inter partes reexamination is at issue here.the board found that although himpp argued that the content of claims and was well known,himpp failed to direct the board to any portion of the record for underlying factual support for the assertion.id.at.the board stated that it was not persuaded that the record before it adequately conveys that the particular distinct connection structures set forth in those claims are disclosed.id.the board also found that during the original prosecution the examiner never took official notice with respect to the plurality of prongs feature of claims and,and that there was no further indication that hear wear acquiesced to the alleged position of official notice so as to qualify the limitations of the claims as admitted prior art.id.at.thus,the board did not agree with himpp that there was a suitable basis for concluding that the particular structural features of claims and were known prior art elements.id.at.accordingly,the board affirmed the cru examiner decision not to adopt himpp proposed obviousness rejections of claims and.id.
himpp timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.
discussion 
we review the board legal conclusions de novo,in re elsner,and the board factual findings underlying those determinations for substantial evidence,in re gartside.a finding is supported by substantial evidence if a reasonable mind might accept the evidence to support the finding.consol.edison nlrb.obviousness is a question of law,based on underlying factual findings.graham john deere,d ksr int l teleflex,d.a claim is invalid for obviousness if,to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art,the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made a see also ksr,at.
himpp argues that the cru examiner and the board failed to consider the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in the art solely because himpp did not provide documentary evidence to prove purportedly facts.himpp asserts that refusing to consider the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in the art because of a lack of record evidentiary support is contrary to the supreme court supposed admonishment in ksr against the overemphasis on the importance of published articles and the content of issued patents.
hear wear responds that himpp assertions of known in the art can not substitute for the factual evidence required to conclude that a structural element is a known prior art element.hear wear argues that the board acted within its discretion when it declined to enter new rejections against claims and because himpp failed to identify the factual evidence necessary to support its contention that the claims would have been obvious.
we agree with hear wear that the board was correct to require record evidence to support an assertion that the structural features of claims and of the patent were known prior art elements.the patentability of claims and with the limitation a plurality of prongs that provide a detachable mechanical and electrical connection presents more than a peripheral issue.see in re zurko,board expertise may provide sufficient support for conclusions as to peripheral issues.the determination of patentability of claims with this limitation therefore requires a core factual finding,and as such,requires more than a conclusory statement from either himpp or the board.see id.with respect to core factual findings in a determination of patentability,however,the board can not simply reach conclusions based on its own understanding or experience.himpp must instead point to some concrete evidence in the record in support of these findings.id.
the requirement that evidence on the record is necessary to support the plurality of prongs limitation is not inconsistent with ksr caution against the overemphasis on the importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents.ksr,at.in ksr,the supreme court criticized a rigid approach to determining obviousness based on the disclosures of individual prior art references that were already on the record,with little recourse to the knowledge,creativity,and common sense that an ordinarily skilled artisan would have brought to bear when considering combinations or modifications.id.at.but the present case does not present a question whether the board declined to consider the common sense that an ordinarily skilled artisan would have brought to bear when combining or modifying references.
instead,it is about whether the board declined to accept a conclusory assertion from a third party about general knowledge in the art without evidence on the record,particularly where it is an important structural limitation that is not evidently and indisputably within the common knowledge of those skilled in the art.randall rea,board failure to consider evidence of the knowledge of one of skill in the art was plainly prejudicial.
here the board refused to adopt himpp proposed rejection of claims and because it found that there was not a suitable basis on the record for concluding that the particular structural features of claims and were known prior art elements.board opinion at.the board decision was correct because an assessment of basic knowledge and common sense as a replacement for documentary evidence for core factual findings lacks substantial evidence support.zurko,at.accordingly,the board holding is not inconsistent with ksr caution against the overemphasis on publications and patents for combining or modifying prior art that are already on the record.see,leapfrog,fisher price,indeed,the common sense of those skilled in the art demonstrates why some combinations would have been obvious where others would not.citing ksr,at.in contradistinction to ksr,this case involves the lack of evidence of a specific claim limitation,whereas ksr related to the combinability of references where the claim limitations were in evidence.
the pto examination procedure further supports hear wear position.although a patent examiner may rely on common knowledge to support a rejection,that is appropriate only in narrow circumstances.see it would not be appropriate for the examiner to take official notice of facts without citing a prior art reference where the facts asserted to be well known are not capable of instant and unquestionable demonstration as being.emphasis in original.in this case,neither the board nor the examiner determined that the facts at issue met the standard justifying official notice.if an examiner chooses to rely on personal knowledge to support the finding of what is known in the art,and the applicant adequately traverses that assertion,then the examiner must provide an affidavit or declaration setting forth specific factual statements and explanations to support that finding.d c.thus,the cru examiner did not err in rejecting himpp contention that the structural features of claims and were known prior art elements because himpp failed to point to any evidence on the record.
we recognize that the board has subject matter expertise,but the board can not accept general conclusions about what is basic knowledge or common sense as a replacement for documentary evidence for core factual findings in a determination of patentability.zurko,at.to hold otherwise would be to embark down a slippery slope which would permit the examining process to deviate from the and requirement that rejections be supported by evidence.it would also ultimately render the process of appellate review for substantial evidence on the record a meaningless exercise.id.at citing baltimore ohio aberdeen rockfish,d.because himpp failed to cite any evidence on the record to support its contention that claims and were known prior art elements,we affirm the board decision to refuse to adopt himpp obviousness contention.
alternatively,himpp asks that we take judicial notice that use of a plug to form a detachable mechanical and electrical connection at the end of an insulated wire would have been known to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention or of the prentiss reference cited by himpp in the ex parte reexamination.
we decline to exercise our discretion to take judicial notice of any plug knowledge for the same reasons mentioned above that it was reasonable for the board and examiner to decline to take official notice.see murakami,application of judicial notice is discretionary.
we also decline to take judicial notice of the prentiss reference and to expand the scope of our review beyond the grounds upon which the board actually relied.in re applied materials,citing sec chenery,u.the pto rules make clear that an inter partes reexamination requester may not,except in limited circumstances,submit new prior art evidence that was not cited in the reexamination request.listing exceptions not applicable here.the scope of the inter partes reexamination is otherwise limited to the prior art that raises a substantial new question of patentability as determined by the director.belkin int l,kappos.prentiss was a part of the ex parte reexamination,but the pto,as was within its discretion,explicitly declined to merge the two proceedings.since himpp did not cite the prentiss reference in its request for inter partes reexamination and the director did not cite the reference for the substantial new question of patentability,we decline to consider the prentiss reference.
conclusion 
because himpp failed to cite any evidence on the record to support its contention that claims and of the patent contained only known prior art limitations,we affirm the board decision to decline to adopt himpp obviousness contention.
this should be an easy case,reversing the quite odd decision of the united states patent and trademark office pto that it could not consider whether electrical connections were well known in the prior art.but the majority does not reverse.it affirms.in my view,this case raises important questions regarding the role of the pto in making obviousness determinations.
the majority holds that patent examiners,in addressing questions of obviousness,may not rely on their expert knowledge and common sense about what is well known in the art except in narrow circumstances involving peripheral issues.the narrowness of this exception is illustrated by the holding in this case.although the claim limitation a plurality of prongs that provide a detachable mechanical and electrical connection was well known as of the patent priority date,the majority holds that the examiner could not resort to the common knowledge of one skilled in the art,but rather was confined to considering only the evidence of record.
in my view,the majority holding is inconsistent with the supreme court decision in ksr international teleflex,d,and will have substantial adverse effects on the examination process.the majority adopts a r igid preventative rule that den ies factfinders recourse to common sense even though the court held such rules neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.id.at.precluding examiners from using their knowledge and common sense significantly impairs their ability to review applications adequately and undermines the purpose of agency review.i respectfully dissent.
the claimed invention is a hearing aid with separate and components.see patent ll.id.ll.during the initial prosecution of the patent,the examiner rejected all claims as obvious in view of multiple prior art references.with respect to dependent claims and,which recite wiring portions terminated by a plurality of prongs that provide a detachable mechanical and electrical connection,id.ll,ll,the examiner stated that providing a plurality of prongs for the electrical connections or for the plugs is known in the art,and concluded it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to provide the prongs for the electrical connections for providing better electrical connections.the applicant did not contest the examiner findings.in response to the rejection,the applicant amended the cushion tip element of independent claims and to recite a cushion tip wherein during deflection said tip portion assumes an offset angle relative to said tubular body and said speaker module.the applicant patentability argument hinged on the novelty of the tip portion.the pto allowed the claims based on the alleged novelty of the tip portion.
appellant himpp himpp requested inter partes reexamination.the examiner and board rejected all claims as obvious except dependent claims and and found the claims to a hearing aid device with the recited tip portion obvious in view of multiple prior art references.himpp argued that claims and were similarly obvious.the only difference between those claims and the rejected claims was a plurality of prongs that provide a detachable mechanical and electrical connection,and himpp argued that such detachable connections were known at the time of the alleged invention as concluded by the examiner during prosecution.the examiner in the inter partes reexamination declined to adopt the rejection on the ground that himpp submitted no evidence in support of requester contention.the board affirmed the examiner,explaining that although himpp asserts tha
