this appeal arises from consolidated hatch waxman proceedings involving the reformulated version of the pain reliever oxycontin.the appellants,purdue pharma,the laboratories,purdue pharmaceuticals,and rhodes technologies collectively,purdue and grunenthal gmbh grunenthal asserted a number of claims from multiple different patents against the appellees,amneal pharmaceuticals,llc amneal,epic pharma,llc epic,mylan pharmaceuticals and mylan collectively,mylan,and teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva,all of whom have filed abbreviated new drug applications andas seeking to sell generic versions of oxycontin.the united states district court for the southern district of new york held a bench trial in the case against teva,following which it held all of the asserted patent claims invalid.in re oxycontin antitrust,d,district court decision.the court then entered orders of dismissal in the three remaining cases against amneal,epic,and mylan based on collateral estoppel.purdue and grunenthal appeal the final judgment in the teva action,and purdue also appeals the orders of dismissal in the three other cases.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court rulings.
background 
oxycodone hydrochloride the active pharmaceutical ingredient api in oxycontin is an opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain.this consolidated appeal concerns four patents associated with the reformulated version of oxycontin patent patent,patent patent,patent patent collectively,the patents,and patent patent patent.
i.the low abuk patents 
the patents recite an improved formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride.those patents describe an oxycodone salt with extremely low levels of a particular impurity,hydroxycodeinone hydroxy,which belongs to a class of potentially dangerous compounds known as alpha,beta unsaturated ketones abuks.the prior art method of synthesizing oxycodone hydrochloride involved three steps first,thebaine,a derivative of the opium poppy,was oxidized to form hydroxy second,the hydroxy was converted to oxycodone free base through hydrogenation and third,the oxycodone free base was reacted with hydrochloric acid to form oxycodone hydrochloride.the end product created by that process,however,contained high levels of hydroxy,on the order of parts per million ppm.
in january,the food and drug administration fda became concerned that hydroxy was potentially toxic and thus mandated that oxycodone hydrochloride manufacturers either provide evidence that the hydroxy levels in their formulations were safe or reduce the amount of hydroxy to less than ppm.even before the fda mandate,however,rhodes technologies a subsidiary of purdue had begun researching methods to reduce hydroxy levels in its oxycodone api.the scientists initially hypothesized that the hydroxy present in the final salt was leftover hydroxy that had not been hydrogenated in the second step.thus,they extended the hydrogenation reaction to completion,confirming that every molecule of hydroxy converted to oxycodone free base at step two.but the scientists found that after step three transforming the oxycodone free base into oxycodone hydrochloride the hydroxy had returned.
the scientists thus shifted their focus to step three.it was well known in the art that an impurity,dihydroxy,dihydrocodeinone dihydroxy was produced as a byproduct of the oxidation of thebaine step one.more specifically,it was known that a particular isomer of dihydroxy was formed,dihydroxy,dihydrocodeinone.scientists did not know with certainty,however,whether dihydroxy,dihydrocodeinone a diastereomer of was also produced during the oxidation step.purdue scientists had previously noted the potential existence of,but no scientific literature discussed that particular isomer.through experimentation,the scientists determined that was indeed being produced at step one and,in fact,was transforming into hydroxy during the dehydration at step three.to remove the hydroxy from the oxycodone api,the scientists added another hydrogenation step at the end of step three to convert the remaining hydroxy into oxycodone free base.by june,rhodes laboratory could routinely produce oxycodone api with hydroxy levels less than ppm using the process.purdue and rhodes thus sought approval from the fda and patent protection for their oxycodone product.
the patents continue from application,known as the chapman application.the claims of the chapman application have previously been before us we authored a decision affirming the board of patent appeals and interferences determination that the chapman claims were obvious.chapman casner,app x,rader,dissenting.in that case,the board declared an interference between the chapman application and patent casner.the relevant claims in the chapman application related to a method for making oxycodone api using a hydrogenation step to remove hydroxy,but they did not require that some of the remaining hydroxy be derived from the isomer.id.the board compared chapman claims to the prior art and concluded that they were obvious.chapman appealed directly to us,and we agreed with the board.we reasoned that,because the claims did not specify the source of the hydroxy,any prior art reference that disclosed conditions under which either or converted to hydroxy would render the claim obvious.id.at.we further noted that the prior art references did just that they disclosed the conversion of to hydroxy under certain conditions.id.thus we affirmed the board decision to reject the chapman claims as obvious.id.at.
purdue eventually amended the chapman claims to include the claims now on appeal.unlike the claims in the chapman application,the claims at issue here are product claims instead of process claims,and they explicitly recite as the source of at least a portion of the minimal amounts of hydroxy remaining in the api.in,the patent and trademark office allowed the claims and issued the patents.
ii.the patent 
the patent covers formulations.original oxycontin was a popular opioid analgesic which delivered a large dose of oxycodone over a period.in the early,however,reports of widespread abuse of original oxycontin emerged,and the problem began to garner significant public attention.original oxycontin was susceptible to tampering because abusers could crush the tablets easily into powder,which could then be swallowed,snorted,or injected for an instant opioid high.in,purdue and the fda changed the label of original oxycontin to warn doctors about the potential for abusers to tamper with the dosage form.
purdue thus investigated ways to reformulate oxycontin to deter abuse.purdue initially considered,among other ideas,creating a tablet that would be difficult to crush and difficult to inject,but those efforts were unsuccessful.in,purdue became aware of technology developed by grunenthal that made tablets extremely hard in order to prevent crushing and formed a gel upon dissolution in water in order to prevent injecting.
grunenthal first began to research abuse resistant properties for its opioid product,tapentadol.in october,johnson johnson proposed a joint venture with grunenthal,using johnson johnson osmotically oral delivery system oros to deter abuse.the oros technology consists of a tablet with an outer shell that limits the flow of the api from an inner core through the use of a push compartment in the tablet.the hard outer shell is composed of high molecular weight polyethylene oxide peo,and the push compartment expands to force the api through a hole in the outer shell.but the tablet could still be easily crushed with a mortar and pestle,so it was not a workable solution.johannes bartholomaeus,who was the head of pharmaceutical development for grunenthal at the time,tried to strengthen tapentadol dosage form by making the entire tablet,instead of just the outer shell,resistant to crushing.bartholomaeus thus designed a formulation that contained a matrix of api and peo throughout the tablet.moreover,bartholomaeus experimentation with peo demonstrated that using both heat and pressure to form the tablet resulted in a stronger solid that resisted breaking by a hammer or by a mortar and pestle,and withstood a breaking strength test that exerted n of force.
after a series of negotiations,purdue obtained a license from grunenthal to use the abuse deterrent technology of the patent in its reformulated oxycontin product.purdue submitted a new drug application to the fda in november,proposing a reformulated oxycontin,which the fda approved in april.by july,purdue noted reductions in the abuse of oxy contin and provided that information to the fda.on april,the fda withdrew its approval for original oxycontin and stopped accepting andas that proposed generic versions of it,reasoning that reformulated oxycontin was available to provide the same benefits with lower risks of abuse and misuse.on the same day,the fda approved a new label that allowed purdue to market reformulated oxycontin on the basis of its abuse deterrent properties.
iii.procedural history 
in march,purdue sued teva for infringement of anda seeking fda approval to market generic versions of reformulated oxycontin.between november and january,purdue filed similar lawsuits against epic,mylan,and amneal.in addition,in june,grunenthal and purdue jointly sued teva for infringement of the patent.the two teva cases were consolidated and joined with the epic,mylan,and amneal cases,along with six actions involving other defendants,in litigation for pretrial purposes.
in september,the district court held a bench trial in the teva cases the district court found that the asserted claims were infringed by teva proposed generic product,but it also held that all of the claims were invalid as anticipated by or obvious over the prior art.district court decision,d at.based on that decision,the district court issued an order for purdue to show cause as to why the actions against epic,mylan,and amneal should not be dismissed under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.purdue stated that it intended to appeal the teva decision but it agreed that the district court decision regarding the invalidity of the patents precluded purdue claims for relief against the other defendants.accordingly,the district court dismissed the three remaining actions based on collateral estoppel.
purdue and grunenthal appeal the final judgment in the teva actions and purdue also appeals the orders of dismissal in the three other cases.we have jurisdiction under a.

invalidity of the low abuk patents 
purdue challenges the district court conclusion that the asserted claims of the patents are invalid as obvious.those claims recite an oxycodone api product with low abuk levels the district court found that the prior art taught that oxidation of thebaine produced hydroxy and that it was well known in the art that hydroxy could be removed using hydrogenation.district court decision,d at.the court further determined that the discovery of was not necessary to the claimed invention a skilled artisan would recognize that hydrogenation could be used to remove the remaining hydroxy,regardless of the source of the hydroxy.id.at.moreover,the court concluded that the claim limitation requiring that the remaining hydroxy is at least in part derived from is a limitation and thus immaterial in the obviousness determination.id.at.finally,the district court found that the secondary considerations did not demonstrate nonobviousness.id.at.purdue alleges clear error in a number of the court findings,but none of its arguments are meritorious.
discovery of 
first,purdue contends that the court failed to properly credit the discovery of as the core of the claimed inventions.it relies heavily on eibel process minnesota ontario paper,for the proposition that where an inventor discovers a source of a problem and then applies a remedy in response,the invention is nonobvious and worthy of a patent even if the remedy,standing alone,would generally appear to be known in the art.purdue br.in eibel process,the invention was a machine that could make quality paper at high speeds.at.at the time,machines could not operate at high speeds without producing wrinkled paper.id.eibel discovered that the unequal speeds of paper stock and a wire in the machine produced the wrinkled paper.thus,he made a minor modification in the existing machines he increased the pitch angle of the wire so that,through gravity,the paper stock would travel at substantially the same speed as the wire,and the paper would not wrinkle.id.at.the supreme court upheld the validity of eibel patent,reasoning that the discovery of the problem unequal speeds of paper stock and the nonobvious,and thus the solution was as well.id.at.purdue contends that,similarly here,the discovery of the source of hydroxy was not obvious,so the solution of hydrogenating the oxycodone salt must also be nonobvious.
purdue reliance on eibel process is misplaced.even if determining the source of hydroxy in the end product was not obvious,that problem did not need to be solved to arrive at the claimed invention thus,eibel process does not apply.as discussed above,the claimed invention in eibel process was a machine that remedied the problem of wrinkled paper at printing.but,here,purdue did not claim the remedy of the problem of remaining hydroxy in the oxycodone api performing a second hydrogenation step.instead,it claimed the end product an oxycodone api with low abuk levels.and,as the district court found,identification of the source of the remaining hydroxy as being had no effect on the structure or nature of the oxycodone product.because o ne molecule of hydroxy is the same as the next,whether derived from or,knowledge of did not make hydrogenation more or less effective as a technique for converting hydroxy to oxycodone.district court decision,d at.
purdue also argues that,without knowing that the hydroxy was derived from,a person of ordinary skill in the art would not know when to conduct the hydrogenation step or under what conditions to run the hydrogenation to create oxycodone.purdue notes that the prior art references were directed to lowering hydroxy levels in the oxycodone free base,not the api or salt.for example,patent chiu reference disclosed a method for preparing free base,but it did not teach how to convert the free base into salt.in fact,as purdue and the district court noted,chiu completed his method by adding acetic acid to the free base.in so doing,chiu likely converted the latent into hydroxy in the final product because reacts with the acid to form hydroxy.but,again,purdue claimed the end product it did not claim a particular method for creating that product,such as the use of hydrogenation after the salting step.in fact,teva generic product would not infringe if that were the case because the teva product is not made by hydrogenating the salt instead the free base is purified through two hydrogenation cycles and then is treated with acid to create the oxycodone salt.similarly,nothing in the asserted patents indicates that the hydrogenation process to remove hydroxy derived from must be conducted under different conditions from the process used to remove hydroxy that is derived from.the issue again comes down to whether it would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art to use hydrogenation to remove the excess hydroxy in the api.one need not know that the hydroxy was derived from as opposed to to answer that question.
derived from limitation 
purdue next argues that,because the asserted claims require that the remaining hydroxy in the oxycodone api is derived from and because was not previously known in the art as being the source of hydroxy,the claims must be nonobvious.indeed,purdue points out that the reason it added that limitation was because of our decision in chapman where we said the claims were obvious because the claims did not differentiate between the and.app x at.the district court rejected that argument because it found that the derived from limitation was a process limitation and thus immaterial to the obviousness analysis.
purdue says,first,the limitation is not a process limitation,and,second,even if it is,it should not be wholly disregarded.again,purdue arguments fail.
the relevant claim language provides 
an oral dosage form comprising oxycodone hydrochloride active pharmaceutical ingredient having less than ppm hydroxy,wherein at least a portion of the hydroxy is derived from α during conversion of oxycodone free base to oxycodone hydrochloride.
see,patent to emphasis added.we agree with the district court that derived from does not describe the structure of hydroxy and thus is a process limitation.the patent specification describes methods for detecting and removing hydroxy without regard to the source.for example,the written description defines dihydroxy as,or a mixture of the two and does not indicate any difference in the resulting hydrodxy depending on the particular isomer from which it is derived.more specifically,there is no suggestion in the patents that the hydrogenation process changes depending on whether the hydroxy is created by or.indeed,even purdue expert testified that t he structure of the hydroxy that is generated from is the same structure that is generated from.because the source of the hydroxy has no effect on its structure or its removal through hydrogenation,the limitation that it be derived from can not be a structural limitation.
we also conclude that,because derived from is a process limitation,the district court did not err in disregarding the limitation in its obviousness analysis.we have clearly stated that i n determining validity of a claim,the focus is on the product and not the process of making it.greenliant,xicor llc,quoting amgen hoffman la roche.that is because of the longstanding rule that an old product is not patentable even if it is made by a new process.see also smithkline beecham apotex,it has long been established that one can not avoid anticipation by an earlier product disclosure by claiming the product as produced by a particular process.in re thorpe,if the product in a claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art,the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.
purdue looks to the exception we carved out in amgen if the process by which a product is made imparts structural and functional differences distinguishing the claimed product from the prior art,then those differences are relevant as evidence of no anticipation although they are not explicitly part of the claim.greenliant,at quoting amgen,at.as previously discussed,however,the fact that the hydroxy is derived from imparts no structural or functional differences in the hydrocodone api as compared to the prior art products.thus,the court did not err in disregarding the process limitation in its obviousness determination.
secondary considerations 
finally,purdue contends that the court erroneously discounted the secondary considerations which it argues demonstrate nonobviousness.purdue first points to rhodes commercial success it says that rhodes became purdue oxycodone api supplier by marketing the features of its product to purdue,which resulted in almost million in sales in.as the district court found,however,rhodes was not successful at marketing its oxycodone api to any significant customer other than purdue,which is its corporate affiliate.the district court further found that purdue invested in rhodes not because of the features,but because it could get oxycodone api at a lower cost from its subsidiary than it could from an unaffiliated manufacturer during times of high demand.purdue does not persuasively rebut these findings on appeal.thus,the district court did not clearly err in concluding that there was no nexus between the product of the patents and the commercial success of purdue or rhodes.
purdue next argues that the failure of others is shown by the experience of teva oxycodone api supplier,noramco,noramco.purdue claims noramco was unable to obtain low abuk levels until,years after purdue discovered,and only then by infringing the patents.but,as the district court found,there is no evidence that noramco tried but failed to create oxycodone api.instead,the record showed that noramco and the fda agreed to a timetable for producing oxycodone api,that noramco adhered to that timetable,and that noramco continued to manufacture the higher abuk products during that time.purdue also argues that need was shown because,although the fda only made oxycodone api a regulatory requirement in less than a year before purdue commercialized its product the need for products was present long before.that does not,however,change the fact that there was no pressing need for companies to create a product before the fda mandate,as they were able to continue to sell their products.thus,the district court did not clearly err in finding that purdue failed to prove the failure of others or but unaddressed need.
finally,purdue points to the fact that noramco credited purdue and rhodes with the discovery of and contends that such recognition shows praise from competitors.but recognition that rhodes discovered that is a byproduct of thebaine oxidation does not equal praise for the invention the oxycodone api.purdue also argues that industry praise is shown because noramco copied its process for creating,but provides no support whatsoever for that argument.finally,purdue contends that the court wholly ignored evidence showing that purdue and rhodes were surprised over their discovery and solution.but,again,there was no surprise as to the patented product.even if it was unexpected that thebaine oxidation would create,it was not surprising that,after the fda mandate,manufacturers would create a oxycodone api or that they would do so using the known technique of hydrogenation.
we find purdue remaining arguments unpersuasive and conclude that the asserted claims of the patents are obvious.we thus affirm the district court finding of invalidity as to those claims.
ii.invalidity of the patent 
purdue and grunenthal also challenge the district court conclusion that the asserted claims of the patent are invalid as anticipated,or,in the alternative,obvious the district court concluded that the asserted claims are anticipated by wo,known as the mcginity reference,which later became patent.district court decision,d at.the mcginity reference discloses the use of extrusion of high molecular weight peo to create a dosage form for pharmaceuticals.the district court found that mcginity disclosed opioid formulations and that it inherently disclosed tablets with a breaking strength in excess of n,as required by the asserted claims.alternatively,the district court concluded that even if the mcginity reference did not anticipate the patent,a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had sufficient knowledge and motivation to make the invention claimed by the patent.id.at.
on appeal,grunenthal contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that mcginity discloses all of the limitations of the asserted claims and that the district court impermissibly combined discrete disclosures in mcginity to arrive at its anticipation determination.grunenthal also asserts a number of grounds of error in the district court obviousness determination.
mcginity disclosure of opioid formulations and breaking strength 
mcginity discloses a variety of therapeutic compounds to be used in its formulations,including analgesics such as aspirin,acetaminophen,d i flunisal and the like.grunenthal argues that,because the only specifically mentioned drugs are,mcginity does not describe formulations that contain opioids such as oxycodone.it invokes the canon of construction ejusdem generis which provides that general terms are construed as referring to things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned to argue that the terms such as and and the like should be understood as also referring to other.but,as the district court found,the mcginity reference can not be read so narrowly.the mcginity reference explicitly notes the use of its process with analgesics to treat pain,and the words such as and the residual clause and the like demonstrate that the application discloses a broader group of analgesics than just those listed.moreover,the record showed that opioids are a major class of analgesics and that oxycodone was one of the most widely prescribed analgesics at the time.the district court also noted that the mcginity reference is directed to dosage forms and credited expert testimony that the only analgesics on the market in a form at the time were opioids the district court assessment is persuasive and not clearly erroneous 
grunenthal next argues that mcginity does not inherently disclose the limitation that the dosage forms have a breaking strength of at least n.according to the district court,
the pivotal evidence with respect to the breaking strength limitation is a series of breaking strength tests that fernando muzzio performed in preparation for this litigation.muzzio thermoformed thousands of tablets according to the mcginity application disclosures.he used a variety of chemical compositions,extruder temperatures,screw speeds,and die diameters.he tested a vast number of the resulting tablets,and without exception they withstood forces greater than.in fact,muzzio often exerted forces in the thousands of newtons and never had a tablet break.
district court decision,d at.the district court credited muzzio testing and noted that,i n contrast with muzzio persuasive experimental evidence,plaintiffs have not put forward any evidence that any tablet produced according to the mcginity application can ever break when a force of is applied to the tablet.id.the district court thus concluded that the mcginity reference inherently discloses a breaking strength greater than,because the experimental results indicate unanimously,reliably,clearly,and convincingly that any tablet made according to the mcginity application would exhibit this characteristic.id.at.
grunenthal asserts a number of grounds of error,many of which focus on the adequacy and reliability of muzzio testing.for example,grunenthal argues that muzzio did not provide api release data,photographs after breaking strength testing,or laboratory notebooks for his reproductions of the mcginity disclosures.but the district court rejected that argument,finding that muzzio has supplemented his own credibility with abundant documentary support in the form of raw data,photographs,and force curves and concluded that grunenthal attacks do not seriously lessen the weight the court assigns to muzzio vast empirical results and credible opinion on the inherency of a breaking strength.id.similarly,grunenthal says that muzzio did not perform a torque test on its reproductions,which would have shown if the extrusion was being accurately repeated.again,however,the district court found that argument unpersuasive,concluding that because torque is not an input or setting in the extrusion process,the lack of torque data does not affect the reliability of muzzio process as a replication of the mcginity application process.id.the district court credited muzzio with having recreated the mcginity application process fairly,accurately,and with no material variation,and grunenthal has shown no clear error in that finding.
grunenthal also points to specific disclosures in mcginity which it argues show that the mcginity formulations do not necessarily have the required breaking strength.first,it notes that mcginity discloses tablets that can be scored making them easy to break in half or ground,which it contends is the antithesis of high breaking strength tablets.next,grunenthal argues that mcginity contemplates the use of heat or pressure to create the disclosed tablets,but notes that tablets with n breaking strength can only be formed using both heat and pressure.neither of those disclosures,however,changes the fact that every tablet made according to mcginity disclosures and tested by muzzio had a breaking strength of over and,again,grunenthal has not shown clear error in the district court crediting of muzzio testing results,nor has it provided any independent testing to rebut muzzio findings 
grunenthal last two arguments relate to testing that muzzio did not perform.grunenthal notes that muzzio only tested formulations with the active ingredient disclosed in mcginity,chlorpheniramine maleate cpm,which is an antihistamine,not an opioid.thus,grunenthal says that muzzio tests only proved that cpm formulations would have a breaking strength of n or more,not that opioid formulations,as claimed in the patent,would have such a breaking strength.but,muzzio testified that any tablet made using at least fifty weight percent peo and heated above the melting point of peo would have a breaking strength above n,regardless of the active ingredient used.the district court did not clearly err in crediting that testimony.
next,grunenthal argues that muzzio did not perform any testing to confirm that the tablets he made according to the mcginity disclosures were formulations.grunenthal contends that without this testing,there is no clear proof that teva actually carried out the same process and made the same disclosed in mcginity.grunenthal br.that is incorrect.as stated above,the district court credited muzzio with recreating the mcginity process fairly,accurately,and with no material variation.district court decision,d at.grunenthal has not shown clear error in the district court finding and can not do so by claiming that muzzio did not conduct an additional test to confirm what the district court already found that he properly replicated the mcginity process.grunenthal also says that,without testing the properties of the tablets,teva can not prove that the limitation requiring a controlled release matrix of the peo is disclosed by mcginity.that is also incorrect.teva did not need to conduct any testing because mcginity clearly discloses peo formulations with properties.for example,in the field of the invention section,mcginity says,the invention relates more specifically to formulations which have been prepared by hot melt extrusion of mixtures containing high molecular weight peo and a therapeutic compound for use in drug delivery.thus,the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the limitation was disclosed in mcginity.
combination of mcginity disclosures 
finally,grunenthal argues that the district court erred by using distinct sections of mcginity and reassembling them into an embodiment to find that all of the limitations were present.see application of arkley,noting that an anticipating reference must clearly and unequivocally disclose the claimed compound or direct those skilled in the art to the compound without any need for picking,choosing,and combining various disclosures not directly related to each other by the teachings of the cited reference.for example,grunenthal points out that the court selected only analgesics from the long list of pharmaceutical categories that could be used as the active ingredient,and then further picked oxycodone,which was not even disclosed,to find anticipation.moreover,grunenthal notes that mcginity teaches that the amount of peo will vary depending on various factors and does not consistently disclo
