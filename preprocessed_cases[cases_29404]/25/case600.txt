apotex,apotex appeals the order of the united states district court for the district of new jersey dismissing its declaratory judgment action for noninfringement against janssen pharmaceutica,and janssen,collectively janssen.we affirm.
background 
this case arises under the act act which governs the food and drug administration fda approval of new and generic drugs.the goal of the act is to better balance two competing interests in the pharmaceutical industry inducing pioneering research and development of new drugs and enabling competitors to bring,generic copies of those drugs to market.andrx,biovail.
under the act,a pioneering or brand name drug company seeking to manufacture a new drug must prepare,file,and have approved a new drug application nda with the fda.a,b.as part of its nda,the applicant must submit information regarding the new drug safety and efficacy obtained from clinical trials.b.the applicant must also identify all patents that could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture,use,or sale of the drug,b,c.the fda publishes a list of those patents in the orange book.drugs approved by the fda are known as listed drugs.j a i.
to encourage the development of generic versions of listed drugs,the act created an expedited approval process known as an abbreviated new drug application anda.j.generic drug companies are not required to conduct their own independent clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy,but can instead rely on the research of the pioneer pharmaceutical companies.j a iv,j b.however,in order to rely on the research of the pioneer pharmaceutical companies,an anda applicant is required to show bioequivalence of its generic drug to the nda drug.j a iv,j b.the anda applicant must also include a certification to each patent listed in the orange book covering the listed drug that either i no patent information has been filed with the fda ii the patent has expired iii the patent will expire on a particular date and approval of the anda should be deferred until expiration or iv in the opinion of the anda applicant,the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the generic drug.j a vii.these options are respectively referred to as paragraph i,ii,iii,and iv certifications.the timing of anda approval is tied to the type of certification contained in the anda.for paragraph iv andas,the timing of approval depends upon two events whether the pioneer drug company brings an infringement action within days of learning of the paragraph iv anda filing,and whether the company seeking approval was the first one to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification to a listed patent hereinafter first paragraph iv anda filer.
in order to bring about early resolution of patent disputes between generics and pioneering drug companies,the act provides that the filing of a paragraph iv certification is an act of patent infringement.e a eli lilly medtronic,d.the anda filer must provide notice to the patentee and nda holder of the factual and legal bases for the paragraph iv certification.j b.upon such notice,the patentee and nda holder have the option of suing on all,some,or none of the patents included in the paragraph iv certification.if the patentee or nda holder does not bring suit within days of receiving notice,the fda may issue final approval of the anda once its approval requirements have been satisfied.j b iii.if,however,the brand name company brings suit within days,the fda may not approve the anda for months.j b iii.the fda may approve the anda after that period,or earlier if a court has decided the patent s are invalid or not infringed.j b iii.
as an incentive for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge suspect orange book listed patents,the act grants the first company to submit a paragraph iv anda a period of generic marketing exclusivity during which time fda will not approve a paragraph iv anda based on the same nda hereinafter subsequent paragraph iv anda.j b iv see.mining barr.significantly,the first paragraph iv anda filer is entitled to the exclusivity period regardless of whether it establishes that the orange book patents are invalid or not infringed by the drug described in its anda.all that is required for the first paragraph iv anda filer to receive the exclusivity period is that it submits a substantially complete anda that contains a paragraph iv certification.j b iv ii bb.
the start of the exclusivity period is triggered by the earlier of two events the first paragraph iv anda filer commercial marketing of a drug product or a court decision of noninfringement or invalidity j b iv.only the first paragraph iv anda filer can trigger its exclusivity period via the trigger.j b iv i.however,the subsequent paragraph iv anda filers can trigger the first paragraph iv anda filer exclusivity period via a successful court judgment.mining,at.
on december,the act was amended by title xi of the medicare prescription drug,improvement and modernization act of mma,a,stat.prior to the mma,nda holders employed several methods of delaying the early resolution of patent disputes.see teva pharms.usa,novartis pharms.the mma ameliorates these situations by authorizing a a civil action under for a declaratory judgment that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the drug for which the applicant seeks approval j c i ii.specifically,the mma allows a paragraph iv anda filer a right to bring a declaratory judgment action for noninfringement or invalidity of the relevant listed patents against the patentee and nda holder,if the patentee has not brought an infringement action within the notice period.j c.congress extended federal court jurisdiction over these declaratory judgment actions to the extent consistent with the constitution.e.therefore,federal courts have jurisdiction over these declaratory judgment actions to the extent that they present an article iii case or controversy.caraco pharm.labs.forest,citation omitted.
janssen holds an approved nda for its drug risperdal oral solution.the orange book originally listed patent patent,patent and patent in connection with this nda.the patent covers the compound risperidone,which is the active compound in the drug risperdal oral solution.the and patents cover specific aqueous solutions of risperidone and methods for preparing these solutions.the patent expired on december.however,the fda granted janssen an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity pursuant to,making june,the effective expiration date of the patent the and patents expire in.
the patent has been the subject of prior litigation.following a bench trial,it was found to be infringed,valid,and enforceable.on may,this court affirmed the judgment of the district court.janssen pharmaceutica,mylan,d,aff.while apotex was not a party to that trial,apotex stipulated to infringement,validity,and enforceability of the patent based on the federal circuit opinion.therefore,this stipulation took effect on may.
prior to september,teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva filed an anda to make a generic version of risperidone oral solution.in filing its anda,teva respected the validity of the patent by filing a paragraph iii certification on that patent.teva was the first anda applicant to file a paragraph iv certification on the and patents.as such,teva is entitled to days of generic market exclusivity,during which the fda will not approve a paragraph iv anda based on the same nda.teva exclusivity period will begin either the day it begins marketing its drug,or on the date a court determines that the and patents are invalid or not comes first.j b iv.as teva filed a paragraph iii certification with respect to the patent,the fda will not approve teva generic product before the expiration of the patent.because janssen did not sue teva for infringing the and patents,the fda will be able to approve teva generic version of risperidone oral solution upon the expiration of the patent.teva will be able to commercially market its generic product immediately upon receiving fda approval.
apotex subsequently submitted an anda application to the fda seeking approval to market its generic version of risperidone oral solution,in which apotex also filed paragraph iv certifications on the and patents.in january,apotex amended its anda and provided janssen with an additional paragraph iv certification directed to the patent.on march,janssen sued apotex for infringing the patent in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,but janssen did not sue apotex on the and patents collectively,the unasserted patents.in its answer to janssen complaint on april,apotex asserted four counterclaims,including claims for declaratory judgment of noninfringement of the two unasserted patents.specifically,apotex sought a declaratory judgment of noninfringement with respect to the two unasserted patents under the declaratory judgment act,and the mma to the act,j c and e on june,janssen moved to dismiss these two counterclaims on the ground that the action did not present a case or controversy as required by article iii of the constitution.
on december,janssen provided apotex with a with respect to the and patents.after granting the covenant,janssen requested that apotex withdraw its counterclaims.apotex refused.on october,the district court granted janssen motion to dismiss apotex counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court found no case or controversy regarding the and patents.this appeal followed.
discussion 
whether an actual controversy exists that is sufficient to sustain federal subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law this court reviews de novo.teva pharms.usa,novartis pharms.in the anda context,congress extended federal court jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act,to anda paragraph iv disputes,j c.congress also directed federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over these anda paragraph iv declaratory judgment actions to the extent consistent with the constitution,e.the relevant text of the declaratory judgment act reads 
in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
a.the declaratory judgment act actual controversy requirement refers to the type of cases and controversies that are justiciable under article iii.medimmune,genentech,d.
in medimmune,the supreme court stated that a justiciable declaratory judgment action exists when 
the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.
id.at citation omitted.the court emphasized that the dispute must be 
definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests and that it be real and substantial and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.
apotex argues that it is suffering three actual and continuing injuries which create a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.specifically,apotex argues that it is unable to promptly launch its generic risperidone product and compete in the market immediately upon the expiration of the patent its approval of its noninfringing generic risperidone product is being indefinitely delayed and its affiliates,suppliers,and downstream customers face patent uncertainty because janssen does not cover them.we address each alleged injury in turn.
prompt launch 
apotex argues that absent a declaratory judgment with respect to the and patents and regardless of janssen grant of a,it continues to suffer a cognizable harm of being unable to launch its generic risperidone product immediately upon the expiration of the patent.apotex contends that this injury creates a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.without a declaratory judgment,teva exclusivity period will commence when it commercially launches its generic risperidone product after the expiration of the patent.therefore,the earliest apotex will be able to enter the market is days after the expiration of the patent.however,if apotex is successful on its declaratory judgment action,teva exclusivity period will be triggered at a time that teva will be unable to launch its generic product.if teva exclusivity period is exhausted prior to the expiration of the patent,apotex will be able to enter the market immediately upon the expiration of the patent 
apotex contends that caraco pharm.labs.forest,in which this court held that despite the existence of a,a declaratory judgment claim brought under the act presents a justiciable article iii controversy,is controlling.we disagree.
jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action must be present at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.steffel thompson,d see benitec,nucleonics,the burden is on the party claiming declaratory judgment jurisdiction to establish that such jurisdiction existed at the time the claim for declaratory relief was filed and that it has continued since.int l med.prosthetics research,gore enter.holdings,j urisdiction over a declaratory judgment action must have existed at,and has continued since,the time the complaint was filed.we agree with the parties that if apotex had not stipulated to the validity of the patent,then caraco would have been controlling.however,apotex stipulated to the validity,infringement,and enforceability of the patent on may.therefore,while the harm that created a justiciable article iii controversy in caraco was present when apotex filed its counterclaims on april,that harm ceased to exist upon apotex stipulation.as such,the harm that gave rise to jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment claims in caraco was no longer present on october,date the district court dismissed the instant case.further,we conclude that the harm that has continuously existed in the present inability to launch its generic product immediately upon the expiration of the not sufficient to give rise to declaratory judgment jurisdiction.
in caraco,forest laboratories,et forest was the pioneer pharmaceutical company,ivax pharmaceuticals,ivax was the first paragraph iv anda filer,and caraco pharmaceutical laboratories,caraco was the subsequent paragraph iv anda filer.at.forest listed two patents in the orange book in relation to its nda.id.at.both ivax and caraco filed paragraph iv andas with respect to both of the listed patents.id.at.forest chose to sue ivax on only one of the two listed patents.id.at.forest patent was found valid,infringed,and enforceable.id.citing forest,ivax.after caraco filed its paragraph iv anda,forest sued caraco on only the previously litigated patent and granted a on the unlitigated,unasserted patent.id.at.caraco brought a declaratory judgment action for noninfringement of the unlitigated,unasserted patent.id.caraco wanted to be able to challenge both patents and if successful,this would trigger ivax exclusivity period at a time when ivax could obtain fda approval and then launch its product.hence,if caraco was successful,ivax would get its exclusivity period sooner and caraco would be able to obtain fda approval in greater competition at an earlier time.without a declaratory judgment,caraco could be excluded from selling a noninfringing product even if the asserted patent was proven to be invalid.see id.at.therefore,caraco could have been blocked from entering the market by an invalid patent.id.
the key difference between caraco and this case is that the harm that gave rise to the jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment claim in caraco ceased to exist once apotex stipulated to the validity,infringement,and enforceability of the patent.therefore,unlike caraco,apotex can not claim that at the time of the district court dismissal it was being excluded from selling a noninfringing product by an invalid stipulated to the validity of the patent
