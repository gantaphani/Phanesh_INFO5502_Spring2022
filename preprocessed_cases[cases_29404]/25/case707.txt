housey pharmaceuticals,housey appeals from the judgement of the united states district court for the district of delaware dismissing its counterclaim for infringement of united states patent,and for failure to state a claim.because we conclude that infringement under g is limited to physical goods that were manufactured and does not include information generated by a patented process,and because the physical goods here drug products were not manufactured by a process claimed in the asserted patents,we affirm the dismissal of housey infringement claims.
background 
housey is the assignee of patents,and collectively the housey patents,all entitled method of screening for protein inhibitors and activators.the patents are directed to a method of screening for substances which specifically inhibit or activate a particular protein affecting the cultural or morphological characteristics of the cell expressing the protein.pat,ll.the expression of the particular protein referred to as the protein of interest results in a change in one or more identifiable characteristics of the cells expressing it.according to the disclosed and claimed method,a cell line is produced that is characterized by a higher production of the protein of interest relative to an original cell line.by applying substances agents to both cell lines,it is possible to determine whether the agent is an activator or inhibitor of protein activity thus,for example,if a link between a protein and a disease is discovered,the disclosed method provides a process for identifying the effect that different agents have on the activity of the suspect protein.
on march,bayer ag and bayer corporation bayer filed a complaint seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity,unenforceability,and of the housey patents.on march,housey filed an answer to the complaint and asserted a counterclaim for infringement of the housey patents.the counterclaim alleged that bayer directly infringed claims of each of the and contributed to infringement or induced others to infringe the.answer to complaint and counterclaim at.additionally,housey alleged that bayer infringed the method claims of the patents in suit pursuant to g.id.at.the factual basis of housey infringement claim as stated in the counterclaim was that 
pursuant to,this court may presume that a product was made by housey patented methods where there is a substantial likelihood that it was so made by and housey has made reasonable efforts to determine the process actually used.here,there is substantial likelihood that housey methods were used by bayer to make the characterization of a pharmacologically active agent.further,housey has requested the defendants to identify the methods used in its facilities,but the sic bayer has failed to do so.housey has made the required reasonable efforts.
on april,bayer filed a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure with respect to housey counterclaim for infringement under g,arguing that the provision applies only to methods of manufacture,and does not apply to housey method patent claims which cover methods of use,not methods of manufacturing.pls.br.in supp.of their mot.to dismiss infringement claim under g at.bayer argued that section g is inapplicable as a matter of law and housey claim for infringement of its method claims under section g should be dismissed.id.bayer characterized housey infringement allegations as follows 
bayer is liable as an infringer when it sells in the united states a pharmaceutical composition containing a substance determined to be an inhibitor or activator of a target protein by use either in the united states or abroad of the housey united states patented methods.
bayer ab is liable as an infringer when it imports into the united states research data or information obtained from using the housey patented methods.
in its opposition to bayer motion to dismiss,housey similarly described its counterclaim for infringement under g as comprising two separate claims,the first of which was directed to the critical information,the identification and characterization of a drug,which is made by the patented process and the second of which was directed to the drug made by the patented process.ict opp to bayer mot.to dismiss g claim at.the parties,therefore,were in substantial agreement as to the scope of the counterclaim for infringement,characterizing it as extending to both the importation of a pharmaceutical composition identified by the patented process and the importation of information generated by the patented process.
the district court interpreted housey infringement claim under g to encompass 
the sale in the united states of a drug that was determined to be an inhibitor or activator of a target protein using the patented methods and import ation into or use in the united states of knowledge and information reflecting the identification or characterization of a drug acquired from using the patented methods.
bayer ag housey,supp.based on this interpretation,the court dismissed housey claim for infringement under g for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the court concluded that u pon a plain reading of the statute,section g addresses only products derived from patented manufacturing processes,methods of actually making or creating a product as opposed to methods of gathering information about,or identifying,a substance worthy of further development.id.at.on august,the court entered final judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure in favor of bayer on housey section g counterclaims.housey timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a

this case presents questions concerning the interpretation of g,which provides 
whoever without authority imports into the united states or offers to sell,sells,or uses within the united states a product which is made by a process patented in the united states shall be liable as an infringer,if the importation,offer to sell,sale,or use of the product occurs during the term of such process patent a product which is made by a patented process will,for purposes of this title,not be considered to be so made after 
it is materially changed by subsequent processes or 
it becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another product.
g emphases added.we are concerned here in particular with the meaning of the phrase a product which is made by a patented process.we have construed portions of this statute in a number of previous cases.see,mycogen plant,monsanto.however,this case presents issues not previously addressed.when interpreting statutory language,words of a statute are given their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.williams taylor,d citations omitted.dictionaries of the english language provide the ordinary meaning of words used in statutes.see,carey saffold,d.
housey offers two theories as to why section g is applicable here.first,it contends that the information produced by bayer using the patented processes claimed in the housey patents is itself a product made by a patented process.bayer,in turn,argues that the word made means manufactured and that information is not a manufactured product.there is no serious dispute between the parties concerning the second of these two propositions if only products that have been manufactured are within the scope of g,it necessarily follows that the statute applies only to physical goods and that information is not included.webster third new international dictionary webster defines the verb form of manufacture as to make as raw material into a product suitable for use to make from raw materials by hand or by machinery.webster at.similarly,random house webster unabridged dictionary random house defines manufacture as the making of goods or wares by manual labor or by machinery.random house at ed emphasis added these definitions are consistent in referring to tangible objects and not intangibles such as information.thus,the production of information is not within the scope of processes of manufacture.see webster at random house at see also diamond chakrabarty,d.housey,in fact,does not argue that information is within the statute if the term made is construed to mean manufactured.appellant br.at.we thus turn to the central the statutory term made means manufactured.
as used in the statute,the term made is the past tense of the verb make.the dictionaries offer multiple definitions of the term make.some definitions are limited to manufacturing,for example,to bring a material thing into being by forming,shaping,or altering material fashion,manufacture.webster at other definitions broadly encompass activities in addition to manufacturing.for example,webster defines make as form as a result of calculation or design.id under these circumstances the text is ambiguous,and we must look beyond the particular language being construed.
in order to resolve the ambiguity in the statutory language,we look first to other provisions of the statute.see pollard du pont de nemours,d gade solid wastes mgmt,d.in a related section of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of which added g,the act describes a person that uses a patented process to produce a product as a manufacturer.b b iii.similarly,section b a refers to a person then engaged in the manufacture of a product as a person that makes the product.by referring to the party that produces a product as a manufacturer and the maker as a person engaged in the manufacture of a product,the statute clearly contemplates that made means manufactured.
there are other indications as well that the statute is concerned exclusively with products that are physical goods produced by a manufacturing process.one statutory exception to section g rules out infringement where the allegedly infringing product is materially changed by subsequent processes.g.housey position that information itself is a product is difficult to reconcile with the existence of this exception,which appears to contemplate a change in a physical product.similarly,the second exception to section g,which provides that there is no infringement where the accused product becomes a trivial and nonessential component of another product,also appears to contemplate a physical product.
however,housey urges that the use of the term manufacture in suggests that made by as used in section g should not be limited to methods of manufacture.section defines the scope of patentable subject matter as including any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof.housey theory is that congress used the word manufacture when it wished to refer to manufacturing,and therefore,must have intended a different meaning when using the phrase made by.we do not agree.we first note that the usage of manufacture in section as cited by housey is the noun form of the word and not the verb form.thus,housey has pointed to no provision in the patent act where congress used the term manufacture to denote the process of manufacturing.in any event,the supreme court has said,congress,needless to say,is permitted to use synonyms in a statute.tyler cain,d interpreting the statutory language made as synonymous with held see also,davis united states,d holding that the statutory language for the use of is synonymous with in trust.housey position suggests an unrealistic level of clarity in congressional word selection.we see nothing in section that suggests that made in section g should be construed to be broader than manufacture.
the legislative history leads to the same conclusion that congress was concerned solely with physical goods that had undergone manufacture.
the history of the enactment of the process patents amendments act is quite long.see eli lilly american cyanamid.section g was not enacted on an entirely blank slate.rather,it was designed to provide new remedies to supplement existing remedies available from the international trade commission itc under.see.at.section section of the tariff act of defines u nfair methods of competition in import trade.a a.one of these statutory unfair methods of competition is the t he importation into the united states,the sale for importation,or the sale within the united states after importation by the owner,importer,or consignee,of articles that are made,produced,processed,or mined under,or by means of,a process covered by the claims of a valid and enforceable united states patent.a b see also a a referring to unfair acts in the importation of articles.when enacting g,congress recognized the availability of redress from the itc,but noted that the remedies available thereunder were insufficient to fully protect the owners of process patents.at.thus,the legislative history suggests that section g was intended to address the same articles as were addressed by section,but to add additional rights against importers of such articles.
even if the legislative history did not affirmatively suggest an intent to limit coverage to manufactured articles in accordance with section,we have been directed to nothing in the legislative history suggesting that congress was concerned that the preexisting statutory scheme failed to reach intangible information,or that the substantive coverage of the act,as opposed to the available remedies,was to be expanded.each and every reference to the provision that became section g describes it as directed to manufacturing.
for example,a provision similar to section g as enacted was proposed as part of an earlier bill in both the house of representatives and the senate in,cong,cong.two new acts of infringement were to be created by the proposed legislation infringement by importation,sale,or use of a product made in another country by a process patented in the united states the precursor to section g and infringement by supplying the material components of a patented invention intending that such components will be combined outside the united states the provision that became section f.id.the second new act of infringement was a response to the supreme court decision in deepsouth packing laitram,d,which held that the intentional exportation of components to be combined into a patented article was not an act of infringement.cong.rec.together,the two new statutory acts of infringement were intended to avoid encouraging manufacturing outside the united states.id.emphasis added.
a subsequent bill in the following year again proposed a precursor of section g i f the patent invention is a process,whoever without authority uses or sells within,or imports into,the united states during the term of the patent therefor a product produced by such process infringes the patent.at discussing,cong.according to the senate report,a principal aim of was t o declare it to be patent infringement to import into,or to use or sell in the united states,a product manufactured by a patented process.id.at emphasis added.
again in,language was proposed substantially similar to section g as it now exists,at the house report reasoned that 
the failure of american patent law to make unlawful the importation of goods made using an american process patent has deep historical roots.american patent the law of other not have an extraterritorial effect with respect to process patents,courts have reasoned that the only act of infringement is the act of making through the use of a patented process therefore,there can be not infringement if that act occurs outside the united states.although the courts are correctly construing current law,this rationale is inadequate public policy because it ignores the reality that the offending act is the importation of a product made through the use of a protected process patent or its subsequent sale within the united states.
id.at emphasis added.here,the report equates products with physical goods.
a senate report on substantially identical legislation also supports limiting the statute to manufactured tangible products.according to the report t he primary target of the process patentholder wil
