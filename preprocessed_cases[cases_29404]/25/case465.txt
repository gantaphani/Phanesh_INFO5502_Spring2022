advanced biofuels llc butamax owns pat.patent and patent collectively,the and appeals a final judgment entered against it following the district court claim construction and denial of butamax motion for summary judgment of literal infringement of the asserted claims of the and patents by gevo,gevo,grant of gevo motion for summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents of the asserted claims of the and patents,grant of gevo motion for summary judgment of invalidity of claims and of the patent for lack of written description,and judgment of invalidity of claims and of the patent for lack of enablement.opinion,advanced biofuels llc gevo,slr,wl.march,opinion.because the district court erred in its claim construction,this court vacates the district court denial of butamax motion for summary judgment of infringement and its grant of gevo motion of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents.because the district court failed to recognize the existence of genuine issues of material fact on gevo motion for summary judgment of invalidity as to claims and of the patent,this court reverses the district court grant of that motion.finally,this court reverses the grant of summary judgment of invalidity for lack of enablement because that judgment appears to have been a scrivener error.
background 
a.the patent 
the patent covers a recombinant microbial host cell that uses a particular biosynthetic pathway to produce isobutanol,which is useful as a fuel or fuel additive.opinion at.the claimed biosynthetic pathway comprises essentially five steps.see patent.
claim of the patent recites the first four steps 
a recombinant microbial host cell comprising heterologous dna molecules encoding polypeptides that catalyze substrate to product conversions for each step below 
i pyruvate to acetolactate 
ii acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate 
iii dihydroxyisovalerate to and 
iv to isobutyraldehyde 
wherein said microbial host cell produces isobutanol and wherein 
a the polypeptide that catalyzes a substrate to product conversion of pyruvate to acetolactate is acetolactate synthase having the ec number 
b the polypeptide that catalyzes a substrate to product conversion of acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate is acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase having the ec number 
c the polypeptide that catalyzes a substrate to product conversion of dihydroxyisovalerate to is acetohydroxy acid dehydratase having the ec number 
d the polypeptide that catalyzes a substrate to product conversion of to isobutyraldehyde is acid decarboxylase having the ec number.
patent ll.emphasis added.in the fifth step,isobutyraldehyde is converted into isobutanol.see patent ll.dependent claim,reciting a method for producing isobutanol from the recombinant microbial host cell of claim.
claim depends from claim and recites a host cell according to claim wherein the acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase has an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of seq id no,seq id no,seq id no,and seq id no.patent ll.seq id no is a sequence of methanococcus.
this appeal primarily concerns step ii the conversion of acetolactate al to dihydroxyisovalerate dhiv,catalyzed by the polypeptide enzyme acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase also known as reductoisomerase,or kari having the ec number.kari assists reactions by rearranging,isomerizing a reagent and also by reducing the process of adding electrons this rearranged molecule.to accomplish the reduction,kari needs a source for the added electrons.this electron source is known as the cofactor or coenzyme.two such cofactors are nadh nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen and nadph nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen.
the patent specification provides definitions to be used for the interpretation of the claims,including a definition of kari 
an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate using nadph reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor.preferred acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductases are known by the ec number and sequences are available from a vast array of microorganisms,including but not limited to methanococcus maripaludis 
ec number,referenced in both this definition and claim,is an enzyme commission number for an enzyme known by the names kari,acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase,and several other names.the ec enzyme classification system was developed in the to standardize enzyme nomenclature.opinion at.notably,rule of the ec system states that f or oxidoreductases using nad or nadp the oxidized states of nadh and nadph,respectively,the coenzyme should always be named as the acceptor unless a certain exception applies,which is irrelevant here.id.however,it also appears common to assign different ec numbers to the same enzyme,where the difference between the numbers is the identity of the cofactor named.id.at.ec number names only nadp as an acceptor,and neither party calls attention to another ec number for kari naming any other cofactor as an acceptor.
butamax alleges that gevo infringes claim of the patent and claims,and dependent therefrom,as well as claim and claims,and dependent therefrom.
b.the patent 
the patent issued from a divisional of the application from which the patent issued.the patents specifications largely are identical,each for example including the kari definition quoted above.see patent ll.the patent focuses on a method of producing isobutanol from a recombinant yeast microorganism that expresses the biosynthetic pathway described above.
claim of the patent states 
a method for producing isobutanol comprising 
providing a fermentation media comprising carbon substrate and 
contacting said media with a recombinant yeast microorganism expressing an engineered isobutanol biosynthetic pathway wherein said pathway comprises the following substrate to product conversions 
pyruvate to acetolactate pathway step a 
ii.acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate pathway step b 
iii.dihydroxyisovalerate to pathway step c 
iv.to isobutyraldehyde pathway step d and 
isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol pathway step e 
and wherein 
a the substrate to product conversion of step i is performed by an acetolactate synthase enzyme 
b the substrate to product conversion of step ii is performed by an acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase enzyme 
c the substrate to product conversion of step iii is performed by an acetohydroxy acid dehydratase enzyme 
d the substrate to product conversion of step iv is performed by a decarboxylase enzyme and 
e the substrate to product conversion of step v is performed by an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme 
whereby isobutanol is produced.
patent ll.as with the patent,the primary issue with the patent on appeal involves step ii the conversion of al to dhiv using acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase enzyme,kari.unlike claim of the patent,claim of the patent does not refer to any ec classification number.
butamax alleges that gevo has infringed claim of the patent and claims and dependent therefrom.
c.the parties and previous proceedings 
butamax was formed in as a joint venture between du pont de nemours and du pont and bp biofuels north america llc.the applications that led to the are part of du pont previous research and development into isobutanol production.the have been assigned to butamax.
gevo was incorporated in as methanotech,and likewise pursues isobutanol production.gevo uses mutant kari enzymes that when using nadh as a cofactor exhibit significantly lower km michaelis menten constant for the al to dhiv conversion than when using nadph as a cofactor.this indicates that the reaction rate with gevo mutant enzymes is much faster with nadh than with nadph.
on january,butamax sued gevo in the district court and on september,moved for a preliminary injunction predicated on the patent.the district court construed the kari term as an enzyme that is solely and denied the motion.butamax tm advanced biofuels llc gevo,app x.this court affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction.id.however,this court noted that the district court construction of the kari term was very questionable and asked the district court to reconsider its construction when it holds the markman hearing.id.
at the markman hearing,the district court construed the term as an enzyme known by the ec number that catalyzes the conversion of acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate and is.opinion at.additionally,adopting butamax proposed construction,the district court construed the patent term pathway step a pathway step b pathway step c pathway step d pathway step e to mean the pathway steps are contiguous steps such that the product of step a is the substrate for step b the product of step b is the substrate for step c id.at.
at the district court,butamax moved for summary judgment of infringement of the and for a judgment of no invalidity of the patent.opinion at.gevo moved for summary judgment of invalidity and.id.in a memorandum opinion,the district court denied butamax motion for summary judgment of infringement.the district court granted gevo motion for summary judgment of noninfringement as it related to the doctrine of equivalents,but otherwise denied the motion.each of butamax motion of no invalidity and gevo motion for invalidity was granted by the district court with respect to some claims and denied with respect to others.relevant to this appeal,the district court granted gevo invalidity motion and denied butamax motion of no invalidity with respect to claims and of the patent,finding the claims lacking in written description support.opinion at.the district court issued an order reflecting the memorandum opinion and also holding claims and the patent invalid for lack of enablement,a ground not raised in the motions of the parties.
butamax appeals the claim construction of the kari term,the denial of butamax motion for summary judgment of literal infringement,the grant of gevo motion for summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents,the grant of gevo motion for summary judgment of invalidity of claims and of the patent for inadequate written description,and the order also holding those same claims invalid for lack of enablement.this court has jurisdiction under a.

claim construction 
the primary dispute between the parties concerns whether the claimed kari must be.the district court considered the patents specifications,prosecution histories,and the extrinsic evidence such as expert testimony and the ec enzyme classification system and other enzyme databases.it concluded that in the state of the art,the kari enzyme known by the ec number was generally understood to be nadphdependent.opinion at.this decision is premised in large part on the district court conclusion that the patentees acted as their own lexicographers in defining kari by reference to ec number and the enzyme use of nadph rather than use of nadh or both nadph and nadh.id.at.the district court therefore construed the kari term as an enzyme known by the ec number that catalyzes the conversion of acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate and is.id.at.
butamax argues that the district court erred because kari plain meaning merely refers to an enzyme catalyzing the al to dhiv conversion and because the patentees did not expressly relinquish any of that claim scope in the specification or the prosecution history.butamax contends that the patentees in defining kari did not clearly express an intent to redefine kari to be.in support,butamax points to the other claims,the embodiments provided in the specifications,and extrinsic evidence including contemporary scientific literature,a database referenced in ec number,and gevo use of ec number to describe its own enzymes.
gevo disagrees,arguing that the district court construed the term correctly.gevo contends that the specifications definition of kari demonstrates that the patentees did clearly express an intent to specify kari as,and points to other aspects of the specifications as well as the prosecution histories in support.gevo further contends that extrinsic evidence,such as ec number and its references,the ec rules,and butamax internal documents and subsequent patent applications indicate that the claimed kari must be.
generally,claim terms are 
given their ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and prosecution history.there are only two exceptions to this general rule when a patentee sets out a definition and acts as his own lexicographer,or when the patentee disavows the full scope of a claim term either in the specification or during prosecution.
thorner,at citation omitted.to act as its own lexicographer,a patentee must clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim term other than its plain and ordinary meaning.id.at quoting ccs fitness,brunswick.it is not enough for a patentee to simply disclose a single embodiment or use a word in the same manner in all embodiments,the patentee must clearly express an intent to redefine the term.id.citing helmsderfer bobrick washroom.
kari ordinary meaning 
the initial inquiry is whether the plain meaning of kari indicates that the enzyme is.while the district court found that the scientific references almost exclusively characterize kari enzymes as,opinion at,there is nothing in the record to indicate that persons of ordinary skill in the art in understood the plain meaning to be limited to dependence on nadph as a cofactor.gevo conceded as much at the district court,acknowledging that under kari plain meaning,the enzyme converts al to dhiv using nadh or nadph as a cofactor.see joint appendix.
we agree that the plain meaning of kari itself imposes no limitation on the cofactor or source of electrons for the al to dhiv conversion.the question then becomes whether the asserted claims are limited,as gevo contends,to the use of nadph only based principally on the explicit definition set forth in the.see.
ii.the specifications and claims 
a.the patentees definition of kari 
the patents provide definitions of several terms,noting that t he following definitions and abbreviations are to be used for the interpretation of the claims and specification.patent ll.as described above,the patents subsequently define kari as 
an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetolactate to dihydroxyisovalerate using nadph reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as an electron donor.preferred acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductases are known by the ec number and sequences are available from a vast array of microorganisms,including but not limited to methanococcus maripaludis 
it can not be disputed that the patentees offered a definition of kari.it is disputed,however,whether this definition clearly expresses an intent to redefine kari in a way that differs from the plain and ordinary meaning identified above and,if so,the extent of any such difference.gevo contends that the phrase using nadph as an electron donor is a clear expression of the patentees intent to exclude kari that are not nadphdependent.
butamax disagrees and asserts that the fact that an enzyme can catalyze the conversion of al to dhiv using nadph does not,on its own,indicate that the enzyme can not also use other cofactors,such as nadh,to catalyze that conversion.
gevo argues that butamax interpretation reads out an important aspect of the patentees definition of kari because all kari are capable of using nadph as a cofactor.thus,gevo argues it would have been completely unnecessary for the patents to have referred to using nadph in the first instance.gevo also argues that the phrase using nadph must be understood in light of other aspects of the specifications.gevo first contends that the specifications use the term use s nadph interchangeably with the phrase.gevo points to this passage 
a lcohol dehydrogenase vi and use nadph as electron donor.an nadphdependent reductase,yqhd,has also been recently identified in coli 
patent ll.the patents further describe as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase.id.at ll.however,i t is not enough for a patentee to simply disclose a single embodiment or use a word in the same manner in all embodiments.thorner,at.
we agree with butamax and find no reason to constrict the phrase using nadph to mean only use nadph or.we also disagree with gevo argument that such an interpretation reads out an important part of the patentees definition.the patents definition at least excludes kari enzymes that could catalyze the conversion of al to dhiv without using nadph at all.moreover,the description of specific types of kari as does not clearly express an intent to redefine all kari using nadph as kari that must be.
next,gevo points to the patents descriptions of other enzymes that use or utilize either nad or nadh nadph as an electron donor.id.at ll.gevo contends that the patentees knew how to describe enzymes that used nadh or both nadh and nadph and that the patentees instead chose to define kari as using only nadph.
butamax counters that the patents descriptions of other enzymes using or utilizing various cofactors merely is a reference to particular ec numbers or the assays for the enzymes in question.for example,butamax contends that the standard assay for kari is the arfin umbarger assay,which uses nadph to measure kari activity by monitoring the consumption of nadph in the presence of acetolactate and the enzyme in question.appellant br.the patents example expressly teaches to measure kari activity using the method described by arfin and umbarger,patent ll.example teaches using the same method.id.at ll.butamax also argues that the patents reference to using nadph merely matches the description of the enzyme in ec number,which notes the use of nadp but is silent as to nad or nadh.butamax notes that the other enzymes in question from the specifications have multiple ec numbers each referring to nadh,nadph,or both nadh and nadph have multiple different assays for their identification each assay using a different cofactor.thus,butamax argues that the patentees merely referred the other cofactors where appropriate.appellant br.
we agree with butamax that the references to other enzymes as either using nad or using nadh nadph do not imply that the patentees intended to limit kari use of nadh.the patentees description of kari merely corresponds with the arfin umbarger assay and the description of kari in ec number.
reference to ec number in claim 
the patent claim explicitly states that the enzyme in question is acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase having the ec number.patent ll.as described above,ec number identifies nadp as the cofactor,but does not itself mention nad or nadh.see appellee br.the ec rules provide that for an enzyme using both nadh and nadph,the entry should always name both cofactors.gevo contends that this confirms that a person of ordinary skill in the art understood kari having ec number to be.
it must first be appreciated that the ec nomenclature was drafted to categorize enzymes and that new ec numbers generally are not created for modified forms of enzymes that might rely on different cofactors.see.the nomenclature is also not necessarily complete.in,for example,it was known that some kari,such as kari from at least some species of methanococcus,can use either cofactor effectively.significantly,methanococcus was explicitly recited in butamax own definition as a preferred kari and recited in dependent claim.patent ll.
butamax points to additional evidence showing persons of skill in the art would have understood that ec number enzymes need not be.the ec number entry contains a link to the brenda database braunchschweig enzyme database,which contains a reference to a mutated kari enzyme in which nadh can substitute for nadph.appellant br.the district court discounted this lone reference because it was the only reference out of many indicating that nadh could be substituted and because the specific enzyme in question was a quadruplet mutant.opinion at.
however,even a single reference to mutant kari under ec number is particularly important here because the accused enzymes also are mutants.butamax points to evidence that gevo in approximately prior to the litigation described its own mutant enzymes by reference to ec number.see,appellant br.and of course gevo contends that its enzymes are not.though this evidence identified by butamax did not exist until years after the were filed in,the brenda entry for ec number referred to a mutant kari that was not and was known prior to,and gevo years later indicated that ec number still would have been the best way they knew how to describe its own mutant enzyme.appellant br.citing testimony of gevo former executive vice president of technology.see,asm,genus,concluding that extrinsic evidence that the patent filing date nonetheless was helpful in determining how a person of ordinary skill in the art would have understood the claim term at the time it was filed.
for the foregoing reasons,the court can not conclude that the reference to ec number is an expression of a clear intent to redefine kari to be nadphdependent.
preferred embodiments and dependent claims 
other aspects of the patents raise further doubt of any express intent to redefine kari in the limited way adopted by the district court.as above,the patents specifically list methanococcus maripaludis seq id no as a source organism for the preferred kari.patent at ll.moreover,dependent claim of the patent claims that kari.patent ll.butamax contends that it would be wrong to conclude that kari from this organism are,pointing to evidence that at least some methanococcus kari are able to utilize nadh as well as nadph and have broad specificity for nadph and nadh.further,butamax notes that nadh supported of the methanococcal activity obtained with nadph.see xing whitman,characterization of enzymes of the branched chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway in methanococcus spp,bacteriology xing.
the district court discounted xing because it provided no references or data to support these findings.opinion at noting that xing included a single conclusory sentence with no data or other literature references to support it.however,xing accuracy is not in dispute.indeed,gevo.cites to xing for this very proposition.gevo does note that the patents identify the kari of methanococcus maripaludis while xing examined the kari of methanococcus aeolicus,a different species of methanococcus.however,there is no genuine dispute that methanococcus maripaludis exhibits similar characteristics.see appellant reply br.
the district court claim construction,without justification,excludes a preferred embodiment,which in this case also is the subject of dependent claim,and this court normally do es not interpret claim terms in a way that excludes embodiments disclosed in the specification.oatey ips.
iii.prosecution history 
gevo also contends that the prosecution history evinces an express intent to redefine kari to be nadphdependent.the patent office separately rejected butamax claims for lack of enablement and for lack of written description,and gevo contends that the patentees responses demonstrated that the claimed kari are.
in the application leading to the patent,the patent office rejected for inadequate written description a claim which stated 
a recombinant microbial host cell comprising at least one dna molecule encoding a polypeptide that catalyzes a substrate to product conversion selected from the grou
