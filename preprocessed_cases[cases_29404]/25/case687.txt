milton goldenberg goldenberg and immunomedics,collectively,immunomedics,appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of united states patent the patent in favor of cytogen,and bard,collectively,cytogen,by the united states district court for the district of new jersey.goldenberg cytogen,wl,aet,summary judgment opinion.while we agree with the district court claim construction,and that summary judgment of no literal infringement was appropriate,we disagree with the grant of summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents.accordingly,we,and remand.
background 
a.the patents and the prosecution history 
the patent is entitled tumor localization and therapy with labeled antibodies specific to intracellular markers.the invention is a method for detecting and localizing tumors by targeting intracellular marker substances that are produced by or associated with tumor cells.patent,ll.the claimed method includes injecting a subject with a radioactively highlighted antibody specific to the marking substance,which,when scanned,reveals the location of concentrations of the marking substance within the body.claim of the patent claims 
a method for detecting and localizing a tumor which either produces or is associated with an intracellular marker substance,which comprises injecting a subject parenterally with an antibody specific to said marker substance and radiolabeled with a pharmacologically inert radioisotope capable of detection using a photoscanning device,and subsequently scanning with said device to detect and locate the site or sites of uptake of said labeled antibody by said tumor with the proviso that when said antibody is an antibody specific to human chlorionic sic gonadotropin or its,said radioisotope is other than.
id.at,ll.emphases added.
the written description of the patent does not define the term intracellular marker substance.it does,however,discuss the previous understanding in the art that tumor localization required antibodies which were specific to antigens located on the surface of the tumor cell id.at,ll.the written description further explains 
the antibodies used in the present invention are specific to a variety of intracellular antigens as marker substances.these markers may be substances produced by the tumor or may be substances which accumulate within tumor cells,whether in the cytoplasm,the nucleus or in various organelles or subcellular structures.
id.at,ll.emphasis added.
the patent issued on july,from an application,ser.the application,filed by goldenberg on may.the application is a continuation of another application,ser.the application.goldenberg also filed a second application,ser.the application,simultaneously with the application.the application led to a application,ser.the application,which resulted in united states patent the patent.in the first office action after the filing of the and applications,the examiner rejected the claims of the application in their entirety.claims and of the application were specifically rejected on double patenting grounds over the application.
attempting to overcome the examiner rejection,goldenberg explained 
t he method and compositions claimed in the application relate to intracellular tumor associated antigens.before the work of the present inventor,the art did not know that antibodies to such intracellular antigens,human chorionic gonadotrophin hcg and afp could be successfully used for tumor localization and therapy.accordingly,the claims of the present application do not overlap claims in the application,since the latter application claims methods and compositions for tumor localization and therapy to cea alone.
response to office action dated march,at.in the same response,immunomedics explained a s noted above,the claims of the application do not overlap with claims to methods and compositions for tumor localization and therapy using radiolabeled antibodies to cea,a cell surface antigen.id.at emphasis in original.
throughout the response,goldenberg distinguished the methods of the application,which focused on intracellular antigens,from the subject matter of the application,which involved cell surface antigens.see,id.at the present specification explains that the prior art considered that tumor localization in man using injected radiolabeled antigens required antibodies which were specific to antigens located on the surface of the tumor cell.emphasis added id.at reid relates to a surface glycoprotein useful in identifying the presence of tumors id.at furthermore,it was not known prior to applicant work in this field that antibodies to antigens would preferentially localize in human tumors.emphasis added id.at the reference discloses that cea is a surface antigen whereas afp is a cytoplasmic or intracellular antigen.despite the frequency with which the distinction appears in the prosecution history,the application did not define intracellular marker substance.
the examiner allowed claims of the application,which issued as united states patent on november.goldenberg also continued the prosecution of the remaining claims in the application with the application,which resulted in the patent.on september,immunomedics filed the application,a of the application.the application defined the term cell surface antigen and incorporated by reference a article by singer and garth nicholson the singer article which contained a further discussion of various antigens associated with a cell membrane.the application matured into the patent on april.
b.the accused product 
cytogen manufactures and sells prostascint.prostascint contains the antibody,which is specific to prostate specific membrane antigen psma.psma is a transmembrane antigen,extending through the cell membrane and having both intracellular and extracellular domains.is covered by united states patent,which is assigned to cytogen.the binding site,or epitope,for is located on the of psma,which is on the cytoplasmic side,interior of the cell wall.to use prostascint,the radiolabeled antibody is injected into a patient,who is then photographed with a camera designed to detect radiation.because the antibody targets and binds to psma,images from the camera reveal concentrations of the combination and,by association,the location of the tumor.
c.the district court proceedings 
immunomedics filed suit against cytogen in the district of new jersey on february,alleging infringement of method claims,and of the patent both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents.claim is the only independent claim.the district court held a markman hearing and provided the parties with its claim construction on november.goldenberg cytogen,aet,claim construction opinion.the only disputed term was intracellular marker substance in claim,which had no commonly accepted meaning outside the context of the patent.id.at.the parties agree that the term has no commonly accepted meaning.
turning to the written description of the patent,the district court noted the discussion in the patent of the need for a method of tumor localization not confined to cell surface antigens.id.at.the district court also noted the prosecution history of the patent and the repeated distinction drawn between intracellular and cell surface antigens.id.at.upon concluding its review of the intrinsic evidence,the district court also considered the extrinsic evidence of two expert witness depositions.id.at.the district court explained that the intrinsic evidence provide d only an amorphous interpretation of the disputed term and finally accepted the deposition testimony of goldenberg,the inventor,which defined intracellular marker substance as an antigen existing within a body cell.id.at emphasis added.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment based on the claim construction.summary judgment opinion at.on july,the court denied both parties motions,explaining that there remained a genuine factual dispute as to whether prostascint infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.id.at.specifically,the district court was uncertain of the relationship between psma and the cell interior,and also whether the binding location of to psma was intracellular.following its denial of the motions,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing to allow both sides an opportunity to present additional information through expert testimony.id.after the hearing,both parties renewed their summary judgment motions.
at this time,the district court granted cytogen motions for summary judgment of no literal infringement and of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.in doing so,the court first addressed whether psma was a cell surface antigen.id.at.the district court rejected immunomedics argument that,because psma was a transmembrane antigen,it could be both a cell surface and an intracellular marker substance,depending on where the targeted binding site was located.instead,the court explained,prostascint targeting of a portion of psma at the interior domain would not change the character of the antigen as being integral to the plasma membrane and being termed a cell surface antigen.id.at.the district court found cytogen expert not only helpful in clarifying the subject matter but also very persuasive.id.
next,the district court rejected immunomedics argument that referencing the patent was improper.id.at.although the patent was not related to the patent,the court explained,goldenberg distinguished the parent application of the patent the application to overcome the examiner rejection during prosecution.the court consequently relied on both the definition and the reference to the singer article in the patent.based on the testimony and the statements from the patent,the district court concluded that psma was a cell surface antigen and was therefore outside of the literal scope of claim.id.at.regarding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,however,the district court found it improper to rely on the prosecution history of the patent for estoppel purposes.id.at.relying on abbott laboratories dey,the court found that there was an insufficient connection between the and patents to permit statements made during the prosecution of the patent to create an estoppel for equivalents under the patent.despite the insufficiency,the district court found that immunomedics argument for insubstantial differences between prostascint and the claims of the patent entirely ignored the surface distinction that goldenberg had drawn in the patent,and immunomedics argument therefore failed as a matter of law.because immunomedics equivalents argument did not address the surface distinction,the district court concluded that immunomedics had not met the requirements of the test and granted cytogen motion for summary judgment.summary judgment opinion at.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
claim construction is a question of law subject to de novo review on appeal.cybor fas,en banc.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d moore,standard register.summary judgment on the issue of literal infringement is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists,in particular,when no reasonable jury could find that every limitation recited in the properly construed claim either is or is not found in the accused device.bai l l wings.summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents is appropriate if no reasonable jury could determine two elements to be equivalent.leggett platt,hickory springs,quoting hilton davis chem,d.
claim construction 
claim construction begins with the intrinsic evidence of record.vitronics conceptronic.in construing patent claims,there is a heavy presumption that the terms carry their ordinary and customary meanings as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d ccs fitness,brunswick.where a claim term has no ordinary and customary meaning,a court must resort to the remaining intrinsic written description and the prosecution obtain the meaning of that term.see lear siegler,aeroquip.extrinsic evidence,although not part of the intrinsic evidence,may be used to aid a court in construing claim terms as they would be understood in the relevant art,but may not be used to vary the meaning disclosed by the patent itself.markman,at.
the district court construed intracellular marker substance to mean an antigen existing within a body cell.claim construction opinion at.immunomedics challenges this construction by arguing that,in the absence of an ordinary meaning,the written description must be controlling.immunomedics explains that neither claim nor the written description require a marker substance to be an entire antigen or that the marker substance be wholly within a cell.to the contrary,immunomedics continues,the intrinsic evidence actually precludes that interpretation by permitting of antigens to qualify as marker substances.immunomedics urges us to construe intracellular marker substance to mean an antigen or a portion thereof that is located inside a cell.appellants br.at emphasis added.under this interpretation,if the epitope for the specific antibody is located within the cell,the claim limitation is satisfied.
we disagree with the construction urged by immunomedics.the parties agree that the term marker substance has no accepted meaning to one of ordinary skill in the art,and we find no reason to disagree with their conclusion.accordingly,we construe it only as broadly as is provided for by the patent itself.see johnson worldwide assocs.zebco,eaton,atl.paste glue,in this case,the dispositive claim limitation is a term unknown to those of ordinary skill in the art at the time the patent application was filed.it thus fell to the applicants,as a duty,to provide a precise definition for the limitation.lear siegler,at.the patent discloses different antigens that are described as suitable marker substances.patent,to.at a minimum,therefore,the patent clearly regards antigens as falling within the scope of marker substances.in addition to antigens,both claim and the written description refer specifically to the beta of human chorionic gonadotropin hcg antigen.
immunomedics broadly construes as encompassing any portion of an antigen,including epitopes.as cytogen points out,however,hcg is a dimeric antigen,which means that it is composed of two individual protein held loosely together by ionic and hydrophobic forces.each is itself a whole protein molecule.the alpha is common to several hormones,but the beta is unique to hcg.see dorland illustrated medical dictionary ed.due to its uniqueness,antibodies targeting the beta will only localize concentrations of hcg,while those antibodies targeting the alpha may errantly identify concentrations of an entirely different hormone.thus,contrary to immunomedics argument,the reference to the beta of hcg is not a reference to portions of antigens generally,but is instead a reference to a very specific and molecule in the field of immunology the beta in the dimeric antigen hcg.the inclusion of the in the claims and the written description,therefore,does not support a reading of the claims as broadly as immunomedics requests.eaton,at.
the prosecution history further reveals the inventor understanding of the term marker substance as synonymous with antigen.for example,goldenberg explained the method and compositions claimed in the present application relate to antibodies to intracellular antigens.response to office action dated march,at emphasis omitted nowhere does the prosecution history suggest that a marker substance includes epitopes as immunomedics would now have us construe the term.accordingly,we will not read the claim scope that broadly.see eaton,at.nor does immunomedics argue that psma is characteristically similar to the dimeric hcg antigen.because neither the patent specification nor the prosecution history supports the breadth of construction that immunomedics desires,we affirm the district court claim construction of marker substance as an antigen,but clarify that molecular,such as those present in the hcg antigen,qualify as antigens under this construction.
we also agree with the district court that the marker substance must be wholly internal to the cell.cytogen argues,and immunomedics does not dispute,that none of the example antigens provided in the patent associates in any way with the membrane of the cells in which they are found.the written description further describes intracellular marker substances as those which are produced by tumor cells or accumulate in the cytoplasm,the nucleus or in various organelles or structures of tumor cells.patent,ll.each of the listed structures is completely internal to the cell.the prosecution history further supports this understanding,specifically explaining that hcg is a cytoplasmic antigen.response to office action dated october,at emphasis added.finally,the ordinary meaning of intracellular,as reflected by its dictionary definition,lends additional support to the interpretation adopted by the district court.see dorland illustrated medical dictionary defining intracellular as within a cell.combining the terms,an intracellular marker substance must be an antigen existing within a cell.this is the construction adopted by the district court,which we now affirm.
in addition to the intrinsic evidence,the district court permitted expert testimony at the summary judgment hearing.immunomedics criticizes the district court use of expert testimony as impermissible,citing this court prohibition on using extrinsic evidence to vary the meaning of claim terms from that apparent in the intrinsic evidence.immunomedics is correct that a lthough expert testimony and declarations are useful to confirm that the construed meaning is consistent with the denotation ascribed by those in the field of the art,such extrinsic evidence can not be used to vary the plain language of the patent document.omega eng g,raytek,citations omitted.however,the interpretation of the claims reached by the district court was consistent with that required by the intrinsic evidence,and the district court use of expert testimony therefore falls within the permissible first clause of the language rather than the impermissible second clause.contrary to immunomedics apparent belief,there is no prohibition on a district court ability to hear expert testimony.key pharms.hercon lab.
summary judgment of no literal infringement 
as we have affirmed the district court interpretation of intracellular marker substance,we likewise affirm its summary judgment of no literal infringement.psma,as a transmembrane antigen,extends both inside and outside of the cell membrane.see summary judgment opinion at.despite this intracellular portion,however,the claims do not provide generally for portions of antigens to qualify as marker substances.we note that in affirming the district court summary judgment,we rest not on the fact that psma is a cell surface antigen as did the district court,but rather on the fact that,as a transmembrane antigen,psma is not an intracellular marker substance.see id.at for the reasons stated above,this court determines that psma is a cell surface antigen.although the basis of our decision varies from that relied on by the district court,the result we reach does not.
the district court reliance on the patent and prosecution history 
immunomedics also argues that it was improper for the district court to reference the patent and its prosecution history when construing the claims of the patent.we analyze the propriety of the district court reliance on the content and prosecution history of the patent in segments.the first segment is the district court examination of the application at the point it was distinguished from the application following the march,rejection.the second segment is the district court reliance on the statements contained in the patent defining the cell surface and incorporating the singer article,all of which is new matter added to a of the application.the district court appears to have relied primarily on the latter.
as for the first piece,the district court made no error to the extent that it referenced the contents of the application as it existed when goldenberg distinguished the application from the application in the office action response dated march.this response constitutes part of the prosecution history of the application,which is a parent application to the patent,and therefore part of the patent prosecution history.in an analogous situation,this court has explained that prior art cited in a patent or cited in the prosecution history of the patent constitutes intrinsic evidence.kumar ovonic battery.while the application was not prior art of the sort discussed in kumar,it did form the basis of the examiner rejection of the patent on grounds.the reasoning underlying the court statement in kumar,therefore,applies equally here,and the district court was entitled to treat the application as part of the intrinsic evidence of the patent when construing the claim terms.
the district court did err in the second segment of its analysis,however,when it relied on the specification of the patent to construe the claims.summary judgment opinion at.the relevant passages from the patent,the reference to the singer article and the definition of cell surface antigen were added during a of the application.these passages are therefore new matter added to the content of the application subsequent to when it was distinguished in the march office action response.while the content of the application at the time it was distinguished from the application constitutes part of the prosecution history of the patent,subsequently added new matter is not similarly incorporated.
in the absence of an incorporation into the intrinsic evidence,this court precedent takes a narrow view on when a related patent or its prosecution history is available to construe the claims of a patent at issue and draws a distinct line between patents that have a familial relationship and those that do not.see.digital telegenix,explaining that an unrelated patent sheds no light on the claims in the patent at issue abbott,at finding an insufficient relationship between patents to rely on statements from the prosecution history of one patent for prosecution history estoppel regarding the other where the applications had no formal relationship and were presented to the patent office as patentably distinct inventions jonsson stanley works,using statements from one patent prosecution history to construe the claims of another patent where the two patents shared a parent application.this dividing line was left undisturbed by our most recent decision on the issue,microsoft systems,which permitted reliance on statements made subsequent to the issuance of a patent when construing its claims where the statements were made in connection with continued prosecution of sibling applications.
the district court reliance on the patent when construing the claims of the patent in the second segment of its analysis does not fit the mold of the cases discussed above.the and applications were filed separately and therefore lack the formal relationship necessary for free license to use the contents of the patent and prosecution history when construing the claims of the patent.see.digital,at.while the application was distinguished from the scope of the application claims,incorporating its contents at that point into the intrinsic evidence of the patent,the relevant passages from the patent relied on by the district court are new matter added by the application.consequently,the passages are not part of the intrinsic evidence of the patent.kumar,at.absent a formal relationship or incorporation during prosecution,the content of the patent is not available to construe the claims of the patent,and the district court erred in relying on them.given that the district court errant reliance on the patent did not cause it to reach an incorrect claim construction,however,and we have reached the same construction based on the intrinsic evidence of the patent,the district court error was harmless.see superguide directv.
summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents 
we turn finally to the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents.the district court explained that,under dey,stateme
