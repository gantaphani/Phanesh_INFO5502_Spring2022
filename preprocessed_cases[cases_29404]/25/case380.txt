the in these four antitrust class actions are wholesale purchasers of tiazac diltiazem hydrochloride,hereinafter diltiazem hcl,a drug for hypertension and angina.they alleged that biovail corporation,which manufactures tiazac,misused a patent to keep off the market a generic equivalent manufactured by andrx pharmaceuticals,in violation of federal and state antitrust laws.the district court entered summary judgment for biovail,which we affirm.
background 
the manufacturer of a generic bioequivalent to a previously approved branded drug may file an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration while the branded drug is purportedly protected by a patent.see generally j ranbaxy labs.leavitt.in its anda the applicant may certify under paragraph iv of the governing section of the food,drug,and cosmetic act either that the patent is invalid or that the generic drug would not infringe it.j a vii iv see also a.the fda may tentatively approve an anda with such a certification,but that approval does not become effective,final for days if within that time the manufacturer of the branded drug brings an action for infringement of its patent,then the effective date of the approval is stayed for months from the date of the paragraph iv certification or until the patent case is resolved,whichever occurs first.j,j b iii see also d,b.
tentative approval of an anda does not entail the right to market the subject drug.see d,b v tentative approval of an application does not constitute approval under fdca and can not,absent a final approval letter from the agency,result in an effective approval.nor does it guarantee final approval,which may depend upon an additional review of the application by the fda.j b iv ii dd bb see also b.
in june andrx filed an anda seeking approval to market diltiazem hcl under the name taztia andrx included a paragraph iv certification both challenging the validity of biovail patent filed,the patent,which biovail claimed protected the formula for tiazac,and asserting taztia would not infringe that patent.biovail sued andrx in federal district court in florida,thereby extending the statutory stay for up to months.in march,the district court determined andrx product would not infringe biovail patent,biovail andrx,d,whereupon biovail appealed to the federal circuit.
in september the fda tentative ly approved andrx anda,noting that biovail pending appeal prevented it from giving final approval at that time.the agency went on to explain that,if and when andrx prevailed on appeal,the fda would have to be assured there is no new information that would affect whether final approval should be granted.
on january,with its appeal still pending,biovail claimed its newly acquired patent filed,the patent also protected tiazac,and the fda asked andrx for its position with regard to that patent.on february the federal circuit affirmed the judgment for andrx in the patent litigation,thereby terminating the statutory stay.three days later,andrx filed a paragraph iv declaration challenging the patent,thereby triggering a new stay,which biovail extended by suing andrx anew in florida.meanwhile,andrx had filed its own action against biovail and the fda in the same district court,challenging as baseless biovail claim that the patent covered tiazac and seeking an injunction requiring the fda to remove the patent from the orange book.see andrx,biovail,d,vacated.on may,while these suits were pending,the fda tentatively approved andrx anda a second time.in april,biovail withdrew its claim the patent covered tiazac.
meanwhile,andrx had begun to encounter problems manufacturing its version of diltiazem hcl.in december,shortly after having received tentative approval from the fda,andrx identified problems in its methodology for testing taztia for dissolution in the human body.in january andrx manufactured a new batch of the drug,which it initially found satisfactory pursuant to a new testing methodology,but on may,the company discovered that samples from the new batch also failed to dissolve as required.andrx eventually rejected that entire batch because the manufacturing process was faulty,and continued to encounter manufacturing problems into.because of those problems,the fda did not finally approve andrx anda until april full year after biovail had withdrawn its claim that the patent covered its drug.
much as andrx had done in its suit against biovail,see d,the plaintiffs in these four class actions alleged in the district court that biovail unlawfully forestalled the fda final approval of andrx anda by filing with the fda documents claiming falsely and in bad faith that the patent covered tiazac,and by engaging in bad faith or sham litigation over that patent.according to the plaintiffs,biovail thus unlawfully excluded andrx from the market for tiazac and its generic equivalents,in violation of federal and state antitrust laws,see united states microsoft,en banc whether any particular act of a monopolist is exclusionary,rather than merely a form of vigorous competition,can be difficult to discern the means of illicit exclusion,like the means of legitimate competition,are myriad see also city of columbia omni outdoor,d the federal antitrust laws exempt the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from the government,but they do reach sham s,as when persons use the governmental opposed to the outcome of that an anticompetitive weapon.but for biovail exclusionary conduct,the plaintiffs claim,the fda would have finally approved andrx anda on or about february,when the federal circuit ruled against biovail in the patent litigation the plaintiffs could have begun soon thereafter purchasing taztia from andrx at a lower price than they had to pay biovail for tiazac.
biovail moved for summary judgment in two of the four present class actions on the ground that,regardless whether biovail had violated the antitrust laws,the plaintiffs could not show biovail had caused them any harm.the district court agreed,twin cities bakery workers health welfare fund biovail,nos,wl,and subsequently entered judgment for biovail in a third case,saj,biovail,no.may,which it found indistinguishable.
seeking to avoid the same fate,the plaintiffs in the fourth action,louisiana wholesale drug lwd biovail,d,amended their complaint to allege that,but for biovail wrongful use of the patent,they could have purchased generic drugs manufactured and sold either by andrx or by biovail itself.according to their amended complaint,biovail and its exclusive distributor,forest laboratories was a defendant in the original action but not the subject of any allegation of conspired to distribute a generic version of tiazac before andrx and other manufacturers could get to market,but abandoned that plan in favor of using the patent to forestall final approval of andrx anda they cite no overt act in furtherance of this conspiracy after biovail dropped its claim the patent protected tiazac.the lwd plaintiffs also sought further discovery pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e.see also.f.
applying its twin cities ruling to lwd without addressing the rule e affidavit,the district court entered summary judgment for the defendants insofar as the lwd plaintiffs claimed the defendants had prevented the plaintiffs from purchasing taztia from andrx the court held that no reasonable juror could find biovail use of the patent prevented the fda final approval of andrx anda.d.the court then entered judgment for the defendants insofar as the lwd plaintiffs advanced in their amended complaint their new theory that they could have purchased generic diltiazem hcl from the defendants but for biovail misuse of the patent the court reasoned that the amendment did not relate back to the filing of the original complaint and was thus.id.at.
ii.analysis 
the plaintiffs in all four class actions appeal,contending they proffered evidence sufficient to defeat biovail motion for summary judgment.in addition,the lwd plaintiffs argue the district court improperly dismissed the amendment to their complaint as untimely and erroneously failed to address their affidavit seeking further discovery under rule e.
inability to purchase taztia from andrx original theory 
a plaintiff seeking damages under the antitrust laws must prove the defendant has caused the plaintiff antitrust injury,meaning an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d emphasis omitted see also andrx,biovail.int l,philip areeda hebert hovenkamp,antitrust law,ed.just as a entrant suing an incumbent firm for excluding it from a relevant market in violation of the sherman act must demonstrate it intended and was prepared to enter that market,zenith radio hazeltine research,d areeda hovenkamp,supra,so a purchaser suing an incumbent monopolist for excluding a potential competitor from which it might have bought a product at a lower price must prove the excluded firm was willing and able to supply it but for the incumbent firm exclusionary conduct,see atl.richfield usa petroleum,d injury must be attributable to an anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny.here,that means the plaintiffs must prove andrx was prepared to sell taztia and could have obtained approval from the fda to do so at some point between february,when the patent no longer barred the fda final approval,and april,when biovail withdrew its claim that the patent protected tiazac.see twin cities,wl,at see also zenith radio,at.andrx.at.
biovail argues,and the district court held,no reasonable juror could conclude biovail caused the plaintiffs any harm.the plaintiffs submit they presented evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that but for biovail conduct,the fda would have granted andrx final approval in february and that andrx would have marketed taztia soon thereafter.reviewing the summary judgment de novo,galvin eli lilly,we hold no reasonable juror could conclude that,but for biovail alleged misuse of the patent,the fda would have granted andrx final approval in february.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court without reaching biovail alternative argument that the plaintiffs could not show andrx was ever prepared to manufacture a safe drug.see.c district court must enter summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
in arguing that a reasonable juror could find the fda would have approved andrx anda in february but for misconduct by biovail,the plaintiffs first point to the affidavits of nicholas fleischer and jeffrey gibbs,each of whom had once worked for the fda.the district court,invoking federal rules of evidence admissibility of expert testimony and exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence on ground of unfair prejudice,excluded those affidavits because they were speculative and ungrounded in fact and,in any event,their value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury.see wl at.the plaintiffs challenge the district court reliance upon rule but not upon rule.in keeping with good sense and our established practice,we will not disturb the ruling of a district court where,as here,an independent basis for that ruling is uncontested.rehab.care,llc nlrb,veitch england.
the plaintiffs next direct us to decisions of courts they claim determined,in litigation involving andrx,biovail,and the fda,that the agency would have finally approved andrx anda in february but for biovail misuse of the patent,see andrx,biovail.int l,andrx,d at andrx,at.as the district court pointed out in the present case,however,none of those decisions made a finding of disputed fact,d at,and none determined whether a reasonable juror could conclude the fda would have granted final approval in february.although the likely timing of the fda final approval was placed at issue in the southern district of florida when andrx sought a preliminary requiring it to prove irreparable court did not reach the issue because it determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.andrx,slip op.at.neither did that court in its decision of september,which addressed various motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,decide when the fda would have granted final approval of andrx anda.see d.instead,in its recitation of the facts the court assumed,as did the federal circuit on appeal,see at,that because the fda had given its initial approval in september it would have given its final approval as soon as the statutory bar was lifted in february,d at.the likely timing of the fda approval was not a disputed issue of fact before either court.
of the evidence upon which the plaintiffs rely in their brief to this court,we accordingly confine our analysis to the fda tentative approval in september,a february fax from the fda to andrx,the fda filings in the case andrx brought to compel the agency to withdraw the patent from the orange book,and the affidavit of an andrx employee.upon the basis of this evidence,we hold no reasonable juror could conclude that but for biovail misuse of the patent the fda would have approved andrx anda in february.
the plaintiffs maintain the tentative approval of september demonstrates that,apart from the patent,the only hurdle to final approval was resolution of the patent dispute.that first tentative approval made clear,however,that final approval was also subject to the fda being assured there is no new information that would affect whether final approval should be granted.for that reason,the fda instructed the applicant,when you believe that your application may be considered for final approval,file u pdated information related to labeling or chemistry,manufacturing and controls data,or any other change in the conditions outlined in th e abbreviated application.a reasonable juror would not infer upon the basis of this letter that final approval would have been forthcoming in february.
as biovail points out,the fda second tentative approval,issued in may,further undermines the plaintiffs treatment of the september tentative approval as tantamount to final approval subject only to the lifting of the statutory stay.the plaintiffs belittle the may approval as simply a reaffirmance of the september approval,but the record contradicts that contention.the fda letter of may,referred not only to the september tentative approval but also to several amendments to andrx anda that postdated the decision of the federal circuit in the patent dispute had the fda meant merely to reaffirm its previous tentative approval,it could easily have said so.at best the second tentative approval suggests the fda could have given final approval of andrx anda in may,not february.
nor is the fda fax of february,helpful to the plaintiffs.it states only that a division of the fda ha d completed its review of the december amendment relating to andrx testing methodology and ha d no further questions at this time,and even that explicitly preliminary observation was made subject to revision after review of the entire application.in the same fax the fda also asked andrx to provide a certification as to the patent,but the fda nowhere suggested the agency would approve andrx anda when biovail patents were no longer a bar.
the plaintiffs also point out that in the litigation andrx brought against biovail and the agency,fda briefing demonstrat es that because biovail listed the patent,andrx anda was no longer eligible for final fda approval in february.relatedly,the plaintiffs note that when andrx filed a statement of undisputed facts in that the effect that only litigation over the patent prevented the fda final fda responded that the patent also barred final approval.these documents are unhelpful,however,because they demonstrate only that ending the patent litigation was a necessary condition for the fda final approval a reasonable juror could not infer from them that it was a sufficient condition.in keeping with applicable law,b j b iii,j b iv ii dd bb,the fda brief stated only that upon the termination of the litigation andrx would be eligible for,not that it would be entitled to,final approval.similarly,the fda response to andrx statement of undisputed facts does not imply it would h
