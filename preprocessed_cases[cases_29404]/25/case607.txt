the united states district court for the district of new jersey permanently enjoined mylan laboratories,from infringing pharmaceutical patent.the patent claims the anticonvulsive drug topiramate.the trial court also reset the effective approval date for mylan abbreviated new drug application anda.because the district court correctly ruled on claim construction,inequitable conduct,obviousness,and enablement,and because the district court did not err in resetting the effective date of mylan anda under e a,this court affirms.
topiramate marketed by as topomax is a significant epilepsy drug with sales exceeding billion annually.scientist bruce maryanoff invented this pharmaceutical during a search for new antidiabetic drugs.topiramate is a reaction intermediate in the synthesis maryanoff ran as part of his antidiabetic efforts.unexpectedly,maryanoff discovered that this particular intermediate had powerful anticonvulsant properties.after extensive testing,clinical trials,and substantial investment,showed that the compound was safe and effective leading to fda approval.
this cause of action arose under the act.under that act,mylan filed an anda with the fda with a paragraph iv certification asserting that patent is invalid or not infringed.within days,filed an infringement suit under e against mylan thus triggering the stay on approval of mylan anda.
after a markman proceeding to set the meaning of the claim terms,the district court rejected mylan position that claim of the patent does not cover topiramate.indeed,in light of the district court claim construction ruling,mylan stipulated that its generic topiramate infringes claims,and of the patent.on summary judgment,the trial court also ruled against mylan affirmative defenses of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct and invalidity based on obviousness and.after entry of final judgment,mylan now appeals the district court claim construction as well as the dismissal of its affirmative defenses of inequitable conduct,obviousness,and.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment without deference.johns hopkins cellpro.this court must decide for itself if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.in deciding these questions,this court draws all justifiable inferences in the nonmovant favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.this court also reviews claim construction as a matter of law without deference.cybor fas,en banc.
mylan argues that the district court improperly construed the word and to mean or in independent claim,and under the proper construction,the claim does not cover topiramate.in light of the plain language of independent claim,several dependent claims,the specification,and the extrinsic evidence,this court sustains the trial court ruling that,in the circumstances of this case,claim use of the term and means or.
claim of the patent states 
a sulfamate of the following formula i 
x is oxygen 
is hydrogen or alkyl and 
and are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and and and together may be a group of the following formula ii 
and are the same or different and are hydrogen,lower alkyl or are alkyl and are joined to form a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring.
topiramate has the following structure 
in the molecule topiramate,and and and together are a group of formula ii,wherein and are methyl.mylan argues that the use of the term and precludes the claim from encompassing topiramate.in context,the term and falls between several r group recitations 
and are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and and and together may be a group of formula ii emphasis added.
on this basis,mylan argues that the phrase quoted above contains two independent claim limitations that,and are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and that and and together may be a group of formula ii.under mylan construction,both of these limitations must be met in order for a compound to infringe.both of these limitations are not met in topiramate.none of the,and subunits are hydrogen or lower alkyl because both and and and together are a group of formula ii.
to the contrary,the claim language depicts two subsets of compounds,but does not require their simultaneous existence.in one subset of compounds covered by claim,the groups,and are independent of one another,in which case,according to the claim,they are either hydrogen or lower alkyl.in a second subset of compounds covered by claim,the through groups are not independent,but rather and are together,and are together,to form either one or two groups of formula ii.topiramate is an example of this type of compound.in it,and are arranged together in a group,as are and.thus,as used in this claim,and conjoins mutually exclusive possibilities.
the claim also does not use and in isolation but in a larger context that clarifies its meaning.specifically,and appears in conjunction with the adverbs independently and together.as the district court explained,these terms signal that and links alternatives that occur under the different conditions of independence or togetherness.in context,it is clear that one of the subunits,or does not always have to be either a hydrogen or lower alkyl.
the larger context of this patent also supports this claim meaning.construing claim to require a conjunctive meaning of and would render several dependent claims meaningless.claims,and would cover nothing if the and at issue must be conjunctive.this court has explained other claims of the patent in question can also be valuable sources of enlightenment as to the meaning of a claim term.phillips awh,en banc citing vitronics conceptronic.thus,this court strives to reach a claim construction that does not render claim language in dependent claims meaningless.rambus infineon tech.ag.
the specification also supports the district court reading of and.the specification thus uses the word and to link alternative chemical structures.in column lines the specification provides 
and are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and,when x is,and may be alkene groups joined to form a benzene ring and when x is oxygen,and and together may be a methylenedioxy group of the following formula ii 
emphases added.without question,this passage within the specification shows use of the word and to join alternatives.
while extrinsic evidence can shed useful light on the relevant art,this court considers such evidence less significant than the intrinsic record in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.phillips,at citations omitted.because the plain language of claim,the dependent claims,and the specification support the district court reading,this court does not need to consult extrinsic evidence.nonetheless,this court notes that dictionary definitions of and,while most often listing the additive sense as the most common usage of the term,also show usage of the term to connote alternatives.webster third new international dictionary.in the circumstances of this case,the use of and to express alternatives was chosen and adequately expressed by the applicant.thus,extrinsic evidence too offers support for the district court reading of the disputed term.
in chef america lamb weston,this court explained that a patent must be interpreted as written,not as the patentees wish they had written it.in other words,courts may not redraft claims,whether to make them operable or to sustain their validity.id.even a nonsensical result does not require the court to redraft the claims of the patent.id.citing process control hydreclaim.however,chef america does not require this court or the district court to interpret and according to its most common usage in the dictionary.to the contrary,this court and the district court must interpret the term to give proper meaning to the claim in light of the language and intrinsic evidence.giving and its most common dictionary meaning would produce in this case the nonsensical result of not covering topiramate and rendering several other dependent claims meaningless.in chef ameri
