background 
pfizer produces and sells the drug celebrex,a drug nsaid,for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.pfizer owns the,which encompass a broad genus of compounds,compositions using those compounds,and methods of using those compositions.the claims of the patents include active ingredient in celebrex.
teva is a generic drug manufacturer.pursuant to the provisions of the act,teva filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration fda addressed to a proposed drug identified as celecoxib capsules,mg,mg,and mg.pfizer,d at.because the patents covering celecoxib are listed in the orange book,teva was required to certify that those patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use or sale of the new drug for which the anda is submitted.j a vii iv teva anda contained the required paragraph iv certification.that certification did not dispute that the filing of teva anda would infringe the patents,but challenged the validity of the patents covering celecoxib.in february,in response to the submission of teva anda,pfizer initiated this litigation by filing a patent infringement action against teva pursuant to e.pfizer alleged that teva anda filing was an act of patent infringement because the anda sought approval to manufacture,use or sell a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent.in may,teva filed an answer.it did not argue that its anda was not within the scope of the claims but rather asserted affirmative defenses that the were invalid or unenforceable.teva did not counterclaim.understanding these affirmative defenses requires an understanding of the history of nsaids and the prosecution history of the three patents.
traditional nsaids have been used for many years to treat people suffering from pain and other symptoms associated with inflammation.aspirin,for example,has been on the market for nearly a century.aspirin was followed several decades later by the introduction of other similar drugs,such as ibuprofen and naproxen.although these traditional nsaids were effective in treating pain from inflammation,they were also associated with harmful gastrointestinal side effects,ranging from slight stomach discomfort to serious ulcers.
in the early,scientists made a breakthrough in understanding the operative mechanism of the traditional nsaids when they discovered that the drugs inhibited the cyclooxygenase cox enzyme in the body,which produces small molecules associated both with pain and inflammation and also with good housekeeping functions that contribute to,for example,good gastrointestinal physiology.several years later,scientists made another significant breakthrough when they discovered that there were in fact at least two different kinds of cox enzymes the first,produces the molecules associated with the good housekeeping functions inside the body,and the second,produces the molecules associated with pain and inflammation.traditional nsaids were found to inhibit both of these cox enzymes.in the years following and leading up to the discovery of celecoxib,scientists began searching for a compound that would selectively inhibit the enzyme to treat pain and inflammation without inhibiting the enzyme.in other words,they began to focus their efforts on identifying a compound that would effectively treat pain without the harmful side effects identified with the traditional nsaids.see generally of rochester searle,describing the development of modern nsaids.
by,pfizer had identified several new compounds that it believed would selectively inhibit.on november,pfizer filed patent application the application with the patent and trademark office pto that claimed a broad range of these chemical compounds.the application included claims directed to the chemical compounds themselves,to compositions using these compounds,and to methods of using these compounds,including specific claims to celecoxib.
in an office action dated july,the patent examiner issued a restriction requirement,which identified the compound claims,the composition claims,and the method claims as each directed to patentably distinct subject matter.the restriction requirement required pfizer to select for prosecution one of these three claim groups.in the same office action,the examiner further required the applicant to elect a single disclosed species that the examiner identified at.in response,pfizer elected to prosecute the generic compound claims and,within that genus,the single compound species celecoxib.the resulting compound claims remaining in the original application were ultimately allowed,and the application issued as the patent.
subsequent to the restriction requirement but before the application issued,pfizer filed a series of continuation applications claiming priority to the application and covering the subject matter which it had elected not to prosecute in the original application in particular,pfizer filed a divisional application,which ultimately issued as the patent,that included the composition claims,and a application cip,which ultimately issued as the patent,that included the method claims.
following an bench trial,the district court rejected each of teva invalidity arguments and found pfizer patents infringed.the district court first rejected teva defense that the asserted patents were invalid as obvious over the prior art.teva does not appeal that aspect of the district court decision,and we do not discuss it here.the district court rejected teva best mode defense as to all of the asserted patents because it held that pfizer subjective preference for selectivity was not the type of preference that best mode requires an applicant to disclose.the district court also rejected teva double patenting argument based on the theory that the patent was prior art to the patent.the district court held that,under,the patent could not be used as prior art against the patent.finally,the district court held that there was no inequitable conduct.teva asserted that two merck references,international application no.wo the application and patent the patent should have been disclosed to the pto.the district court held that they were not material because they did not qualify as prior art under e.the latter holdings are the subject of this appeal.
after trial,the district court issued a judgment,concluding that teva infringed each of the,and patents and ordering that teva anda not be approved earlier than the expiration date of the,and patents.the judgment also included an order enjoining teva from engaging in the manufacture,use,offer to sell,sale,or importation into the united states of any product comprising the chemical compound celecoxib.teva timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we first consider whether the claims of the method patent are invalid based on double patenting over the composition patent.if the patent is invalid,pfizer is not entitled to an injunction beyond the expiration date of the patent.the district court held that the provision of prevented the patent from serving as prior art with respect to the patent.this was so because both the patent and the patent derived from applications filed in response to the restriction requirement made in the common parent application.because it found that the patent was not prior art,the district court held that the patent was not invalid on grounds of double patenting.
the third sentence of section provides a safe harbor to patents that issue on applications filed as a result of a restriction requirement 
a patent issuing on an application with respect to which a requirement for restriction under this section has been made,or on an application filed as a result of such a requirement,shall not be used as a reference either in the patent and trademark office or in the courts against a divisional application or against the original application or any patent issued on either of them,if the divisional application is filed before the issuance of the patent on the other application.
in addition to the express requirements of section,we have also construed the statute to require consonance the applicant must maintain the line of demarcation between the independent and distinct inventions that prompted the restriction requirement.gerber garment tech.lectra.this consonance requirement prevents an applicant from amending the claims in the divisional application in a way that would violate the originally imposed restriction requirement and thereby impermissibly extend the patent term as to that subject matter.id.
teva contends that section applies exclusively to divisional applications,and that because the patent issued on a cip rather than on a divisional application,it does not fall within the terms of the statute 
although both are types of continuing applications,divisionals and cips differ significantly in at least one respect a divisional application contains an identical disclosure to its parent application,but a cip introduces new matter.a cip is just what its name implies.it partly continues subject matter disclosed in a prior application,but it adds new subject matter not disclosed in the prior application.of.bd.of trs.vanvoorhies,see also manual of patent examining procedure mpep,a is an application filed during the lifetime of an earlier nonprovisional application,repeating some substantial portion or all of the earlier nonprovisional application and adding matter not disclosed in the said earlier nonprovisional application.emphasis in original.a divisional application is defined as a later application for an independent or distinct invention,carved out of a pending application and disclosing and claiming only subject matter disclosed in the earlier or parent application mpep.a divisional application is often filed as a result of a restriction requirement made by the examiner.id.
pfizer argues that the terms divisional and are merely labels used for administrative convenience,and that accordingly,although the is termed a cip,it is in effect a divisional for purposes of section.in other words,pfizer contends that the term divisional application as it is used in section refers broadly to any type of continuing application filed as a result of a restriction,regardless of whether it is labeled by the pto,for administrative purposes,as a divisional,a continuation,or a cip.we disagree.
section explicitly refers to divisional applications.that section provides 
if two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in one application,the director may require the application to be restricted to one of the inventions.if the other invention is made the subject of a divisional application which complies with the requirements of section of this title it shall be entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the original application.a patent issuing on an application with respect to which a requirement for restriction under this section has been made,or on an application filed as a result of such a requirement,shall not be used as a reference either in the patent and trademark office or in the courts against a divisional application or against the original application or any patent issued on either of them,if the divisional application is filed before the issuance of the patent on the other application.if a divisional application is directed solely to subject matter described and claimed in the original application as filed,the director may dispense with signing and execution by the inventor.the validity of a patent shall not be questioned for failure of the director to require the application to be restricted to one invention.
emphases added.as noted above,the third sentence of the statute provides a safe harbor for patents or applications derived as the result of a restriction requirement from attack based on the original application or a patent issued therefrom,or based on applications or patents similarly derived from the same restriction requirement.that safe harbor,by its literal terms,protects only divisional application s or the original application and patents issued on such applications.
the legislative history of section,like section itself,refers specifically to divisional application s.the house report,referring to section,states 
this section enacts as law existing practice with respect to division,at the same time introducing a number of changes.division is made discretionary with the commissioner.the requirements of section are made applicable and neither of the resulting patents can be held invalid over the other merely because of their being divided in several patents.in some cases a divisional application may be filed by the assignee.
at emphasis added.
the changes referred to in the legislative history included the provision of section.prior to the patent act,no protection was afforded to patent applications filed as a result of a restriction to at the time as a requirement for division and such applications were often rejected or held invalid on double patenting grounds.see studiengesellschaft kohle mbh petrochemical,sgk newman,concurring in re eisler.thus,although a requirement for division embodied a determination by the pto that the patent application contained more than one patentably distinct invention,such a determination did not protect the divisional application from rejection on grounds of double patenting.in re isherwood,holding that an examiner is not estopped from rejecting a divisional application because of an earlier requirement for division.the pto and the courts were therefore not precluded from rejecting an application filed as a result of a requirement for division based on the very same application from which the subsequent application was divided.see in re kauffman.pursuant to this practice,a patent applicant could appeal an examiner requirement for division,united states ex rel.steinmetz allen,and his failure to litigate the question was at his peril.kauffman,at.
the inequity of this practice was well known by.see in re ferenci,one anomalous result is that after division has been required and the applicant has complied therewith,the divided claims have been rejected on the ground of double patenting,although it is obvious that division was required upon the theory that the original application contained claims for more than one independent invention.the purpose of section was to eliminate this inequity and thereby allow applicants to reasonably rely on restriction requirements.see sgk,at newman,concurring.given the protection of section,applicants would no longer need to appeal a restriction requirement because they would no longer be penalized for acquiescing in an improper restriction requirement.see id.at.the enactment of section,therefore,brought clarity and fairness to the interaction between restriction and double patenting.
there is no suggestion,however,in the legislative history of section that the provision was,or needed to be,directed at anything but divisional applications.the commentary and materials published since section enactment similarly contain no suggestion that section was meant to cover any applications other than divisionals although the legislative history reveals no reason why congress drafted section only to benefit divisional applications,there are certainly plausible reasons why congress would have concluded that section should be limited to divisional applications,and not include cips.the need for the protection only existed when a divisional application was filed as a result of the restriction.if the section had included cips,which by definition contain new matter,the section might be read as providing the earlier priority date even as to the new matter,contrary to the usual rule that new matter is not entitled to the priority date of the original application.see asseff marzall.there was no possible reason for protecting the new matter from double patenting rejections.
the difference between divisional applications and cips,moreover,was well known at the time that congress enacted the patent act.the manual of patent examining procedure in use at the time included definitions of the different types of applications.a divisional was defined as a later application for a distinct or independent invention,carved out of a pending application and disclosing and claiming nothing not disclosed in the earlier or parent application mpep.and a cip was defined as an application filed during the lifetime of an earlier application by the same applicant,repeating some substantial portion or all of the earlier application and adding matter not disclosed in the said earlier case.id.emphasis in original.indeed,these earlier definitions are nearly identical to those in the latest edition of the mpep quoted above.despite this awareness,however,the drafters of section chose to refer specifically and only to divisional and original applications.if the drafters wanted to include cips within the protection afforded by section,they could have easily done so.
pfizer only claimed authority for including cip applications within the scope of section are three cases where this court,although it did not consider the question,may have assumed that section applied to cip applications filed in response to a restriction requirement.see geneva,glaxosmithkline plc,gerber,at sgk,at.but in two of these cases we held that section was inapplicable on other grounds,and thus did not need to,and did not in fact address the divisional question.geneva,at finding that the patentee did not comply with the consonance requirement gerber,at same.in the third,we disposed of the double patenting issue on the ground that the claims of the patents were patentably distinct.sgk,at.since the issue now before us was not decided by those cases,they are not binding authority.see rhone poulenc agro,dekalb genetics.
we conclude that the protection afforded by section to applications or patents issued therefrom filed as a result of a restriction requirement is limited to divisional applications.we note that this interpretation of section is consistent with the pto understanding of section.see ex parte granados,wl,not selected for publication t he instant case is a,not a divisional it therefore does not fall within the literal terms of section.see also mpep similarly referring to divisional applications.here,the patent,though it derived from the application that led to the patent,was filed as a cip and not a divisional application.we hold that section does not apply to the patent and that the patent may be used to invalidate the patent.given our conclusion,we do not consider teva alternative argument that section does not apply because the patent is not consonant with the restriction requirement made in the parent application.
because section does not prohibit us from using the patent as a reference against the patent,we must next determine whether the claims of the patent are patentably distinct from the claims of the patent.
double patenting is a judicially created doctrine that prohibit s a party from obtaining an extension of the right to exclude through claims in a later patent that are not patentably distinct from claims in a commonly owned earlier patent.eli lilly barr.we have identified two steps in an double patenting analysis.first,a court construes the claim s in the earlier patent and the claim s in the later patent and determines the differences.id.at.second,it determines whether those differences render the claims patentably distinct.id.a later patent claim is not patentably distinct from an earlier patent claim if the later claim is obvious over,or anticipated by,the earlier claim.id.we have also held that a claim to a method of using a composition is not patentably distinct from an earlier claim to the identical composition in a patent disclosing the identical use.geneva,at.double patenting is a question of law,which we review without deference.gypsum.
here,although the district court first held that section precluded the use of the patent against the patent,the district court also found that if section did not prevent the patent from being prior art,it would hold that the relevant claims of the two patents were not patentably distinct.we agree that the relevant claims of the two patents are not patentably distinct.the claims at issue of the patent merely recite methods of administering a amount of the compositions found in claim of the patent.moreover,the term amount is found in claim of the patent and was stipulated by the parties to mean the same thing in both patents thus,we agree with the district court that the patent merely claims a particular use described in the patent of the claimed compositions of the patent the asserted claims of the are therefore not patentably distinct over the claims of the patent.
we conclude that pfizer can not claim the protection of section with respect to the patent because that patent did not issue on a divisional application,and the asserted claims of the patent are not patentably distinct from the claims of the patent.accordingly,the patent is invalid for double patenting 
we next consider teva contention that the compound and composition patents are invalid because they violate the best mode requirement.the best mode requirement is contained in the specification shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.the test for compliance with best mode is comprised of two steps first,whether,at the time of filing the application,the inventor possessed a best mode for practicing the invention and second,whether the inventor disclosure was adequate to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the best mode of the invention.bayer ag schein.the first prong is subjective and focuses on the inventor state of mind at the time the application is filed the second prong is objective and depends upon the scope of the claimed invention and the level of skill in the relevant art.id.the invention referred to in the best mode test is the invention as defined by the claims.id.typically,the best mode issue concerns the applicant failure to disclose a preferred embodiment,but not always.in bayer,we explained that the best mode requirement does not demand disclosure of every preference an inventor possesses as of the filing date.id.at.we held that the best mode requirement does demand disclosure of an inventor preferred embodiment of the claimed invention.id.at.however,it is not limited to that.we have recognized that best mode requires inventors to disclose aspects of making or using the claimed invention when the undisclosed matter materially affect s the properties of the claimed invention.id.at.
we first consider teva best mode challenge to the generic claims of the compound and composition patents claims,and of the patent,and claims,and of the patent.teva contends,with respect to those claims,that pfizer violated the best mode requirement by failing to disclose its preference for selectivity.here,teva argument is limited.teva does not claim that pfizer had a subjective,undisclosed preference for a particular compound a preferred embodiment at the time it filed the patent applications.rather,teva argues that the generic claims of the and patents do not teach one of skill in the art how to arrive at the preferred embodiment because they do not reveal pfizer preference for compounds that demonstrate selectivity.teva asserts that,without the knowledge of the preference for selectivity,one of ordi
