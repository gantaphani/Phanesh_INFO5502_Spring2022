the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has certified the following question of florida law that is determinative of a cause pending in that court and for which there appears to be no controlling precedent 
under florida law,does a laboratory that manufactures,grows,tests or handles materials owe a duty of reasonable care to members of the general public to avoid an unauthorized interception and dissemination of the materials,and,if not,is a duty created where a reasonable response is not made where there is a history of such dangerous materials going missing or being stolen 
stevens battelle mem l,cir.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons that follow,we answer the first part of the certified question in the affirmative,and therefore,we need not address the second part.
proceedings to date 
the eleventh circuit outlined the plaintiff injuries and allegations 
in the fall of,an unknown group or individual mailed letters containing bacillus anthracis anthrax to recipients in florida,new york,and washington.one such letter was mailed to american media,american media in boca raton,florida where robert stevens stevens worked.stevens became ill and died after inhaling the anthrax.as a result,two wrongful death suits were brought by maureen stevens,his wife,individually,as a personal representative of the estate of stevens,and on behalf of their three children collectively stevens.stevens sued the united states in federal court and battelle memorial institute battelle,a private research facility,in state court,alleging that they were the source of the anthrax that killed stevens.battelle removed the state case to federal court and the two suits were consolidated for discovery purposes.
the complaint against the united states,brought pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca,b,et,alleged that the origin of the strain of anthrax that killed stevens could be traced to the united states army medical research institute for infectious diseases usamriid at fort detrick,maryland.the suit alleged further that the government knew it was utilizing an material requiring the highest degree of care in its handling,storage,use,and possession,and that,as early as,samples of anthrax were missing from usamriid.the complaint stated that despite this knowledge,the government failed to provide adequate security for the handling or shipping of the materials,and,as a result,sometime before october anthrax was improperly intercepted either from usamriid or from another research facility to which the materials had been sent.the complaint does not describe the relationship between the government and the person who initially intercepted the anthrax or between the government and the person who eventually mailed the anthrax to american media.
the complaint against battelle alleged that battelle breached its duty of care to stevens by failing to implement adequate security procedures at its facility.the suit alleged,inter alia,that battelle failed to properly maintain the anthrax it was using for research,monitor employees who had access to the anthrax,or secure the facility from unauthorized access.the complaint also alleged that battelle was negligent in its hiring practices because it failed to conduct background investigations prior to hiring individuals who would have access to anthrax.finally,the complaint alleged negligent supervision of employees working with anthrax.as a result of these failings,the complaint alleged that anthrax was obtained and sent to american media.
stevens,at footnote omitted 
the government moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that 
it could not be liable for any third party criminal activity allegedly occasioned by negligent security practices because it owed no duty of protection to stevens,a stranger,and did not have a duty or ability to control the unidentified third party tortfeasor or tortfeasors responsible for intercepting and mailing the anthrax.reiterating this argument,battelle moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c.battelle also argued that stevens could not satisfy the element of proximate cause.stevens responded to these motions by arguing that the complaint did not allege a claim of failure to control or prevent the mailing of the anthrax by a third party criminal,but,rather,a claim of duty of care whenever a human endeavor creates a generalized and foreseeable risk of harming others.
id.at.the federal district court denied the government and battelle motions,describing stevens claim as falling under florida foreseeable zone of risk theory and citing this court decisions in mccain florida power,so d,and kaisner kolb,so d.stevens,at.the district court examined this theory within the context of the unreasonable risk of harm by affirmative act rule embodied in sections,and of the restatement of the law of torts and the special relationship requirement embodied in section of the restatement.id.the district court found that the allegations of negligent security sufficiently stated a claim under either section or section of the restatement to allow the claim to proceed.id.at.
the government moved for leave to seek reconsideration,which the district court denied.stevens,at.the court,however,granted the government request for certification of the order denying the motion to dismiss for interlocutory appeal,certifying a question similar to the one the eleventh circuit certified to this court.id.at.on appeal to the eleventh circuit,the court noted that t he central issue here is what duties exist under florida law to protect members of the public where an organization creates a significant risk by using anthrax or another material.id.at.the court certified the instant question of florida law to this court,while observing that florida case law imposes limits on negligence liability,but it fails to fit neatly into the complex factual pattern at hand.id.
preliminarily,we note that this case involves a claim of negligence,which we have explained consists of four components 
a duty,or obligation,recognized by the law,requiring the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct,for the protection of others against unreasonable risks.
a failure on the defendant part to conform to the standard required a breach of the duty 
a reasonably close causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury.this is what is commonly known as legal cause,or proximate cause,and which includes the notion of cause in fact.
actual loss or damage 
clay,johnson,so d,quoting prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at page keeton,ed.in certifying a question to this court,the court of appeals has asked us to focus on the duty component of our negligence analysis as it may apply to allegations set out in the federal complaint 
in mccain,this court explained that the duty element ordinarily arises from four potential sources legislative enactments or administration regulations judicial interpretations of such enactments or regulations other judicial precedent and a duty arising from the general facts of the case.so d at citing restatement second of torts.
in this case,it appears that the claimant is asserting that a duty arises from the general facts of the claim as alleged in the complaint.in mccain,we explained that the determination of the existence of a common law duty flowing from the general facts of the case depends upon an evaluation and application of the concept of foreseeability of harm to the circumstances alleged,which is a threshold question of law.see id.at.we have explained,where a person conduct is such that it creates a foreseeable zone of risk posing a general threat of harm to others,a legal duty will ordinarily be recognized to ensure that the underlying threatening conduct is carried out reasonably.id.at.we have also explained that as a general proposition the greater the risk of harm to others that is created by a person chosen activity,the greater the burden or duty to avoid injury to others becomes.thus,as the risk grows greater,so does the duty,because the risk to be perceived defines the duty that must be undertaken.id.at citing christopher russell,so.
importantly,this court has emphasized that reliance on the mccain foreseeability test is appropriate because we had intended mccain to function as a restatement of the law of negligence.williams davis,so d,quoting whitt silverman,so d.again,we reaffirm our previous declarations that the foreseeable zone of risk test discussed in mccain is the test to be applied under florida law to determine whether a duty exists under our negligence law.
given the nature of the parties assertions in the district court,it is not surprising that the defendants seek to focus on what they perceive to be the unforeseeable criminal agency of a third party in causing harm to the decedent,while the claimant seeks to focus on the magnitude of the risk of harm created by the defendants decision to deal with such a dangerous substance.nevertheless,in determining whether certain conduct creates a foreseeable zone of risk,it is appropriate to acknowledge that we have looked for guidance in sections,and of the restatement second of torts,because these sections largely mirror our foreseeable zone of risk analysis in mccain.these sections provide 
risk of direct or indirect harm.
a negligent act or omission may be one which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another through either 
a the continuous operation of a force started or continued by the act or omission,or 
b the foreseeable action of the other,a third person,an animal,or a force of nature.
risk of negligence or recklessness of others.
an act or an omission may be negligent if the actor realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another through the negligent or reckless conduct of the other or a third person.
risk of intentional or criminal conduct.
an act or an omission may be negligent if the actor realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another through the conduct of the other or a third person which is intended to cause harm,even though such conduct is criminal.
restatement second of torts.comment e to section further provides that there are two situations where an actor is required to anticipate and guard against the intentional,or even criminal,misconduct of others where the actor own affirmative act has created or exposed the other to a recognizable high degree of risk of harm through such misconduct,which a reasonable man would take into account,or where the actor is under a special responsibility to the victim.restatement second of torts cmt.e.
in the instant case,we conclude that the district court appropriately turned to sections,and of the restatement for guidance in determining whether a duty exists under florida law while we could reinvent the wheel and set out our own analysis as to the application of the principles of these sections to the circumstances alleged here,we acknowledge that we could not improve upon the district court analysis.because we agree with judge hurley analysis,we adopt the portion of his order regarding the application of these sections to the certified question 
the duties described in sections,and of the restatement attach to acts of commission,which historically generate a broader umbrella of tort liability than acts of omission,which are the subject of and.this distinction is expressed in comment a,section of the restatement of torts second 
this section is concerned only with the negligent character of the actor conduct,and not with his or her duty to avoid the unreasonable risk.in general,anyone who does an affirmative act is under a duty to others to exercise the care of a reasonable person to protect them against an unreasonable risk of harm to them arising out of the act.the duties of one who merely omits to act are more restricted,and in general are confined to situation s where there is a special relation between the actor and the other which gives rise to the duty.
in this case,plaintiff alleges that the government generated,tested and handled deadly laboratory organisms,but failed to employ adequate security procedures during the commission of these acts.thus,plaintiff contends,the government exposed the public to an unreasonable risk of contamination as a result of unauthorized interception and disbursement of lethal materials.in other words,the complaint effectively alleges the commission of affirmative acts ownership and handling of biohazards,which,under section,give rise to a corresponding duty to protect all others exposed to any unreasonable risk of harm arising out of that activity.
considered in conjunction with the further allegations of the complaint regarding the facility history of missing samples of anthrax bacterium,hanta virus and ebola virus dating back to,which the court must accept as true at this juncture,the court concludes that plaintiff complaint states a potential claim under section of the restatement second of torts against the government and will accordingly uphold the sufficiency of the complaint on this basis.
in doing so,the court draws from florida case law precedent clearly recognizing that negligence liability may be imposed on the basis of affirmative acts which create an unreasonable risk of harm by creating a foreseeable opportunity for third party criminal conduct,even though there is no special relationship between the parties that independently imposes a duty to warn or guard against that misconduct.see shurben dollar,so d dca.in shurben,a british tourist was accosted by unknown criminals while traveling in a rental car bearing a license plate designation easily recognized by knowledgeable criminals as the mark of a rental car.the consumer sued the rental agency in tort,contending that it should have realized criminals were targeting tourist car renters in certain areas of miami and that a reasonable rental company would have understood that its customers would be exposed to unreasonable risk of harm if not protected against this risk.although the rental agency and customer did not stand in any special relation toward each other,the court concluded that the circumstances alleged stated a claim within the scope of section of the restatement second of torts,and sustained the plaintiff complaint on this theory.
similarly,taking the facts alleged in the complaint as true and reading them in the light most favorable to plaintiff here,the plaintiff complaint may fairly be read to allege defendant knew or should have known of the risk of bioterrorism associated with lethal laboratory organisms under its ownership and control,particularly in light of its history of missing laboratory specimens dating back to a reasonable medical research and testing laboratory operator in possession of those facts would understand that the public would be exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm unless it implemented adequate security procedures to guard against the risk of unauthorized interception of toxic materials from its laboratory the death of stevens was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant failure to use reasonable care in adopting and implementing security measures reasonably necessary to protect against the possibility of unauthorized interception and release of the biohazards under its control.
in the court view,these allegations are sufficient to establish a duty of care under section of the restatement second of torts.see suchomajcz hummel chemical,newark,new jersey,cir touchette ganal,haw.
stevens united states,at,footnotes omitted.
in responding to the certified question we agree with the court of appeals that the complex factual pattern at hand presents a unique challenge to the courts that must ultimately be resolved upon the facts as developed in the trial court.as we stated in mccain,duty is a minimal threshold legal requirement for opening the courthouse doors as is obvious,a defendant might be under a legal duty of care to a specific plaintiff,but still not be liable for negligence because proximate causation can not be proven.so d at footnote omitted.in the instant case,we have no way of knowing whether stevens will ultimately be able to prove a case against the defendants.however,we conclude that stevens allegations are sufficient to open the courthouse doors.t
