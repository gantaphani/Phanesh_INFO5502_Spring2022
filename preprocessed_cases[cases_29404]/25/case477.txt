when the inventors applied for the patent at issue,they had sequenced one gene coding for one enzyme,using a test purportedly capable of finding other,similar genes.in writing its claims,the owner now bayer cropscience ag decided to claim a broad category based on the function of the particular enzyme,defining the category by using a term with an established scientific meaning.in doing so,bayer got ahead of the science experiments had not confirmed that the term even applied to the particular enzyme whose gene bayer inventors had sequenced.soon science showed that it did not,and bayer knew as much years before its patent issued but did not change its claim language.when it ultimately sued dow agrosciences for infringement,bayer recognized that the term used,in its established scientific meaning,did not cover the accused product itself different from the particular enzyme whose gene bayer inventors had sequenced,so it argued for a broad functional claim construction.
applying our decisions about the potentially unwelcome consequences of a patentee chosen claim language,the district court rejected bayer argument,explaining particularly the great breadth of the asserted functional construction,and entered summary judgment of.we too are unpersuaded by bayer proposed claim construction.because bayer has presented no argument for reversing the judgment independent of our adopting that construction,we affirm.
background 
the patent at issue concerns genetically modifying plants in order to confer resistance to a commonly used herbicide called dichlorophenoxyacetic acid,or d for short.the process works by inserting a particular dna segment a segment containing the sequence of nucleotides identified as the gene coding for a particular enzyme into plant cells,which then reproduce to create new cells that contain that gene.the plant cells produce the enzyme that then catalyzes a biochemical reaction with the d herbicide in which the herbicide is broken down into something harmless to the plant.a plant with the gene can thereby survive application of the herbicide while surrounding weeds do not.
bayer owns patent,entitled microorganisms and plasmids for dichlorophenoxyacetic acid d monooxygenase formation and process for the production of these plasmids and strains.the application that eventually led to this patent was filed in the late.by that time,scientists had discovered that certain bacteria found in soil could grow on to do so,those bacteria first convert d into a substance called dichlorophenol,or dcp,which the bacteria,far from finding toxic,use as a source of carbon and energy.patent,lines see,lines.scientists hoped that,if they identified genes in such bacteria that coded for enzymes that catalyze d to dcp reactions,they could then transfer the ability to inactivate d to plants,lines.
the inventors of the patent were the first to isolate,to clone,and to characterize a gene that had that property,a gene from the soil bacterium strain alcaligenes eutrophus,lines.the patent sets forth the nucleotide sequence in figure.it is the only gene identified in the patent.
the specification explains the growth test used to isolate the identified gene.first,the inventors created a mutant strain of the bacterium that lacked the ability to grow on d or convert it into dcp,line,through,line.next,they fragmented the dna of a strain,which could still break down,line,through,line.they then inserted the fragments into cells of the mutant strain,with roughly speaking no two fragments in the same cell,and placed the cells on d.when they identified cells that grew,they concluded that the dna fragment that had restored the ability to grow on d contained a gene producing an enzyme that caused the conversion of d into dcp,lines.they used known sequencing techniques to identify the nucleotide sequence of the successful fragment,line,through,line 
although this work led the inventors to the figure gene sequence,they did not fully understand the enzymatic reaction that they were studying.in particular,the reaction requires the presence of the oxygen molecule,but the inventors did not know where one of the two oxygen atoms wound up.there was no doubt about the first it combines with d to create an unstable,hydroxylated d,which then spontaneously splits apart into dcp and a compound called glyoxylate.the patent describes this process as bringing about the cleavage of the side chain of,lines.as for the second oxygen atom,however,the inventors at best simply shared the scientific community unverified belief that this atom was incorporated into water.as was established beyond dispute in the district court in this case,enzymes catalyzing a reaction in which one oxygen atom ends up in water and the second is incorporated into a product other than water are called monooxygenases,and the patent uses the term monooxygenase throughout the specification to characterize the enzyme whose gene it sequenced.and bayer used the term monooxygenase in its claims both alone and as part of d monooxygenase in the application that eventually issued as the patent.patent application,filed.
bayer reliance on an unverified belief about its enzyme soon proved wrong.in,when bayer application was still pending,scientists determined that it was incorrect to refer to bayer enzyme as a monooxygenase because the second oxygen atom does not actually end up in water.it was,instead,a dioxygenase,because both oxygen atoms are incorporated into products other than water.see fumiyasu fukumori robert hausinger,alcaligenes eutrophus dichlorophenoxyacetate monooxygenase is an a ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase,bacteriology.yet,despite the announcement of this discovery in the very title of the article,and bayer knowledge of the article,bayer did not alter the claims of its application which did not mature into a patent until seven years after the discovery.accordingly,the patent issued in with independent claim reciting an artificially constructed gene as follows 
a recombinant gene,comprising 
a dna sequence encoding a polypeptide having the biological activity of d monooxygenase which is capable of being expressed in a plant,operably linked to 
a heterologous promoter capable of promoting the expression in a plant of a structural gene operably linked thereto.
patent,lines.dependent claim claims the recombinant gene of claim wherein the dna sequence is the structural gene sequence of,except that the initiation codon is atg,or certain specified variants,lines.
dow agrosciences produces a line of genetically modified seeds that are resistant to d as well as other herbicides.dow products use two genes called aad and aad that code for two aad aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase enzymes.like the enzyme of bayer patent specification,those aad enzymes are dioxygenases that catalyze a reaction in which d converts to dcp.
in december,bayer brought suit accusing dow seeds of infringing the patent.although dow products do not use the figure gene,bayer argued that they fall within the broader claim,which encompasses enzymes that hav e the biological activity of d monooxygenase.bayer position from the outset has been that the quoted phrase covers any enzyme that triggers cleaving of the side chain of d to produce dcp,even if it is a dioxygenase and even if it does not share other biological activities of the particular enzyme whose gene bayer sequenced.because dow seeds contain genes coding for enzymes that allegedly cause the cleaving of d side chain,bayer contended that they infringe.
after holding a markman hearing with witness testimony and receiving for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in dow favor.see bayer cropscience ag dow agrosciences llc,civ,wl.limiting its analysis to the biological activity of d monooxygenase phrase,the court rejected bayer view of its claims.instead,the court concluded that the plain and ordinary meaning requires that d monooxygenase be read to embody the established scientific meaning of monooxygenase,which involves one oxygen atom going to water,and that the whole phrase therefore means the enzymatic activity of an enzyme,in a biological system,that causes a reaction with d,and two molecules of oxygen,where one molecule of oxygen is added to d and the other ultimately forms water.id.at see id.at.under that construction,there was no dispute that dow products do not infringe because they are dioxygenases,even though they create d resistant plants through an enzymatic activity that produces cleaving of the side chain of d to yield dcp.id.at.
having rejected bayer broad construction,id.at,the court went on to explain that,if it had concluded otherwise,it still would have granted summary judgment for dow,just for a different reason.id.at.specifically,the court ruled that the claim so construed would fail to satisfy the written description requirement of because disclosing one gene and the test used to find it was not enough to capture the large genus that bayer purported to have claimed.id.bayer appeals.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
this case turns on claim construction,a matter that we review de novo.specifically,it turns on whether bayer proposed construction of the term the biological activity of d monooxygenase in the only independent claim claim is correct.bayer rests its appeal entirely on the contention that the district court erred in failing to construe the term broadly to mean bringing about the cleavage of the side chain of d,without further qualification.like the district court,we see two problems with this position a familiar aspects of textual analysis point strongly the other way and b it would read independent claim so broadly as to raise serious doubts about validity.together,those problems lead us to conclude that bayer proposed claim construction is wrong,which leaves us with no basis for disturbing the district court judgment of of claim and hence all dependent claims.
to get to its construction of the biological activity of d monooxygenase as bringing about the cleavage of the side chain of d,bayer takes two steps.first,it treats the phrase d monooxygenase as not carrying the ordinary meaning of sending one of the two oxygen atoms to water treating it instead either as if it said merely oxygenase or as if it were a proper name of a particular enzyme or class without any descriptive meaning.second,bayer broadens the claim coverage by defining the term the biological activity of as referring to any enzyme that alters d by cleaving its side chain neither encompassing other biological activities nor limited to those cleaving reactions that make the enzyme a mono oxygenase.both steps encounter serious textual difficulties.
to begin with,these efforts fight a facially straightforward textual analysis.as the district court recognized,all agree that the word monooxygenase has long had a clear meaning,an enzyme catalyzing a reaction in which one oxygen atom is incorporated into water and the second is incorporated into something other than water.see bayer,wl,at.putting d in front of monooxygenase,then,appears to be simply the standard way of conveying what the monooxygenase acts on,namely,and the biological activity of,in turn,is naturally understood to refer to the activity that makes the identified enzyme a monooxygenase that acts on d the attachment of one oxygen atom to the d molecule to trigger cleaving with the other atom of going to water.under this reading,the full phrase works as an integrated unit in a way that fits its structure and the ordinary meaning of its words.
arguing against this textual analysis,bayer proposes a construction that first requires stripping the phrase d monooxygenase of the scientifically accepted descriptive content of the term monooxygenase.adopting bayer position,we think,would require that the patent,or its history,make reasonably clear that bayer was not using the term in its established descriptive sense.see,abbott labs.syntron bioresearch.familiar claimconstruction policies regarding public notice and patentee drafting duties make it appropriate to demand such clarity here bayer chose the language based on an unverified belief that it accurately described its enzyme,learned that the belief was false while its application was pending,had seven years before its patent issued to alter the language,but never did.
the patent and its history,however,do not clearly indicate that the patent uses the language at issue without its accepted scientific descriptive meaning.on the contrary,bayer usage in the intrinsic record is at the very best inconsistent.much of it actually reinforces the straightforward descriptive meaning of the claim terms.
nothing in the intrinsic record affirmatively indicates that,if the phrase d monooxygenase is descriptive,the mono part is to be ignored.perhaps bayer should have recognized that its background assumption that mono was accurate was unverified,and initially used a different phrase.but given its reliance on that assumption,one would hardly expect the written description to contain a redefinition to override the mono meaning.
as for any understanding of the claim phrase as a proper name whose monooxygenase portion lacks any descriptive significance,the intrinsic record provides bayer nothing like clear support.the patent uses the phrase or its variants in different ways,sometimes with an indefinite article implying a descriptive use,sometimes with other indicators that it is describing a genus naturally defined by the ordinary meaning,and only sometimes as what might seem to be just a proper name but even then without excluding an implication that the name conveys the underlying mechanism of action,patent,lines d monooxygenase is an enzyme catalyzing in many d degrading organisms the first step in the metabolizing of d,lines referring to the enzyme d monooxygenase activity,line referring to the d monooxygenase,the adjective suggesting a narrowing of the broader class identified by the noun the prosecution history is similar.notably,claims filed in the application claimed a d monooxygenase gene encoding a polypeptide having the biological activity of such a monooxygenase,patent application,filed,emphasis added language that reinforces rather than undermines the ordinary descriptive meaning.
the conclusion we draw is that there is no clear message that the patent gives bayer broad meaning to d monooxygenase in place of the term accepted scientific meaning,which describes a particular mechanism of action.bayer usage in this court reinforces the conclusion.much of bayer language continues to suggest a descriptive meaning.see note,supra opening br.at claim recites the dna sequence of one exemplary d monooxygenase reply br.at specification also unambiguously refers to a genus of genes encoding a genus of d monooxygenases opening br.at one claim phrase is at issue here biological activity of a d monooxygenase.
bayer argument regarding the biological activity language of claim is likewise unpersuasive.as the district court recognized,the ordinary meaning of that phrase alone places no particular limit on what kinds of activities in living cells are covered.see bayer,wl,at.as indicated above,a natural narrowing is provided by giving monooxygenase its mono meaning the biological activity would be that activity which makes the enzyme a monooxygenase.but bayer rejects both the meaning and the premise of the narrowing integrated interpretation.instead,it argues that the specification defines the biological activity claimed to be bringing about the cleavage of the side chain of d,no more and no less.we disagree.
the specification uses the phrase biological activity just twice.bayer focuses heavily on the first appearance,which says the tfda gene codes for d monooxygenase,a polypeptide having the biological activity of bringing about the cleavage of the side chain of patent,lines as corrected by certificate of correction.that language does not have the form of,or otherwise convey that it is,a definition of the biological activity.it describes something that a d monooxygenase does,but it does not say that every enzyme with that function is a d monooxygenase.see bayer,wl,at.more is needed for a term with an established scientific meaning to be redefined in the specification.
the specification second reference to biological activity actual
