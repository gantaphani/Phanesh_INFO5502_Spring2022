this appeal arises from a dismissal of a putative class action suit brought under sections,and of the securities act of,a.lead plaintiffs silverstrand investments,safron capital corporation,and briarwood investments collectively,plaintiffs challenge the dismissal,arguing that the complaint plausibly pleads actionable omissions from a prospectus and a registration statement the offering documents issued by amag pharmaceutical,amag in connection with a secondary stock offering held on january,the offering.specifically,plaintiffs point to two omissions by amag failure to disclose reports of serious adverse effects including a death linked to feraheme,a drug for amag future and failure to disclose information the food and drugs administration fda revealed in a warning letter issued nine months after the offering.
the district court premised the dismissal of the entire complaint on the relatively narrow ground that plaintiffs failed to sufficiently plead claims pursuant to items and of securities and exchange commission sec regulation s k.we affirm in part and reverse in part that dismissal.first,we conclude that the complaint states claims of actionable omissions because the undisclosed reports gave rise to uncertainties amag reasonably knew would adversely affect future revenues,see a ii requiring disclosures of uncertainties that reasonably will adversely affect a registrant business and risk factors that made the offering risky and speculative,see id.c requiring disclosure of risks that make an offering risky or speculative.we,however,also hold that as to the information the fda revealed nine months after the offering,the complaint failed to allege omissions sufficient to state a claim.we thus affirm as to that claim 
to get to our conclusion we first have to answer three questions whether the district court decision was consistent with items and of regulation s k whether the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs and claims based on the determination that the complaint failed to allege claims under and whether the district court erred in implicitly denying a request for leave to amend by not addressing it.we reach this latter issue only because plaintiffs move us to grant them leave to amend their allegations in connection with the information revealed by the fda,a request we deny.
background 
a.the parties 
plaintiffs filed this suit on behalf of themselves and all other investors who purchased amag shares pursuant or traceable to the offering documents.are amag,all officers and directors of amag who signed the offering documents,as well as the investment firms that underwrote the offering collectively,defendants.
events leading up to plaintiffs suit 
as related in the complaint and stated by the district court,the events leading up to this appeal began with amag development of feraheme,an intravenous drug used to treat anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease.although two competing therapies dominated the market in which feraheme intended to compete,amag hoped to capitalize on the drug faster and shorter treatment time in december,amag thus sought approval from the fda to market feraheme as an treatment.
amag disclosed to investors details about feraheme process.amag disclosures included information concerning serious adverse events saes that resulted during feraheme clinical trials for example,in a january,sec k form,amag disclosed results of one of the phases of feraheme clinical trials,including that the sae rate was among feraheme subjects compared to among oral subjects.amag also apprised investors that in the feraheme clinical development program that included subjects,deaths were observed,but n one of these deaths were considered to be related to study treatment.
amag made similar disclosures in an sec k form filed for the fiscal year ending december.there,amag stated that,a cross all phases of the feraheme clinical development program with approximately total administered doses of feraheme,there were no cases of anaphylaxis and no deaths determined by the fda investigators to be.
amag efforts to secure fda approval for feraheme initially failed.by letter dated october,the fda declined to approve feraheme due,in part,to a single occurrence of anaphylaxis among patients exposed to the drug.the letter also expressed concerns with the occurrence of serious hypotensive reactions in approximately of the exposed population inconsistencies in the reports of saes and systematic deficiencies in feraheme manufacturing process.the fda again declined to approve feraheme on december.it took amag until june,to finally obtain the fda imprimatur for feraheme.
in approving feraheme,the fda sanctioned a product insert for amag to include with the drug.among other things,the product insert explicitly disclosed several safety risks associated with the drug 
feraheme may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions,including anaphylaxis anaphylactoid reactions.in clinical studies,serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported in of subjects receiving feraheme.other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity,pruritus,rash,urticaria or wheezing were reported in of these subjects.
an sec k form amag filed in july,announced the fda approval of feraheme and shared with potential investors the information in feraheme package insert.
feraheme hit the market in july,and amag quickly geared up for the offering.on november,amag issued an sec k form which disclosed to investors that feraheme may not receive the same level of market acceptance as competing iron replacement therapy products the iron replacement therapy market is highly sensitive to several factors including the perceived safety profile of the available products 
the offering documents were issued in january.the prospectus included detailed disclosures about the results of feraheme clinical trials,the fda approval process,and the package insert.it also incorporated by reference some of amag filings with the sec and contained a section regarding the risk factors associated with the offering,which,according to amag,included o ur ability to demonstrate to the medical community the clinical efficacy and safety of feraheme as an alternative to current treatments for iron deficiency anemia the prospectus further appraised investors that 
amag is subject to ongoing fda regulatory requirements failure to comply with such regulatory requirements or the later discovery of previously unknown problems with feraheme may result in restrictions on our ability to market and sell feraheme fda warning letters and label changes any of these sanctions would have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and to achieve profitability.
amag ability to generate future revenue is solely dependent on our successful commercialization and development of feraheme accordingly,if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from sales of feraheme,we may never be profitable,our financial condition will be materially adversely affected,and our business prospects will be limited.
the offering documents,however,did not mention that amag had reported to the fda at least reports of saes since feraheme inception to the market.two of those reports documented,respectively,anaphylactic reactions in two female patients with a outcome requiring hospitalization.fourteen of the other reports stated that saes had resulted in hospitalizations due to one or more symptoms associated with anaphylaxis,including cardiac arrest,shortness of breath,a reduction in blood pressure,loss of consciousness,hives,dizziness,or vomiting.the offering documents similarly failed to mention that on december,amag had reported to the fda that a year old patient died following one mg injection of feraheme and that the drug had been identified by the treating physician as the primary suspect for the fatality.
the offering took place on january.over three million shares of amag common stock were sold to the public at per share,bringing amag approximately million in net proceeds and over million in fees to the underwriters.within weeks,however,the market value of amag shares began to plummet.
on february,a securities analyst reported that several patients using feraheme had experienced adverse reactions to the drug and that at least one patient had died for reasons that may or may not be directly related to feraheme.the report also stated that it was impossible to determine whether those incidents fell within the occurrence rate of saes disclosed in feraheme package insert and that consultants continu ed to use feraheme but adoption rates were slowing.amag shares closed at after the issuance of the report.
the next day,amag issued a press release stating,among other things,that the saes identified by the analyst were consistent with the rates disclosed in feraheme package insert.according to amag press release,o f the estimated patient exposures to date,serious adverse events have been reported no mortality signal has been observed.a single reported death occurred in a patient two days treatment,which the company does not believe was the result of feraheme.notwithstanding,amag shares still dropped an additional cents at market end.
the market price of amag shares took another hit on february.that day,a analyst report expressed skepticism regarding amag representations as set forth in its press release and stated that one of feraheme competing alternatives had been associated with only one sae and one death during its market life.amag shares slipped to.
plaintiffs file suit 
plaintiffs filed the complaint on march.they sought compensatory damages under of the securities act,claiming,in essence,that amag failed to disclose in the offering documents the existing fact that feraheme users had already suffered adverse reactions to feraheme requiring hospitalization.
amag shares continued to perform poorly in the market after plaintiffs suit.on october,the fda issued a warning letter to amag,stating that amag website had misrepresented feraheme approved uses.the letter also asserted that amag website had failed to communicate any of the risks associated with the drug,suggesting that feraheme was safer than ha d been demonstrated and therefore plac ing the public at risk.ten days later,amag announced for the first time that the fda had created a tracked safety issue for feraheme saes the fda had met with the company in september to discuss saes and the company was in discussions with the fda concerning labeling changes.amag shares fell from to on that day.
on november,prompted by the fda,amag announced changes in feraheme package insert.the changes included warnings of saes as well as a requirement that physicians increase the observation period after administering feraheme to patients.when that news hit the market,amag shares fell to,a decrease from the offering price of per share.
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on december.this time the complaint pled causes of action under,and of the securities act and advanced the two claims of omissions at issue here.among other things,the complaint alleged that between feraheme approval and the offering amag had reported to the fda but failed to disclose to investors saes associated with feraheme use,including documented anaphylactic reactions in two female patients with a outcome requiring hospitalization according to the complaint,amag had a duty to disclose the saes under item,a ii,because the saes gave rise to uncertainties that amag knew would reasonably have a negative impact on its business.similarly,the compliant alleged that the saes made the offering risky or speculative,and therefore,that amag had a duty to disclose them under item.c.
further,the complaint alleged that amag failed to disclose that a material portion of its revenues was derived from the internet practices highlighted in the fda october,warning letter,and thus,implied that amag was already engaging in such practices when the offering took place nine months earlier.
plaintiffs suit is dismissed 
in february,defendants moved to dismiss under.b.plaintiffs opposed and moved to amend the complaint.in dismissing plaintiffs claims,the court concluded that the saes neither were a known trend or uncertainty pursuant to item nor made the offering speculative or risky pursuant to item,because the saes that occurred after the launch of feraheme but prior to the offering were consistent with the previously rates observed in the clinical trials.the court also remarked that one death does not a trend make.
plaintiffs contentions regarding the information underlying the october,fda letter were also dismissed.according to the district court,no allegation in the complaint linked the internet practices questioned in the letter to amag business practices at the time of the offering.
plaintiffs claims under and fared no better.the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims under the same reasoning used to dismiss the claims,noting that both sections require a showing of an actionable omission.the district court also dismissed plaintiffs claims,on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state requisite claims under either or.the court made no ruling in connection with plaintiffs request for leave to amend the complaint,and thus implicitly denied it.this appeal timely followed.

iii.analysis 
plaintiffs claims and items and 
in their first point of error,plaintiffs challenge the district court determination that amag was not to disclose the saes and the information the fda revealed in the warning letter issued nine months after the offering.specifically,plaintiffs find error in the district court determination that said information did not constitute uncertainties or risks under items and,both of which are actionable through.

i the saes 
our de novo review satisfies us that the allegations in the complaint,when read in context,plausibly plead item and omissions in connection with the saes.the relevant allegations for this analysis are the following that as of the time of the offering,feraheme had been in the market for six months that feraheme was sold in a market dominated by alternatives with proven safety and efficacy records that amag profitability entirely depended on feraheme commercial success that the fda twice declined to approve feraheme due to safety concerns,which included one incident of anaphylaxis that during feraheme clinical trials there were no deaths determined by the fda investigators to be that as of the time of the offering,amag had disclosed to the fda saes,including one death in which feraheme had been identified by a reporting physician as the primary suspect,two incidents of anaphylactic reactions attributed to feraheme,and fourteen hospitalizations caused by anaphylactic symptoms attributed to feraheme and that amag offering documents did not disclose either the death,the incidents,or the fourteen hospitalizations attributed to feraheme.
taking the preceding factual allegations as true,we have no trouble drawing the reasonable inference that before the offering amag knew that a death,two reactions,and fourteen hospitalizations would have been relevant to consumers when deciding whether to use feraheme,as opposed to another proven and safer alternative.the offering documents stated as much the iron replacement therapy market is highly sensitive to several factors including the perceived safety profile of the available products.common sense also dictates that amag knew that the riskier feraheme appeared,the less attractive the drug would be as a method of treatment,and the less likely an investor would be to invest in amag,whose profits entirely depended on feraheme commercial success.
the allegations also allow the reasonable inference that,before the offering,amag knew that the saes could have prompted fda action in connection with feraheme.if the fda initially declined to approve feraheme due to a single case of anaphylaxis during clinical trials,a death,two anaphylactic reactions,and fourteen hospitalizations undoubtedly could have raised red flags with the agency.moreover,because the fda investigators had found no deaths as of the time of feraheme approval,we can reasonably infer that the fda could have sprung into action due to a death.
similarly,the allegations allow us to reasonably infer that fda intervention due to the saes would have meant trouble for amag.we need go no further than the excerpts of the offering documents cited above to get an idea of one of at least two possible consequences fda action may result in restrictions on amag ability to market and sell feraheme,the issuance of fda warning letters,and label changes.any of th o se sanctions would have a material adverse impact on amag ability to generate revenues and to achieve profitability amag ability to generate future revenue is solely dependent on its successful commercialization and development of feraheme.regarding the other possible consequence,let just say that we doubt that amag believed that an untimely fda intervention would positively impact the offering.to plead plausible claims for omissions under due to undisclosed item uncertainties and undisclosed item risks,the type of allegations and inferences just described more than suffice.
the district court,however,concluded otherwise primarily because the saes that occurred after the launch of feraheme but prior to the offering were consistent with the previously rates observed in the clinical trials.defendants invite us to affirm that conclusion,arguing that it is a matter of simple math that the rate of saes alleged by plaintiff is dramatically less than the sae rate observed during clinical trials and disclosed to the public we can not accept defendants invitation.
to reach its conclusion,the district court compared the information disclosed prior to the offering with the data disclosed in the press release amag issued on february,that is,patient exposures to feraheme and serious adverse events reported.this comparison is problematic for at least three reasons.
first,the complaint alleges that amag misleadingly calculated the rate of occurrence of saes.in its press release,amag reported the rate as based on the estimated injections of feraheme to date,rather than based on the number of patients,the metric used during the clinical trials.because feraheme is administered in as many as four injections,the changed metric understated the rate of saes.the complaint alleges that the true rate of saes is as high as based on the per patient metric.defendants apparently succeeded in convincing the district court to compare that rate with a rate of occurrence reported during one of the many phases of feraheme clinical trials but in so doing,defendants did not reveal,either to the district court or to us,that the disclosure documents also set forth a separate category for saes,which were reported as occurring only in of the patients in the clinical trials.since plaintiffs allege that the unreported saes were all,the rate alleged in the complaint appears to have been over two times higher than what amag had previously reported,which negates the district court conclusion.
second,amag press release refers to the state of affairs two weeks after the offering.that gap is dispositive in itself,as the inquiry under,as well as under items and,requires us to assess the information a registrant knows exclusively as of the time of the stock offering.see a in case any part of the registration statement,when such part became effective emphasis supplied.
last but not least,our analysis under items and can not be limited to simple arithmetical computations.the question is not whether the saes comported with past experiences but rather whether the saes,in the context in which they occurred,created uncertainties or risks that amag needed to disclose under items and.panther partners,at,a decision issued after the district court dismissal,offers guidance on this issue.
in that case,investors brought,and claims following a secondary stock offering by a manufacturer of programmable semiconductors.their complaint alleged that the offering documents ran afoul of item in failing to disclose known defects,and thus possible recalls,on all semiconductors sold in a transaction representing of the company yearly revenues.the district court dismissed the complaint under rule b,finding that i t is no secret that chips are subject to some percentage of failure the plaintiff must tell the court what was going on and how much the defect experienced actually differed from the norm.id.at quoting panther partners,ikanos commc ns,civ,wl,at june,internal citations omitted.the second circuit granted a motion for leave to amend the complaint,but the district court,on remand,still found the proposed amendments insufficient to allege that defendants knew the defect rate was above average before filing the registration statement.id.in reversing,the second circuit stated 
we believe that,viewed in the context of item disclosure obligations,the defect rate,in a vacuum,is not what is at issue.rather,it is the manner in which uncertainty surrounding that defect rate,generated by an increasing flow of highly negative information from key customers,might reasonably be expected to have a material impact on future revenues.
in focusing on whether plaintiff alleged that defendants knew the defect rate was above average before the secondary offering,the district court construed the proposed complaint and our remand order too narrowly.item disclosure obligations,like materiality under the federal securities laws provisions,do not turn on restrictive mechanical or quantitative inquiries.
id.at,internal citations omitted citing matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d rejecting contention that saes associated with pharmaceutical company product could not be material absent a statistically significant number of reports establishing a causal link between the product and the saes 
under the foregoing analysis,the statistical comparison defendants advance,even if it worked in their favor,is not dispositive.rather,at this stage,we are more concerned with the allegation that,when the offering took place,the news that feraheme had possibly caused a death,as well as the other serious side effects reported in the saes,was already circulating within the medical community amag needed to win over to remain as a going concern.because the complaint alleged that amag failed to disclose the saes,even though it knew about them,we can not conclude that it failed to state plausible claims for omissions of item uncertainties and item risks.
ii the fda warning letter 
the claim that item required amag to disclose the information revealed in the fda warning letter issued nine months after the offering is a completely different story.not much elaboration is needed on this front.as the district court correctly noted,the complaint is devoid of factual allegations to allow the inference that amag website contained the problematic information when the offering took place.the complaint also lacks allegations to support the inference that as of the time of the offering amag derived a significant amount of revenue from internet sales.without such allegations,plaintiffs contentions amount to nothing more than dispensable unsupported conclusions.see ocasio hernández,at.
plaintiffs and claims 
plaintiffs second and third points of error challenge the dismissal of their and causes of action,arguing that the district court exclusively premised its decision on the erroneous determination that the complaint had failed to plead a cause of action under.given our conclusion regarding the claims under,plaintiffs are correct.see in re morgan stanley info.fund secs,at claims under sections and a are securities act siblings with roughly parallel elements citing pinter dahl,d see also plumbers union local pension fund nomura asset acceptance,cir stating that a liability finding under either or is a prerequisite for success under 
plaintiffs leave to amend request 
as stated above,in their third point of error,plaintiffs challenge the district court failure to allow a third amended complaint and move us to grant them leave to replead the allegations regarding amag misrepresentations on its website.plaintiffs included their request for another attempt at making a plausible claim on this front within their submission opposing dismissal,but failed to provide the district court with the reasons supporting their request and with the substance of possible amendments.instead,plaintiffs relied on four boilerplate sentences stating the freely given standard under which a request for leave to amend is generally analyzed.the district court never addressed the request,and plaintiffs believe that that constituted a reversible error.
plaintiffs request for leave to amend had one basic problem it failed to abide by our maxim that litigants should not seriously expect to obtain a remedy without doing the necessary leg work first.see,united states zannino,cir it is not enough to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.not much is needed to satisfy this rule.litigants simply have to set forth the factual and legal predicate for the remedy sought.see rodríguez machado shinseki,cir per curiam.
this is for good reason.on the one hand,busy judges,faced with lengthy and growing dockets,necessarily must rely on litigants to present the relevant facts and law governing the disputes that the judges are asked to resolve.powers hamilton county public defender com n,cir.and on the other,federal litigation is less a game of blind man buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues of facts and law disclosed to the fullest practicable extent,united states procter gamble,d,so as to give each party a meaningful opportunity to present its case.truncated at the factual end,plaintiffs request for leave to amend ran afoul of both of these principles.the district court therefore acted well within its discretion when completely disregarding the request.see in re olympic mills,cir finding a damages claim waived because as presented to the district court the argument was fatally undeveloped,comprising only four sentences,a citation to a district court opinion,and no analysis whatsoever see also in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust,cir it is within the district court discretion to deny leave to amend implicitly by not addressing the request when it is presented informally in a brief filed in opposition to a motion to dismiss.
all the same,we have no basis under which to assess plaintiffs request at this juncture,as they failed to provide us with any information from which to conclude that their already fatally flawed claim can somehow spring back to life.plaintiffs main contention on this front is that matrixx overturned decades of existing case law interpreting the materiality standard for purposes of the federal securities laws.plaintiffs therefore should,at least,be given the opportunity to replead in light of this significant intervening change in law.but matrixx,which is not controlling here,did not have such a effect.see hill gozani,cir matrixx reaffirmed the rule that the possession of material,information does not create a duty to disclose.moreover,we have been provided with no explanation whatsoever as to why any additional facts plaintiffs might add now were not included in the complaint or in the two amendments preceding it.see foman davis,d stating that repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed constitutes an appropriate ground to deny leave to amend.and because plaintiffs failed to even generally describe their intended amendments,we do not know what sort of new facts they may allege now to cure the deficiencies in their complaint.see mann chase manhattan mortg
