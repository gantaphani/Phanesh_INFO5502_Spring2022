appellants ricardo alerre,deborah bordeaux,and michael jackson the defendants challenge the various convictions and sentences imposed on them in the district of south carolina.the a new trial on drug distribution,drug conspiracy,and conspiracy charges levied against them by the grand jury.the multiple charges in their indictment arise from an alleged operation and a scheme carried out during a period in the myrtle beach area of south carolina.the defendants contend on appeal that,in their trial,their lawyers were constitutionally ineffective and the prosecutors engaged in prejudicial misconduct.they also maintain that the trial evidence was insufficient to support their conspiracy convictions.finally,the defendants challenge their sentences on the basis of the supreme court recent decision in united states booker,and the prosecutors have confessed error on that point.as explained below,we affirm the defendants convictions,vacate their sentences,and remand for resentencing.
the government prosecuted the were medical doctors licensed in south carolina and registered with the drug enforcement administration the dea for their involvement with the comprehensive care and pain management center ccpmc,in myrtle beach.during the relevant period to,ccpmc was owned and operated by david woodward.on august,the grand jury charged the defendants,along with woodward and four others,in a count indictment.the defendants were each charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances,in contravention of the drug conspiracy charge count conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of h the laundering conspiracy charge count and multiple counts of distributing controlled substances,in violation of a the distribution charges.more specifically,of the distribution charges in the indictment,jackson was charged with five counts of distributing oxycontin,oxy ir,and percocet counts through bordeaux with four counts of distributing oxycontin and oxy ir counts through and alerre with eight counts of distributing oxycontin counts through 
the defendants jury trial was conducted in florence,south carolina,from january to february.the jury heard the testimony of witnesses,thirty of whom were called by the government.the most important prosecution witness was woodward,who had earlier pleaded guilty under a plea agreement and was cooperating with the united states attorney.
according to woodward testimony,ccpmc was simply a front for an illegal operation and a scheme.woodward explained how he had developed a plan to conceal ccpmc illegal activities from the law enforcement and medical authorities.in carrying out his activities,he had directed ccpmc physicians to conduct superficial physical examinations of ccpmc patients that served no medical purpose and were intended only to make the issuance of prescriptions look like the practice of medicine.tr.in so doing,woodward developed a medical record template with boilerplate diagnoses that could be loaded into patients charts and used to deceive insurance companies and investigators.tr.patients were given various diagnostic tests to justify insurance billings,and ccpmc physicians systematically requested outside radiologists to over read magnetic resonance imaging pictures in order to justify specific prescriptions.tr.if a patient was insured,the ccpmc doctors would order additional unnecessary tests and scans.tr.the revenue from such tests and scans constituted about half of ccpmc income,with the other half being derived from the superficial patient examinations and the issuance of illegitimate prescriptions.id.
in his testimony,woodward acknowledged that fifteen to twenty percent of ccpmc patients had legitimate medical problems,but asserted that all patients were treated the same,t hey all received the narcotic medication without regard to medical necessity.tr.the testimony of former ccpmc employees and patients corroborated woodward evidence.
woodward hired jackson in february,and hired bordeaux two years later,in february.the evidence revealed that bordeaux and jackson,along with other ccpmc physicians,developed a practice known as fast tracking,which they used to expedite the issuance of illegitimate prescriptions for controlled substances.tr.under the practice,a ccpmc physician would enter an examination room where five or six patients waited,sign prescriptions for each,and promptly exit without asking any medical questions or performing any medical examinations.id.
after bordeaux and jackson left ccpmc in the summer of,woodward hired alerre.according to woodward,he needed alerre to shadow him and issue prescriptions because woodward license to prescribe controlled substances had been suspended by the dea.tr.woodward further testified that alerre understood his role before he accepted a position with ccpmc.id.when alerre began his work at ccpmc,he would accompany woodward while superficial patient examinations were conducted.tr.at the conclusion of such examinations,alerre would issue illegitimate prescriptions to the patients.tr.
donald shafer,a former ccpmc patient,testified that,on his first visit to ccpmc,alerre and woodward took him to an examination room,searched him to determine if he was wired,and asked if he was working as an undercover agent.once satisfied that shafer was not working for the authorities,woodward and alerre asked shafer if he wanted a prescription for oxycontin or a drug called lorcet.
importantly,woodward also testified that he confronted each defendant and inquired whether they understood the illicit nature of ccpmc activities.the defendants assured woodward that they were willing to participate in ccpmc overall scheme.woodward approached jackson,asked if he was able to do this,and jackson assured him i got your back.tr.in answering a similar inquiry,bordeaux replied if i go along with this and do this,can i have your father pickup truck tr.when woodward asked alerre if he was comfortable with what we were doing,alerre paused and responded o h,to hell with it.tr.woodward understood alerre response to confirm that alerre was part of our team that is,alerre was agreeing to join in woodward illicit operations.id.
the prosecution expert witness,arthur jordan,testified that the defendants systematically wrote prescriptions that were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose.based on his review of randomly selected patient charts,jordan opined that the defendants had failed to adhere to generally accepted medical standards.see.specifically,jordan testified that many of the prescriptions lacked appropriate documentation or had no follow up treatment,that the defendants ignored red flags indicative of drug abuse,and that certain prescriptions and dosages were inappropriate.see.
jordan then testified that the defendants had issued prescriptions that were totally away from and inconsistent with the dosages that a prudent physician in the state of south carolina would give,as what we call the standard of care.when the court,sua sponte,expressed concern that such evidence might be improper,a defense lawyer stated that he was waiting for jordan to finish his answer.the court then observed there was no reason to put something in the record which the jury may consider that is not the standard.id.the court concluded,in the presence of the jury,that w hether the doctors are negligen t or not,whether they were guilty of malpractice,is not an issue in this case.id.
the prosecution presented other evidence that the defendants prescription practices constituted illegitimate medicine,and that their practices consistently failed to meet the ordinary standard of care.though the defense lawyers did not object to such evidence,the court expressed its concern that evidence might be irrelevant and confusing,in that it appeared to relate to civil negligence issues and not necessarily to whether the defendants had contravened the applicable criminal statutes.the prosecutors,as well as the defense lawyers,repeatedly assured the court that such evidence was relevant and appropriate.
after the prosecution rested its,the defendants presented their own evidence.alerre testified personally and called eight other witnesses to testify.alerre asserted that he had only prescribed medicine to patients he believed to be in pain,and he denied having agreed to participate in ccpmc illegal activities.jackson testified that he had always prescribed medicine in good faith,and he called a corroborating witness.bordeaux did not testify,but called thirteen witnesses of her own.
at the close of trial,the court instructed the jury without objection.the instructions included the elements of the various offenses charged,the legal propriety of a physician actions concerning prescriptions,and the availability of a good faith defense on the distribution and drug conspiracy charges.tr.in particular,the court instructed the jury that it could not convict on the distribution and drug conspiracy charges if it found only that the defendants practices fell below that line of what a reasonable physician would have done.the instructions were that,in order to convict on the distribution and drug conspiracy charges,the jury was obliged to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were selling drugs,or conspiring to do so,and not practicing medicine.id.by its verdict,the jury found each defendant guilty as charged,except that alerre was found not guilty on one distribution charge count and the government dismissed a distribution charge against bordeaux count.
the laundering conspiracy charge alleged that the defendants conspired with woodward and others to knowingly and willfully conduct and attempt to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate and foreign commerce with the intent to promote the carrying on of specific unlawful activities.it further alleged that in excess of was received through ccpmc scheme,ordering unnecessary tests to collect insurance and its operation,and that such monies were deposited into accounts held and controlled by woodward and his companies.it alleged that these monies were expended to continue ccpmc scheme and operation,and that,i n furtherance of the conspiracy,and to achieve the objectives thereof,payments were made from the illicitly obtained funds,held by woodward and his companies,to the defendants,woodward,other ccpmc employees,and other institutions.at trial,the parties stipulated that the checks drawn on the business accounts of woodward and his companies,which are referred to in the laundering conspiracy charge,were cashed,and were financial transactions affecting interstate commerce.to.as explained above,woodward testimony was that each of the defendants had knowingly agreed to participate in ccpmc illegal activities relating to illegitimate prescriptions and health care fraud.
at the close of the prosecution,and again at the conclusion of the evidence,the defendants each moved under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure for judgment of acquittal on the laundering conspiracy charge.tr.their rule motions were denied and the jury found each of them guilty on that charge.
on february,prior to the supreme court decisions in blakely washington,d,and united states booker,d,the defendants sentencing hearings were conducted and their sentences were imposed.on appeal,the government concedes the challenged sentences were premised on drug quantities neither found by the jury nor admitted by the defendants,and because the sentences were imposed under a mandatory sentencing guidelines defendants are entitled to be resentenced.see booker,d united states hughes,cir concluding error was plain and warranted reversal where court imposed sentence under mandatory guidelines based on judicial factfinding,increasing sentencing range beyond that which could have been imposed on the basis of facts found by jury or admitted by defendant.
the defendants have filed timely notices of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.their consolidated appeals present three issues 
first,whether a civil liability standard was erroneously injected into the trial by the prosecutors and the defense lawyers,and,if so,whether the defendants are entitled to relief from their convictions either because their lawyers were constitutionally ineffective,or because the prosecutors engaged in prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct 
second,whether the evidence was sufficient to support their convictions on the laundering conspiracy charge and 
third,whether the the prosecution entitled to resentencing because booker was contravened.
as explained below,we reject the defendants challenges to their convictions,but we vacate their sentences and remand.
first,the defendants contend that they are entitled to a new trial because their lawyers were constitutionally ineffective and because the prosecutors engaged in prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct.these claims derive from their assertion that the lawyers on both sides of the case erroneously and unconstitutionally misunderstood and misapplied the pertinent standard for criminal liability.
we may consider an ineffective assistance claim in the first instance on direct appeal only if it conclusively appears from the record that counsel was constitutionally ineffective.united states vinyard,cir see also united states russell,cir a defendant may raise an ineffective assistance claim in the first instance on direct appeal only where the ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.in order to show such ineffectiveness,a defendant is obliged to demonstrate that the performance of his lawyers was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,and he was actually prejudiced in that but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.swisher true,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord strickland washington,d.
when asserting a prosecutorial misconduct claim,a defendant bears the burden of showing that the prosecutors engaged in improper conduct,and that such conduct prejudiced the defendant substantial rights so as to deny the defendant a fair trial.see united states mitchell,cir.and we review for plain error a prosecutorial misconduct claim that was not raised or presented to the trial court.b see also vinyard,at applying plain error review to prosecutorial misconduct claim first raised on appeal.in reviewing for plain error,we must affirm unless an appellant can show that an error was made,it was plain,and it affected the appellant substantial rights.vinyard,at.moreover,the correction of plain error lies within our discretion,which we do not exercise unless the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
in order to resolve the ineffective assistance and prosecutorial misconduct claims raised here,we must first assess the proper relationship between the civil and criminal standards of liability for a physician who has prescribed drugs.the distribution charges against the defendants involve violations of a,while the drug conspiracy charge involves a violation of,having as its object the contravention of a in relevant part,a provides that e xcept as authorized by law,it shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally distribute a controlled substance.generally,in order to convict under a,the prosecution is obliged to prove that the defendant knowingly or intentionally distributed the controlled substance alleged in the indictment,and at the time of such distribution the defendant knew that the substance distributed was a controlled substance under the law.united states tran trong cuong,cir.an enhanced analysis applies,however,to persons who are properly registered with the dea.pursuant to,such authorized to distribute controlled substances to the extent authorized by their registrations.see a requiring persons who distribute controlled substances to obtain annual registration from attorney general b authorizing registrant to distribute controlled substances to the extent authorized by the registration and in conformity with other provisions of law delegating,inter alia,attorney general authority under to dea administrator.
the seminal decision explaining the liability of such registered distributors is united states moore,where the supreme court held that a dea registration under grants only a qualified authorization of certain activities,and not a blanket authorization to dispense controlled substances.see,d.the defendants in who,although registered with the dea pursuant to,were convicted under a for illegally distributing controlled on appeal that,as registrants,they were immune from liability under.the court disagreed,affirming their drug distribution convictions and holding that registered physicians can be prosecuted under when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.id.at.the criminal standard.in discussing the proper application of the criminal standard,we have observed that a licensed physician who prescribes controlled substances outside the bounds of his professional medical practice is subject to prosecution and is no different than a pusher.tran trong cuong,at internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast to the criminal standard,a medical malpractice plaintiff in south carolina must show in a civil case the generally recognized practices and procedures that would be exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant doctor field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances,and that the defendant doctor departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards,practices,and procedures.gooding francis xavier,the civil standard.
in our tran trong cuong decision,we spelled out the proper relationship between the criminal standard,on the one hand,and the civil standard,on the other.tran,a registered physician,had been convicted on several distribution charges under a.see tran trong cuong,at.he sought relief from his convictions by,inter alia,contending that the prosecution evidence was insufficient.id.at.as part of his contention,tran asserted that the trial court had,in conducting his trial,mistakenly and erroneously applied the civil standard instead of the criminal standard.id.
we responded to tran appeal by explaining the pertinent distinctions between the criminal standard and the civil standard.in particular,judge chapman opinion observed that a criminal prosecution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the doctor was acting outside the bounds of professional medical practice.tran trong cuong,at.it elaborated that,in such a situation,a physician authority to prescribe drugs is being used not for treatment of a patient,but for the purpose of assisting another in the maintenance of a drug habit or of dispensing controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose,the personal profit of the physician.id.we concluded that the instructions in tran trial not only comported with the criminal standard,but also required the prosecution to prove that the physician had written prescriptions without a legitimate medical purpose,arguably a more stringent requirement than the criminal standard announced in moore,inuring to the defendant benefit.id.at.
importantly,as judge chapman explained in tran trong cuong,we found sufficient evidence to sustain tran distribution convictions by relying in part on expert testimony that tran had deviated drastically from accepted medical standards.id.at.as tran trong cuong thus demonstrates,evidence that a physician performance has consistently departed from accepted professional standards supports the proposition that the physician was not practicing medicine,but was instead cloaking drug deals under the guise of a professional medical practice.as a result,such evidence may properly be relevant to establish that the physician contravened the criminal standard of liability.see id.
the defendants contend that the lawyers on both sides of this case erroneously conflated the criminal standard with the civil standard and that,as a result,they were tried and convicted for civil malpractice rather than for the criminal distribution of drugs.importantly,however,the defendants have neither challenged the sufficiency of the trial evidence nor the propriety of the jury instructions of the trial court indeed,the defendants do not point to any specific trial error that prejudiced them.rather,they contend that their entire trial was infected with an erroneous standard of proof and that the verdict must thus be set aside,notwithstanding the sufficiency of the evidence and the propriety of the jury instructions.as explained below,this position does not pass muster.
first,the defendants have not directed us to any evidence that was improperly introduced.in contending that they were erroneously tried,the defendants appear to be asserting that,because evidence might show that a physician contravened the civil standard,it must categorically be excluded from a criminal proceeding.as our analysis in tran trong cuong demonstrates,however,evidence that a physician consistently failed to follow generally recognized procedures tends to show that in prescribing drugs he was not acting as a healer but as a seller of wares.see at see also.relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.providing that relevant evidence is generally admissible 
second,as the defendants concede,the jury was correctly instructed on the applicable legal principles.the trial court was careful to spell out the differences between the criminal standard and the civil standard.indeed,it admonished the jury that the defendants could only be convicted under the criminal standard,and it emphasized that they could not be convicted if they had dispensed the controlled substances at issue in good faith.ordinarily,of course,we presume that a properly instructed jury has acted in a manner consistent with the instructions.see jones united states,d.nonetheless,the defendants maintain that,on this record,an overwhelming probability exists that the jury ignored the instructions and convicted the defendants of civil malpractice.see goldsmith witkowski,cir the presumption of cure by a court instructions is overcome when there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court instructions,and a strong likelihood that the effect of the trial error would be devastating to the defendant.internal quotation marks omitted.in these circumstances,we are unable to agree with the defendants.the jury entered its deliberations armed with ample admissible evidence and with proper instructions on the applicable legal principles.the defendants assertions that their lawyers were confused at trial is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the jury used these tools properly 
in these circumstances,the defendants have not established any trial error caused by a misapprehension of the criminal standard on the part of the lawyers.they are unable to show that a substandard performance by their lawyers conclusively appears from the record,and they have also failed to demonstrate that the prosecutors engaged in any improper conduct relating to the standard of proof or their use of evidence.accordingly,we decline to reach and address the defendants ineffective assistance claims,and we reject their prosecutorial misconduct claims on the merits.
next,the defendants contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions on the laundering conspiracy charge and that the district court therefore erred in denying their motions,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,for judgment of acquittal on that charge.the defendants contention on this point is premised on their view that,as a matter of law,a defendant must have committed the substantive offense of promotion money laundering in order to be convicted on the laundering conspiracy charge.as explained below,that proposition is legally incorrect.moreover,the jury was properly the laundering conspiracy charge,and the defendants convictions on that offense are supported by substantial evidence 
we review de novo a district court denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal.united states,cir in so doing,we are obliged to sustain a guilty verdi
