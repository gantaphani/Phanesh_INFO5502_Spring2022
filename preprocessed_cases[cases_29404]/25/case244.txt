charles price voluntarily dismissed his indiana lawsuit against american cyanamid company and lederle laboratories in.unbeknownst to the defendants,price then reinstated the suit five years later and obtained a million default judgment from the state court.price attorney gave the defendants no notice of these proceedings until he sought to collect on the judgment in,at which point the defendants quickly removed the case to federal court and had the default judgment vacated based on the lack of notice.the district court ultimately granted summary judgment for the defendants dismissing price claim on statute of limitations grounds.
price has appealed,challenging the removal of the action and the district court orders granting relief from the default judgment and summary judgment for the defendants.price attorney takes the extraordinary position that his ex parte reinstatement of the lawsuit was perfectly appropriate under indiana law.it certainly was not.the defendants were entitled to notice of the motion to reinstate and all subsequent proceedings under indiana trial procedure rules ex parte conduct of this sort also violates indiana rules of professional conduct for attorneys.we affirm the orders of the district court and order price attorney to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for filing this frivolous appeal.we also direct the clerk of this court to transmit a copy of this opinion to the indiana supreme court disciplinary commission for any action it deems appropriate.
background 
on june,cathy and charles price filed suit in indiana state court against american cyanamid company and lederle laboratories a division of american cyanamid after cathy contracted polio from a child who recently had been vaccinated.cathy claim was based on product liability,and charles claim was for loss of consortium.the summons and complaint were served by certified mail on june,and a return of service was entered for american cyanamid on june.on june,the manager of american cyanamid legal department faxed a letter to plaintiffs counsel,delmar kuchaes,informing him that the national childhood vaccine injury act,et,requires that vaccination claims first be brought in the court of federal claims vaccine court pursuant to the federal vaccination compensation program.the letter provided plaintiffs counsel with the telephone number and mailing address of the federal program and asked that the lawsuit be terminated as required by the act.after receiving the facsimile letter,plaintiffs counsel voluntarily dismissed the suit that same day,before either defendant filed an appearance or responsive pleading.plaintiffs counsel sent american cyanamid a copy of the dismissal order,along with a letter stating that the suit had been discontinue d,or ed.
over the next few years,the prices pursued their claims in the vaccine court,where they ultimately learned that charles derivative claim was not compensable under the vaccine act accordingly,in march,charles voluntarily dismissed his claim in the vaccine court.cathy subsequently obtained a judgment from the vaccine court in excess of million.on july,the prices moved to reinstate their action,but they did not provide any notice of that motion to the defendants.the state court reinstated the case on july,again without notice to either defendant.for the next year and a half,no effort was made to notify the defendants of the reinstated proceedings.
on april,charles price filed motions for default judgment against the defendants,stating that process had been served in june and the defendants had subsequently failed to appear or respond the motions said nothing about the circumstances of the voluntary dismissal and were not served on the defendants.the court entered default judgments against the defendants on april,and scheduled an evidentiary hearing on damages.at that point,the court not price attorney forwarded a notice of the damages hearing to lederle laboratories at the address on the original summons served in.on july,the notice was returned to sender,stating no such office in state.as it turned out,the address on the original summons had incorrectly attributed lederle new york address to new jersey,but the post office had delivered it to the new york address anyway,presumably based on the new york zip code.price attorney made no attempt to notify lederle or american cyanamid of the reinstated proceedings,the default judgment motions,or the damages hearing.the hearing went forward on june,and the court awarded million to charles price 
the default judgments languished in state court for approximately four years until price initiated garnishment proceedings on june.at that time,price provided the state court with a new address at which to serve the defendants,that of the registered agent for american cyanamid and lederle.process for the garnishment proceedings was served on june,marking the first time since june,that the defendants received any notice of the proceedings that were taking place in indiana state court 
on june the defendants jointly filed a notice of removal to federal court and the case was removed.price challenged the removal as untimely and sought a remand to state court.the district court denied remand,holding that the removal was timely because the defendants had no notice that the previously dismissed case had been reinstated until a week before they sought removal.the district court then vacated the default judgments due to price failure to comply with notice requirements under indiana law.the defendants moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds the district court granted the motion,holding that the statute of limitations had expired during the intervening years between the voluntary dismissal and the reinstatement of the lawsuit.price now appeals the denial of his remand motion,the order vacating the default judgments,and the grant of summary judgment for the defendants.
ii.discussion 
timeliness of removal 
we review a district court denial of a motion to remand to state court de novo.tifft commonwealth edison,cir.price claim was removable based on diversity of citizenship a,a.price argues that the removal was not timely under two provisions of b.because federal procedure does not apply until removal occurs.c,we apply state rules to preremoval conduct.romo gulf stream coach,cir.
the removal clock 
price first invokes the time limit in b,which requires a defendant to file for removal within days of receiving the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief or receipt of the summons if the initial pleading is not required to be served.price argues that this period expired days after the defendants received the complaint in,even though the case was voluntary dismissed two weeks after it was filed.he claims that under indiana law,a lawsuit is not actually terminated when it is voluntarily dismissed,but rather remains pending indefinitely until such time as the plaintiff may seek reinstatement.he bases this argument on the distinction between a cause of action and a cause in indiana law a cause refers to a lawsuit,whereas a cause of action refers to an individual theory of liability within a cause.see,songer civitas bank.price maintains that he voluntarily dismissed only his cause of action in he insists that his cause remained pending emptied,as it were,of its cause of action,and the removal clock kept on ticking and expired.
what utter nonsense.to the extent there is a difference between a cause and a cause of action under indiana law,that difference is completely irrelevant here.songer defined these terms in the context of determining whether a single lawsuit containing both legal and equitable claims required a jury trial the case neither involved nor made any mention of voluntary dismissals.see id.at.price can not identify a single case supporting the notion that a voluntary dismissal terminates the cause of action but not the cause.this is undoubtedly because the idea is so ridiculous a cause that is,lawsuit can not continue to exist once every cause of action within it has been dismissed.the prices voluntary dismissal terminated the entire case against the defen
