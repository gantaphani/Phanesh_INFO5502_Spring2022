plaintiff animal legal defense fund filed a freedom of information act foia request with the food and drug administration fda regarding farms in texas.the fda released almost pages of documents but redacted data regarding total hen population,number of hen houses,number of floors per house,number of cage rows per house,number of cage tiers per house,and number of birds per cage for each farm in question.plaintiff filed this foia action seeking to compel the fda to release the redacted data.the district court ordered the release of information regarding the number of birds per cage at each farm.but the court held on summary judgment that,under foia exemption,the fda properly withheld the other categories of information because its release was likely to cause substantial competitive harm.see b.we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
in late,plaintiff submitted a foia request to the fda that sought the following 
all fda documents since april,relating to egg safety in texas,egg production in texas,or facilities in texas 
all fda communications with texas state government agencies since april,relating to egg safety,egg production,or facilities and 
all communications between the fda and egg producers in texas since april.
the fda released records related to inspections of eleven chicken facilities one quail facility and food manufacturer one food warehouse and one food distribution center.but redactions appeared on of the pages that the fda produced.
plaintiff filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief under foia,seeking to compel the production of the following information regarding inspected facilities total hen population number of hen houses number of floors per house number of cage rows per house number of cage tiers per house and number of birds per cage.the fda moved for summary judgment on the ground that foia exemption which applies to trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,id.b protected the redacted data.in support of its motion,the fda submitted several declarations from experts who stated that releasing the requested information would enable competitors to learn a given egg producer production rate,which in turn would allow the competitors to undercut the egg producer prices and lure away customers.plaintiff filed a for summary judgment,supported by its own declarations from an economist and a food industry consultant.those experts attested that releasing the withheld information would not facilitate competitive underbidding.
plaintiff also asked to suspend briefing of fda summary judgment motion in order to permit discovery directed to whether the information sought was publicly available.the district court denied that request because,among other things,plaintiff had not shown that the discovery it sought is essential to litigating the motion for summary judgment.
after briefing and oral argument,the district court granted in part and denied in part both parties summary judgment motions.the district court held that the fda had fallen short of showing how releasing the number of birds per cage would threaten any competitive harm and ordered disclosure of that information.but the court concluded that the fda had established that the release of the other five categories of redacted information total hen population,number of hen houses,number of floors per house,number of cage rows per house,and number of cage tiers per house was likely to result in substantial competitive harm due to underbidding.
plaintiff timely appeals the court grant of summary judgment in favor of the fda on the redaction of those five categories of information,as well as the denial of discovery.

discussion 
disclosure under foia 
disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of foia.shannahan irs,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.we construe narrowly foia nine exemptions.id.the fda relies on exemption,b,which is available to prevent disclosure of commercial and financial information,obtained from a person or by the government,that is privileged or confidential.gc micro def.logistics agency,cir.commercial information qualifies as confidential when disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.id.citing parks conservation ass morton.
adequate factual basis 
as noted above,we first must determine whether the district court had an adequate factual basis to reach its decision.lion raisins,at.in making this determination,we may rely solely on government affidavits so long as the affiants are knowledgeable about the information sought and the affidavits are detailed enough to allow the court to make an independent assessment of the government claim.kowack forest,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that threshold is met here.
several of the declarations by the fda experts stated that the industry was highly or extremely competitive.one emphasized that anything that changes costs by even a penny can make a huge difference.according to the experts,the redacted information was likely to cause substantial competitive harm because the competitors of the egg producers in question could use the information to form accurate estimates of each farm or producer rate of production and use those estimates to underbid.for example,one declarant stated that,once a competitor knows the production rate at an egg farm,the competitor is able to enter the farm regional market and offer to produce the same number of eggs per day for a lower price or a greater number of eggs per day for the same price and thereby lure away the farm customers.as in lion raisins,at,the declarations in this case established an adequate factual basis.the declarations provided the district court with the identity of the information sought and the claimed exemption,and provided the necessary detail about the specific competitive harm that could arise from the release of the redacted information.see also bowen fda,cir holding that government affidavits that described the documents withheld,the statutory exemptions claimed,and the specific reasons for the agency withholding provided an adequate factual basis for application of exemption.
review of district court analysis for clear error 
we next must decide whether the district court clearly erred in determining that the redacted information fell within exemption protection.the clear error standard is significantly deferential,and we will accept the lower court findings of fact unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.lentini cal.ctr.for the arts,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
