plaintiff dale wallis invented an antigen for a bovine mastitis vaccine as part of her duties as an employee of defendant phl associates,phl,more than years ago.the vaccine was eventually sold to upjohn,and this protracted litigation has featured the contest between wallis and phl over the benefits related to that sale.a jury concluded that phl and wallis agreed that wallis would own the antigen,but the jury also concluded that phl committed no fraud relating to the antigen.instead,the jury concluded phl committed fraud relating to wallis money she paid to phl and its shareholders also defendants to buy stock in phl.based on this conclusion,the jury awarded wallis a total of more than million dollars in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.finding unjust enrichment,the trial court awarded wallis a constructive trust against phl of more than million.both sides appeal.
we conclude that the jury verdict that phl and the individual defendant shareholders committed fraud related to wallis money does not support the damages award of more than million given the required reduction of the fraud damages,the punitive damages award against phl must also be reduced the trial court equitable award must be reversed and remanded for a new trial because the court improperly denied phl request for a statement of decision the trial court erred by offsetting the award of damages to wallis before computing prejudgment interest and we need not resolve several additional issues raised by the parties because of how we resolve the issues already mentioned.
we therefore modify the judgment as to the jury verdict and remand for recalculation of prejudgment interest,and we reverse and remand the judgment as to the equitable relief.
defendant phl develops,produces,and markets animal biologics commercial biotechnology products.individual defendants jeffrey wichmann,mary holmes,and thomas hanzo were shareholders and directors of phl.before,holmes held percent of the stock,and wichmann and hanzo each held percent.
phl hired plaintiff wallis in october.wallis served as phl director of laboratories.
in the fall of,wallis developed the j tc antigen referred to hereafter as the antigen for a vaccine for bovine mastitis.in a vaccine,the antigen is the active ingredient that invokes the immune response.it was disputed at trial whether wallis developed the antigen on her own time or within the scope of her phl employment.as we discuss later,the jury concluded that she developed the antigen within the scope of her phl employment.
in may,wallis and phl negotiated terms of a employment contract,including a term that any inventions or products she developed would remain her own.however,the agreement was never finalized.
in june,wallis met with the phl board of directors to discuss the production of a vaccine using the antigen.the board expressed a desire to do so,but wallis felt the board was reneging on its promise to make her a shareholder.she told phl attorney,thomas strohl,that she was considering taking the antigen to another company.
phl gave wallis a raise and the opportunity to purchase shares of phl stock for per share.purchase of the shares would entitle wallis to a position on the board of directors.wallis paid to phl for shares in july and paid the individual defendants a total of for five shares in december to holmes and each to wichmann and hanzo.after she paid for the phl shares,she was given a vote in board meetings.
phl began using the antigen to manufacture vaccine for the market.wallis received shareholder bonuses through and part of.
in,phl negotiated with upjohn to sell the vaccine.during the negotiations with upjohn,phl fired wallis.she refused an offer from wichmann and holmes to buy back her shares because she believed she was entitled to of the upjohn deal.wichmann,hanzo,and holmes voted to remove wallis from the board of directors.
in january,phl finalized the sale of the vaccine to upjohn for million.phl agreed not to compete with upjohn for years,and upjohn agreed that phl would be the exclusive producer and supplier of the antigen in the united states.
in march,phl attorney vigfus asmundson sent wallis a letter notifying her that she was not a shareholder because she had purchased only an option to become a shareholder after five years of employment.strohl enclosed checks to refund the purchase price of the shares plus interest.wallis rejected the characterization of the transaction and refused to cash the checks.
meanwhile,wallis husband at the time,james wallis,started an animal biologics company,hygieia biological laboratories hygieia,in february.after wallis left phl,she became an unpaid consultant for hygieia.in,she was put on the hygieia payroll.hygieia developed and marketed its own j antigen,and wallis contacted upjohn trying to get upjohn to purchase the vaccine from hygieia.
in,upjohn sued wallis and hygieia in federal court,alleging that they were infringing on the vaccine upjohn had purchased from phl.wallis and hygieia filed a counterclaim.the court granted summary judgment to upjohn on the counterclaim,and the parties settled upjohn claim with wallis agreeing that upjohn owned the rights to the vaccine.
wallis filed a complaint against phl,wichmann,hanzo,and holmes on june,the complaint alleged causes of action for unjust enrichment,fraud,conspiracy,constructive fraud,constructive trust,and conversion.wallis alleged but later dismissed a spoliation of evidence cause of action.wallis did not allege a breach of contract cause of action.the complaint also named attorney strohl as a defendant,but he is not a party to this appeal.
phl filed a against wallis,james wallis,and hygieia on february.the alleged causes of action for declaratory relief,rescission,intentional interference with contractual advantage,fraud,misappropriation of trade secrets,conversion,breach of fiduciary duty,unfair competition,and conspiracy.
wallis moved to bifurcate trial on the complaint and and to stay discovery on the until after trial on the complaint.the trial court granted the motion,and trial on the complaint began with judge stephen mock presiding.
after wallis,the trial court granted motions for nonsuit on the constructive fraud cause of action as to all defendants and the conversion cause of action as to the individual defendants.
the jury returned special verdicts on june,as follows 
general allegations 
wallis invented the j tc antigen.
she developed the antigen as part of her duties as an employee of phl.
wallis and phl agreed that she would own the antigen.
fraud relating to the antigen 
neither phl nor any of the individual defendants made a false promise or false representation to wallis related to the antigen.
fraud relating to wallis money 
phl did not make a false promise to wallis related to her money.
the individual defendants made a false promise to wallis related to her money and did not intend to perform on the promise.
phl and the individual defendants knowingly made a false representation to wallis related to her money for the purpose of inducing wallis to justifiably rely on it,which she did,unaware that the representation was false and that phl and the individual defendants did not intend to perform on it.
wallis fraud cause of action was not barred by unclean hands.
wallis did not fail to mitigate her damages caused by fraud.
wallis damages for fraud were against phl,against wichmann,against hanzo,and against holmes.
conversion of the antigen 
phl did not deliberately interfere with the antigen.
conversion of wallis money 
phl deliberately and unjustifiably interfered with wallis,but did not interfere with wallis.
phl did not make a good faith offer to return to wallis.
wallis conversion claim against phl was barred by neither the statute of limitations nor unclean hands.
wallis total damages suffered as a result of phl conversion of her money was.
the individual defendants deliberately and unjustifiably interfered with wallis but did not interfere with wallis.
the individual defendants did not make a good faith offer to return to wallis.
wallis conversion claim against the individual defendants was barred by neither the statute of limitations nor unclean hands.
wallis total damages suffered as a result of the individual defendants conversion of her money was against wichmann,against hanzo,and against holmes.
punitive damages 
phl and the individual defendants committed fraud,but not with malice or oppression.
the jury did not assess punitive damages against the individual defendants.
the jury assessed in punitive damages against phl.
the jury did not include in their assessment of compensatory damages for fraud and conversion any damages intended for the sake of example or for the purpose of punishment.
in summary,the jury found phl liable for fraud and conversion related to wallis money and assessed in compensatory damages and in punitive damages,and the jury also found the individual defendants liable for fraud and conversion related to her money and assessed compensatory damages only against wichmann,against hanzo,and against holmes.the jury did not find phl and the individual defendants liable for fraud related to the antigen.
after the jury trial was completed,judge mock heard argument on the equitable causes of action.the court granted the individual defendants motion for nonsuit on the unjust enrichment and constructive trust causes of action as it relates to the antigen,but it denied phl similar motion for nonsuit.with respect to unjust enrichment related to wallis money,the trial court denied the motions for nonsuit of both phl and the individual defendants although the trial court later determined that wallis had an adequate remedy at law as to the money.
on september,the court ruled on the equitable causes of action.it stated that it was bound by the factual determinations of the jury.concerning the merits,the court stated there was no oral or written contract providing wallis with compensation for the antigen.however,it would be unfair to wallis to allow phl to retain the money it received for the antigen.based on this reasoning,the court found there was unjust enrichment and that the appropriate equitable remedy was a constructive trust.
concerning whether phl wrongfully acquired the antigen from wallis,the court stated there no question that the defendants acquired the antigen.without the antigen there could be no vaccine.n othing would have been sold to upjohn.now,the defendants argue that when the jury found that there was no fraud and no conversion with regard to the antigen,then the court is precluded from imposing constructive trust.i acknowledge the jury finding under civil code section,constructive trust can be imposed when there any kind of wrongful taking whether it by accident,mistake,undue influence,the violation of a trust or any other wrongful act.in this case there no question that phl took the antigen without any compensation due to the plaintiff.i find that at the time the defendants took the antigen and failed to pay the plaintiff they were operating under what i would call a mistake of fact.
based on this reasoning,the court imposed a constructive trust of against phl for royalties phl received for the antigen after it was sold to upjohn up to may.it also imposed a constructive trust of against phl for the noncompetition agreement between phl and upjohn.as to this amount attributable to the noncompetition agreement,however,the trial court was not prepared to calculate interest.as to the wallis paid for the shares in phl,the court stated that she had an adequate remedy at law.finally,the court stated that it was unprepared to rule on the issues of whether to require an accounting or appoint a receiver.it therefore took that issue under submission,as well as the issue of interest on the amount attributable to the noncompetition agreement.
at the end of the hearing on september,and in response to a question from counsel for phl,the court stated that it did not intend its ruling to be final until it had made a decision on the issue of interest.
on november,the court held another hearing on its equitable decision.it stated that on the issue of prejudgment interest for the constructive trust for the noncompetition agreement it would award,making the total equitable judgment.the court then discussed with counsel for the parties whether to appoint a receiver.unsure how to proceed,the court asked the parties to file letter briefs on the issue.
on december,the court held a hearing to address two remaining issues whether a receiver could be appointed and,if so,whether the court should appoint one then.the court stated that the requirements for appointment of a receiver were met in this case,but that a receiver would not be appointed,with the understanding that other steps would be taken to preserve assets available to satisfy the judgment.
the court lifted the stay on the proceedings.because the was still pending,the court did not enter judgment.
on january,phl filed a written request for statement of decision on the equitable issues tried to the court.the court,however,denied the request as untimely.
in july,wallis filed a notice of peremptory disqualification of judge mock under code of civil procedure section,and judge mock stepped aside.
hanzo passed away in,and his estate settled with wallis.for that reason,neither hanzo nor his estate representative is a party to this appeal.
in april,the case was assigned to judge david de alba of the sacramento county superior court.
in april,the parties settled the,with wallis paying phl.phl dismissed the on july.
with the dismissed,the parties filed briefs concerning the judgment to be entered on the year old jury verdicts and equitable decisions on the complaint.wallis stated that the damage awards against phl for fraud and conversion were duplicative and elected to recover on the fraud cause of action.wallis also stated that of the equitable award attributable to the noncompetition agreement between upjohn and phl duplicated another part of the award.
on july,years after filing of the complaint and years after trial,judge de alba entered judgment.as later amended,the judgment against phl was on the jury fraud verdict,on the jury punitive damages verdict,and on the equitable claims.the court also awarded prejudgment interest on the amount of the compensatory damages award in wallis favor minus the amount of the settlement on phl at a rate of seven percent from the date of the verdict.the judgment against wichmann was for fraud and deceit together with prejudgment interest from the date of the verdict for a total of.and the judgment against holmes was together with prejudgment interest from the date of the verdict for a total of.
phl and wallis filed postjudgment motions.phl filed motions for new trial,for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and to set aside the judgment,while wallis filed a motion for new trial.judge de alba expressed concern that he did not have jurisdiction to entertain the postjudgment motions because he was not the trial judge,but the parties stated that they had no objection to his ruling on the motions.the court took the matters under submission and later issued a ruling denying all postjudgment motions.
discussion 
iinconsistent special verdict 
phl contends that the special verdict does not support the damages award of more than million because,according to the jury,phl committed fraud related to wallis money but not related to the antigen.phl argues that,instead,the maximum damages for fraud related to wallis money equaled the she paid to phl for shares in the corporation.wallis responds that the million damages award is supported because phl false representations about the money were the means by which phl obtained access to the antigen.we conclude that the proper measure of damages for fraud is damages as the jury was properly instructed,and that measure supports no more than in damages for phl fraud related to wallis money.
before reviewing the law concerning special verdicts,we note that our discussion relates to phl fraud and the damages awarded against phl.at the end of the discussion,we comment on how the discussion as to the damages also relates to the damages awarded against the individual defendants.
a special verdict is inconsistent if there is no possibility of reconciling its findings with each other.citation.if a verdict appears inconsistent,a party adversely affected should request clarification,and the court should send the jury out again to resolve the inconsistency.citations.if no party requests clarification or an inconsistency remains after the jury returns,the trial court must interpret the verdict in light of the jury instructions and the evidence and attempt to resolve any inconsistency.citations.
on appeal,we review a special verdict de novo to determine whether its findings are inconsistent.citation.with a special verdict,unlike a general verdict or a general verdict with special findings,a reviewing court will not infer findings to support the verdict.citations.where the findings are contradictory on material issues,and the correct determination of such issues is necessary to sustain the judgment,the inconsistency is reversible error.citations.citation.the appellate court is not permitted to choose between inconsistent answers.citations.citation.the proper remedy for an inconsistent special verdict is a new trial.citation.singh southland stone,th,fn.omitted.
although the jury found phl liable under both fraud and conversion theories,wallis elected the remedies for fraud.therefore,we need not discuss the jury findings as to conversion.we also note that,because wallis did not allege breach of contract,the jury was not asked questions relating to breach of contract and was not given the option of awarding contract damages.
the pertinent parts of the special verdicts we must try to harmonize with respect to fraud are as follows the findings were the same as to the individual defendants,except as noted 
wallis invented the j tc antigen as part of her duties as an employee of phl.
phl and wallis agreed wallis owned the j tc antigen.
phl did not make a false promise to wallis or a false representation of material fact related to the j tc antigen.
phl did not make a false promise to wallis as to a material matter related to wallis money.however,the jury concluded that wichmann,hanzo,and holmes made a false promise to wallis as to a matter related to her money.
phl knowingly made a false representation of material fact related to wallis money,with the purpose of inducing wallis to rely on the misrepresentation,and wallis,unaware that the representation was false,actually and justifiably relied on it.
wallis damages from phl fraud totaled wichmann hanzo holmes.
therefore,the jury unequivocally found that phl committed the elements of a fraud cause of action relating to wallis money but not related to the antigen and that damages resulting from phl fraud totaled more than million.the question is whether the fraud findings support the amount of damages when viewed in light of the pleadings,jury instructions,and evidence.we conclude that they do not.
wallis alleged in her complaint that phl defrauded her into giving up all rights,benefits and profits due her as the owner of the j tc vaccine as well as the money paid to defendants to purchase said shares.she continued plaintiff was justified in relying upon those representations,especially in that she had paid for shares to phl referring to the total amount paid to all defendants,having been allowed to purchase those shares as partial compensation in return for phl use of her j tc vaccine.
the trial court instructed the jury concerning the loss standard of fraud damages as follows 
the amount of such award shall include the difference,if any,between the actual value of that with which the plaintiff parted and the actual value of that with which sic was received.this is sometimes referred to as the loss.actual value means market value.market value means the highest price for which real or personal property would sell on the open market 
wallis paid to phl but failed to receive an ownership interest in the corporation as promised,meaning she received no value therefore,under this standard she is entitled to in fraud damages.however,wallis argument in support of the damages is that phl fraud concerning wallis money gave phl access to the antigen.she states defendants made false promises and representations to wallis concerning her to the company and her shareholder status,and as a direct result of that fraud obtained access to wallis s antigen.the damages awarded properly reflect the value of the antigen wallis gave up as a result of defendants fraud.this argument fails entirely to address the standard for fraud damages loss.wallis novel theory posits that she can recover values associated with ownership of the antigen based on phl fraud related to her money.she cites no authority for this theory.indeed,she fails even to attempt to relate it to the standard for fraud damages the only theory presented to the jury,except to say that it reflected the market value of the antigen.phl,however,did not defraud her out of the antigen,according to the jury.
still attempting to support her argument that the jury could award damages based on phl use of the antigen despite the finding that phl committed fraud only as to her money,wallis states t he jury instructions set forth at length in phl opening brief tracked the allegations of the complaint and the evidence.they informed the jury that under wallis s theory of the case,she allowed phl access to her antigen based upon defendants false promises and representations concerning her opportunity to buy in to the company and become a shareholder.original italics.
this was not an instruction to the jury instead,it was merely a reading by the trial court of wallis theory of the case.in connection with this reading,which the trial court provided as a courtesy to wallis,the court said i want to read you plaintiff summary of her theory of the case.i have given plaintiff sic this opportunity because she has the burden of proof in most instances.this is a summary which was prepared by plaintiff counsel so it is to be regarded in the same weight sic as any other statement of counsel.it is not to be considered as evidence.italics added.
neither was it a recitation of the applicable law.it was nothing more than a summary of wallis theory,without any comment,explicit or implied,about the legal validity of the theory.therefore,wallis recitation of and reliance on the comment on appeal is misleading.
wallis concludes defendants fraud did not just involve the illusory purchase of shares.defendants false representations concerning wallis s money were the means by which they induced her to give them access to the antigen,and ultimately sell it to upjohn.wallis did not just give up her money as a direct result of defendants fraud she gave up the antigen as well.
this argument is not tenable.having asked the jury and having received the answer that there was no fraud related to the antigen,wallis can not now argue successfully that there was fraud related to the antigen.the jury concluded phl did not make a false promise to wallis or a false representation of material fact related to the antigen.if phl did not make a false promise or a misrepresentation related to the antigen,phl did not take the antigen by fraud,and phl is not liable to wallis for fraud damages related to the antigen.there simply is no other way to interpret the special findings relating to fraud.
that leaves,then,the question of what to do about the inconsistency between the fraud findings and the fraud damages awarded by the jury.wallis provides no analysis concerning how the damages award can be justified considering the fraud only as to wallis money.instead,she argues that the jury properly awarded the damages based on the fair market value of the antigen.phl,on the other hand,contends that wallis was entitled only to,the amount she paid to phl for the shareholder.phl has the better argument.when a special verdict concerning liability does not support the damages awarded,the damages award must be modified to conform to the liability finding if the amount of damages properly awarded is definite.see myers building industries,interface technology,th,punitive damages struck when no finding of tort in special verdict see also orthopedic systems,schlein th,court may modify judgment on special verdict when record sufficiently definite.that is the case here.the damage resulting from phl fraud relating to wallis money is,the amount of wallis loss,and not.accordingly,we must modify the judgment to reflect the proper amount.
having concluded that the fraud damages award against phl could only have been,the amount wallis paid to phl for shares in the corporation,we also conclude,by the same reasoning,that the fraud damages awarded against the individual defendants could only have been the amount wallis paid to each of them for shares in the corporation that is,to wichmann,to hanzo,and to holmes.therefore,the fraud damages awarded to wallis against the individual defendants wichmann hanzo holmes must be reduced to the amount paid by wallis,except,of course,as to hanzo,whose successors settled with wallis and are not parties to this appeal.
punitive damages 
based on its finding that phl committed fraud relating to wallis money,the jury awarded in punitive damages.no punitive damages were awarded against the individual defendants.on appeal,phl contends that,in light of the required reduction of the compensatory fraud damages to,the punitive damages award now more than times the compensatory damages award is constitutionally excessive because it is grossly disproportionate to the compensatory damages award.wallis responds that the reprehensibility of phl conduct justifies the full punitive damages award even if we reduce the compensatory damages award.we conclude that the punitive damages award must be reduced to,or times the compensatory damages award,because phl offers to accept that amount as constitutionally permissible and any higher amount would surely violate phl due process rights.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution places constraints on state court awards of punitive damages.citations.in state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d,state farm,the high court articulated three guideposts for courts reviewing punitive damages the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.citations.roby mckesson cal th.in deciding whether an award of punitive damages is constitutionally excessive under state farm and its predecessors,we are to review the award de novo,making an independent assessment of the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,the relationship between the award and the harm done to the plaintiff,and the relationship between the award and civil penalties authorized for comparable conduct.citations.simon san paolo holding,cal th.
as will be seen,the essential guideposts in determining the upper limit of punitive damages in this case are moderate reprehensibility as compared to other punitive damages cases and the ratio between the compensatory damages which,with the modification of compensatory damages,stands at more than to.neither party discusses the third guidepost difference between punitive damages and authorized civil penalties,and neither will we,although we note in passing that there appear to be no authorized civil penalties.
reprehensibility 
the first guidepost we consider is reprehensibility.this is the only guidepost that wallis relies on to justify the award.we conclude that,although phl conduct was reprehensible,it was not extremely so.
the united states supreme court has identified five factors to consider in determining the degree of reprehensibility the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.state farm,supra,at.
the existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.it should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages,so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant culpability,after having paid compensatory damages,is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.citation.state farm,supra,at.
we therefore consider the reprehensibility factors as they apply to this case.
first factor here the harm was purely economic,not physical.
second factor the tortious conduct did not evince an indifference to the health or safety of others.
third factor wallis was financially vulnerable.
fourth factor the money was obtained by phl in one transaction however,it could be said that the deceit was at least continuing,if not repeated.
fifth factor the deceit was intentional.
therefore,of the five factors,at least two,and probably three,weigh in favor of a finding of reprehensibility vulnerability,intentionality,and probably continuing conduct.absence of physical harm or indifference to health and safety weigh against a finding of reprehensibility.therefore,this is a case of moderate reprehensibility.
wallis argues that the reprehensibility is rather more extreme.keeping in mind that reprehensible conduct is,by definition,reprehensible in all instances and that extreme reprehensibility is found only in exceptional cases,we conclude that this case does not rise to the level of extremely reprehensible cases.comparison to a recent case of extreme reprehensibility illustrates the moderation in this case.in bullock philip morris usa,th bullock,a cigarette manufacturer intentionally deceived smokers for several decades concerning the adverse health effects of smoking.id.at.a jury awarded a smoker who contracted lung cancer in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.ibid.the court of appeal,second appellate district,division three,upheld the punitive damages award,finding that all five reprehensibility factors were present.id.at.the court concluded in light of such extreme reprehensibility,including the vast scale and profitability of philip morris misconduct,and its strong financial condition,the million in punitive damages,approximately times the compensatory damages award,is not unconstitutionally excessive.id.at.
the conduct in bullock,involving physical harm and acute indifference to health and safety,was extremely reprehensible,while the conduct in this case was only moderately so.
relation to compensatory damages 
the second guidepost we consider is the disparity between compensatory and punitive damages.considering the moderate reprehensibility,we conclude that the more than to ratio between compensatory damages and punitive damages is constitutionally excessive.
the united states supreme court stated in state farm w e have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm,or potential harm,to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.citations.we decline again to impose a ratio which a punitive damages award can not exceed.our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate,however,that,in practice,few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process.in a prior case,in upholding a punitive damages award,we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.citation.we cited that to ratio again in another case.citation.the court further referenced a long legislative history,dating back over years and going forward to today,providing for sanctions of double,treble,or quadruple damages to deter and punish.citation.while these ratios are not binding,they are instructive.they demonstrate what should be obvious multipliers are more likely to comport with due process,while still achieving the state goals of deterrence and retribution,than awards with ratios in range of to citation or,in this case,of to.state farm,supra,at.
wallis contends that phl fraud was intentional and it cheated her out of substantial profit in its fraud relating to her money.but even considering these factors,a case of no more than moderate reprehensibility can not justify a punitive damages award more than times greater than the compensatory damages award.this case is not like bullock,in which extreme reprehensibility justified a high ratio of to.furthermore,phl is not a large corporation like the cigarette manufacturer in bullock.
while the punitive damages award here was only about of the jury original compensatory damages award of more than million,that ratio between punitive and compensatory damages no longer exists because the compensatory damages award must be reduced to.accordingly,because we conclude that the compensatory damages award against phl should have been set at,the punitive damages award,as it stands,is constitutionally excessive and must be reversed.
that leaves the question of what appellate remedy to invoke.in this regard,phl states that the constitutionally permitted maximum in this case is ten times the compensatory award against phl.and phl states it is willing to waive its right to a new trial on the punitive damages issue if the judgment is reduced below the legally permissible amount.we agree that a punitive damages award of more than would violate due process under the circumstances of this case.see state farm,supra,at normally,awards exceeding a ratio violate due process.we also agree that prolonging any aspect of this case that need not be prolonged is against the public interest and the interest of the parties.therefore,rather than reverse and remand for a new jury trial on punitive damages,we modify the punitive damages award against phl to.
equitable relief 
after the jury trial ended,the court held proceedings on the equitable relief requested by wallis.the court imposed a constructive trust of against phl for royalties phl received for the antigen from upjohn and for the noncompetition agreement.after the court issued its ruling on the equitable issues,phl requested a statement of decision,but the trial court denied the request as untimely.on appeal,phl contends that the trial court prejudicially erred by denying the request for a statement of decision.we conclude the request was proper and should have been granted.we also conclude that,because judge mock has been disqualified,the only remedy for this error is remand for a new trial 
code of civil procedure section states in relevant part in superior courts,upon the trial of a question of fact by the court,written findings of fact and conclusions of law shall not be required.the court shall issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal controverted issues at trial upon the request of any party appearing at the trial.the request must be made within days after the court announces a tentative decision 
the purpose of a statement of decision is to provide an explanation of the factual and legal basis for the trial court decision.onofrio rice th.it gives the parties and the appellate court a clear understanding of the facts and law relied on by the court to reach its decision.slavin borinstein th.if a party does not request a timely statement of decision,all intendments favor the ruling of the trial court and an appellate court must assume the trial court made whatever findings are necessary to sustain the judgment,as long as those findings are supported by substantial evidence.michael jamie cal d,superseded by statute on another issue as stated in in re zacharia cal th.
a trial court failure to issue a statement of decision can have a significant adverse effect on that party ability both to assess whether an appeal is justified and,if an appeal is filed,to present an effective challenge to the trial court decision.gruendl oewel partnership,th.for this reason,a trial court failure to file a statement of decision following a timely request constitutes per se reversible error.espinoza calva th,miramar hotel frank hall d.
here,the trial court spread its rulings on equitable issues over three separate occasions.as detailed in the statement of procedure above,the court ruled on most equitable issues on september.however,it stated that it did not intend its decision to be final at the time because it had not made a decision concerning interest.it also took under submission whether to require an accounting or appoint a receiver.on november,the court announced a decision concerning interest but reserved the issue of whether to appoint a receiver.finally,on december,the court announced that it would not appoint a receiver.
there can be no dispute that phl requested a statement of decision within days after the trial court issued the last part of its piecemeal tentative ruling.the trial court announced its tentative decision concerning the receivership issue on december,and phl filed its request for statement of decision on january.the question is whether this request preserved phl right to obtain a statement of decision on all equitable relief issues.we conclude that phl request was timely and adequate to require a statement of decision on all equitable relief issues.
neither the statute code civ,nor the rule applying the statute cal.rules of court,rule addresses whether the court announcement of a tentative decision on some issues but reservation of other issues for later decision initiates the period during which a party must request a statement of decision.phl argues that a tentative decision is not announced for the purpose of the statute until the court has ruled on all reserved issues.on the other hand,wallis argues that the time period begins to run from the trial court announcement of its decision on each question of fact.we conclude that the only reasonable and workable interpretation of the statute is that the time to request a statement of decision runs from the time the trial court completes the announcement of its decision on all reserved issues.
as noted,code of civil procedure section requires that upon the trial of a question of fact by the court the trial court must issue a statement of decision if a party makes a proper request within days after the court announces a tentative decision.rule b of the california rules of court states that a tentative decision is not binding on the trial court and may be modified,and rule d allows that w ithin days after announcement or service of the tentative decision,whichever is later,any party that appeared at trial may request a statement of decision to address the principal controverted issues.
while the statute and rule do not expressly provide for the situation in which the trial court announces part of its decision but reserves some issues,common sense dictates that,for the purpose of the statute and rule,the days does not begin to run until the trial court completes the announcement of its tentative decision on all issues.nothing in the statute or rule provides for multiple requests for statements of decision as to individual issues.therefore,the best reading of the statute and rule is that the days begin to run when the trial court has announced its tentative decision on all controverted issues.
