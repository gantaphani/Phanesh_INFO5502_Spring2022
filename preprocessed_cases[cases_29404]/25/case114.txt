the antitrust laws are concerned with the protection of competition,not competitors.eisai complains that the conduct of sanofi aventis,llc,and sanofi services,sanofi jointly and severally harmed competition in the market for anticoagulant drugs by preventing hospitals from replacing lovenox,one of sanofi drugs,with competing drugs.the facts,however,do not bear out eisai characterization of market events.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that what eisai calls payoffs were,in reality,discounts offered by sanofi to its customers what eisai calls agreements with hospitals to block access were,in reality,provisions proscribing customers from favoring competing drugs over lovenox what eisai calls a campaign of fear,uncertainty,and doubt was,in reality,sanofi marketing of lovenox.analyzing eisai claims under the rule of reason,we find no evidence that sanofi actions caused broad harm to the competitive nature of the anticoagulant market.to the extent that sanofi conduct caused damage to its competitors,that is not a harm for which congress has prescribed a remedy.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court,granting summary judgment in favor of sanofi.
lovenox is an anticoagulant drug used in the treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis dvt,a condition in which blood clots develop in a person veins.lovenox belongs to a category of injectable,anticoagulant drugs known as low molecular weight heparin lmwh.lovenox was the first lmwh approved by the food and drug administration and has been sold by sanofi in the united states since.lovenox has at least seven uses known as indications,including the treatment of certain severe forms of heart attack.
fragmin is a competing injectable lmwh,which pfizer,initially sold only abroad.in september,pfizer sold eisai an exclusive license to market,sell,and distribute fragmin in the united states.fragmin has five indications,some of which overlap lovenox indications.fragmin is also indicated to reduce the reoccurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in cancer patients,while lovenox is not.lovenox,however,is indicated for treating certain more severe forms of heart attack,an indication that fragmin does not have.
the relevant product market also consists of two other injectable anticoagulant drugs,innohep and arixtra.innohep,a lmwh,was manufactured and sold by leo pharma in the united states from to.arixtra is an injectable anticoagulant approved by the fda in and sold in the united states by glaxosmithkline from to.while not a lmwh,arixtra is clinically comparable to lmwhs in its treatment of dvt.
relevant to eisai claims is the market for lovenox,fragmin,innohep,and arixtra in the united states from september,when eisai was able to begin selling fragmin until july,when sanofi ended certain marketing practices after a generic entered the market.during that time,lovenox had the most indications of the four drugs,the largest sales force,and maintained a market share of to.fragmin had the second largest market share at to.
eisai antitrust claims relate to sanofi marketing of lovenox to hospitals.most hospitals are members of group purchasing organizations gpos,which negotiate drug contracts and discounts from pharmaceutical companies on behalf of their members.from september until july,sanofi offered gpos the lovenox acute contract value program program,featuring a contractual offer to sell lovenox on certain terms and conditions.eisai allegations of anticompetitive conduct relate to three elements of this program and volume discounts,a restrictive formulary access clause,and aggressive sales tactics used to market the program.
under the terms of the program,hospitals received price discounts based on the volume of lovenox they purchased and their calculation tied to their purchases of the four anticoagulant drugs the program generally treated a gpo members as individual customers when determining the volume and market share.when a hospital purchases of lovenox were below of its total purchases of lmwhs,it received a flat discount regardless of the volume of lovenox purchased.but when a hospital increased its market share above that threshold,it would receive an increasingly higher discount based on a combination of the volume purchased and the market share.for example,in,the discount ranged from to of the wholesale price.additionally,if certain criteria were met,a system could have the hospitals volumes and market shares calculated as one entity.for a system,the discount started at for a market share meeting the threshold,and increased to.
although this discount structure motivated gpos to purchase more lovenox,they were not contractually obligated to do so.the consequence of not obtaining market share was that a customer would receive only the discount.if a customer chose to terminate the contract,it was required to give thirty days notice and could still purchase lovenox off contract at the wholesale price.
the program also included a formulary access clause that limited a hospital ability to give certain drugs priority status on its formulary.generally,a hospital maintains a formulary,a list of medications approved for use in the hospital based on factors such as a drug cost,safety,and efficacy.the formulary access clause in the lovenox contract required customers to provide lovenox with unrestricted formulary access for all lovenox indications so that the availability of lovenox was not more restricted or limited than the availability of fragmin,innohep,or arixtra.hospitals were also forbidden by the contract to adopt any restrictions or limitations on marketing or promotional programs for lovenox.in essence,the contract did not prohibit members from putting other anticoagulant drugs on their formularies,but did prohibit them from favoring those drugs over lovenox.noncompliance with the contract did not limit a customer access to lovenox it merely caused a customer discount to drop to the base level.
according to eisai,sanofi further engaged in a campaign to discredit fragmin by spreading fear,uncertainty and doubt about its safety and efficacy.eisai asserts that the fud campaign consisted of the following conduct sanofi paid doctors to publish articles attacking fragmin on false grounds,without properly disclosing such payments,and distributed those articles broadly sanofi paid doctors to present educational programs regarding the medical and legal risks of switching from lovenox,casting doubt on fragmin effectiveness and promoting a belief that fragmin use would expose hospitals to malpractice liability sanofi representatives claimed that lovenox was superior to other drugs,in violation of fda regulations and sanofi promoted lovenox for uses,also in violation of fda regulations.
eisai commenced this action on august,in the district court for the district of new jersey,asserting willful and unlawful monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of section of the sherman act de facto exclusive dealing in violation of section of the clayton act an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of section of the sherman act and violations of the new jersey antitrust act sanofi moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and for being untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.after a hearing,the district court denied the motion and referred the case to a magistrate judge for further proceedings.
the parties then engaged in extensive discovery.on one particularly contentious discovery issue,eisai moved to compel discovery of deposition transcripts from a antitrust lawsuit brought by organon sanofi synthelabo oss against aventis pharmaceuticals sanofi predecessor relating to a contractual offer similar to the terms of the lovenox program.on february,the magistrate judge denied eisai motion on the basis that the transcripts were irrelevant to the current action and unlikely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,and because the burden or expense of the discovery outweighed its likely benefit.the district court affirmed the order.
both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment.eisai relied largely on an expert report by professor einer elhauge,who determined that customers occupying a certain spectrum of market share would not save money by partially switching to a rival drug,even if the rival drug was cheaper than lovenox.according to professor elhauge,the lovenox program restricted rival sales by bundling each customer contestable demand for lovenox the units that the customer is willing to switch to rival products with the customer incontestable demand for lovenox the units that the customer is less willing to switch to rival products.the incontestable demand for lovenox was based,at least partially,on its unique cardiology indication,which no other anticoagulant in the market possessed and which hospitals needed to treat certain of their patients.based on lovenox and fragmin april prices,professor elhauge determined that bundling resulted in an enormous dead zone spanning fragmin market share for any system choosing to increase its fragmin market share from to any amount less than,it would actually cost hospitals more to switch from lovenox to fragmin despite fragmin lower price.professor elhauge also determined that the program foreclosed between and of the relevant market.
on march,the district court granted sanofi motion for summary judgment.the district court held first that price was the predominant mechanism of exclusion under sanofi practices,and therefore eisai antitrust claims could not succeed because sanofi prices were above cost.next,the court held that,even when analyzed under an exclusive dealing framework,eisai claims still failed because the evidence could not support eisai contention that sanofi engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing.eisai also could not satisfy the requirement because it could not establish that its lower market share was attributable to anticompetitive conduct by sanofi as opposed to other factors.
the district court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to and.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
we employ a de novo standard of review to grants of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.we view the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.a court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we review discovery decisions for abuse of discretion 
the applicable law is the same for each of eisai four claims to establish an actionable antitrust violation,eisai must show both that sanofi engaged in anticompetitive conduct and that eisai suffered antitrust injury as a result courts employ either a per se or a rule of reason analysis to determine whether conduct is anticompetitive the per se illegality rule applies when a business practice on its face,has no purpose except stifling competition.when conduct does not trigger a per se analysis,we apply a rule of reason test,which focuses on the particular facts disclosed by the record.
one form of potentially anticompetitive conduct is an exclusive dealing arrangement,which is an express or de facto agreement in which a buyer agrees to purchase certain goods or services only from a particular seller for a certain period of time.while exclusive dealing arrangements may deprive competitors of a market for their goods,they can also offer consumers various economic benefits,such as assuring them the availability of supply and price stability as such,an exclusive dealing arrangement does not constitute a per se violation of the antitrust laws and is instead judged under the rule of reason 
eisai argues that sanofi conduct,as a whole,operated as a de facto exclusive dealing arrangement that unlawfully hindered competition.an exclusive dealing agreement is illegal under the rule of reason only if the probable effect of the arrangement is to substantially lessen competition,rather than merely disadvantage rivals.while there is no set formula for making this determination,we must consider whether a plaintiff has shown substantial foreclosure of the market for the relevant product we also analyze the likely or actual anticompetitive effects of the exclusive dealing arrangement,including whether there was reduced output,increased price,or reduced quality in goods or services 
to demonstrate substantial foreclosure,a plaintiff must both define the relevant market and prove the degree of foreclosure.although t he test is not total foreclosure,the challenged practices must bar a substantial number of rivals or severely restrict the market ambit.there is no fixed percentage at which foreclosure becomes substantial and courts have varied widely in the degree of foreclosure they consider unlawful.in analyzing the amount of foreclosure,our concern is not about which products a consumer chooses to purchase,but about which products are reasonably available to that consumer for example,if customers are free to switch to a different product in the marketplace but choose not to do so,competition has not been thwarted even if a competitor remains unable to increase its market share one competitor inability to compete does not automatically mean competition has been foreclosed.
in certain circumstances,however,we have recognized that a monopolist may use its power to break the competitive mechanism and deprive customers of the ability to make a meaningful choice.that was the case in lepage,where we held that the use of bundled rebates,when offered by a monopolist,foreclosed portions of the market to competitors that did not offer an equally diverse line of products similarly,in united states dentsply international,we held that a dominant manufacturer of prefabricated teeth hindered competition when it prohibited dealers from adding competing tooth lines to their product offerings and retained the ability to terminate the dealer relationships at will finally,in zf meritor,we found the defendant conduct to be anticompetitive when the defendant leveraged its position as a dominant supplier of necessary products to force manufacturers into long term agreements and there was proof that the manufacturers were concerned that they would be unable to meet consumer demand without doing so although consumers had a choice between products in lepage,dentsply,and zf meritor,in each case the defendant anticompetitive conduct rendered that choice meaningless.
eisai argues that sanofi practices substantially foreclosed the market for anticoagulant drugs because hospitals had no choice but to purchase lovenox despite its increasing price.in support,eisai points to what it characterizes as extensive evidence of hospitals that wanted to purchase fragmin but allegedly were prevented from doing so due to sanofi conduct.but identification of a few dozen hospitals out of almost in the united states is not enough to demonstrate substantial foreclosure particularly,if the reason a hospital did not change to fragmin was due to price,the loss of the discounts offered by the program.
eisai also relies on the findings of professor elhauge,who described two purported examples of foreclosure.first,professor elhauge claims that the discount offered by sanofi foreclosed rivals from to of the lmwh market.professor elhauge calculated this percentage by treat ing as restricted any customer that was receiving loyal lovenox prices and thus would have been penalized with higher lovenox prices if they purchased a higher percentage of their ltc drugs from rivals.in other words,professor elhauge assumed that all lovenox customers utilizing the discount program were foreclosed from switching to another lmwh drug.second,professor elhauge asserts that the lovenox discount created a dead zone that prevented customers from increasing their fragmin purchases to anywhere between and of their lmwh needs.again,professor elhauge focuses on consumer preference as the basis for foreclosure.specifically,he calculates this dead zone based on the fact that many customers are willing to switch only a portion of their lovenox purchases to rival ltc drugs.
professor elhauge examples of foreclosure ultimately derive from a theory of bundling of lovenox demand.but a bundling arrangement generally involves discounted rebates or prices for the purchase of multiple products for example,in lepage,the plaintiffs alleged that,a dominant seller of transparent tape in the united states,used its monopoly to gain a competitive advantage in the private label tape portion of the transparent market by offering a bundled rebate structure,which offered higher rebates when customers purchased products in a number of different product lines.analogizing this practice to tying,which is per se illegal,we found such bundling anticompetitive because it could foreclose portions of the market to a potential competitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse group of products and who therefore can not make a comparable offer.in zf meritor,we limited the reasoning in lepage to cases in which a producer is excluded through a bundled rebate program offered by a producer of multiple products,which conditions the rebates on purchases across multiple different product lines.significantly,eisai does not claim that sanofi conditioned discounts on purchases across various product lines,but on different types of demand for the same product.such conduct does not present the same antitrust concerns as in lepage,and we are aware of no court that has credited this novel theory.
we are not inclined to extend the rationale of lepage based on the facts presented here.even if bundling of different types of demand for the same product could,in the abstract,foreclose competition,nothing in the record indicates that an equally efficient competitor was unable to compete with sanofi.professor elhauge defines incontestable demand as the units that the customer is less willing to switch to rival products because of unique indications,departmental preferences,and doctor habit.of course,obtaining an fda indication requires investing a significant amount of time and resources in clinical trials.but eisai does not offer evidence demonstrating that fixed costs were so high that competitors entering the market were unable to obtain a cardiology indication.in fact,eisai has its own unique cancer indication,which it presumably obtained because of its calculated decision to focus on that area,above others.nor does eisai explain what percentage of incontestable demand for lovenox was based on its unique cardiology indication as opposed to the other factors.while professor elhauge certainly explains why,in theory,a customer might hesitate to switch from lovenox to one of its lower priced competitors,eisai fails to tie professor elhauge model to concrete examples of anticompetitive consequences in the record.accordingly,we can not credit eisai bundling claims,at least on the facts before us 
eisai reliance on our holdings in zf meritor and dentsply is also misplaced.as a preliminary matter,although eisai cites extensively to these cases for the proposition that lovenox customers lacked any meaningful ability to switch products,its supposed evidence of foreclosure is grounded in professor elhauge unsupported bundling theory.moreover,sanofi conduct is distinguishable from the anticompetitive practices at issue in zf meritor and dentsply.in zf meritor,the plaintiff introduced evidence that compliance with the market penetration targets was mandatory because failing to meet such targets would jeopardize the customers relationships with the dominant manufacturer of transmissions in the market.if customers did not comply with the targets for one year,they had to repay all contractual savings we observed that the situation was similar to dentsply,where we applied an exclusive dealing analysis because the defendant threatened to refuse to continue dealing with customers if customers purchased rival products.the threat to cut off supply ultimately provided customers with no choice but to continue purchasing from the defendants.
here,lovenox customers did not risk penalties or supply shortages for terminating the lovenox program or violating its terms.the consequence of not obtaining the market share threshold or meeting the formulary requirements was not contract termination rather,it was receiving the base discount.if a customer chose to terminate the contract entirely,it could still obtain lovenox at the wholesale price.in fact,nothing in the record demonstrates that a hospital supply of lovenox would be jeopardized in any way or that discounts already paid would have to be refunded.attempting to draw a comparison with zf meritor,eisai argues that the threat of not obtaining a higher discount ranging up to off handcuffed hospitals to the lovenox program.yet,eisai points to no evidence of this.moreover,the threat of a lost discount is a far cry from the anticompetitive conduct at issue in zf meritor or dentsply.on the record before us,eisai has failed to point to evidence suggesting the kind of harm to competition that was present in these earlier cases.accordingly,eisai fails to demonstrate that hospitals were foreclosed from purchasing competing drugs as a result of sanofi conduct.
eisai also can not demonstrate that sanofi conduct,as a whole,caused or was likely to cause anticompetitive effects in the relevant market.eisai claims that the district court ignored proof of reduction of output,denial of consumer choice,and increasing price.as to output,eisai relies on two pages of professor elhauge description of the annual growth rate in the anticoagulant market as more than doubling after generic entry.because there was a large reduction in promotional spending that year,professor elhauge concluded that sanofi must have previously been reducing output.such an assumption can not serve as a substitute for actual evidence at the summary judgment stage.moreover,eisai fails to identify any record evidence in support of its argument that sanofi conduct restricted consumer choice,instead presumably relying on its theory of foreclosure.
eisai sole example of actual or likely anticompetitive effect is that lovenox price increased from until a generic entered the market in.according to eisai,the rising price is particularly significant considering sanofi monopoly in the market and therefore provides ample basis for us to find a likelihood of anticompetitive effect.specifically,sanofi had as high as a share of the market and lovenox price was the highest in the market.for example,in,the average price per converted unit of lovenox was compared to for fragmin.while these figures certainly suggest that lovenox prices were high,we have no reason to believe that sanofi allegedly anticompetitive conduct was the cause.in fact,sanofi list prices increased at a rate similar to eisai prices and the pharmaceutical producer price index.as a result,we find little evidence to suggest that sanofi practices caused or were likely to cause anticompetitive effects.
without evidence of substantial foreclosure or anticompetitive effects,eisai has failed to demonstrate that the probable effect of sanofi conduct was to substantially lessen competition in the relevant market,rather than to merely disadvantage rivals unlike in lepage,dentsply,and zf meritor,lovenox customers had the ability to switch to competing products.they simply chose not to do so.we will therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of sanofi under a rule of reason analysis.
turning to safofi argument that its discounts amounted to no more than competition and eisai suit must be dismissed under the test,we disagree.we are not persuaded that eisai claims fundamentally relate to pricing practices.
unlawful predatory pricing occurs when a firm reduces its prices to levels to drive competitors out of the market and,once competition is eliminated,reduces output and raises its prices to supracompetitive levels reducing prices to only levels,however,generally does not have an anticompetitive effect because the exclusionary effect of prices above a relevant measure of cost reflects the lower cost structure of the alleged predator,and so represents competition on the merits.while there may be situations where prices are anticompetitive,it is beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribuna
