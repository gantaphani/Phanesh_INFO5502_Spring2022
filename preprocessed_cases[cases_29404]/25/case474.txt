this appeal arises from an inter partes reexamination of patent the patent.the patent is owned by leo pharmaceutical products,leo pharmaceuticals and challenged by third party requester galderma r d.while the substantial evidence standard of review for fact findings made by the board of patent appeals and interferences board makes leo pharmaceutical burden on appeal a challenging one,after careful review,this court finds that leo pharmaceuticals has met that burden.because the board incorrectly construed the claim term storage stable,this court reverses the board claim construction.see ex parte leo pharm.furthermore,because the board incorrectly found the claimed invention would have been obvious in view of the prior art and incorrectly weighed the objective indicia of nonobviousness,this court reverses the board obviousness determination.
this case concerns pharmaceutical compositions for the topical treatment of certain skin conditions,psoriasis.see patent,ll.psoriasis can be a painful and socially debilitating disease.the prior art discloses that psoriasis is commonly treated through a combination treatment of a vitamin d analog and a corticosteroid.patent,ll.
the patent teaches that simultaneous treatment with vitamin d and corticosteroids can heal psoriasis faster and more effectively.patent,ll.however,according to the patent,a storage stable combination of vitamin d and corticosteroids in a single formulation did not exist in the prior art.patent,ll.the patent teaches that previous combination formulations were not storage stable because vitamin d and corticosteroids have divergent ph requirements for optimum stability.patent,ll.specifically,vitamin d analogs require basic environments with a higher ph value above for optimal stability,but corticosteroids are most stable in acidic environments with a lower ph value in the range of.patent,ll.because of the storage stability problem,physicians had to prescribe a regimen that required patients to apply one drug in the morning and another at night.patent,ll.this regimen generated patient compliance issues.
after recognizing the storage stability problem,leo pharmaceuticals began testing formulations that combined vitamin d analogs and corticosteroids.in testing formulations from the prior art,leo pharmaceuticals found that several ingredients including almond oil,propylene glycol,and water did not solve the problem.see aqueous solvents,propylene glycol and almond oil.leo pharmaceuticals then discovered that a new set of solvents,including polyoxypropylene stearyl ether pop se,solved the storage stability problem by allowing the vitamin d analog and the corticosteroid to coexist in a single pharmaceutical product.
the patent claims a pharmaceutical composition comprising three components a category a component vitamin d analog a category b component corticosteroid and a category c solvent.patent,ll.as amended during reexamination,independent claim is representative

emphases added.
among other changes,leo pharmaceuticals amended claim during reexamination to include the phrase wherein said pharmaceutical composition is storage stable and.leo pharmaceuticals also added new claims,and amended and canceled other claims.leo pharmaceuticals contends that the commercial embodiment of the patent,as amended,is the taclonex ointment.
the board construed the term storage stable and.then the board relying on the examiner findings rejected the claims of the patent as obvious over three prior art references patent turi patent dikstein and wo serup.
turi was filed in and is titled topical steroidal anti inflammatory preparations containing polyoxyproplyene stearyl ether.turi discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a steroid contained within a solvent,pop se,but it does not teach the use of vitamin turi,ll.turi specifically discloses that the claimed invention does not contain water,gels,or alcohols.turi,ll.instead,turi discloses the use of pop se as well known to those skilled in the art of formulating and compounding topical ointment like compositions and preparations.turi,ll.turi teaches that pop se is antifungal,antibacterial,nonirritating,and lubricating.turi,ll.turi further teaches that while these properties are not sufficient to provide therapeutic value,they are useful because they render additional preservatives unnecessary.turi,ll.turi claimed invention thereby reduces exposure of tissue to chemical compounds and reduces manufacturing costs.turi,ll.turi addresses neither stability concerns from combining vitamin d analogs and corticosteroids,nor the use of pop se or corticosteroids for the treatment of psoriasis.
the second prior art reference,dikstein,was filed in and is titled compositions containing for topical treatment of skin disorders and methods employing same.dikstein discloses dermatological compositions,including creams,ointments,and lotions,comprising a vitamin d analog and a corticosteroid.dikstein,ll.dikstein teaches that vitamin d can treat psoriasis and that corticosteroids have side effects,but it does not teach using vitamin d to treat the side effects of corticosteroids.dikstein,ll,ll.every example composition in dikstein contains almond oil or propylene glycol and several also contain water.dikstein.yet,dikstein does not disclose or recognize the storage stability problems associated with using water,almond oil,or propylene glycol in the combination formulations.nor does dikstein disclose the use of pop se or any other solvent that could solve the storage stability concerns.
the third prior art reference,serup,was filed in and is titled hydroxy vitamin compounds for treating skin atrophy.serup describes a composition containing a vitamin d analog and a steroid.serup,ll.serup further teaches the use of vitamin d analogs to treat skin atrophy,a side effect of steroid treatment.serup,ll,ll.atrophy is associated with reduced skin thickness vitamin d can prevent atrophy and normalize skin thickness.serup,ll.although serup describes the benefits of using vitamin d to treat atrophy,serup does not address any storage stability concerns associated with this combination.while serup teaches that preparations may include creams,ointments,pastes,or gels,every example composition disclosed in serup is aqueous,containing either purified or hot water.serup.every example also contains almond oil,propylene glycol,or alcohol.serup.thus,serup does not recognize the stability problems associated with using water,almond oil,or propylene glycol in the combination formulations.nor does serup disclose the use of pop se or any other solvent that could solve the storage stability concerns.
based on these three prior art references,the board rejected claims,and of the patent as obvious under a.the board relied on turi as the primary reference because turi disclosed a category b corticosteroid and a category c solvent.the board then used serup or dikstein with turi to reject various dependent claims concerning different vitamin d analogs.
regarding the combination of turi with serup,the board found that the reason for combining them was for the turi solvent advantages and to obtain a more effective preparation without the potential of causing skin atrophy.quoting the examiner reasoning.according to the board,because both serup and turi describe compositions with corticosteroids,an artisan would have found the two references reasonably pertinent for the same type of compositions with the same therapeutic purpose.the board concluded that adding vitamin d to turi would have been obvious to address the side effects of topical steroid treatment.the board also found that because serup discloses selecting ingredients that are compatible and not deleterious,an artisan would have been familiar with selecting components by routinely picking and choosing from a list to achieve a compatible and preparation.
regarding the combination of turi with dikstein,the board found that dikstein teaches the benefit of combining a vitamin d analog with a corticosteroid to achieve more complete skin healing,which was a reason to add a vitamin d analog to turi corticosteroid treatment.the board further concluded that the analysis for serup also applied to dikstein.
the board acknowledged that leo pharmaceuticals provided extensive experimental evidence that water,alcohol,and propylene glycol cause unacceptable degradation of vitamin d and steroid compositions.however,the board found that turi provided explicit guidance to exclude these ingredients.specifically,the board found that turi excluded water,alcohol,and propylene glycol taught that propylene glycol is irritating to the skin and a nonlubricant and taught that pop se solved the problems associated with propylene glycol.quoting turi,ll.the board also concluded that because serup uses almond oil,but does not teach that almond oil is necessary,an artisan,at the time of the claimed invention,would have considered both compositions excluding or including almond oil to be obvious.
addressing the objective indicia of nonobviousness,the board found that the objective indicia did not overcome a prima facie case of obviousness.the board acknowledged that the claimed compositions were adequately shown to be more storage stable than compositions formulated with certain ingredients that had been used in the prior art,such as water,propylene glycol,and alcohol.however,the board concluded that the unexpected results claimed by leo pharmaceuticals were not unexpected because turi provided explicit reason to use pop se as a solvent.therefore,the board found that leo pharmaceuticals did not establish that the improvement observed was unexpected to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the strong reason to have utilized pop se.even though the board found that turi did not teach pop se as a solvent to allow vitamin d and corticosteroid to coexist,the board nonetheless concluded that the reason for utilizing the solvent does not have to be the same reason the solvent was employed by the inventors.citing ksr int l teleflex,d.
this court reviews claim construction without deference.cybor fas,en banc.during reexamination,as with original examination,the pto must give claims their broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification.in re suitco surface.
for claim construction,the portion of the representative claim at issue reads 
a pharmaceutical composition for dermal use,said composition comprising components a,b,c wherein said pharmaceutical composition is storage stable and nonaqueous.
emphasis added claim of the patent as amended during reexamination.
although the claim term,storage stable is not de fined in the patent,the specification teaches a combination composition of a vitamin d analog,a corticosteroid,and a component c solvent,coexisting without degradation.patent,ll.the board construed ability to resist degradation even though ability to resist degradation is not a claim term to denote that the composition is stable,not changing or fluctuating because it does significantly degrade.citing http.
the board then adopted a disclosure in the specification to define storage stable.example two discloses an accelerated chemical stability test after storage for one month at and three months at and,respectively.patent,ll.this test describes a specific stability test to determine the chemical stability of a composition comprising all three components stored for a period of time.see also patent.the board adopted this test because one of ordinary skill would have reasonably looked to the described stability test as defining what was meant by storage stable.
at the outset,the board construction of storage stable is impermissibly narrow because example two is just one disclosure of an accelerated stability test.under its accepted and customary meaning,storage stable would include a composition that maintains its stability during its shelf life for its intended use as an approved pharmaceutical product for sale and home use by ordinary customers.see appellant br.
the board erred by narrowing the definition of storage stable to something far short of its broadest reasonable meaning.the plain meaning of storage stable is broader than the disclosure in example two.
accordingly,this court vacates the board construction.because it is unnecessary for this court to adopt a specific alternative construction to resolve this appeal,this court declines to do so,leaving that question to a later forum where the issue is determinative.
obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact.an analysis of obviousness must be based on several factual inquiries the scope and content of the prior art the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue the level of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made and objective evidence of nonobviousness,if any.
in re kubin,see also graham john deere,d.this court reviews the board fact findings for substantial evidence.in re mouttet.based on the underlying fact findings,whether a claimed invention would have been obvious under a is a question of law reviewed de novo.id.
as the board acknowledges,this record does not present unresolved issues of fact.thus,at bottom,this court confronts a question of law whether,in light of the prior art references and objective indicia of nonobviousness,the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at a time just before the time of invention.
relying on turi,dikstein,and serup,the board concluded that a skilled worker familiar with a wide range of possible ingredients to incorporate into a composition comprising a steroid and vitamin d analog would have arrived at the patent claimed invention.
the patent,however,is not simply a combination of elements found in the prior art.the inventors of the patent recognized and solved a problem with the storage stability of certain formulations a problem that the prior art did not recognize and a problem that was not solved for over a decade.
as an initial matter,an invention can often be the recognition of a problem itself.see cardiac pacemakers,jude med,there can of course arise situations wherein identification of the problem is itself the invention.here,the prior art either discouraged combining vitamin d analogs and corticosteroids in a single formulation,or attempted the combination without recognizing or solving the storage stability problems associated with the combination.
during reexamination,leo pharmaceuticals presented several medical research articles published as early as discouraging the combination of a vitamin d analog with a corticosteroid because of the stability problems of vitamin d analogs at lower phs.see knud kragballe,vitamin analogues,dermatological clinics,mark lebwohl,the evolution of vitamin d analogs for the treatment of psoriasis,archives of dermatology.these articles taught away from mixing topical vitamin d formulations with other drugs.see.even though studies in the prior art compared the effectiveness of treating psoriasis with vitamin d versus corticosteroid,those studies did not describe combining the two into one formulation.see id.researchers noted that it was only natural for clinicians to attempt to try combinations of vitamin d with other ingredients,but warned that vitamin d should not be combined with other drugs requiring a low ph,corticosteroids.see.these researchers recognized possible advantages from combining a vitamin d treatment with topical corticosteroids,but nevertheless they recommended a regimen where patients applied the drugs at different times of a day or on alternating days.see id.
although dikstein and serup attempt the combination of a vitamin d analog with a corticosteroid,neither discloses or addresses the stability problems of combining vitamin d analogs and corticosteroids into one pharmaceutical formulation.as evidenced by the experiments leo pharmaceuticals conducted,the prior art does not teach any composition that exhibits storage stable properties.every example disclosed in dikstein contains either almond oil or propylene glycol.similarly,the examples disclosed in serup contain not only water,but also almond oil,alcohol,or propylene glycol.
leo pharmaceuticals presented experimental evidence to the board that each of these ingredients harmed the storage stability of the vitamin d analog and corticosteroid combination.see,hoy decls.discussing propylene glycol and almond oil didriksen decl.discussing aqueous solvents.for example,the use of propylene glycol as a solvent resulted in degradation of the vitamin d analog.similarly,the use of aqueous solvents resulted in almost complete degradation of the vitamin d analog after three months of storage degradation in one formulation and degradation in another.and,when almond oil was used as a solvent,vitamin d analogs degraded after three months of storage.the vitamin d analogs were not the only components at risk for degradation.when commercial ointments with vitamin d analogs or corticosteroids were combined,one corticosteroid degraded by after four weeks and another degraded by almost within hours.see also range of corticosteroid degradation after months of storage in combination with a vitamin d analog.
moreover,because neither dikstein nor serup recognized or disclosed the stability problem,the record shows no reason for one of ordinary skill in the art to attempt to improve upon either dikstein or serup using turi.the ordinary artisan would first have needed to recognize the problem,that the formulations disclosed in dikstein and serup were not storage stable.to discover this problem,the ordinary artisan would have needed to spend several months running storage stability tests.see patent,see also.only after recognizing the existence of the problem would an artisan then turn to the prior art and attempt to develop a new formulation for storage stability.if these discoveries and advances were routine and relatively easy,the record would undoubtedly have shown that some ordinary artisan would have achieved this invention within months of dikstein or serup.instead this invention does not appear for more than a decade.
although the board acknowledges compositions within the scope of the patent claims were adequately shown to be more storage stable than compositions formulated with certain ingredients that had been used in the prior art,the board went on to find this evidence insufficient to overcome the strong case of obviousness.by brushing aside the storage stability issue,the board erred by collapsing the obviousness analysis into a combination of elements.this record,however,discloses several reasons that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to try,let alone make,the claimed invention of the patent.
first,the board found motivation to combine dikstein or serup with turi because one of ordinary skill would have used vitamin d to solve the side effects of steroid treatment.however,combining turi and vitamin d to address the side effects of a steroid treatment is only straightforward in hindsight.turi was publicly available in the prior art for years before the patent was filed,yet there is no evidence that anyone sought to improve turi with vitamin d.according to the record,even when serup published the side effects of atrophy in,no one including serup sought to improve turi by adding vitamin d to turi corticosteroid composition.serup even targeted the precise side effects that the board believed would have motivated the addition of a vitamin d analog to turi corticosteroid composition,yet serup did not seek to improve turi by adding vitamin 
moreover,focusing on the claim element,the board found there was a strong reason to have made a composition with pop se.the board believed an artisan would have add ed the vitamin d analog of serup or dikstein to turi pop se containing steroid composition for the solvent advantages and to obtain a more effective steroid preparation.internal quotations marks omitted.however,substantial evidence does not support the board finding that an ordinary artisan would have deviated from the aqueous composition of serup or the composition of dikstein plucking the vitamin d analog from those two references and incorporating the analog into turi.the board found that statements in turi exclude the solvents used by serup and dikstein.turi provides explicit guidance to exclude water,alcohol,and propylene glycol.thus,turi guidance actually teaches away from the board posited combination or,at a minimum,provides no evidence of motivation to combine turi with those prior solvents.
for example,turi distinguishes its compositions from aqueous compositions the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention contain no water.turi,ll.indeed,all of turi examples are.turi.yet,serup list of preparations are all aqueous,serup,ll,and serup examples are all aqueous,serup.similarly,dikstein discloses that dermatological creams are preferably formulated with,among other ingredients,water.dikstein,ll.and,five of dikstein examples include water.dikstein.
moreover,turi specifically disclaims the use of propylene glycol because of its very undesirable qualities from a pharmacological point of view.turi,ll.despite turi teaching away from that solvent,four of dikstein examples,dikstein exs,and five of serup examples,serup exs,involve propylene glycol.further,dikstein discloses that propylene glycol is a convenient solvent in the preparation of dermatological lotions.dikstein,ll.
even with the differing solvents taught by the prior art,the board explained that,because turi provided a reason to exclude water and propylene glycol,pop se would have been a logical choice to use for improving upon serup and dikstein.however,serup surprisingly observed that certain vitamin d analogues can prevent treat skin atrophy induced by topical steroid treatment.serup,ll.similarly,when dikstein combined a corticosteroid and vitamin d analog,it noted that s urprisingly the combination led to more complete healing.dikstein,ll.with surprisingly successful results,an ordinary artisan would not have been motivated to change the solvents serup or dikstein relied upon and use the different solvent disclosed in turi.
thus,in the face of such divergent compositions with express disclaimers of the other contents,the record showing that turi,serup,and dikstein describe compositions for the same therapeutic purpose does not rise to the level of a motivation to combine.without more,and especially in the face of such strong objective indicia of nonobviousness discussed infra,the board erred by using hindsight to determine that the addition of serup or dikstein vitamin d analog to turi formulation would have been obvious.
in addition,the board found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been capable of selecting the correct formulation from available alternatives.specifically,the board found more than eight different classes of additives,diluents,buffers,thickeners,lubricants.serup,ll.the board also found more than ten different categories of composition forms,liniments,lotions,applicants,or emulsions such as creams,ointments,pastes,or gels.serup,ll.based on these broad and general disclosures,the board reasoned that an artisan would have been able to mak e choices about what ingredients to include,and which to exclu
