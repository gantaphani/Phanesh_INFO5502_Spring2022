at issue in these consolidated appeals is the standing of payors of drugs prescribed for purposes,uses not approved by the food and drug administration fda,as well as the standing of individual patients prescribed drugs for purposes,to pursue claims against a pharmaceutical company and its affiliated marketing entities under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,the new jersey rico statute,et,as well as other state statutory and common law causes of action.both groups of plaintiffs claim that the defendants pursued illegal marketing campaigns to persuade physicians to prescribe certain drugs for uses.the district court found that both groups of plaintiffs lacked standing because,inter alia,they did not allege a plausible nexus between the assailed marketing campaign and the physicians decisions to prescribe certain drugs for use.having carefully considered the parties contentions in the context of the entire record,we agree that dismissal of both actions for want of standing is warranted.accordingly,we will affirm the district court decisions.
a.the parties 
there are two sets of plaintiffs in these consolidated appeals.one set of plaintiffs consists of a putative nationwide class of payors tpps the other set of plaintiffs is comprised of a putative nationwide class of individual who paid for prescriptions of certain drugs for uses,with the named class representative being angela montgomery separate amended complaints were filed on behalf of each set of plaintiffs.the defendants common to both amended complaints are the schering plough corporation,a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products,and its affiliated marketing and sales companies,the schering sales corporation and schering corporation.the tpp amended complaint also names as defendants another schering subsidiary,integrated therapeutics group,individual schering executives richard kogan,william heiden,and mary naughton,as well as unnamed individuals john doe and jane doe defendants,and unknown business entities abc corporations,who purportedly participated in the alleged illegal and false sales and marketing campaigns.for sake of simplicity,we shall refer to the defendants collectively as schering.both sets of plaintiffs assert that they paid for schering drugs that were ineffective or unsafe for the uses for which they were prescribed.
fdca labeling and marketing regulations 
the marketing claims are at least partially predicated on schering alleged violations of the labeling and marketing restrictions of the federal food,drug and cosmetic act,et fdca.the fdca regulates the manufacturing,marketing and sale of prescription drugs,and provides that a drug can not be sold in interstate commerce unless it is approved by the fda for the specific medical use,or indication,listed on the drug labeling.see a no person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug,unless an approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection b or j of this section is effective with respect to such drug.to obtain fda approval,drug companies generally must submit evidence from clinical trials and other testing that evaluate the drug risks and benefits and demonstrate that it is safe and effective for all of the indications prescribed,recommended,or suggested on the drug label.see id.at d.
prescription drugs frequently have therapeutic uses other than their indications.the fdca,however,generally prohibits manufacturers from marketing,advertising,or otherwise promoting drugs for such unapproved or uses.see a and d prohibiting manufacturers from introducing a drug into interstate commerce with an intent that it be used for an purchase,or by misbranding it by including information about unapproved uses on its label.
because the fdca does not regulate the practice of medicine,physicians may lawfully prescribe drugs for uses.see buckman plaintiffs legal,recognizing usage as an accepted and necessary corollary of the fda mission to regulate in this area without directly interfering with the practice of medicine.legal found.henney,a physician may prescribe a legal drug to serve any purpose that he or she deems appropriate,regardless of whether the drug has been approved for that use by the fda.thus,there is a certain asymmetry in the regulation of uses while physicians may lawfully prescribe drugs for uses,the fdca generally prohibits manufacturers from marketing these uses to physicians.see id.at referring to the fdca asymmetrical if not necessarily inconsistent regulatory treatment of uses.indeed,the fdca regulatory regime prohibits manufacturers from directly advertising uses,such as through labeling claims or explicit statements made by sales representatives.moreover,it is also unlawful for manufacturers to engage in certain indirect methods of marketing.for example,in certain circumstances it is unlawful for manufacturers to sponsor continuing medical education cme courses that focus on uses.the fdca does,however,permit manufacturers to distribute information about uses in certain limited circumstances.see id.at.
the drugs involved in these consolidated appeals the subject drugs are certain oncology and hepatitis drugs,including intron a intron a,peg intron peg intron,rebetol rebetol and rebetron rebetron collectively the intron franchise drugs,and temodar temodar.the fda has approved these drugs for specific purposes.
criminal case against schering 
in june,the fda division of drug marketing,advertising,and communications sent schering sales a letter notifying it that the fda had identified various promotional activities that were in violation of the fdca and its implementing regulations.information at,united states schering sales,cr.the letter cited a may american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in san francisco at which the fda witnessed schering sales representatives give purportedly false or misleading efficacy information about temodar to visitors at the commercial exhibit hall booth,and promote temodar for the unapproved use in first line therapy of anaplastic astrocytoma.id.at.the fda letter requested that schering immediately cease making such violative statements and any other promotional activities or materials for temodar that make the same or similar claims or presentations.id.at.
in august,the united states attorney for the district of massachusetts charged schering sales with conspiracy to make false statements to the federal government,in violation of.id.at.the government information alleged that schering sales and its knowingly and willfully made material false statements to the fda.id.at.it stated that schering sales response to the fda june letter specifically asserted that schering home office had aggressively pursued sales of intron a and temodar for unapproved uses through numerous methods,including training the sales force to seek sales,requiring the sales force to create business plans that emphasized detailed promotional goals to obtain sales,and compensating the sales force partly on their success in achieving sales.id.
schering sales pleaded guilty to the information pursuant to a written settlement agreement.see amended judgment,united states schering sales,cr.feb.under the settlement agreement,schering sales agreed to pay fine of million.id.it also agreed to pay million to resolve civil claims that it defrauded government health benefit programs,including medicare,medicaid,and the veteran administration.id.
consolidated putative class action 
following schering settlement with the government,various civil suits were filed across the country by consumer plaintiffs who were prescribed,consumed,and paid for the drugs,and by tpps who paid for the subject drugs prescribed to their plan members.the judicial panel on multi district litigation ordered the cases to be transferred to the district of new jersey,where schering is incorporated,and consolidated pursuant to.
the district court directed that the various actions transferred to it be consolidated for pretrial management and that a consolidated complaint on behalf of all plaintiffs be filed.in december,the nine named plaintiffs the four tpps and five patients identified in footnotes and,supra filed a consolidated class action complaint the complaint on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,alleging that the defendants engaged in illegal promotion of the subject drugs in violation of the federal and new jersey rico statutes counts i and ii,and the new jersey consumer fraud act njcfa,stat.ann,et count iii.the complaint also asserted common law claims for unjust enrichment count iv civil conspiracy count v fraud count vi negligent misrepresentation count vii aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty count viii and equitable accounting count ix.

in september,two separate amended complaints were filed,one by montgomery and the other by the four tpp plaintiffs identified in footnote,supra.montgomery filed an amended civil consumer class action complaint mac individually and on behalf of a putative nationwide class of similarly situated who purchased,were reimbursed,paid for any of the subject drugs during the class period.the mac asserted violations of the washington state consumer protection act,et count i,and the consumer protection statutes of the remaining states,the district of columbia,and puerto rico count ii,as well as claims of civil conspiracy count iii,aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty count iv,and unjust enrichment count v.
the tpp plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint tpp complaint on behalf of a proposed class of health and welfare funds and other tpps who paid any portion of the purchase price for the subject drugs during the class period.the tpp complaint asserted violations of the federal and new jersey rico statutes,counts i and ii,in addition to common law claims for intentional interference with contractual relations count iii and unjust enrichment count iv.
the plaintiffs amended complaints allege that schering engaged in a widespread marketing campaign that employed illegal techniques to promote prescriptions of the subject drugs for uses.they contend that these illegal practices included promoting certain of the subject drugs for uses using false and misleading statements to promote certain of the subject drugs as effective,safe,and for uses and providing physicians with disguised and undisguised bribes,kickbacks and other illegal inducements to encourage them to prescribe the subject drugs for uses.
plaintiffs claim that schering used a variety of methods to effectuate this marketing scheme and disseminate its false claims.for example,they allege that schering trained its sales representatives to mislead medical professionals about the subject drugs effectiveness for uses by distorting contrary scientific data and the results of clinical studies.they also claim that the schering sales force promoted prescriptions by disseminating false and misleading statements in private sales meetings with doctors,at medical conferences,and in cme programs.plaintiffs also assert that schering promoted these prescriptions through both disguised and undisguised bribes to induce doctors to prescribe the subject drugs.
plaintiffs aver that schering unlawful marketing practices caused physicians to prescribe the subject drugs for uses instead of equally effective alternative treatments that were approved for the prescribed uses or no medication at all.they assert that these marketing techniques led to a significant increase in prescriptions of the subject drugs for uses,and contend that this caused the plaintiffs ascertainable loss because they paid hundreds of millions,if not billions,of dollars for the subject drugs that they otherwise would not have paid.
on october,schering filed separate motions to dismiss each amended complaint.on june,the district court issued separate orders and opinions collectively,schering ii granting both motions.the court dismissed the tpp complaint because it failed to adequately plead the and causation elements required to establish standing to assert its rico,interference with contractual relations,and unjust enrichment claims.the court also held that even if the complaint had established standing to pursue claims,its two common law claims of interference with contractual relations and unjust enrichment would still fail under rule b.the court dismissed the mac for failure to show a causal link between montgomery alleged injury and schering alleged misconduct.

the district court dismissed the tpp complaint in its entirety for lack of standing and failure to state a claim.local contends that the court applied the wrong standard of review and consequently erred in finding that the tpp complaint fails to adequately plead facts to establish an that is fairly traceable to the defendants alleged misconduct.local also argues that the court erred in finding that it failed to state a claim for tortious interference with contract and unjust enrichment.we address each of these arguments in turn.
counts i and ii of the tpp complaint assert causes of action under the federal and new jersey rico statutes,respectively.the federal rico statute creates a civil remedy,including an award of treble damages,costs,and attorneys fees,for any person injured in his business or property by a violation of one of rico substantive provisions.c.pursuant to c,it is unlawful for any person who is employed by or associated with any enterprise affecting interstate commerce to participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.genty resolution trust,cir quoting c.the rico statute defines racketeering activity by a list of crimes,or predicate offenses,including several state felonies such as murder,kidnapping,and bribery that are punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,and federal crimes such as bribery,mail fraud and wire fraud.
the tpp complaint also alleges violations of the new jersey rico statute,stat.ann.c,based on the same alleged enterprises,predicate offenses,and pattern of racketeering activity as those alleged in support of the federal rico claims.tpp compl.since the tpp complaint federal and new jersey rico claims parallel each other,and because the two rico statutes are intended to be coextensive,we follow the district court approach and analyze the two claims concurrently.see,see also cetel kirwan fin,cir t he new jersey supreme court believed the new jersey rico statute was and should be consistent with the federal rico statute.citing state ball.
in addition to meeting the constitutional standing requirements,plaintiffs seeking recovery under rico must satisfy additional standing criterion set forth in section c of the statute.maio aetna,cir.section c confers standing upon any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter c.we have interpreted this language as requiring rico plaintiffs to make two related but analytically distinct threshold showings to establish standing that the plaintiff suffered an injury to business or property and that the plaintiff injury was proximately caused by the defendant violation of.maio,at.
the district court in this case conducted an extensive analysis of the tpp complaint to determine if it complied with the rico standing requirement of alleging injury to business or property.it concluded that the tpp complaint did not allege a concrete injury to tpp business or property because it did not contain sufficient allegations that they paid for prescriptions of the drugs that were actually ineffective or otherwise worth less than what they paid for them.on appeal,the parties focused their arguments,in significant part,on debating this conclusion.
although we agree with the district court conclusion in this respect,we need not reach the question of standing under rico.it is that a plaintiff article iii standing is a prerequisite for the federal courts to decide the merits of a suit.see steel citizens for a better environment.therefore,prior to considering whether local has standing to bring a rico claim,we must determine whether it has article iii standing to invoke the jurisdiction of this court.because we find that local has not established that its alleged injury is fairly traceable to schering alleged wrongful conduct,we conclude that the complaint was properly dismissed for lack of article iii standing.
the district court held that the tpp complaint fails to sufficiently allege facts to establish that the plaintiffs purchases of the subject drugs assuming one were to constitute is fairly traceable to schering allegedly unlawful marketing practices,and specifically to misrepresentations about the drugs to conduct characterized as bribery.on appeal,local argues that if the court had properly applied the causation standard to the plausibility test,it would have determined that there is a traceable connection from local injuries to the defendant illegal marketing scheme.local br.at.
we limit our analysis to the injury and causation theories that local raises on appeal in the statement of case section of its brief,local mentions three distinct injuries.first,it paid for off label prescriptions that were ineffective.second,it paid for off label prescriptions when less expensive but equally effective medication was available.and third,it paid for elevated drug prices that recouped the costs of schering illegal marketing.local br.at.the argument section of its brief,however,is limited to economic loss based on paying for ineffective drugs.accordingly,we further limit our analysis to the question of whether the tpp complaint alleges a causal link between the challenged conduct and the injury that local actually argues on appeal.
on appeal,local defends its standing to sue in large part on the basis of drug purchases made by the other tpp plaintiffs.it cites allegations that the defendants made false claims about temodar and intron a,and the other tpp plaintiffs purchases of those drugs for indications.local br.at.such allegations are unhelpful to local,which does not allege that it ever paid for a temodar or intron a prescription.see lewis casey,requiring named plaintiffs in a putative class action to allege that they personally have been injured,not that injury has been suffered by other,unidentified members of the class.accordingly,we will assess whether the tpp complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to confer standing upon local based upon its alleged purchases.
according to the tpp complaint,local damages are limited to two prescriptions of rebetol 
member kraft and member maurone were both prescribed rebetol during the class period which were paid for in large part by local.upon information and belief,these prescriptions were written for uses by physicians improperly influenced by the false and misleading statements,bribes,and other dishonest inducements brought to bear by defendants illegal marketing scheme.
tpp compl.accordingly,to establish standing,local must allege facts showing a causal relationship between the alleged injury payments for rebetol that was ineffective or unsafe for the use for which it was prescribed and schering alleged wrongful conduct.
to show the requisite causal connection,local must allege sufficient facts to plausibly support a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan,at.in other words,the amended complaint must allege facts that plausibly support a causal connection between local and schering allegedly illegal marketing or bribery schemes.
in arguing that the tpp complaint meets this burden,local essentially repeats the reasoning that the district court rejected.specifically,it states that the tpp complaint alleges both an overwhelming and reprehensible pattern of deceit by the defendants,including false marketing and illegal inducements to doctors,and that this scheme was aimed at the tpps.local br.at.local refers to allegations that schering falsely marketed the intron franchise drugs as efficacious for uses,but cites only to paragraphs that discuss intron see tpp compl.likewise,local argues that schering paid doctors to prescribe the drugs to patients who did not need them,but cites only to paragraphs referring to intron a,temodar,or rebetron.see tpp compl,local br.at.local apparently believes that these allegations are an adequate basis to conclude that,schering illegal conduct that increased prescriptions,local either would not have had to pay for them,or would not have had to pay for them at increased prices over therapies.id.at.
local suggestion that the claims about the other drugs are what caused the doctors to prescribe rebetol for uses is inadequate to establish causation.local claims that the allegations about the other subject drugs,paired with the fact that schering alone marketed rebetol,together reasonably support the inference that discovery will almost certainly confirm that schering also made false statements about all the drugs described in the complaint.local reply at.local must allege facts sufficient to show that the rebetol which it paid for was prescribed to its members for ineffective uses because of schering alleged misconduct.there are no averments that come close to satisfying this standard.it is pure conjecture to conclude that because schering misconduct caused other doctors to write prescriptions for ineffective uses for other products,local ended up paying for two prescriptions for rebetol due to the same kind of misconduct.accordingly,local has failed to show the requisite causal relationship between the alleged misconduct and its alleged injury.therefore,dismissal for lack of standing is warranted 
montgomery 
montgomery,a consumer of rebetol and peg intron,brought the mac on behalf of a putative nationwide class of consumers of the subject drugs.the mac alleges facts particular to her experience and use of two of the subject drugs,as well as the various legal theories pursued on behalf of the consumer plaintiffs.
montgomery suffered from hepatitis c,a viral liver infection,and after tests conducted in showed that she was asymptomatic,her physician,jeffrey willis,decided not to prescribe her a combination therapy of rebetol and intron a.at a visit in september,willis recommended a different treatment plan even though montgomery was still asymptomatic.a few months after this consultation,willis prescribed montgomery the peg intron and rebetol combination therapy,also called the peg intron combination therapy.mac.
the mac avers that at the time she was prescribed the subject drugs,they were only approved for patients with compensated liver disease,and that since she was healthy and did not need treatment,she suffered from the serious side effects of the drugs and lost weeks of work due to these side effects.the mac further claims that willis changed his mind about her treatment plan because of schering improper marketing of the intron combination therapy.specifically,it alleges willis new plan for montgomery treatment for her asymptomatic hepatitis c evidences that he was subjected to the marketing and sales scheme by schering alleged in this amended complaint.mac.
the mac reaches this conclusion based on the alleged facts that due to schering marketing techniques,willis mistakenly believed that the combination therapy was the standard treatment for montgomery condition willis prescribed the combination therapy before sending montgomery for two tests that he suggested were necessary before beginning the treatment willis received misinformation from a nurse on his staff who was believed to be a nurse.
the mac contains extensive factual allegations regarding the types of improper marketing techniques that schering used,which montgomery alleges must have influenced willis between,when he declined to prescribe her the drugs,and,when he changed his treatment plan.the mac reasserts many of the same allegations about schering techniques alleged in the tpp complaint.the mac also incorporates by reference all of the factual allegations made in a qui tam action brought against schering in the district of massachusetts,and the allegations in the criminal information,discussed above,to which schering pleaded guilty.mac.the allegations include claims about schering scheme for providing kickbacks to doctors for prescribing the drugs,false promotional claims made by sales representatives,and the placement of a nurse on willis staff.the mac further alleges that montgomery would not have been prescribed and would not have paid for such a costly,noxious,and dangerous medication cocktail had she known all the facts that were concealed by defendants and her doctors mac.
the defendants moved to dismiss the mac under rule b.the district court dismissed the mac for lack of jurisdiction under rule b,finding that it failed to establish a sufficient nexus between her alleged injury and schering alleged misconduct.
in reaching this conclusion,the court first found that montgomery had alleged an adequate for her claims under the washington consumer protection act and various common law theories.the district court held,however,that her standing to bring suit founders on her inability to establish any nexus between her purported injury be it the needless purchase of the intron,the she claims to have suffered the lost work time and the wrongful conduct in which schering was allegedly engaged.montgomery theory that the defendants injured her is premised on whether willis shifted his opinion about the appropriate treat
