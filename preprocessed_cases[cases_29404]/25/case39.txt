therese shepley and larry young,representing a class of nationwide consumers,appeal from the district court adverse entry of a final judgment as to their claims against johnson johnson centocor,and ortho biotech products,collectively j j.the appellants contend that the district court improperly entered judgment against them before trial.for the reasons that follow,we remand this matter to the district court.
background 
this appeal represents just one case in a sprawling,nationwide class action involving the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs which were reimbursed by medicare,private insurers and patients making payments from through.the gravamen of the nationwide litigation against the pharmaceutical companies is that they unfairly and deceptively inflated the drugs average wholesale prices awps,a price published by the pharmaceutical companies in various private industry publications and widely used as a benchmark for reimbursement payments,while simultaneously offering secret discounts and rebates to physicians.the result of this scheme was that the awps dramatically diverged from the physicians actual acquisition costs,a divergence referred to as the spread,thereby creating a windfall profit for the physicians who bought the drugs at the lower prices but were reimbursed based on the higher prices.the plaintiffs further allege that the pharmaceutical companies exploited this system by marketing the spread,by which a company used the prospect of windfall profits to induce physicians to prescribe its drug,thereby protecting or increasing market share competitor drugs.this case involves just a slice of the larger litigation the claims against j j by class group of natural persons nationwide who made based on awp for relevant medicare part b drugs for a detailed discussion of this scheme,and of the district court case management efforts,see in re pharmaceutical industry average wholesale price litigation,slip op.cir,and in re pharmaceutical industry average wholesale price litigation,d.this opinion assumes familiarity with those two decisions.
as part of the broader litigation,the district court held a bench trial adjudicating the claims of the class and class plaintiffs,see in re pharm.industry average wholesale price,defining classes and,against a set of pharmaceutical companies,including j see in re,d at this bench trial involved two massachusetts classes.one class,class,consists of payors tpps in massachusetts that reimburse medicare beneficiaries for their statutory twenty percent coinsurance obligations under medicare,known as medigap insurance or supplemental insurance.the other class of plaintiffs,class,consists of all third party payors,consumers who make coinsurance payments,and consumers who have no insurance for these drugs in massachusetts and who pay for drugs based on awp.footnotes omitted.in june,the district court entered a split judgment,finding in favor of the class and plaintiffs as to some of the defendants but not others.id.at summarizing findings.
j j was one of the victorious defendants.although the district court noted that the company conduct was at times troubling,it ultimately found that j j conduct had not damaged the class because the spread for the two relevant j drugs,procrit epoetin alfa and remicade infliximab,had not substantially exceeded industry expectations about the size of the spread,and therefore j j conduct did not rise to the level of egregiousness necessary to trigger liability under massachusetts general laws chapter chapter.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court rejected the class plaintiffs contention that any spread at all should trigger potential liability for the defendants an approach that the court labeled the per se liability theory,and instead applied a speed limit or yardstick for potential liability,whereby only spreads that exceeded would trigger potential liability.the potential liability trigger was also applied to the claims of the class plaintiffs.because the spreads for procrit and remicade were approximately or less during the class period,the district court declined to find liability as to either class or class.
on the strength of those findings,during a july conference relating to the class plaintiffs claims against the bristol myers squibb company which ultimately settled before trial,the district court characterized its findings as having cut off the claims of the class plaintiffs against j specifically,the following exchange occurred between the district court and steve berman,the attorney representing the class plaintiffs 
the court so,there will be no more trials with respect to the first five defendants in track with respect to,as i understand it,class 
berman there one issue on track,your honor.
the court yeah 
berman and,that is johnson johnson.i know that you said that their drugs did exceed the percent rule for the purposes of class and.but,it our we would like the opportunity to present this or maybe you already the percent would not apply to class.
the court i thought i ruled that.the percent did apply to class.
berman well,you have a footnote that talks that,but you did not rule in that way.that your ruling,that we have no j j class trial.
the court i thought it was not a footnote.i thought i went on and on about it.i think i went on and on about everything.so,maybe i ought to look at it again.
berman i do think you did 
the court i think i said that i rejected plaintiffs position that the per se liability for class and that i thought that the percent speed limit should apply to class as well.and,that would be,i thought applicable to all of the defendants.
so why is that not clear 
berman well,i did see that in your order,your honor.
the court they got it.
berman at the time we negotiated that bms settlement,both sides thought that was a risk that could go either way.and,we discussed that with the mediator.the mediator did think that it was clear either.
the court well 
berman it clear now.
the court it clear now.and,i will look at it again.if it was clear,it is clear.the percent speed limit applies to class.
i rejected a per se position.and,i have to go look through it again,because i thought it was clear.that why i essentially had the expert go back and calculate the damages again.because,the way he did it was he aggregated all the years when he did it with the percent speed limit.he did back out might have been statute of limitations and on the specific drugs.that why i needed a root calculation.
otherwise,i could have done it.right on the per se.because,he did it year by year.
berman correct,you could have,yeah.
the court i could have done that.i mean 
berman but,we felt it was a different issue with the consumers,because there no evidence that they had any knowledge of the industry norm of,percent.
the court well,i ruled to the contrary and i do accept that position.and,i thought it was clear.if not,i making it clear now.
seizing on this colloquy,j j began asking the district court to officially seal the fate of the class plaintiffs claims in august,j j moved for final judgment under.b allowing the district court to enter final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties in a or lawsuit the next month,j j submitted a proposed order concluding that no reasonable jury could find that the j j defendants conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the class claims and in november,j j again moved the district court for final judgment,asking it to effect its stated intention to enter judgment in favor of the j j defendants with respect to class and proposing the same conclusion that no reasonable jury could find that the j j defendants conduct violated the consumer protection laws applicable to the class claims.
the class plaintiffs responses to these efforts appear to have taken two different positions.in one response,filed by attorney donald haviland,on behalf of the class and class consumers,the class plaintiffs argued that the entry of judgment against them would unfairly and inappropriately limit their right to adjudicate their claims fully.a separate,later filing by the other attorneys representing the plaint
