on august,the pharmaceutical company pfizer,settled various claims that it had violated the false claims act fca,et,with the department of justice doj.as part of that settlement,pfizer entered into a corporate integrity agreement cia with the department of health and human services hhs.
less than a year after that settlement,relators alex booker and edmund hebron,two former pfizer sales representatives,brought this qui tam action against pfizer in federal district court,alleging it was on behalf of the united states,more than two dozen individual states,and the district of columbia,and asserting that despite the settlement,pfizer had continued to engage in conduct prohibited by the fca and state analogues.none of the sovereigns elected to intervene.
relators filed their original complaint on july,and amended it several times before the district court denied their motion for leave to file a sixth amended complaint.primarily,they alleged that pfizer had continued to knowingly induce third parties to file false claims for payment for pfizer drugs with government programs like medicaid by marketing the drug geodon for uses,in violation of sections and of the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et and paying kickbacks to doctors to compensate them for prescribing the drugs geodon and pristiq,in violation of the statute aks,b,g relators also alleged that pfizer had violated the reverse false claims provision of the fca,see a g,by failing to pay the government money owed it under pfizer cia with hhs.finally,relators alleged that pfizer had violated the fca provision,see id.h,by terminating booker employment on january,purportedly in response to his alleged whistleblowing activities.
all of these claims were resolved against relators,one on a motion to dismiss and the rest on summary judgment.on march,the district court granted pfizer motion to dismiss the claim under the reverse false claims provision the reverse fca claim but allowed relators to proceed to discovery with limits on the other claims.see ex rel.booker pfizer,booker i,supp.on may,the district court granted pfizer motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims.see ex rel.booker pfizer,booker ii,supp.relators appeal the dismissal,the grant of summary judgment,and certain of the district court intervening discovery rulings.we affirm the district court merits decisions and find no error in its management of discovery.
we rely on the district court two thorough opinions for a basic recounting of the case.see booker i,supp.booker ii,supp.we give only that background information needed for this appeal.
appeal from dismissal of reverse fca.appellate jurisdiction 
pfizer wrongly suggests that we have no jurisdiction to review the district court march,order dismissing relators reverse fca claim due to defects in relators notice of appeal.see fed.app.c b a notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.specifically,we reject the contention that there is no jurisdiction because relators notice of appeal did not explicitly mention the dismissal order.while the notice did specify certain other orders issued by the district court,it also specified the court may,final judgment disposing of the case,and it has been uniformly held that a notice of appeal that designates the final judgment encompasses not only that judgment,but also all earlier interlocutory orders that merge in the judgment.john insulation,addison,cir.see also,cir.
merits of dismissal of reverse fca claim 
we affirm the district court dismissal of relators reverse fca claim on de novo review,albeit on grounds different from those relied on by the district court see otero commonwealth of indus.comm n,cir.we take no position on whether the district court reasoning was correct.
the reverse false claims provision of the fca imposes liability on anyone who knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay money to the government.a g.the term obligation is defined by the statute as an established duty,whether or not fixed,arising from an express or implied contractual relationship.id.b.
relators reverse fca claim was predicated on pfizer alleged breach of its obligations under its august,cia with hhs.the cia imposed on pfizer an ongoing duty to report its probable violations of the fca to hhs.specifically,the cia defined as a reportable event,inter alia,a matter that a reasonable person would consider a probable violation of laws applicable to any fda requirements relating to the promotion of government reimbursed products.and the cia provided that i f pfizer determines after a reasonable opportunity to conduct an appropriate review or investigation of the allegations that there is a reportable event,pfizer shall notify hhs within days after making the determination.elsewhere,the cia stated that pfizer failure to meet the obligations set forth above may lead to the imposition of a stipulated penalty of for each day pfizer is in breach.the cia explained that,if hhs finds that pfizer has failed to comply with the aforementioned obligations,and if hhs thereafter determin es that stipulated penalties are appropriate,hhs shall notify pfizer of hhs exercise of its contractual right to demand payment of the stipulated penalties.
in their complaint,relators allege that a january,email sent by booker to pfizer corporate compliance department,purportedly claiming that booker manager was instructing his subordinates to engage in promotion,constituted a reportable event under the cia.because pfizer did not report this email to hhs,relators allege,pfizer illegally avoided its obligation to pay the cia stipulated penalt y of per day for failure to report a reportable event.
pfizer argues as it did before the district court that relators fail to state a claim for reverse fca liability because booker email to the corporate compliance department did not constitute a reportable event.pfizer points out that the cia does not require pfizer to report all complaints it receives.under the cia,conduct becomes a reportable event only if pfizer determines,after a chance to investigate,that the conduct is a probable violation of a specific class of laws.as pfizer explains,nowhere in their much amended complaint do relators allege that pfizer ever determined booker complaint to be in any way credible and therefore a reportable event.
on the record in this case we affirm.we do not decide if,under the cia,pfizer authority to determine whether a reportable event occurred is subject to an implicit reasonableness limitation that prevents pfizer from shutting its eyes to conduct that it abides but that a reasonable person would think is a probable violation of relevant law.relators did not assert before the district court,nor do they assert on appeal,that the agreement should be construed that way and that pfizer acted unreasonably in not determining that booker complaint constituted a reportable event,so the point is waived.as relators fail to allege that pfizer determined that a reportable event occurred,their complaint fails to state a claim for relief.we affirm the dismissal on that basis.
appeal from summary judgment on the remaining fca claims 
relators next appeal the district court grant of summary judgment for pfizer on their promotion and retaliation claims under the fca after reviewing those decisions de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in relators favor,feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir,we affirm both.
promotion fca claim 
relators sought to prove that after pfizer resolved its fca liability with the doj in for,inter alia,knowingly inducing false claims through promotion in violation of a a,pfizer continued to induce false claims by promoting geodon for three uses those three uses were as a treatment for children and adolescents,as a bipolar maintenance monotherapy drug,and as a treatment for any condition at excessive dosages.without deciding whether relators had provided sufficient evidence of continued promotion to survive summary judgment,see booker ii,supp.at,the district court concluded that relators proffer was fatally devoid of evidence that an
