impax laboratories,impax sued aventis pharmaceuticals aventis in the united states district court for the district of delaware for a declaratory judgment that impax did not infringe,induce infringement of,or contribute to the infringement of,patent the patent under e by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda.in its suit,impax alleged,inter alia,that the patent was invalid and unenforceable.impax filed its anda under the provisions of the patent laws and drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat,codified at,c,and commonly referred to as the act.in its anda,impax sought the approval of the united states food and drug administration fda to engage in the commercial manufacture sale of riluzole tablets for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als.
impax now appeals from the decision of the district court,following a bench trial,that it failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct and that claims of the patent are invalid as anticipated.see impax,aventis,d validity and enforceability order.we see no error in the decision of the district court on the inequitable conduct issue.however,as far as the anticipation issue is concerned,we conclude that the court erred in its determination that one of the alleged two items of invalidating prior art did not enable a method of using riluzole to treat als and,therefore,could not serve as an anticipatory reference under b.accordingly,we,and remand.
background 
impax is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in hayward,california.aventis is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in bridgewater,new jersey.aventis was formed in as part of a merger between,rp and hoechst,ag aventis owns the patent,which involves the use of riluzole to treat als.aventis sells riluzole under the trade name rilutek.
als,commonly referred to as lou gehrig disease,is a disease of the central nervous system.it involves the progressive degeneration of the nerves that carry impulses to muscles.als is characterized by the death of the nerves that control motor function also called motor neurons.this occurs after the motor neuron cell bodies shrivel and harden,a process called sclerosis.the clinical symptoms of als may first appear in the skeletal muscles,referred to as limb onset als,or in the bulbar muscles of the throat,tongue,and respiratory system,referred to as bulbar onset als.
riluzole is the chemical compound.in and,aventis conducted comparative testing of riluzole and seven other compounds,pharm through,on dissociated rat spinal cord cells.the purpose of the testing was to determine whether the compounds would be effective in treating als.louvel sent riluzole and the other seven compounds to a research facility in uruguay for analysis.the effects of riluzole and the other compounds on the rat spinal cords were analyzed based on the following criteria number of neurons in the cells used to screen for extraneous effects of the compound number of neurites per neuron thought to indicate effectiveness in treating als and neuronal diameter thought to indicate neuronal health and to be pertinent to treating als.
the tests compared riluzole to compounds identified as pharm through pharm the comparative test data.the study concluded 
none of pharm compounds showed the same pattern of effects than sic riluzole.pharm and were toxic for motoneurons,while pharm also decreased the number of neurites per neuron.pharm was observed to stimulate the growth of the cultures and to increase the size of neurons.pharm showed no relevant effects.
the set of tests compared riluzole to compounds identified as pharm through pharm the comparative test data.the study concluded none of pharm compounds tested showed the same pattern of effects than sic riluzole pharm and pharm induced an important decrease in neuronal cell number including motoneurons and prevented the development and differentiation of neurons.the effects of pharm were not significantly different from control conditions.
in due course,the patent issued from patent application serial the application,filed october,which claimed priority to patent application serial the application,filed september.the application and the application both were directed to treating als with riluzole.
on november,the examiner issued a final rejection of the claims of the application based on obviousness in light of certain prior art.the examiner asserted that the prior art disclosed that als is a motor neuron disease or disorder which may be treatable in humans with antiglutamate agents and that riluzole is known to be a glutamate antagonist useful for the treatment of motor neurons in mammals.it had been theorized that excitatory amino acids,such as glutamates,may be involved in als.on that basis,the examiner concluded that o ne of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to employ riluzole in the treatment of any form of the motor neuron disease,als,since riluzole was known in the art as an antiglutamate agent,and antiglutamate agents were known in the art for the treatment of als.
responding on may,aventis relied on the comparative test data relating to pharm and pharm benzothiazolamine.both are compounds disclosed in patent the patent,which the examiner referred to as pertinent to the applicant disclosure.aventis stated that pharm and pharm constituted evidence of the of the instant claims over the prior art relied upon by the examiner.aventis explained that riluzole,pharm,and pharm were compared in two tests on dissociated spinal cord cell cultures as to the number of neurites per neuron and neuron diameter.aventis stated that positive results were shown for riluzole 
the most striking effects are 
increased number of neurites per neuron and 
increased number of large neurons.
these results are urged to be unexpected and not predictable from the prior art.the examiner should note that the compound pharm presents an opposite action and compound pharm is inactive.the effects shown for riluzole permit the use of this compound for the treatment of motor neuron diseases,in particular,als.
a may,declaration from louvel accompanied the response and discussed the testing methodology and comparative test data obtained for riluzole and pharm and pharm.the same declaration was submitted on february,during prosecution of the continuing application,an application that claimed priority to the later abandoned application.
on february,the examiner rejected the claims of the application as obvious based on several prior art references,including a prior art reference authored by theodore munsat.the examiner challenged the testing procedure resulting in the comparative test and described in the february,louvel declaration as providing unexpected results applicant has not demonstrated that the testing procedure discussed in the declaration would be accepted by one of ordinary skill in the art as showing the activity of compounds in the claimed methods of treatment.the examiner then explained that the february,declaration had been considered but was deemed not persuasive to overcome the rejection under.
in april,june,and september,interviews with the examiner and in a june,response,aventis asserted that the comparative test data on pharm and pharm and other evidence indicated that the invention had unexpected results.a june,declaration from louvel asserted that the testing procedure that was used to compare the pharm and pharm compounds to riluzole was.
thereafter,on september,aventis obtained new patent prosecution counsel and stated to the examiner that the june,response was fully responsive to the february,office action.aventis then withdrew reliance on all previous arguments and declarations.aventis also submitted a declaration from munsat as noted,the author of one of the prior art references cited by the examiner that stated that by the priority date of the patent one of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reasonable expectation of success in using riluzole to treat als because of the failure of other glutamate antagonists to effectively treat als.
on march,the examiner issued a notice of allowability specifically referencing amendments and remarks from the june,response,the munsat declaration,and the september,response.the applicants responded that they viewed the application as allowed solely because of the september,amendment and declaration of munsat.the patent issued on june,and names louvel as the sole inventor.

on march,impax filed an anda with the fda under j,seeking approval to market and sell generic riluzole tablets for the treatment of als.the fda approved impax anda on january.at the time that impax filed its anda,there was no patent listed with respect to riluzole in the fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations the orange book,which lists patents that claim an approved or pending use of a new drug however,impax became aware of the patent while preparing its anda.
on june,impax filed a declaratory judgment action in the district of delaware.in its suit,impax sought a declaration that it had not infringed the patent under e by filing its anda,and that it would not contribute to or induce infringement of any valid claim of the patent by engaging in the manufacture and sale of its riluzole product for the treatment of als.impax asserted that the claims of the patent were invalid over the prior art and invalid by reason of incorrect inventorship.impax later amended its complaint to add allegations of inequitable conduct.on december,the district court entered a preliminary injunction against impax,barring it from marketing its riluzole product.impax,aventis,d.on april,the parties entered into a stipulation whereby impax conceded that its anda product infringed claims,and of the patent.
from october to,the district court conducted a bench trial on the issues of whether claims of the patent were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct,whether claims of the patent were invalid as anticipated,as obvious,or by reason of incorrect inventorship,and whether impax infringed claims of the patent or induced such infringement.see validity and enforceability order,d at.on august,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order,concluding that impax had not proven that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct or demonstrated that claims were invalid as anticipated by the prior art cited by impax.id.at.the court also rejected impax assertion that claims of the patent were invalid by reason of obviousness or for incorrect inventorship.id.at.with respect to obviousness,the court held that impax had not proven,by clear and convincing evidence,that the prior art upon which impax relied rendered the claims obvious.id.at.with respect to inventorship,the court found that the allegation was unduly speculative and not supported by evidence sufficient to support a finding of invalidity.id.at.finally,in a footnote,the court declined to address whether impax proposed marketing of riluzole would induce infringement of claims and of the patent because impax may not engage in the manufacture or sale of riluzole regardless of whether its proposed actions would induce infringement of claims and of the patent.id.at.
on march,the district court entered final judgment against impax,to the effect that claims of the patent were neither unenforceable nor invalid,that impax proposed manufacture or sale of riluzole would induce infringement of claims,and of the patent,and that lmpax proposed marketing of riluzole to treat als would induce infringement of claims and of the patent.
on march,impax filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
impax appeals the district court determination that it failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct and that the patent is invalid as anticipated.we address these contentions in turn.
to prove that a patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct,the alleged infringer must provide clear and convincing evidence of affirmative misrepresentations of a material fact,failure to disclose material information,or submission of false material information and an intent to deceive.alza mylan.
the materiality aspect of inequitable conduct was recently discussed in digital control charles machine works.in that case,we considered the standard for materiality set forth in the present version of patent and trademark office pto rule,see b,as well as the previous version of the rule,that was in effect through.digital control,at.we explained that if a misstatement or omission is material under the new rule standard,it is material.similarly,if a misstatement or omission is material under the reasonable examiner standard or under the older three tests it is also material.id.at.the present rule standard is as follows 
information is material to patentability when it is not cumulative to information already of record or being made of record in the application,and 
it establishes,by itself or in combination with other information,a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim or 
it refutes,or is inconsistent with,a position the applicant takes in 
i opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the office,or 
ii asserting an argument of patentability.
a prima facie case of unpatentability is established when the information compels a conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of evidence,standard,giving each term in the claim its broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification,and before any consideration is given to evidence which may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of patentability.
b.under the prior reasonable examiner standard,an omission or misstatement was material if a reasonable examiner would have considered such prior art important in deciding whether to allow the parent application.digital control,at citations omitted.
as seen,inequitable conduct also requires an intent to deceive.to satisfy the intent to deceive element of inequitable conduct,the involved conduct,viewed in light of all the evidence,including evidence indicative of good faith,must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive.kingsdown med.consultants,hollister,en banc in relevant part.intent need not,and rarely can,be proven by direct evidence.merck danbury pharmacal.rather,intent to deceive is generally inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the applicant overall conduct.id.
if the court finds materiality and intent,it must balance the equities to determine whether the patentee has committed inequitable conduct that warrants holding the patent unenforceable.monsanto bayer bioscience.the more material the omission or misrepresentation,the less intent that must be shown to elicit a finding of inequitable conduct.squibb rorer.if inequitable conduct occurred with respect to one or more claims of an application,the entire patent is unenforceable.kingsdown med.consultants,at.
we review a district court ultimate decision on a claim of inequitable conduct for an abuse of discretion and its threshold findings on materiality and intent for clear error.alza,at.an abuse of discretion occurs when the court decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary,or fanciful,the court decision is based on an erroneous construction of the law,the court factual findings are clearly erroneous,or the record contains no evidence upon which the court rationally could have based its decision.see,cybor fas,en banc.under the clear error standard,the court findings will not be overturned in the absence of a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.roche,promega,quoting molins plc textron.
before the district court,impax main contention in support of its claim of inequitable the contention that is relevant on that,during prosecution of the application and the continuing application,aventis withheld from the examiner the comparative test data relating to the testing of pharm through pharm,and the comparative test data relating to the testing of pharm.according to impax,the withheld data was material because it was inconsistent with an argument advanced by aventis in support of patentability during prosecution.aventis responded that the information that was not provided to the examiner was immaterial,superfluous,or less pertinent than the disclosed information.the district court ruled that under either the materiality standard of the current version of rule or equitable principles,the rules based on the version of rule impax had not proven inequitable conduct.validity and enforceability order,d at.considering the alleged withholding of the comparative test data,the court concluded that aventis partial disclosure of the comparative test results was not inappropriate.id.at.the court found that the withheld and comparative test data was not material because the results for pharm pharm,and pharm were not inconsistent with the representation to the examiner that riluzole was better than pharm and pharm,which were the subject of the comparative test data the withheld comparative testing did not produce results that indicated effectiveness in treating als,because while pharm produced increases in neuron diameter and neurites per neuron,it only produced significant increases in neuron diameter the patent examiner explicitly excluded the submitted testing pharm and pharm from her decision because the applicant has not demonstrated that the testing procedures discussed in the declaration would be accepted by one of ordinary skill in the art as showing the activity of compounds in the claimed method of treatment and the comparative test results were not as valuable as the results of human clinical trials which were submitted to the pto.id.at.the district court suggested that even if it did find a minimal level of materiality there was an absence of intent to deceive.id.thus,the district court concluded that there was no inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the patent.id.
on appeal,impax repeats its claim that aventis committed inequitable conduct by withholding the comparative test data and the comparative test data relating to pharm.according to impax,that data was inconsistent with a position that aventis took in its may,response.in its response,which relied on louvel may,declaration pursuant to,aventis argued that the invention was patentable because it showed unexpected results over pharm and pharm.
impax argues that louvel declaration withheld data for certain prior art compounds pharm and pharm,included in the comparative test data,and pharm,included in the comparative test data that had positive results for key criteria.specifically,impax argues that the comparative test data demonstrates that pharm and pharm,along with riluzole,had the highest increase of neurites per neuron and that pharm had the greatest absolute values in increased diameter of neuron cells.impax contends that pharm presented positive results in two of the same parameters in which riluzole tested positive,while pharm and pharm did not,so pharm is superior to pharm and pharm.thus,impax concludes,louvel failed to disclose positive test data for pharm,which data undermined the argument aventis was making in prosecution that its riluzole compound showed unexpected results in the treatment of als as compared to pharm and pharm.as far as the comparative test data is concerned,impax argues that the data demonstrates that pharm and riluzole had the largest increase in neuron cell diameter.impax rejects the district court three reasons for finding the information immaterial.first,impax asserts that the withheld information is inconsistent because louvel asserted in prosecution that riluzole had unexpected results.therefore,it was inconsistent to withhold test results that exhibited better results for other compounds.second,impax argues that it is irrelevant that the withheld data does not indicate effectiveness in treating als because it was clearly better than the data that louvel supplied and thus material.
aventis responds that impax misrepresents the comparative test data because,while pharm and pharm were positive in neuron diameter,they were not significantly different from the control in neurites per neuron,while pharm and were toxic for motoneurons,and only riluzole was positive in all parameters tested.further,aventis asserts that the reported data was consistent with aventis statements to the examiner because the comparative test data on pharm and pharm served to distinguish the patent from the patent,while the unreported comparative test data was related to compounds that were not in the patent.
we see no error in the ruling of the district court that the comparative test data and the comparative test data on pharm were not material under either rule standard.there is no evidence that the withheld comparative test data establishes by itself or in combination with other information a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim.in our view,the district court correctly recognized that the comparative test data did not produce results that indicated that any of pharm,or was effective in treating als.as the district court recognized,
a lthough some of the pharm compounds produced significant positive results in one of the two relevant increase in neurites per neuron or an increase in neuron of the pharm compounds from the withheld tests produced results significant in both parameters.for example,pharm produced increases in neuron diameter and neurites per neuron,but only produced significant increases in neuron diameter.
validity and enforceability order,d at.
further,there is no evidence that the withheld comparative test data refutes or is inconsistent with a position aventis took during prosecution.aventis submitted correct information,and impax does not argue that the submitted comparative testing data was false.we see no error in the district court determination that the results for pharm,pharm,and pharm were not inconsistent with the representation to the examiner that riluzole was better than pharm and pharm.the comparative test data in this case was submitted to demonstrate unexpected results based on compositions in the pharm and pharm.aventis never suggested that this was the only testing data or that another compound,such as pharm,was not tested.
finally,there is no evidence that a reasonable examiner would have considered such prior art important in deciding whether to allow the parent application.digital control,at.as discussed above,the comparative test data and the comparative test data on pharm did not produce results that indicated effectiveness in treating als.
reviewing the district court finding on materiality for clear error,we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.
nor did the district court clearly err in its intent findings.the district court concluded after a bench trial that there was an absence of intent.validity and enforceability order,d at.as far as intent is concerned,impax asserts that the and comparative test data were withheld with an intent to deceive.first,impax argues that misrepresentations and omissions in a declaration are presumptively intentional.next,impax asserts that the circumstances surrounding prosecution demonstrate an intent to deceive because of the submission of the declaration and the materiality of the withheld information.finally,impax argues that louvel,who was involved in the preparation and prosecution of the patent,was aware of the comparative test data and the comparative test data on pharm,but he chose to disclose only the comparative test data on pharm and pharm.
aventis responds that there is no clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive.it argues that impax citations to internal aventis documents suggesting that aventis did not have faith in the strength of the application do not demonstrate an intent to deceive.it distinguishes impax reliance on cases involving false statements in declarations,arguing that there was no false information in the louvel declaration.
we can not say that the district court finding that there was no intent amounts to clear error.louvel was involved in both the and testing and the prosecution of the patent.he did disclose the data relevant to distinguishing the comparative test data on pharm and pharm he did not disclose the comparative test data that would be irrelevant to distinguishing the patent.we agree with the district court that these facts,standing alone,are not enough to establish an intent to deceive.as the district court recognized,there was no evidence that impax intended to deceive the pto when it did not disclose the comparative test data or the comparative test data on pharm.
we thus affirm the district court ruling that the patent is not unenforceable by reason of inequitable conduct.
an issued patent is presumed to be valid,and the burden of establishing invalidity as to any claim of a patent rests upon the party asserting such invalidity.clear and convincing evidence is required to invalidate a patent.typeright keyboard microsoft.when the prior art was before the examiner during prosecution of the application,there is a particularly heavy burden in establishing invalidity.see bausch lomb.
in the district court impax claimed that claims of the patent were anticipated by the patent and french application the application,from which the patent claims priority.the pertinent facts are as follows 
on december,the application that matured into the patent was filed.the patent,which is owned by aventis,is directed to a class of compounds disclosed in formula i below 
patent.the patent explains that formula i includes many different compounds,but it exempts.that is,also known as riluzole,is a compound that could fall within the literal scope of formula i but is explicitly exempted from formula i by the specification of the patent.the patent explains that is not new,and thus does not form part of the invention.
the patent goes on to state that the compounds of formula i are useful in treating medical conditions associated with the effects of glutamate such as als 
the compounds of formula i and their salts possess advantageous pharmacological properties.these compounds are useful in the treatment of medical conditions associated with the effects of glutamate in which it is desirable to inhibit such effects at least partially.they are active with respect to convulsions,and are hence useful in the treatment and prevention of convulsive phenomena,schizophrenic disorders,and in particular the deficiency forms of schizophrenia,sleep disorders,phenomena linked to cerebral ischaemia and also neurological conditions in which glutamate may be implicated,such as alzheimer disease,huntington chorea,als and olivopontocerebellar atrophy.
patent.to,emphases added.
the patent claims priority from the application,which has a disclosure similar to that of the patent.however,the application does not exempt from the family of formula i compounds as a claimed compound.
before the district court,impax argued that every limitation of claims of the patent was disclosed by the patent.impax asserted that the patent disclosed a class of compounds generally encompassed by formula i,including riluzole,and that the patent taught that riluzole is useful in treating als and also taught effective administration.because the patent claims priority from the application and contains similar disclosures,impax asserted virtually identical arguments with respect to the application.aventis responded that the patent excluded riluzole from the compounds in formula aventis asserted in addition that even if the patent included riluzole,it did not anticipate the patent because it failed to disclose the invention in the patent and was not enabling because it did not provide specific instruction for using riluzole and actually taught away from riluzole.it asserted similar arguments with respect to the application.
the district court agreed with impax that formula i of the patent included riluzole,but concluded that the patent was not anticipated because formula i entails such a large number of compounds that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have recognized that riluzole was effective in treating als without additional detail or guidance that is not found in the disclosure of the patent.validity and enforceability order,d at emphasis added the court reasoned that riluzole was not listed as one of the especially advantageous compounds,that riluzole was not meaningfully discussed in the patent,and that the language of the patent demonstrated that there was substantial uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of treating als with glutamate inhibiting compounds.id.emphasis added.the district court concluded that the language in the patent which indicated that formula i compounds will treat neurological conditions in which glutamate may be implicated amounted to speculation that those compounds would be useful in treating als.id.the court stated o ne of ordinary skill in the art would not have recognized riluzole effectiveness in treating als,and therefore,the court finds that the patent does not anticipate the patent.id.emphasis added.thus,the court apparently determined that even though formula i of the patent includes riluzole,the formula did not anticipate the patent because it did not disclose riluzole as being effective in treating als.therefore,the court reasoned,formula i was not enabling.
the district court explained that the application,from which the patent claims priority,contained a disclosure similar to the patent and that the parties asserted virtually identical arguments with respect to the two disclosures.id.thus,it concluded that there were no material differences between the two references that persuaded the court to reach a conclusion different from the one it had reached with respect to the patent.id.having decided that the patent and the application were not enabling,the district court did not address whether they anticipated claims of the patent.
on appeal,impax argues that the patent enables treating als with riluzole because it provides sufficient guidance to allow one of ordinary skill in the art to determine riluzole actual effectiveness against als without undue experimentation,as the patent indicates that the compounds of formula i are active against als and specifies the dosage ranges to be given.impax also argues that the application anticipates the patent,but acknowledges that the application does not exclude riluzole from the compounds included in formula 
aventis responds that the was considered during prosecution but was not viewed by the examiner as supporting a rejection of the pending not enable a method of using riluzole to treat als,as the patent discloses hundreds of possible compounds,does not meaningfully discuss riluzole or identify it as a medication,indicates that the compounds of formula i may be useful in treating a laundry list of diseases,and offers only speculation that the formula i compounds might treat als.aventi
