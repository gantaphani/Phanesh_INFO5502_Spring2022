bayer schering pharma ag and bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals,collectively,bayer appeal from two judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york.in the first case,the court dismissed bayer patent infringement claims against watson pharmaceuticals,and watson laboratories,collectively,watson and sandoz.in the second case,the court dismissed similar patent infringement claims against lupin and lupin pharmaceuticals,collectively,lupin.we affirm.
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of the hatch waxman act,stat,creates a procedure by which a drug manufacturer can obtain permission from the food and drug administration fda to market a generic version of a previously approved drug.a manufacturer seeking to market a generic drug is entitled to submit an abbreviated new drug application anda,rather than submitting a full new drug application nda.eli lilly teva pharm.usa.the anda process streamlines fda approval by allowing the generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy studies of a drug that has previously been approved upon a showing that the generic version and the relevant listed drug share the same active ingredients and are bioequivalent.caraco pharm,forest.
in the case of drugs that enjoy patent protection,the hatch waxman act creates a mechanism that allows for prompt judicial determination of whether the anda applicant drug or method of using the drug infringes a valid patent.the act makes it an act of infringement to file an anda for a drug or for a use of the drug that is claimed in a patent.e a.that artificial act of infringement creates jurisdiction for a court to entertain an action by the patentee against the anda applicant in which issues of patent infringement and validity can be resolved.warner lambert apotex.
the hatch waxman act requires an nda applicant seeking fda approval for a drug that enjoys patent protection to identify every patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug that could reasonably be asserted in an infringement action.b.the fda lists the patents identified by the nda applicant in a publication entitled approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations,which is universally referred to in the industry as the orange book.in the case of patents claiming methods of use,fda regulations provide that only patents claiming indications or other conditions of use that either have been approved by the fda or are in a pending nda are to be submitted for listing in the orange book.b.
when an applicant files an anda seeking fda permission to market a generic drug,it is required to address each patent in the orange book that relates to that drug.eli lilly,at.for patents that will not expire prior to the proposed marketing of the generic drug,the anda applicant has two options.
first,the anda applicant can include a statement,known as a section viii statement,that the applicant is not seeking approval for the method of use that is claimed in the patent.j a viii.when submitting a section viii statement,the anda applicant must include a proposed label that removes or carves out the claimed method of use.see astrazeneca lp apotex.the fda will approve an anda with a section viii statement only if there is no overlap between the proposed label submitted by the anda applicant and the use described in the orange book,and removing the information about the claimed method of use from the label does not render the drug less safe or effective.see c.a see also applications for fda approval to market a new drug,june,a section viii statement would not be appropriate when the anda applicant is seeking approval for exactly the same labeling as that in the nda for which the patent was submitted.
second,the anda applicant can file a paragraph iv certification,which states that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the generic drug.j a vii iv see novo nordisk,at.if the anda applicant files a paragraph iv certification,it must also send a notice letter so advising the holder of the original nda and the patent owner.j b.
for patents,the artificial infringement claim provided by section e a lies only against a patented use that has been approved by the fda.warner lambert,at.as this court explained in the warner lambert case,because an anda may not seek approval for an unapproved or use of a drug under j a i,it necessarily follows that e a does not apply to a use patent claiming only such a use.see also astrazeneca pharm.lp apotex,allergan,alcon.
bayer produces and markets yasmin,an oral contraceptive.in,the fda approved the new drug application for yasmin that was filed by bayer predecessor,berlex laboratories.that application sought fda approval for the use of yasmin for oral contraception.the fda approved the application,noting that it had concluded that adequate information has been presented to demonstrate that the drug product is safe and effective for use as recommended in the agreed upon enclosed labeling text.
the defendants in the two cases before us have all filed andas with the fda to market generic versions of yasmin.the andas,which track the original nda as required,seek fda approval for the use of the generic versions of yasmin for oral contraception.in their respective andas,the defendants have certified that the three patents that bayer had listed in the orange book in connection with yasmin are either invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of their generic version of yasmin.see j a vii iv.in march,watson and sandoz sent notice letters to bayer regarding their anda filings.in response,bayer filed a complaint against watson and sandoz in april,alleging infringement under section e a of one of the three listed patents,patent the patent.lupin sent bayer a notice letter in june regarding its anda filing.bayer filed a complaint against lupin in july alleging infringement of the same patent.
the patent is a patent with two independent claims 
a method of simultaneously achieving,during premenopause or menopause a gestagenic effect,antiandrogenic effect,and an antialdosterone effect in a female patient in need thereof comprising administering an amount of dihydrospirorenone to said female patient,wherein said amount of dihydrospirorenone is effective to simultaneously achieve a gestagenic effect,antiandrogenic effect and antialdosterone effect in said patient.
a method of simultaneously achieving,during premenopause or menopause,a contraceptive effect,an effect,and an antialdosterone effect in a female patient in need thereof comprising administering an effective amount of dihydrospirorenone and an effective amount of an estrogenic compound,wherein said effective amount of dihydrospirorenone is effective to simultaneously achieve a gestagenic effect,effect,and an effect in said female patient.
those claims recite that the claimed method achieves three effects simultaneously a contraceptive or gestagenic effect,an effect which reduces the activity of male hormones and can be effective in treating conditions such as hirsutism or acne,and an effect also known as an antimineralocorticoid effect,which can be effective in reducing excess water retention in the body.
watson and sandoz moved for judgment of noninfringement on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.they argued that their andas related to the use of the generic form of yasmin only for oral contraception and not for the combination of uses claimed in the patent.accordingly,they argued,they could not be held liable for inducing infringement of that patent.the district court granted their motions.the court held that because the fda had not given approval for the use of the drug that was claimed in the patent,bayer could not state a claim for patent infringement.bayer schering pharma ag sandoz,d.the court explained that an action for infringement of a patent could be brought under section e a only if the fda had approved the use claimed in the patent under the nda.the court noted that the fda had approved the use of yasmin only for oral contraception,and not for the simultaneous treatment of three conditions,which was the use claimed in the patent.because the court concluded that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the defendants sought to promote their generic versions of yasmin based on the or antialdosterone properties claimed in the patent,the court rejected bayer claim that the defendants were liable for inducement of infringement under u.b.the court therefore granted the motion and entered judgment of noninfringement in favor of watson and sandoz.based on that ruling,bayer and lupin stipulated to,and the court entered,final judgment in bayer suit against lupin as well.bayer schering pharma ag lupin ltd,cv.bayer took appeals from both judgments,and we consolidated the two cases for appeal.
as the district court correctly noted,the issue in these cases is a very narrow one.the following propositions are not in dispute first,bayer does not enjoy patent protection for the drug yasmin or for the use of the drug for contraception alone.see bayer schering pharma ag barr.second,the patent claims a method of use consisting of simultaneously achieving an effect,an effect,and a contraceptive effect in a premenopausal or menopausal female patient in need of all three effects.third,the only proposed indication for use in the nda application filed by bayer predecessor was for oral contraception,and the only use set forth in the indications and usage section of the label attached to the fda approval letter was for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use an oral contraceptive.fourth,the indications and usage section of the defendants andas used the same language and did not refer to the other effects claimed in the patent.and finally,the parties agree that under e a,the patent can be infringed only if the defendants andas seek fda approval to market yasmin for the three simultaneous effects covered by the patent.
in light of those uncontested propositions,bayer quarrel with the district court is limited to contending that the fda did approve the use of yasmin to obtain all three effects simultaneously in menopausal and premenopausal patients in need of all three effects,and that the defendants andas seek fda approval for the same uses.bayer contends that its label for yasmin demonstrates that the fda approved the use of the drug for all three effects,and that the similar label to be used by the defendants on their generic version of yasmin likewise covers the use of the drug to obtain all three effects simultaneously in patients needing that combined treatment.therefore,according to bayer,the defendants are liable for inducing infringement by physicians and patients because the label instructs the use of the generic drug to obtain the three effects claimed in the patent.the district court rejected bayer argument,and so do we.
this court decision in warner lambert apotex corp,sets the framework for analyzing this case.in warner lambert,the patentee received approval from the fda to market a particular drug for use in treating epilepsy.warner lambert patent for use of the drug in treating epilepsy had expired,but warner lambert had an unexpired patent claiming the use of the drug for treating neurodegenerative disease.that latter use of the drug,however,had not been approved by the fda.apotex,a generic manufacturer,filed an anda seeking approval to market a generic form of the drug for the approved use of treating epilepsy.warner lambert sued under its unexpired patent,but this court held that it is not an act of infringement under section e a to submit an anda for approval to market a drug for a use when neither the drug nor that use is covered by an existing patent,and the patent at issue is for a use not approved by the fda.id.at.
a second case from this court,decided the same year,is even more closely on point.in that case,allergan,alcon laboratories,alcon,a generic drug manufacturer,filed an anda seeking approval to market the unpatented drug brimonidine for the use of reducing intraocular pressure.allergan had two patents that claimed other uses for which brimonidine was effective protection of the optic nerve and neural protection.those uses,however,were not approved by the fda.this court held that because those additional uses were not approved by the fda,the generic drug applicant could not be liable for infringement under section e a,even though brimonidine necessarily had those protective effects in patients who took the drug for the approved purpose.id.at.
based on warner lambert and allergan,the defendants conduct would constitute infringement under section e a or inducement of infringement under section b only if the defendants andas sought approval for the use protected by the patent,for the combination of a gestagenic effect,an effect,and an effect in patients needing that combination of effects.because the defendants andas are substantively identical to bayer nda,the use or uses for which the andas seek fda approval are necessarily the same as the uses for which the fda has given its approval by granting bayer nda.the question to be answered,then,is whether the fda has approved the use of yasmin to achieve the combination of the three effects claimed in the patent.
the label for an approved drug indicates whether the fda has approved a particular method of use for that drug.an nda that seeks fda approval for a particular use for a drug must include full reports of investigations demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective for that use,b a,and it must include the labeling proposed to be used for such drug,id.b f.the fda determines whether the information submitted with the application shows that the drug is safe and effective for the use described in the submitted label.see id.d fda approval requires showing that drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed,recommended,or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof and that there is substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed,recommended,or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof see also requirements on content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products,the centerpiece of risk management for prescription drugs generally is the labeling which reflects thorough fda review of the pertinent scientific evidence and communicates to health care practitioners the agency formal,authoritative conclusions regarding the conditions under which the product can be used safely and effectively.
the label for yasmin that was approved by the fda states in the indications and usage section that yasmin is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use an oral contraceptive.as noted,that characterization tracks the fda approval letter for yasmin,which stated that the nda provides for the use of yasmin for oral contraception.
in claiming that the label recognizes fda approval of all three effects claimed in the patent,bayer relies on the pharmacodynamics subsection of the clinical pharmacology section of the label,which recites that drospirenone,one of the two active compounds in yasmin,
is a spironolactone analogue with antimineralocorticoid activity.preclinical studies in animals and in vitro have shown that drospirenone has no androgenic,estrogenic,glucocorticoid,and antiglucocorticoid activity.preclinical studies in animals have also shown that drospirenone has antiandrogenic activity.
while that passage states that yasmin exhibits antimineralocorticoid activity and has the potential for antiandrogenic activity based on animal studies,neither that passage nor anything else on the label provides any safety or efficacy information associated with the possible use of yasmin in treating patients who are in need of those effects.thus,while the label mentions potential antimineralocorticoid and activity,it does not do so in any way that recommends or suggests to physicians that the drug is safe and effective for administration to patients for the purposes of inducing these effects.
the fda labeling regulation,makes clear that the fda has not approved the use of yasmin to produce the pharmacological effects that are listed in the clinical pharmacology section of the label.the portion of the regulation that is addressed to the indications and usage section of the label requires the indications set forth in that section to be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and studies.id.c iv.the regulation adds that indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section.id.the reference in the clinical pharmacology section of the label to the antimineralocorticoid and activity of drospirenone is certainly not a direct indication of an appropriate use for yasmin,and even if it could be considered an implied or suggested indication of an appropriate use,the regulation expressly states that such implied or suggested uses do not constitute approved uses.
in addition,the fda regulation requires the label to provide a summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug.see a.the yasmin label does not provide physicians with such a summary with respect to the drug and antimineralocorticoid effects,which is a further indication that the fda did not approve the use of yasmin to exploit those effects in treating patients.
bayer points out that the sections of the regulation directed to the indications and usage portion of the label address only the portion of the labeling that can detail the diseases or conditions the fda has approved the drug to treat,and that other effects that do not treat a disease or condition will not be in the indications section and will still be fda approved.however,whether other effects may be described outside the indications and usage section of the label does not address the issue in this case.the regulation states that the clinical pharmacology section of the label must include a description of any biochemical or physiologic pharmacologic effects of the drug or active metabolites related to the drug clinical effect in preventing,diagnosing,mitigating,curing,or treating disease,or those related to adverse effects or toxicity.c i b.that section of the label is also required to describe the clinically significant pharmacokinetics of a drug or its active metabolites information related to in vitro and animal studies is permitted to be included in that section of the label only if the information is essential to understand dosing or drug interaction information presented in other sections of the labeling.id.c i.thus,the fact that certain of the effects of a drug are described in the clinical pharmacology section of the label does not mean that the fda has approved the use of the drug to produce those effects it only ensures that physicians are aware of the full range of the drug pharmacological effects especially those that might be considered adverse effects when prescribing the drug for a purpose set forth in the indications and usage section and under the conditions described in other parts of the label.
bayer notes that methods of use do not invariably appear in the indications and usage section of the label.for example,an method of use relating to the dosage or method of administration of a drug would appear not in the indications and usage section,but in the dosage and administration section of the label.but that does not help bayer in this case.the patent is narrowly focused on simultaneously achieving three effects in premenopausal or menopausal patients in need of all three effects as the parties stipulated,the claim limitation referring to a patient in need thereof means a patient with a perceived need for all three effects.the patent does not claim a method of achieving a contraceptive effect in a patient in need of contraception in which the drug used to achieve the contraceptive effect has two generally beneficial additional effects.to practice the method claimed in the patent,a physician must determine that all three effects are needed by a specific premenopausal or menopausal patient.fda approval of that method of use would require a showing that yasmin was safe and effective for simultaneously obtaining those three effects in patients needing those effects.acknowledgement of the safety and efficacy of that specific method of use would be evidenced by including it in the indications and usage section of the label.therefore,the point is not simply that the method of use was not described in the indications and usage section that shows lack of fda approval the point is that the label,taken in its entirety,fails to recommend or suggest to a physician that yasmin is safe and effective for inducing the claimed combination of effects in patients in need thereof.
bayer relies on four pieces of evidence to support its argument that the references to antimineralocorticoid and activity in the clinical pharmacology section of the yasmin label indicate that the fda has approved the use of yasmin to induce those effects the fda regulation that addresses the listing of patents in the orange book a declaration from lee shulman,a physician a declaration from susan allen,a former fda official and marketing materials for yasmin that were approved by the fda.that evidence,however,demonstrates only that the fda was aware that yasmin could cause the effects discussed in the patent.it does not go to the critical question of whether the fda has found yasmin to be safe and effective for the purpose of inducing those effects in a premenopausal or menopausal patient with a specific need for those effects.absent that finding of safety and efficacy,and the recognition of such safety and efficacy on the yasmin label,the yasmin label can not instruct and the anda proposed label can not induce infringement of the method of use claimed in the patent.
bayer first relies on the fda regulation that addresses the requirement to submit patents for inclusion in the orange book,c.bayer argues that the regulation supports its contention that the fda approved the pharmacological effects listed in the clinical pharmacology section of the yasmin label because the regulation requires the submission not only of patents that claim indications,but also patents that claim other conditions of use.id.b.in bayer view,that requirement shows that the fda considered that infringement under section e a could extend to the type of pharmacological effects detailed in the clinical pharmacology section of the yasmin label.bayer further contends that the regulation constitutes an interpretation of section e a,and that it is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council.
bayer argument reflects a misinterpretation of section.the regulation implements the patent listing requirements of.b,which requires a patent holder to submit those patents for listing in the orange book with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted the fact that bayer submitted the patent for inclusion in the orange book is not helpful to its case,for several reasons.first,the fda does not make a determination as to whether particular patents should be listed in the orange book it simply lists those patents that are submitted by patent holders.second,the category of claims as to which infringement could reasonably be asserted is plainly broader than the category of claims that are infringed.section b and its implementing regulations encourage broad disclosure and do not require nda applicants to make an extrajudicial determination of actual infringement.section e a defines the filing of an anda as an act of infringement,but it does not alter the underlying patent infringement analysis,which requires in the case of a patent that the accused infringer use the patented product for the use claimed in the patent.see warner lambert,at.nothing in the regulation provides any support for bayer position in this case.
shulman,an with experience in the clinical use of contraceptives,stated in his declaration that prescribing yasmin as an oral contraceptive with the intent to produce an pharmacological effect and an pharmacological effect is clearly stated and.that opinion,however,is contrary to the contents of the label for yasmin.the language of the clinical pharmacology section of the label does not indicate that the fda has determined that the drug is safe or effective in inducing those effects in patients with a specific need for those effects,as claimed in the patent.see warner lambert,at.
as to yasmin antimineralocorticoid effect,the label simply states that drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with antimineralocorticoid activity.it does not describe the extent of or summarize the scientific evidence for that activity in humans.the dosage and administration section of the label specifically describes the use of the yasmin t o achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness it contains no discussion of the dosage required to achieve a therapeutic level of antimineralocorticoid effect.even if knowing that drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue were all the information a physician would need to induce a desired therapeutic effect,the label contains no information regarding the safety of the drug in a patient needing such an effect 
similarly,as to yasmin effect,the information in the clinical pharmacology section of the label indicates only that drospirenone has been shown to generate that activity in preclinical studies in animals.the fda has not found the drug to be safe or effective in inducing an effect in a human patient,and the label neither provides a statement to that effect nor summarizes any supporting research.therefore,notwithstanding shulman understanding to the contrary,any prescription of yasmin to produce either an or effect has not been approved by the fda and is therefore off label.
allen,a former fda official,stated that while she was at the fda she oversaw the approval of the yasmin nda,including the preparation of final contents of the yasmin label.allen stated that the label indicates that the fda approved yasmin for a therapeutic effect contraception and for the two additional pharmacological effects the and effects.regarding the pharmacological effects,allen stated that listing those effects in the clinical pharmacology section of the label indicated that those effects were confirmed in yasmin and are pertinent to human use of the drug.however,just because those effects were confirmed and are pertinent to human use,and therefore important for a prescribing physician to be aware of,does not mean as the dissent contends that the drug is safe or effective for use in inducing those effects in a patient with a specific need for them.moreover,allen distinguished between the contraceptive effect of yasmin and the other effects,stating that the fda approved the therapeutic effect contraceptive and the two additional pharmacological effects.importantly,allen did not say that yasmin was approved for achieving those two additional effects in patients with a therapeutic need for those effects.therefore,allen view of the effect of fda approval does not draw into question the proposition that yasmin was not approved for the purpose of inducing the three simultaneous effects recited in the patent in premenopausal and menopausal patients.
finally,bayer argues that the fda approval of certain promotional materials highlighting the antimineralocorticoid and properties of yasmin indicates that the fda approved those pharmacological effects.the problem with that argument is that the description of those effects is,in almost all cases,qualified.in the case of the antimineralocorticoid effect,the description is accompanied by a warning regarding the potential for hyperkalemia in patients.in the case of the effect,the materials note that this effect is seen in preclinical studies.the fda regulations require such disclosure of specific side effect s in approved labeling.e.that treatment is in contrast to the clinically proved benefits of contraceptive efficacy and cycle control.the fact that bayer was able to frame a required disclosure in a positive light without crossing the line into promoting such use does not mean that the fda has approved a use not otherwise indicated in the approved label.see e i advertisement violates n,among other reasons,if it c ontains a representation or suggestion,not approved or permitted for use in the labeling,that a drug is useful in a broader range of conditions.
as applied to this case,warner lambert and allergan make clear that the defendants do not infringe bayer patent under section e a and that their sale of the generic form of yasmin would not induce infringement of that patent.the defendants andas seek approval to market the generic form of yasmin solely for contraceptive use,and there is no valid patent on the use of the drug for that purpose alone.the label for yasmin does not indicate to physicians that the specific use claimed in the patent,producing contraceptive,and effects in premenopausal and menopausal women with a specific need of all three effects,is safe and effective.therefore,we agree with the district court that the fda has not approved such use and that the defendants can not be held liable for infringement of the patent.
the district court dismissed this complaint on the pleadings under.c,thereby denying the patentee the opportunity to litigate infringement of its patent before the defendants market their generic counterpart of the yasmin product.my colleagues err in endorsing this dismissal,which is contrary not only to the federal rules and judicial precedent,but also to the premises of fda generic drug practices and to the purposes of the hatch waxman act.
motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c are considered under the same standards applicable to rule b.king am.airlines,cir.pleading standards are a matter of regional circuit law.see corebrace llc star seismic llc,the question whether a rule b motion was properly granted is a purely procedural question not pertaining to patent law,to which this court applies the rule of the regional circuit.review of the substantive patent law embodied in the pleadings is,however,in accordance with the law of this court.
the district court held,on the pleadings as a matter of law,that the generic counterpart of the bayer product,brand name yasmin,does not infringe the patent.my colleagues on this panel affirm,on the theory that some of the claimed properties of the yasmin product are not covered by the label,in part because these properties are stated in a different part of the label.the label for yasmin recites use as an oral contraceptive in the section headed indications and usage,and recites the properties of activity acne control and activity diuretic effect in the clinical pharmacology section.the patent recites these three effects in the same claim.
the court holds that the listing of some of the yasmin properties in the clinical pharmacology section of the fda label,instead of the indications and usage section,removes the generic counterpart of the yasmin product from the scope of the claims.that ruling is in error,for the portion of the fda label in which a product properties are described is irrelevant to whether the patent is infringed by sale or use of the product.the court also finds,albeit incorrectly,that the label,taken in its entirety,fails to recommend or suggest to a physician that yasmin is safe and effective for inducing the claimed combination of effects in patients in need thereof,and holds that this also requires on the pleadings,as a matter of law.neither the district court,nor this court,conducted a standard infringement analysis.
the infringement question is whether sale or use of the generic equivalent of the yasmin product,in accordance with the representations in the anda with respect to fda approval for the generic equivalent of yasmin,infringes the patent.fda approval is embodied in the approved label for the yasmin product.the court concentrates on the inclusion of the and antimineralocorticoid activity in the pharmacodynamics section of the label instead of the indications and usage section.the purpose of the pharmacodynamics section is to describe i mportant pharmacologic effects other than the main desired effect of the drug product.see fda draft guidance for industry clinical pharmacology section of labeling for human prescription
