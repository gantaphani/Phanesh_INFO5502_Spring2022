plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york trager,granting summary judgment for defendants.defendants bayer ag and its subsidiary bayer corporation collectively bayer own the patent for the active ingredient in the antibiotic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cipro.defendants barr laboratories,barr,hoechst marion roussel,hmr,and watson pharmaceuticals,watson were potential generic manufacturers of cipro.plaintiffs are direct purchasers of cipro,who allege that defendants violated federal antitrust law when they settled a patent infringement lawsuit by entering into collusive agreements that blocked the entry of generic versions of cipro into the prescription drug market.
background 
settlement agreements 
bayer is the owner of the patent relating to the active ingredient in cipro,which has been described as the most prescribed antibiotic in the world.the cipro patent,patent,was issued on june,and was scheduled to expire on december,
in,barr sought to market a generic version of cipro pursuant to the expedited fda approval process established by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of the act,stat.under the act,a pharmaceutical company can seek approval to market generic versions of an approved branded drug without having to the drug safety and effectiveness by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda.j a,b.where,as here,a generic manufacturer seeks to enter the market before the expiration of the branded firm patent,it must file a challenge paragraph iv or certification.j a vii iv.the certification requires the generic firm to demonstrate the bioequivalence of its proposed version of the drug,see a,and to state the basis for its claim of invalidity or noninfringement of the branded firm patent,see j b iv ii.
an certification itself constitutes an act of infringement,triggering the branded manufacturer right to sue.e a.indeed,the branded manufacturer must sue within days of receiving notice of the in order to stay the generic firm entry into the market.j b iii thus,the act redistributes the relative risks between the patent holder and the generic manufacturer,allowing generic manufacturers to challenge the validity of the patent without incurring the costs of market entry or the risks of damages from infringement.see.carpenters health welfare fund bayer ag in re ciprofloxacin hydrochloride antitrust litig.
the first generic firm to file an is rewarded with a exclusive right to market its generic version of the drug.j b iv however,only the is eligible for the exclusivity period even if the first filer loses,withdraws,or settles its challenge,subsequent filers do not become eligible for the exclusivity period 
the lawsuit 
barr filed an challenging bayer cipro patent in october bayer sued barr for patent infringement in the southern district of new york within days of its receipt of notice of barr filing,triggering the statutory stay barr subsequently entered into an agreement with other defendants herein,also potential generic manufacturers of cipro,to share the costs and benefits of the patent litigation.
in june,the district court denied the parties for summary judgment.in january two weeks prior to the scheduled and barr entered into a reverse exclusionary payment or settlement that is,the patent holder bayer agreed to pay the alleged infringer to settle the lawsuit,and in exchange,the alleged infringer agreed not to enter the market under the terms of the settlement agreement,bayer agreed to pay million immediately make quarterly payments of between and million for the duration of the patent except for the last six months prior to the patent expiration and provide the generic manufacturers a guaranteed license to sell cipro at a reduced rate for six months prior to the patent expiration.in exchange,barr conceded the patent validity and agreed not to market a generic version of cipro prior to the patent expiration 
plaintiffs antitrust lawsuit 
in,direct and indirect purchasers of cipro filed over thirty antitrust lawsuits against bayer under federal and state law.these cases were consolidated by the litigation panel in the eastern district of new york.see in re ciprofloxacin hydrocholoride antitrust,d,cipro i.plaintiffs allege that defendants settlement exceeded the scope of bayer patent rights because bayer effectively paid its potential competitors hundreds of millions of dollars not to challenge its patent.plaintiffs also allege that the agreements were unlawful because barr was permitted to reclaim the market exclusivity period if a subsequent challenger was successful in having the patent invalidated,and because the generic manufacturers agreed not to file any certifications for products that relate to cipro.but for the challenged agreements,plaintiffs assert that barr would have entered the market pending resolution of the patent litigation barr would have prevailed in the litigation and entered the market or bayer would have granted barr a license to market a generic version of cipro to avoid a trial on the patent validity.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.in re ciprofloxacin hydrochloride antitrust,d,cipro iii.the court stated 
the ultimate this is the crux of the not whether bayer and barr had the power to adversely affect competition for ciprofloxacin as a whole,but whether any adverse effects on competition stemming from the agreements were outside the exclusionary zone of the patent.it goes without saying that patents have adverse effects on competition.however,any adverse effects within the scope of a patent can not be redressed by antitrust law.
id.at citations omitted.in eschewing a post hoc determination of the potential validity of the underlying patent,the court reasoned that such an approach would undermine the presumption of validity of patents in all cases,as it could not logically be limited to drug patents,and would work a revolution in patent law.id.at.
the district court also found that the agreements did not allow barr to manipulate the exclusivity period to obstruct subsequent challengers of the patent.id.at see also cipro ii,d at.the court summarized as follows 
i n the absence of any evidence that the agreements created a bottleneck on challenges to the patent,or that they otherwise restrained competition beyond the scope of the claims of the patent,the agreements have not had any effects on the market for ciprofloxacin beyond that which are permitted under the patent.the fact that bayer paid what in absolute numbers is a handsome sum to barr to settle its lawsuit does not necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the patent,but rather the economic realities of what was at risk.there is simply no precedent for plaintiffs argument that the parties to a settlement are required to preserve the public interest in lower prices.such a rule would only result in parties being less likely to reach settlements,aside from undermining principles of patent law.finally,to even attempt to quantify the public interest in a patent settlement between private parties would require devaluing patents across the board,a result that would contravene the presumption of validity afforded by congress and impact the very way patent licenses are handled in countless daily transactions.
cipro iii,d at.
plaintiffs timely appealed.this court retained jurisdiction over the direct purchaser plaintiffs appeals,but transferred the indirect purchaser plaintiffs appeal to the federal circuit 
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing evidence in the manner most favorable to the nonmoving party.horvath westport library ass n,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
section of the sherman act 
the sherman act provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.although by its terms,the act prohibits every restraint of trade,the supreme court has long recognized that congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.state oil khan.agreements that have a predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect,and limited potential for procompetitive benefit are deemed per se unlawful.id.most conduct,however,is subject to rule of reason analysis.see texaco dagher.
rule of reason analysis proceeds in three steps.first,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that the defendant conduct had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market.capital imaging,mohawk valley med,cir emphasis in original.if plaintiff satisfies this burden,the burden then shifts to defendant to offer evidence that its conduct had effects.id.if defendant is able to offer such proof,the burden shifts back to plaintiff,who must prove that any legitimate competitive effects could have been achieved through less restrictive alternatives.id.
reverse exclusionary payment settlements,antitrust law,and tamoxifen 
plaintiffs argue that when bayer paid barr to withdraw its challenge to the cipro patent,defendants effectively entered into a agreement in restraint of trade.patent settlements,like all private contracts,are subject to antitrust scrutiny.standard oil united states,the limited monopolies granted to patent owners do not exempt them from the prohibitions of the sherman act see also braun,abbott,the sherman act prevents patentees from obtaining a greater monopoly than was inherent in the relevant patent grant.thus,like ordinary contracts,patent settlements can not take the form of agreements.see palmer brg of georgia,per curiam agreement is unlawful on its face united states sealy,same see also herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed.t he law does not condone the purchase of protection from uncertain competition any more than it condones the elimination of actual competition.
the question,therefore,is whether patent settlements in which the generic firm agrees to delay entry into the market in exchange for payment fall within the scope of the patent holder property rights,or whether such settlements are properly characterized as illegal agreements.authorities are divided on this question.the federal trade commission ftc,the antitrust enforcement agency charged with supervising the pharmaceutical industry,has long insisted that reverse exclusionary payment settlements violate antitrust law and has challenged numerous agreements as unreasonable restraints of trade although it initially took a different view,the united states has since maintained that reverse exclusionary payment settlements may violate antitrust laws.see brief for the united states as amicus at,joblove barr,wl may.many academic commentators share the united states view 
most courts,by contrast,including this court,joblove barr labs.inc,in re tamoxifen citrate antitrust litig,cir tamoxifen,have held that the right to enter into reverse exclusionary payment agreements fall within the terms of the exclusionary grant conferred by the branded manufacturer patent.see in re ciprofloxacin antitrust,at ftc,cir.but see.wholesale drug hoechst marion roussel,in re cardizem cd antitrust litig,cir holding such agreements to be per se illegal in re terazosin hydrochloride antitrust,d same.
particularly relevant here is this court decision in tamoxifen.the plaintiffs in tamoxifen challenged a reverse exclusionary payment settlement between zeneca and barr that the parties entered into after a district court had declared zeneca patent invalid.at.at the b stage,tamoxifen rejected as speculative plaintiffs allegation that barr would have prevailed on appeal but for the settlement agreement.id.at.assuming the truth of plaintiffs allegation that the exclusion payments exceeded the profits barr would have obtained upon entering the market as a generic competitor,the tamoxifen court determined that the plaintiffs had no antitrust claim because a patent holder is entitled to protect its lawful monopoly over the manufacture and distribution of the patented product.id.at.
notably,tamoxifen expressly adopted aspects of the lower court summary judgment decision in this case,holding 
unless and until the patent is shown to have been procured by fraud,or a suit for its enforcement is shown to be objectively baseless,there is no injury to the market cognizable under existing antitrust law,as long as competition is restrained only within the scope of the patent.
id.at citing cipro iii,d at.the tamoxifen court ruled that the settlement agreement did not exceed the scope of the patent where there was no restriction on marketing products a generic version of the branded drug would necessarily infringe the branded firm patent and the agreement did not bar other generic manufacturers from challenging the patent.id.at cipro iii,d at cipro ii,d at.
since tamoxifen rejected antitrust challenges to reverse payments as a matter of law,we are bound to review the cipro court rulings under the standard adopted in tamoxifen.see at.we therefore proceed to evaluate plaintiffs claims under tamoxifen plaintiffs do not argue that the patent infringement lawsuit was a sham or that the cipro patent was procured by fraud.thus,the only reasonable basis for distinguishing tamoxifen would be if plaintiffs demonstrated that the settlement agreement here,unlike in tamoxifen,exceeded the scope of the cipro patent.plaintiffs can not establish this because a generic version of cipro would necessarily infringe bayer patent.tamoxifen explained that unlike formulation patents,which cover only specific formulations or delivery methods for a compound,a compound patent by its nature,excludes all generic versions of the drug.at.bayer cipro patent is a compound patent.id.thus,barr agreement to refrain from manufacturing generic cipro encompasses only conduct that would infringe bayer patent rights.
plaintiffs also claim that the challenged agreements contained ancillary restraints outside the scope of the patent barr was permitted under the agreements to manipulate its rights to the market exclusivity period and barr and hmr agreed to refrain from filing future certifications related to cipro tamoxifen recognized that a plaintiff can have antitrust claims where a settlement allows the generic manufacturer to manipulate the exclusivity period in a manner that bars subsequent challenges to the patent or precludes the generic manufacturer from marketing products unrelated to the patent.see tamoxifen,at see also cardizem cd,at.in this case,however,plaintiffs have not shown that the settlement agreements allowed manipulation of the exclusivity period or prohibited the marketing of products.
plaintiffs contend that barr insistence on its right to reclaim the exclusivity period caused other generic manufacturers to delay subsequent challenges.specifically,they maintain that mylan delayed its challenge because it perceived barr continued assertion of a right to the exclusivity as an obstruction to their entry into the market.this argument is unpersuasive.although the settlement agreement allows barr to reinstate its if a subsequent patent challenge were successful,a reinstated certification would not have entitled barr to the exclusivity period based on the law in effect at the time of settlement thus,the district court properly determined that barr forfeited its challenge to the patent and thus any right to exclusivity,and that other generic manufacturers were able to subsequently challenge the cipro patent.see cipro ii,d at tamoxifen,at rejecting a claim that barr manipulated the exclusivity period based on similar analysis.
finally,plaintiffs argue that barr and hmr unlawfully agreed to refrain from filing even after the cipro patent expired.the agreement states that barr and hmr are not to file any anda relating to cipro with a certification made pursuant to paragraph iv of the act.the district court reasonably interpreted the agreement to mean that barr and hmr would not file any certifications challenging the validity of the cipro patent.see cipro ii,d at.this reading was consistent with barr concession of validity and with t
