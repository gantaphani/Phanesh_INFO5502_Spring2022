on summary judgment,the united states district court for the district of new jersey determined that claims and of patent the patent are invalid.schering geneva,wl.because the district court correctly found that patent the patent inherently anticipates claims and of the patent,this court affirms.
schering corporation schering owns the and patents on antihistamines.antihistamines inhibit the histamines that cause allergic symptoms.
the prior art patent covers the antihistamine loratadine,the active component of a pharmaceutical that schering markets as claritin.unlike conventional antihistamines when claritin was launched,loratadine does not cause drowsiness.
the more recent patent at issue in this case covers a metabolite of loratadine called descarboethoxyloratadine dcl.a metabolite is the compound formed in the patient body upon ingestion of a pharmaceutical.the ingested pharmaceutical undergoes a chemical conversion in the digestion process to form a new metabolite compound.the metabolite dcl is also a antihistamine.the patent issued in april and will expire in april the patent issued in and has since expired.see c defining the term of a patent in force before june,as the greater of twenty years from the earliest priority date or seventeen years from grant.
structurally,loratadine and its metabolite dcl differ only in that loratadine has a carboethoxy group,cooet on a ring nitrogen,while dcl has a hydrogen atom on that ring nitrogen 
claim of the patent covers dcl for x cl,its fluorine analog,and their salts claim covers only dcl and its salts 
a compound of the formula 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,wherein x represents cl or 
a compound having the structural formula 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
the patent issued on august,over one year before the earliest priority date of the patent,february.the patent is thus prior art to the patent.see b a person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was patented in this or a foreign country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states.the patent discloses a class of compounds including loratadine disclosed in example.patent,ll.the patent claims loratadine in claim,ll.the patent claims four other compounds in claims.examples are prophetic examples of pharmaceutical compositions a syrup and a tablet,each containing an unidentified active compound.the patent does not expressly disclose dcl and does not refer to metabolites of loratadine.
the numerous sought to market generic versions of loratadine once the patent expired.seeking regulatory approval,each appellee submitted an application to the food and drug administration fda.see b,j.because schering included the patent in the orange book listing for loratadine,the applications also contained a certification that the patent was invalid.see id.b a,j a vii.the appellees notified schering of the fda filings.see id.b b,j b ii.
after receiving notice of the fda filings,schering filed suit for infringement.see e a.after discovery,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the validity issue.the district court construed claims and of the patent to cover dcl in all its forms,including metabolized within the human body and synthetically produced in a purified and isolated form.the parties agreed to that construction.applying that claim construction,the district court found that the patent did not expressly disclose dcl.nonetheless,the district court also found that dcl was necessarily formed as a metabolite by carrying out the process disclosed in the patent.the district court concluded that the patent anticipated claims and of the patent under b.the district court therefore granted the appellees motions for summary judgment of invalidity.schering timely appealed to this court under a.

a patent is invalid for anticipation if a single prior art reference discloses each and every limitation of the claimed invention.lewmar marine,barient.moreover,a prior art reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is necessarily present,or inherent,in the single anticipating reference.continental can monsanto.
at the outset,this court rejects the contention that inherent anticipation requires recognition in the prior art.schering relies on elan pharmaceuticals,mayo foundation for medical education research,for that proposition.this court has since vacated elan.see.other precedents of this court have held that inherent anticipation does not require that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time would have recognized the inherent disclosure,in re cruciferous sprout,int l milgraum,where the result is a necessary consequence of what was deliberately intended,it is of no import that the article authors did not appreciate the results.atlas powder,at because sufficient aeration was inherent in the prior art,it is irrelevant that the prior art did not recognize the key aspect of the invention an inherent structure,composition,or function is not necessarily known.thus,recognition by a person of ordinary skill in the art before the critical date of the patent is not required to show anticipation by inherency.the district court therefore did not err in allowing for later recognition of the inherent characteristics of the prior art patent.
contrary to schering contention,continental can does not stand for the proposition that an inherent feature of a prior art reference must be perceived as such by a person of ordinary skill in the art before the critical date.in continental can,this court vacated summary judgment of anticipation of claims reciting a plastic bottle with hollow ribs over a prior art reference disclosing a plastic bottle.the record contained conflicting expert testimony about whether the ribs of the prior art plastic bottle were solid.the accused infringer expert testified that the prior art plastic bottle was made by blow molding,a process that would inherently produce hollow ribs.the patentee experts testified that the prior art plastic bottle had solid ribs.the patentee disputed whether the blow molding inherently produced hollow ribs.given the disputed material fact,this court vacated the summary judgment as improper.continental can,at.continental can makes no reference to whether the inherent feature,hollow ribs,was recognized before or after the critical date of the patent at issue.read in context,continental can stands for the proposition that inherency,like anticipation itself,requires a determination of the meaning of the prior art.thus,a court may consult artisans of ordinary skill to ascertain their understanding about subject matter disclosed by the prior art,including features inherent in the prior art.a court may resolve factual questions about the subject matter in the prior art by examining the reference through the eyes of a person of ordinary skill in the art,among other sources of evidence about the meaning of the prior art.thus,in continental can,this court did not require past recognition of the inherent feature,but only allowed recourse to opinions of skilled artisans to determine the scope of the prior art reference.
cases dealing with accidental,unwitting,and unappreciated anticipation also do not show that inherency requires recognition.see eibel process ontario paper.tilghman proctor.in contrast to the present case,the record in eibel and tilghman did not show that the prior art produced the claimed subject matter.the patent at issue in tilghman claimed a method of forming free fatty acids and glycerine by heating fats with water at high pressure.in tilghman,the record did not show conclusively that the claimed process occurred in the prior art.in reviewing the prior art,the court referred hypothetically to possible disclosure of the claimed process.for example,the court stated w e do not regard the accidental formation of fat acid in perkins steam
