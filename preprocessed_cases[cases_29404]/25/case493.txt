jeffrey hubbell,jason schense,andreas zisch,and heike hall are the named inventors on patent application the application.the examiner rejected all of the pending claims claims,and for double patenting over several patents,including patent the patent.hubbell appeals from the decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences the board affirming the examiner final rejection with respect to the patent.ex parte jeffrey hubbell,jason schense,andreas zisch,and heike hall,wl.lexis may,board decision.because the board did not err in concluding that the pending claims were barred under the doctrine of double patenting,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
the application,entitled enzyme mediated modification of fibrin for tissue engineering,was filed on august,the invention relates generally to the field of tissue repair and regeneration,and more specifically to matrices containing bidomain peptides or proteins.claim,which the parties agree is representative of the pending claims,recites a bidomain protein or peptide comprising a transglutaminase substrate domain and a polypeptide growth factor.
the invention disclosed in the application was based on research jeffrey hubbell and jason schense conducted while hubbell was a professor of chemical engineering at california institute of technology caltech and schense was obtaining his phd at the same institution.two other caltech researchers also assisted hubbell and are,thus,listed on the application as coinventors,andreas zisch and heike hall.because all of the named inventors were affiliated with caltech,the application is assigned to caltech.
hubbell left caltech and joined the faculty at eidgenossische technische hochschule zurich ethz in roughly five years before the application was filed.the application that issued as the patent was filed on december,and is based on research hubbell and schense conducted at ethz.the patent,entitled growth factor modified protein matrices for tissue engineering,issued on october,lists jeffrey hubbell,jason schense,and shelly sakiyama elbert as inventors,and is jointly assigned to ethz and universitat zurich.
claim of the patent recites 
a fusion protein,comprising 
i a first protein domain 
ii a second protein domain and 
iii an enzymatic or hydrolytic cleavage site between the first and second domains 
wherein the first domain is a growth factor selected from the group consisting of the platelet derived growth factor superfamily and the transforming growth factor beta tgf beta superfamily 
wherein the second domain is a crosslinking factor xiiia substrate domain 
wherein the enzymatic cleavage site is selected from the group consisting of proteolytic substrates and polysaccharide substrates,and 
wherein the hydrolytic cleavage site comprises a substrate with a linkage which undergoes hydrolysis by an acid or a base catalyzed reaction.
it is undisputed that,although the application and the patent have two inventors in common hubbell and schense they do not have identical inventive entities and have neither common owners nor common assignees 
procedural history 
the application at issue on appeal is a continuation of application the application,which was filed on december.the application shares the same title and same inventors as the application on appeal,and was likewise assigned to caltech.during prosecution of the application,the examiner rejected all of the pending claims based on double patenting over patent the patent and application,which issued as patent the patent on august.hubbell and schense are the named inventors on the and patents,and both patents were assigned to caltech.
in response to the examiner rejection,hubbell submitted two terminal disclaimers,amended certain claims,and added new claims.the examiner indicated that claims of the application were allowable,and hubbell cancelled the remaining claims.although the examiner issued a notice of allowance in june,hubbell failed to pay the issue fee within the statutory period,let the application go abandoned,and instead filed the application on august.
in a final office action dated october,the examiner rejected claims,and of the application for double patenting over the and patents,the application that issued as patent the patent to lutolf,et,and the application that issued as the patent application.in relevant part,the examiner found that the conflicting claims in the patent are a species of the instantly claimed invention and as such are encompassed by the claimed invention and thus anticipate the claimed invention.board decision,wl,at.lexis,at.hubbell appealed the rejections to the board.
on appeal,the board reversed the examiner double patenting rejection over the patent and affirmed the rejections over the,and patents.because hubbell indicated that he would file terminal disclaimers with respect to the and patents,the board summarily affirmed those rejections.that portion of the board decision is not at issue on appeal.
turning to the examiner rejection for double patenting over certain claims in the patent,the board agreed with the examiner that the claims of the patent anticipate representative claim.specifically,the board found that claim of the patent recites a protein that contains both of the features required in rejected claim a transglutaminase substrate domain the crosslinking factor xiiia substrate domain and a domain encoding a growth factor.board decision,wl,at.lexis,at.the board also noted that claim use of the term comprising allowed for inclusion of the additional elements recited in claim of the patent,including an enzymatic cleavage site not otherwise recited in claim.accordingly,the board found the double patenting rejection proper because the genus claim in the application was anticipated by issued claims directed to a species falling within that genus.
next,the board rejected hubbell argument that common ownership is a requirement for double patenting.it began its analysis by citing the manual of patent examining procedure mpep,which provides that d ouble patenting may exist between an issued patent and an application filed by the same inventive entity,or by a different inventive entity having a common inventor,by a common.mpep i a emphasis added.the board further relied on this court prior case law regarding double patenting in which we recognized a concern over potential harassment of an infringer by multiple assignees asserting essentially the same patented invention,even where there was no common ownership.board decision,wl,at.lexis,at citing in re van ornum,ccpa and in re fallaux.given this concern,the board concluded that common ownership is not required and that double patenting applied here because the patent and the application share two common inventors.hubbell timely appealed that issue to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.
discussion 
double patenting is a doctrine designed to prevent claims in separate applications or patents that do not recite the same invention,but nonetheless claim inventions so alike that granting both exclusive rights would effectively extend the life of patent protection.perricone medicis pharm,citation omitted.it prohibits the issuance of claims in a second patent that are not patentably distinct from the claims of the first patent.in re longi,citations omitted.a later patent claim is not patentably distinct from an earlier claim if the later claim is obvious over,or anticipated by,the earlier claim.eli lilly barr,citations omitted.
there are two justifications for double patenting.the first is to prevent unjustified timewise extension of the right to exclude granted by a patent no matter how the extension is brought about.van ornum,at quotation and citation omitted.the second rationale is to prevent multiple infringement suits by different assignees asserting essentially the same patented invention.fallaux,at recognizing that harassment by multiple assignees provides a second justification for double patenting see also chisum on patents b ii the possibility of multiple suits against an infringer by assignees of related patents has long been recognized as one of the concerns behind the doctrine of double patenting.double patenting is a question of law that we review de novo.in re emert.we review the board factual findings for substantial evidence.see in re gartside.
on appeal,hubbell does not dispute that claim of the patent anticipates representative claim of the application.instead,hubbell argues that double patenting should not apply where,as here,an application and a conflicting patent share common inventors but do not have identical inventive entities,were never commonly owned,and are not subject to a joint research agreement.in the alternative,if the court finds that an double patenting rejection is applicable,hubbell argues that either he should be allowed to file a terminal disclaimer as an equitable measure or that this court should employ a obviousness analysis for the rejected claims.
in response,the director argues that whether the application and patent were ever commonly owned is immaterial to the policy of preventing harassment by multiple assignees identity of inventors is not required where there is an overlap in the inventors hubbell has not established any grounds upon which he should be allowed to file a terminal disclaimer and hubbell is not entitled to a obviousness analysis because he admitted that he partially is responsible for the delay that caused the patent claims to issue first for the reasons explained below,we agree with the director on each point.
obviousness type double patenting 
the first issue on appeal is whether double patenting applies where an application and a conflicting patent have one or more inventors in common but the inventive entities are not identical and the applications were never commonly owned.although hubbell argues that this issue is one of first impression,the board found that the mpep specifically contemplates application of double patenting in these circumstances and this court prior case law supports application of double patenting in instances where there is no common ownership.we agree with the board.
first,as noted,the mpep provides that double patenting may exist between an issued patent and an application filed by the same inventive entity,or by a different inventive entity having a common inventor,by a common.mpep i a emphasis added.although the mpep is not binding on this court,we can take judicial notice of this provision to the extent it does not conflict with statutory text.enzo biochem,gen probe,stating that the pto guidelines governing its internal practice and the mpep are not binding on this court,but may be given judicial notice to the extent they do not conflict with the statute.as discussed below,moreover,the mpep standard is consistent with the rationale we have used to support application of double patenting rejections.
hubbell primary argument is that double patenting should never be applied in the absence of common ownership of the applications at issue.we have already rejected that contention.in van ornum,for example,our predecessor court affirmed an double patenting rejection over a patent with a common inventor,despite a lack of common ownership.in that case,as here,the claims in the application were generic to the species claims in the patents on which the double patenting rejection was based.van ornum,at.although the application and the patents shared a common inventive entity,the inventors assigned one of the patents to general motors and assigned the second patent,as well as the application at issue,to rockcor.id.at.because the application generic claims disclosed no additional invention or discovery other than what ha d already been claimed in the prior patents,the court concluded that the double patenting rejection was fully justified.id.at.the court further found that,because the application and conflicting patents were not commonly owned,the applicants could not file a terminal disclaimer to overcome the rejection.see id.at approving the common ownership requirement for terminal disclaimers set forth in.in reaching this conclusion,the court recognized the importance of preventing harassment of an alleged infringer by multiple assignees asserting essentially the same patented invention.
likewise,in fallaux,this court reaffirmed the multiple assignee harassment rationale and applied it to a situation where,as here,the patents were related to the application only by way of a common inventor.see fallaux,at the reference patents for the double patenting rejection on appeal the vogels patents are related to the fallaux application only by way of a single common inventor abraham bout.while this court noted that neither party raised the issue of whether a patent may be used as a reference for an double patenting rejection where it shares only a common inventor with the application,and cautioned that the opinion should not be read to decide or endorse the pto view on this issue,it concluded that the harassment justification for double patenting is particularly pertinent in such circumstances.id.at.the court also pointed out that the lack of common ownership in that case was of the applicant creation as through assignment it allowed ownership of the applications to be divided among different entities.id.at.
on appeal,hubbell argues that van ornum and fallaux are distinguishable because in those cases,unlike here,the applications at issue were once commonly owned.hubbell also contends that van ornum should be limited to its facts and that both van ornum and fallaux should be read as standing for the proposition that in situations where the complaining party is responsible for the divided assignment,issuance of the second patent is impermissible and barred by the public policy of harassment by multiple assignees.appellants br.citations omitted.according to hubbell,because caltech did not control the ownership of the patent and was not responsible for the divided assignment,double patenting should not apply.hubbell arguments are not.
it is undisputed that the patent is assigned to ethz and universitat zurich,whereas the application is assigned to caltech.while hubbell is correct that caltech was not responsible for the bifurcated assignment,the fact remains that,if hubbell rejected application claims were to issue,the potential for harassment by multiple assignees would exist because an infringer of claim of the patent would also infringe at least rejected claim.as such,there is a risk that a potential infringer could be subject to suit from both caltech and ethz and universitat zurich under their respective patents.the fact that hubbell controlled the assignment by moving from one institution to another does not alter this analysis.
although hubbell attempts to distinguish van ornum and fallaux on grounds that the applications involved in those cases were once commonly owned,this distinction does not alleviate the underlying harassment concerns here.as the director points out,the possibility of harassment by multiple assignees exists when issued patents lack common ownership.thus,whether the applications that led to the issued patents were ever commonly owned is irrelevant.appellee br.and,as we recognized in fallaux,the harassment justification is particularly pertinent in cases where,as here,the application and the conflicting patent are not commonly owned.
based on the foregoing,although hubbell argues that we should create a specific exception barring application of double patenting in instances where the conflicting claims share only common inventors,rather than common ownership,we see no valid basis for doing so.because it is undisputed that an infringer of the patent would also infringe the application,the multiple assignee harassment justification adopted in van ornum and reaffirmed in fallaux applies here,despite the lack of common ownership.
while not the thrust of his contentions on appeal,hubbell also seems to argue that double patenting should not apply where the overlap in inventorship is not complete,where the inventive entities are not identical in all respects.here,hubbell was the first named inventor on both the application and the patent and schense was the second.the had two other named inventors and the patent had one.it is undisputed that this overlap in inventorship is precisely the type of relationship that would give rise to double patenting under the mpep.hubbell does not explain why the mpep is wrong to treat cases,like his,where the overlap in inventorship is substantial any differently than cases where the overlap is complete.we too can find no reasoned basis to differentiate between cases involving identical inventive entities and those where the inventive entities are almost identical when assessing double patenting rejections.indeed,fallaux drew no such distinction and endorsed an double patenting rejection despite the absence of identity among inventors 
for these reasons,we reject hubbell request that we insist upon a complete identity of inventors or common ownership as a prerequisite to an double patenting rejection and find the board rejection to have been proper on the facts presented here.
terminal disclaimer 
in the alternative,hubbell argues that,if double patenting does apply,we should authorize him to file a terminal disclaimer and thus avoid any concern regarding undue extension of the rights granted in the patent.as a general rule,a terminal disclaimer filed to overcome an double patenting rejection is effective only where the application and conflicting patent are commonly owned.see fallaux,at if the fallaux application and the vogels patents were commonly owned,the terminal disclaimer filed in this case would have been effective to overcome the double patenting rejection.indeed,c specifically provides that a terminal disclaimer filed to obviate judicially created double patenting in a patent application must include a provision that any patent granted on that application shall be enforceable only for and during such period that said patent is commonly owned with the application or patent which formed the basis for the judicially created double patenting.c emphasis added.
recognizing that there is neither common ownership nor a common assignee here,hubbell points to the cooperative research and technology enhancement act of the create act,which amended c to provide that otherwise unrelated persons can be treated as common owners under the statute if they are parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the claimed invention was made the claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research agreement and the application for patent for the claimed invention discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to the joint research agreement.c a c.
because the application and the patent are not commonly owned and there is no joint research agreement between the assignees,hubbell reliance on the create act is misplaced.although hubbell argues that this court should ignore the joint research agreement requirement and nonetheless permit the filing of a terminal disclaimer,there is no statutory basis for doing so,and we decline hubbell invitation to rewrite the statutory text by creating a new equitable right to resort to terminal disclaimers.we conclude that,because hubbell does not qualify for a terminal disclaimer under the statute,he is not entitled to file one as an equitable measure.
two way obviousness analysis 
finally,hubbell argues that the rejected claims should be reconsidered under a obviousness analysis.as a general rule,a test applies to determine double patenting.in re berg.under that test,the examiner asks whether the application claims are obvious over the patent claims.id.in certain circumstances,however,a test may apply,wherein the examiner also asks whether the patent claims are obvious over the application claims.if not,the application claims later may be allowed.id.
the test,which is a narrow exception to the general rule of the test,arose out of the concern to 
prevent rejections for double patenting when the applicants filed first for a basic invention and later for an improvement,but,through no fault of the applicants,the pto decided the applications in the reverse order of filing,rejecting the basic application although it would have been allowed if the applications had been decided in the order of their filing.
id.we have explained that the test is appropriate only in the unusual circumstance where the pto is solely responsible for the delay in causing the application to issue prior to the first.id.at emphasis added.whether a or analysis applies is a question of law that we review without deference.in re basell poliolefine italia,citation omitted.
on appeal,hubbell argues that he is entitled to a obviousness analysis because the claims in the application and the claims in the patent could not have been filed together and on a balance,the pto was responsible for the claims in the patent issuing before the present claims.appellants br.in response,the director argues that a analysis is not applicable because hubbell can not establish that the pto is solely responsible for any delays associated with the claims on appeal.we again agree with the board.
first,during the hearing before the board,counsel specifically conceded that hubbell was partially responsible for the delay that caused the patent to issue before the application claims,ll.monheit so the pto shares responsibility.i not saying that we blameless.i just saying that there is shared responsibility.counsel also conceded that hubbell could have presented the claims at issue on appeal in december,but failed to do so until august.see,ll.judge fredman this is a situation where the pto prevented you from presenting these claims way back in or whatever it would been when you had the first case.monheit the earliest point that we could have presented the claims on appeal is when we filed that cip,which is in.this admission further supports the conclusion that the pto was not solely responsible for the delay.see eli lilly,at recognizing that an admission that the claim s could have been presented earlier indicates that the delay was not solely caused by the pto.
finally,the record reveals that,in june,the examiner allowed claims very similar to those at issue on appeal.rather than permitting those claims to issue,hubbell failed to pay the issue fee,let the application claims go abandoned,and filed the application in august these prosecution choices resulted in the foreseeable consequence that the patent issued before the application claims on appeal.given these circumstances,and because it is undisputed that the pto was not solely responsible for the delay,hubbell is not entitled to a obviousness analysis 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,and because we find that hubbell remaining arguments are without merit,we conclude that the board properly affirmed the examiner decision rejecting the pending application claims based on double patenting in view of the patent.accordingly,the board decision is affirmed.
in accordance with the law of double patenting,double patenting does not apply when the application and patent are of separate ownership and have separate inventive entities.in such situation the appropriate examination path is on the merits of the invention,or through the interference or derivation procedures,or other standard protocol as may apply in the particular situation.the technology here appears to involve generic and species inventions such separate developments are not unusual,and there exists extensive precedent to guide patentability.this court need not create a new protocol wherein the contributions of distinct entities and separate ownership are rejected for double patenting instead of examined under the established rules.
the court today not only finds double patenting when there is neither common inventorship nor common ownership,but having so found withholds the standard remedy of the terminal disclaimer,and simply denies the application.this novel ruling is contrary to statute and precedent,with no policy justification for changing the law.i respectfully dissent.
discussion 
in the entire body of precedent relating to rejection on the ground of double patenting,the rejected patents or applications were of common inventorship or common ownership.this is illustrated in early exam
