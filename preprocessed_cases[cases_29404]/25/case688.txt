background 
the sodium salt of s acid,commonly known as naproxen sodium,is a drug sold under various tradenames,including naprosyn and aleve.syntex corporation,the manufacturer of naprosyn,owned patent,directed to,inter alia,compositions and methods for treating inflammation,pain,pyrexia,and pruritus in mammals using substituted acid derivatives such as naproxen.in the,in preparation for the december,expiration of the patent,elan began development of a naproxen formulation for administration.in a letter dated august,kenneth mcvey,elan executive vice president for business planning and commercial development,wrote the following to michael forrest,vice president of lederle laboratories 
it was a pleasure to meet you and your colleagues on august,and i hope you found our discussions on naproxen of interest.
with regard to naproxen,i would like to confirm to you our licensing and development plans for our once daily tablet aimed at a launch in the by the patent expiry date.on product development,we plan to be in a position to file an by early,and believe that we will need a clinical program involving enrollment of patients and running for up to two years to generate the necessary data for filing.
on the licensing side,we are actively seeking a partner and believe lederle marketing strengths make you ideal in this respect.ideally,we want to have our partner determined this year so that they can actively participate in the planning of the clinical studies,even though elan would remain responsible for conducting them.
as i indicated to you,we see any license as involving two types of licensing fee in the form of recoverable advance royalties and a charge for the clinical program as patients become enrolled.on the former,the total licensing fee would be million dollars,payable 
i on contract signature,
ii on filing,
iii on filing,and 
iv on approval,
all recoverable against a running royalty by withholding of each payment due.
on the clinical side,we would ask for a payment of upon enrollment of each new patients,up to a maximum of million dollars.
finally,i would confirm that we would take responsibility for supplying bulk tablets with our objective being to achieve a price structure allowing you an initial gross margin based on current naproxen prices of not less than after taking into account our processing charge at current exchange rates,around x mg tablets,excluding cost,cost,packaging and royalty.
as i mentioned above,we would value having lederle as a partner in this project,and i look forward to having your decision in this matter and more detailed discussions on the contract in the near future.
elan andrx,d.findings of fact.over the following year,elan officers sent similar letters to schering laboratories,and wyeth ayerst laboratories.id.at.
on january,elan filed a patent application directed to a naproxen formulation,based on an irish priority application filed on january.id.at.after filing a series of continuation applications from that application,elan was issued patent on june.the patent includes one independent claim and sixteen dependent claims.claim reads as follows 
a naproxen formulation for oral administration comprising naproxen in a pellet form,each pellet having a core of naproxen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association with an organic acid,the naproxen or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the organic acid being present in a ratio of from to,and a membrane surrounding said core and containing a pharmaceutically acceptable,water insoluble polymer and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable,water soluble polymer and having a dissolution rate which when measured in vitro in a type dissolution basket apparatus according to pharmacopoeia xxi in phosphate buffer at ph and at corresponds to the following dissolution pattern 
a from to of the total naproxen is released after hour of measurement in said apparatus 
b from to of the total naproxen is released after hours of measurement in said apparatus and 
c not less than of the total naproxen is released after a total of hours of measurement in said apparatus.
in,elan filed a new drug application nda at the food and drug administration fda,directed to its formulation.findings of fact,slip op.at.the fda approved the nda on january,and elan launched the approved formulation under the tradename naprelan in april.
in,andrx submitted an abbreviated new drug application anda under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat,at the fda,seeking approval to market its own naproxen formulation.elan then sued andrx for infringement of the patent under e a.andrx defended by arguing that elan patent is invalid under the bar of b as a result of its having offered to supply the patented tablets to lederle,schering,and wyeth,as well as having advertised in a article the scrip article that it had developed a naproxen formulation.
the district court found that,although elan scrip article did not start the running of the clock for the bar,its letter offering to supply tablets to lederle did do so.the court noted that that letter had included a price term and referred to a proposed contract.the court also concluded that the formulation that elan had offered to supply to lederle was ready for patenting and was the same composition that was eventually claimed.
elan now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
on appeal,elan argues that the district court erred by holding the patent invalid under the bar.according to elan,the plain language of the letter and the unrebutted testimony of both the letter author and its recipient establish that the letter was not a definite offer,but merely an initial inquiry into whether lederle would be interested in further discussions about a potential licensing and development project for a product that had not yet been developed and that could not be marketed until at least six years later.elan explains that an offer to license an invention is not an offer for sale under b and that its letter to lederle lacked the hallmarks of a commercial offer,such as mention of prices,quantities,time and place of delivery,and product specifications.elan also asserts that the processing charge estimate in the lederle letter was not a price quote.
elan further contends that the court made numerous other errors of law,including failing to construe any of the claims of the patent failing to address the validity of each claim individually placing the burden on elan to prove that the letter did not concern subject matter within the scope of the claims,rather than on andrx to provide clear and convincing evidence that it did and concluding that the subject matter of each claim of the patent was complete and ready for patenting at the time of the lederle letter.indeed,elan asserts that the formulation was experimental only and was changed significantly before elan arrived at the final formulation that it ultimately marketed.elan also points out that the lederle letter itself states that elan was not yet in a position to file an investigational new drug ind application in.
andrx responds by arguing that elan has mischaracterized the invalidating commercialization of its product as use.according to andrx,elan letter to lederle offered the patented product in bulk at a specified price,and there were at least nine other instances of offers public uses prior to the critical date.andrx also argues that the district court decision was firmly based on the applicable case law and correct findings of fact.according to andrx,elan theory that the lederle letter does not concern the patented product is raised for the first time on appeal and elan manufactured more than kg of its patented naproxen sodium beads in
