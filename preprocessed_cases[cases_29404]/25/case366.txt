in,the president of the united states ordered a missile strike against a pharmaceutical plant in sudan that he believed was connected to the terrorist activities of osama bin laden.the owners of the plant sued the united states,challenging several allegedly defamatory statements made by senior executive branch officials justifying the strike as well as the government failure to compensate them for the destruction of the plant.the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint,and we affirm on the ground that it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
because we are asked to review the grant of a motion to dismiss,we treat the factual allegations in the complaint as true.leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d.in august,the terrorist network led by osama bin laden bombed american embassies in kenya and tanzania.days later,the united states responded with a missile strike against a pharmaceutical plant in north khartoum,sudan,owned by plaintiffs pharmaceutical industries company elshifa and salah el din ahmed mohammed idris.
president clinton justified the attack by publicly claiming that the plant was a terrorists base of operation and associated with the bin laden network.consistent with this claim,executive branch officials also stated their belief that bin laden financed the plant,which was owned by the sudan military industrial complex corporation,made no commercial products,and,most ominously,was involved in the production of chemical weapons.to support this latter accusation,the officials pointed to a soil sample from the plant that included a chemical known as oethylmethyl phosphonothioic acid,referred to as empta,which is used in the manufacture of nerve gas.
plaintiffs allege the clinton administration was wrong on all counts about its justifications for striking the plant.neither bin laden nor the sudan military industrial complex corporation had ties to the plant,no chemical weapons agents such as empta were ever present,and the plant produced only medicinal products,including over half the pharmaceuticals used in sudan.
once they learned that their initial justifications for the attack were false,clinton administration officials offered a new explanation that portrayed idris,the actual owner of the plant,as a friend and supporter of terrorists.in particular,and as reported in several newspapers,anonymous executive branch officials claimed idris was linked to bin laden.the washington post,for example,reported one official as saying,what we learning about idris leads us to suspect that he involved in money laundering,that he involved in representing a lot of bin laden interests in sudan.vernon loeb bradley graham,sudan plant was probed months before attack.postt,at.according to plaintiffs,these statements were false.
plaintiffs took several actions to recoup their losses from the attack.they first filed a lawsuit in the united states court of federal claims seeking million as just compensation under the takings clause of the constitution.the court dismissed the suit as nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine and the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed.see pharm.indus.united states.plaintiffs also filed an administrative claim with the central intelligence agency cia under the federal tort claims act ftca,seeking compensation for the destruction of the plant as well as a retraction of the allegedly defamatory statements about and idris.
after the cia denied the claim,plaintiffs filed this action against the united states under the ftca seeking at least million in damages for the government alleged negligence and trespass in carrying out the attack.at issue on appeal are two further claims.the plaintiffs also sought declaratory judgments that the statements linking them to osama bin laden,international terrorist organizations and the production of chemical weapons were false and that the government refusal to compensate them for the attack violated the law of nations.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,see.b,concluding that sovereign immunity barred all of plaintiffs claims.pharm.indus.united states,d.the court also noted that the complaint likely present ed a nonjusticiable political question.id.at.plaintiffs filed a motion to alter the judgment with respect to their claims for equitable relief,which the district court denied.pharm.indus.united states,wl.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge only the dismissal of their claims for equitable relief for defamation and under the law of nations.they restrict their defamation claim to statements about idris and their law of nations claim to the refusal to pay compensation for the attack.we have jurisdiction under,and we review the district court grant of the motion to dismiss de novo,see carter.metro.area transit.
the government urges us to affirm the district court dismissal of this case on the ground that it presents a nonjusticiable political question.because we affirm on this basis,we do not address the government other arguments.see nemariam fed.democratic republic of.
early in the nation history,chief justice john marshall,in seminal words that shaped the development of the political question doctrine,explained that the limited authority the constitution grants to the judiciary to resolve disputes does not extend to all complaints about the actions of the executive 
the province of the court is,solely,to decide on the rights of individuals,not to enquire how the executive,or executive officers,perform duties in which they have a discretion.questions,in their nature political,or which are,by the constitution and laws,submitted to the executive,can never be made in this court.
marbury madison,cranch.in baker carr,d,the supreme court explained that the political question doctrine precludes courts from considering cases that involve 
a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
id.at.as baker first factor indicates,the doctrine is primarily a function of the separation of powers,id.at,and prohibits the judiciary from reviewing policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of congress or the confines of the executive branch,japan whaling ass am.cetacean soc y,d emphasis added.
disputes involving national security and foreign policy decisions are quintessential sources of political questions.bancoult mcnamara.the constitution places these policy decisions in the hands of the president and the judiciary.see oetjen cent.leather.the conduct of the foreign relations of our government is committed by the constitution to the executive and legislative the political departments of the government,and the propriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political power is not subject to judicial inquiry or decision.schneider kissinger,t here could be no doubt that in the fields of foreign policy and national security is textually committed to the political branches of government.comm.of citizens living in nicar.reagan,noting that foreign policy decisions are the subject of a textual commitment.
even though it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance,baker,at,the political question doctrine looms over plaintiffs claims,this being a case that arises out of a decision to launch a military attack.we begin our analysis with a proposition upon which both parties agree it is not for the federal courts to review the president battlefield decisions.appellee br.appellants reply br.see gilligan morgan,d bancoult,at luftig mcnamara,per curiam.president clinton,in his capacity as,fired missiles at a target of his choosing to pursue a military objective he had determined was in the national interest.under the constitution,this decision is immune from judicial review.
although plaintiffs attempt to distance their law of nations and defamation claims from the nonjusticiable question of why the president ordered the missile strike,both claims nonetheless present questions inextricably intertwined with the underlying decision to attack the elshifa pharmaceutical plant.plaintiffs law of nations claim asserts that under customary international law a state must compensate a foreign national for the unjustified destruction of property.plaintiffs allege the united states violated this principle by failing to compensate them for the destruction of their plant.in passing judgment on this claim,the district court could not avoid becoming arbiter of the president battlefield actions and would need to determine whether his decision to bomb the plant was justified.see appellants reply br.acknowledging this issue could require the court to consider whether was,in fact,a chemical weapons facility.
this a court can not do.we have consistently held that courts are not a forum for the merits of foreign policy and national security decisions textually committed to the political branches.see kissinger,dismissing a suit concerning alleged unlawful assistance to the pinochet regime because the challenged actions were inextricably intertwined with the underlying foreign policy decisions constitutionally committed to the political branches quoting bancoult,at see also harbury hayden,dismissing a suit against american officials alleged to have unlawfully conspired with the guatemalan army because it sought a determination whether the alleged conduct should have occurred,which impermissibly would require examining the wisdom of the underlying policies bancoult,at dismissing a suit challenging the tactical measures allegedly taken in depopulating island territories to build a naval base because the measures were inextricably intertwined with an exercise of the foreign policy and national security powers entrusted to the political branches schneider,at dismissing a suit alleging that the united states assisted in the kidnapping,torture,and death of a chilean general during the cold war because it challenged a foreign policy decision textually committed to the political branches.this precedent controls our decision here.plaintiffs law of nations claim asks us to review whether the president was justified in striking the elshifa plant.courts have no business hearing such claims 
plaintiffs defamation claim suffers from a similar flaw.the complaint plainly acknowledges that executive branch officials offered the allegedly defamatory statements in justification of the president decision to attack the plant.compl.stating the action arises out of false and defamatory statements made by united states government officials seeking to justify the destruction of the pharmaceutical plant id.concluding that officials offered these statements as a new justification for their attack.consider the review the district court would need to undertake in ruling on this claim.to prevail in their defamation suit,the plaintiffs must show that the statements made to justify the attack were false.see generally restatement second of torts.the district court,then,could not avoid the question whether idris was in fact associated with bin laden,meaning a judicial decision for the plaintiffs would directly contradict the clinton administration ultimate stated justification for launching the missile strike.
the dissent notes that this allegedly defamatory justification came after the plant was bombed and thus argues that the plaintiffs claim would not call into question the president true motivations for launching the missile strike.see dissenting op.at.but both idris and the dissent admit that the challenged statements were offered in justification of the decision to bomb the plant.see id.at citing compl.we have no trouble concluding that the president public justifications for discrete military action are always offered,in part at least,with strategic military,national security,or foreign policy objectives in mind.the making of such justifications is itself a policy decision that can not be separated from the conduct of foreign relations and the exercise of the war power that it explains.see appellee br.p ublic statements about the bombing are closely intertwined with the decision to launch the military strike.accordingly,we conclude that a decision on the defamation claim would necessarily cross the barrier marked by the political question doctrine.see schneider,at t here could be no doubt that in the fields of foreign policy and national security is textually committed to the political branches of government.wilson libby,holding that the political question doctrine did not apply in a case involving disclosures made by executive branch officials when speaking with the press because plaintiffs did not challenge any foreign policy or national security decisions 
the dissent responds by arguing that judicial review of the allegedly defamatory statements about idris is no more of an intrusion upon the executive national security decisions than is judicial review of,for example,an enemy combatant determination,which the political question doctrine does not forbid.see dissenting op.at citing boumediene bush,d parhat gates,chai dep t of state,von zedtwitz sutherland.but none of the cases cited by the dissent involved a textual commitment of authority to the political branches.boumediene found in the suspension clause a textual commitment to the judiciary of authority to review enemy combatant determinations resulting in prolonged detention.see.at.likewise,in parhat chai and von zedtwitz we were not called upon to scrutinize decisions textually committed to a coordinate branch of government.in raising these cases,the dissent presents an interesting question concerning the boundary between decisions properly made by the judiciary and decisions constitutionally committed to the political branches.fortunately,we need not decide where that boundary lies.plaintiffs defamation claim presents a challenge to the executive foreign policy and national security decisionmaking,two areas clearly outside our authority.
we conclude that this case presents a nonjusticiable political question.the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs claims is 
salah el din ahmed mohammed idris and the pharmaceutical industries company,which idris allegedly owns,sued the united states following a missile strike against the company plant in sudan.the plaintiffs advanced several claims,only two of which remain at issue in this appeal.the court holds both claims must be dismissed because they raise questions constitutionally committed not to the judicial but to the political branches,the alternative ground raised by the government in the district court.
i agree that the claim the united states violated the law of nations in striking the plant and failing to pay the plaintiffs compensation should be dismissed,but i do so because the plaintiffs did not preserve that claim we therefore have no need to pass upon a constitutional issue.i believe the claim that various officers of the united states defamed idris in the wake of the strike should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings the complaint,which the government has not yet answered,does not necessarily raise a political question and may be subject to objections that do not require us to reach the constitutional issue.
i.the law of nations claim 
the plaintiffs first allege the united states violated international law by destroy ing the plant without justification,compl,and by failing to use peaceful means to resolve its concerns,id,in contravention of the prohibition on the use of force in the charter of the united nations,id.the breach of this international obligation,they say,triggers the responsibility of the united states to compensate them.id.the plaintiffs accordingly seek a declaration that the attack on the elshifa pharmaceutical plant violated the law of nations,which declaration they say would restore the reputations of elshifa and idris by dispelling the suspicion that they were engaged in the production of chemical weapons or other activities associated with terrorism,id.
the district court dismissed the claim as barred by sovereign immunity,see cohens virginia,wheat.a sovereign independent state is not suable,except by its own consent see also united states lee,without reaching the government alternative argument for dismissal based upon the constitutional bar to judicial resolution of a political question.although the plaintiffs sued only the united states,they invoked of the administrative procedures act,which provides a waiver of immunity for any suit against the united states seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority,regardless whether the suit is brought under the apa,trudeau ftc.the district court held the waiver in the apa inapplicable,however,because the plaintiffs law of nations claim sought to impugn only the president decision to strike the plant and the president is not an agency within the meaning of the apa.d,see dalton specter,d.
on appeal,the plaintiffs do not take issue with the ruling that the waiver of sovereign immunity in is inapplicable insofar as they alleged the strike against the plant violated international law.their opening brief states frankly plaintiffs no longer seek a declaration that the destruction of the plant violated international law.in that respect,therefore,their claim is waived and there is no need for the court to reach the constitutional question whether the claim is barred by the political question doctrine.see meijer,biovail.
the plaintiffs do argue on appeal,however,as they did before the district court on motion to alter the judgment,that they were challenging not only the president decision to strike the plant but also the cia independent and final decision to deny compensation based on evidence about the plant.the waiver of sovereign immunity in the apa does apply to this claim because the cia clearly is an agency.
the claim nonetheless must be dismissed because the complaint faults the government for failing to compensate the plaintiffs only upon the premise that the destruction of the plant was not justified under the law of nations.see compl.having waived the argument that the strike against the plant violated the law of nations,the plaintiffs necessarily forfeited their challenge to the cia failure to compensate them.accordingly,we have neither the need nor the occasion to address the government argument that the plaintiffs law of nations claim raises a political question.
ii.the claim for defamation 
the second claim before us on appeal is that certain officers of the united states defamed idris,giving rise to a cause of action against the united states under both the common law and the apa.it is worth repeating idris allegations because,as the court notes,we must treat the factual allegations in the complaint as true.op.at.
according to idris president clinton and various government officials initially justified the attack to the public on the ground that the plant,which was owned by the sudanese government,was a chemical facility involved in the manufacture of empta,compl.in sudan,they are manufacturing nerve gas which could kill us all,had no commercial purpose,id,and enjoyed the suspicious protection of the sudanese military,id.moreover,a senior intelligence officer reported on the day of the strike that osama bin laden has made financial contributions to the sudanese military industrial complex a distinct entity of which,we believe,the shifa pharmaceutical facility is a part,id.thus,t he officials who authorized the attack did not know idris owned at the time of the attack.id.within a few days after the strike,however,the press began to identify him as the owner of the plant,id,and officials began to retract the public statements made initially in justification for the strike.r ather than admit that a terrible mistake was made officials invent ed new justifications for striking the plant.id.officials claimed falsely and with reckless disregard for the truth that,among other things,idris is a financial supporter of the national islamic front evidence obtained since the attack suggest s that idris purchased the plant on bin laden behalf idris represent s a lot of bin laden interests in sudan and idris has had financial dealings with members of islamic jihad and launders money for international islamic groups.id.as with the law of nations claim,idris sought declaratory relief and argued the apa provided the requisite waiver of sovereign immunity.
the district court dismissed the defamation claim because it erroneously read the complaint to seek damages,and therefore to be subject to the federal tort claims act,which does not waive sovereign immunity for claims of defamation seeking damages.d at citing h.in his motion to alter the judgment idris pointed to the waiver in the apa for suits seeking declaratory relief.the court denied the motion,again without reaching the government alternative argument that the case presented a political question,this time on the ground there had been no final agency action,as required by of the apa.no,wl,at.
in ruling upon the motion,the district court again erred first,the cia had denied idris request for a retraction,which certainly seems to be final agency action.see yousuf samantar.in any event,t he waiver in of the apa applies regardless of whether the challenged conduct constitutes final agency action.trudeau,at.finally,the requirement of final agency action in limits only causes of action arising under the apa itself,id.at here idris invoked both the apa and the common law of defamation.
today the court affirms the district court erroneous dismissal of idris claim for defamation on the different but inapposite constitutional ground that the allegedly defamatory statements are inextricably intertwined with the underlying decision to attack the pharmaceutical plant.op.at.the court first asserts that idris defamation claim suffers from a flaw similar to that of his claim under international law.id.at.the claim based upon international law,according to the court,presents a political question because in adjudicating it,the district court would need to determine whether the president decision to bomb the plant was justified.id.at.apparently,however,the court does not,it could not the district court,in adjudicating the defamation claim,would necessarily call into question the president decision idris contends the cia statements came after and had nothing to do with the president reason for bombing the plant.see id.at bill clinton,my life.instead,the court reasons that,even if idris claim would not call into question the president true motivations for launching the missile strike,it is nevertheless barred by the political question doctrine because the cia post hoc justification may implicate other strategic military,national security,or foreign policy objectives of the president.op.at.in other words,the post hoc justification was itself a strategic military and foreign policy decision and therefore not subject to judicial review.
the court,however,merely speculates that strategic objectives were served by the cia post hoc statements about idris.for support the court first musters the assertion that public justifications for discrete military action are always offered,in part at least,with strategic objectives in mind.id.if,however,the allegedly defamatory statements themselves furthered the president conduct of military affairs,then surely the government would explain how.
the government offers no such explanation in support of its motion to dismiss and therefore i am at a loss to understand why the court struggles to create one for it.in order to imply the government has explained how the cia
