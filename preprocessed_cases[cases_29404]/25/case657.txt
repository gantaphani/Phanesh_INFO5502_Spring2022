breckenridge pharmaceutical,breckenridge appeals the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of florida dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction its claims of tortious interference,unfair competition,and declaratory judgment of against patent holder,metabolite laboratories,metabolite.breckenridge,metabolite,d breckenridge.breckenridge also appeals the district court subsequent grant of summary judgment on all claims to pamlab,pamlab,the exclusive licensee of the patents at issue.breckenridge,metabolite.may,pamlab.the district court held that the claims could not proceed without metabolite,an indispensable party,and that the state law claims were preempted under federal circuit law.id.because the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over metabolite,and because there are genuine disputes of material fact with respect to the state law claims,the district court incorrectly dismissed metabolite and granted summary judgment to pamlab.therefore,we reverse the dismissal of metabolite,vacate the grant of summary judgment to pamlab,and remand.
metabolite,a colorado corporation,is the holder of patents for a method of controlling hyperhomocysteinemia,a condition involving elevated serum metabolite levels,which is an emerging risk factor for heart and vascular disease,and its principal business involves licensing its patents to pharmaceutical manufacturing companies.through an exclusive license of the metabolite patents,pamlab,a louisiana corporation,manufactures and distributes a vitamin product containing a specific formulation of,folic acid and marketed as foltx,which it promotes to doctors and clinicians throughout the country.breckenridge,a generic drug company headquartered in florida,manufactures a similar product,marketed as folbee,which it sells to large pharmacies and walgreens,eckerd,and rite a substitute for foltx.
on december,metabolite and pamlab filed suit in the united states district court for the district of colorado alleging that breckenridge had infringed the metabolite patents by offering to sell folbee to drug wholesalers and retailers as a generic equivalent to foltx.following the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order tro on december,the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the suit.
several weeks later,metabolite,in cooperation with pamlab sent between ten and twenty letters to vitamin distributors and retailers informing them of the metabolite patents and pamlab exclusive license.three letters were sent to customers of breckenridge in florida publix super markets,eckerd,and.the letters did not name breckenridge or threaten a lawsuit for infringement.the letters stated in relevant part 
o ne or more small generic drug companies are offering generic equivalents to foltx.as the patent owner,metabolite wanted to alert you to the patent coverage on foltx.we would urge you to consult with your patent attorney before entering into any arrangements for the distribution,dispensing or substitution of these generic equivalents in place of a legitimate prescription or order for foltx.
metabolite enclosed a pamlab brochure that contained pamlab contact information but did not contain pricing or order forms.
on january,about eight days after learning of the letters,breckenridge filed suit against metabolite and pamlab in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,seeking declaratory judgment of and alleging state law claims of tortious interference and unfair competition.metabolite moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and,on december,following jurisdictional discovery,the district court granted the motion.on may,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pamlab on all claims.breckenridge challenges both rulings in separate appeals,which we have consolidated.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
where a defendant is not subject to general jurisdiction in the forum state,a district court may nonetheless exercise specific jurisdiction over the defendant if the cause of action arises out of or relates to the defendant activity.burger king rudzewicz,d.in determining whether specific jurisdiction may be exercised over a defendant,a district court must undertake a inquiry.first,the state statute must permit service of process on the defendant.see.e,k a.second,the exercise of personal jurisdiction must satisfy due process requirements.burger king,at.the due process clause requires that there exist sufficient minimum contacts such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.at.
on appeal,breckenridge asserts that two subsections of the florida statute permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction over metabolite subsection b authorizes jurisdiction over a party that c ommit s a tortious act within this state,and subsection f authorizes jurisdiction over a party that c aus es injury to persons or property within this state arising out of an act or omission by the defendant outside this state,if,at or about the time of the injury.the defendant was engaged in solicitation or service activities within this state.stat.b,f.
the district court held that metabolite contacts with florida satisfied subsection f of the florida statute.we agree.the district court correctly concluded that there was no jurisdiction under b because metabolite letters into florida may qualify as protected communications under federal patent law and thus may not be tortious.see globetrotter software,elan computer group,the federal patent laws preempt state laws that impose tort liability for a patentholder good faith conduct in communications asserting infringement of its patent and warning about potential litigation.with respect to subsection f,the court correctly concluded that the letters could be construed as solicitations,because they described the foltx product and pamlab exclusive license,and enclosed pamlab promotional materials.because breckenridge alleges that the letters caused injury in florida,the requirements of subsection f are met.accordingly,the district court correctly determined that metabolite would be subject to personal jurisdiction if consistent with due process.
the issue of personal jurisdiction in a declaratory action for is intimately related to patent law and thus governed by federal circuit law regarding due process.silent drive,strong.where a suit involves both patent and claims,federal circuit law regarding due process also applies to the question of personal jurisdiction on claims if the resolution of the patent infringement issue will be a significant factor in determining liability under the claims,aarotech.a court must inquire whether the defendant has purposefully directed his activities at the forum state and,if so,whether the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.burger king,at.then,to defeat jurisdiction,the burden of proof shifts to the defendant,which must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.id.at.
breckenridge argues that the district court erred by applying federal circuit law rather than eleventh circuit law to the question of personal jurisdiction with respect to the state law tort claims,and argues that this choice of law question is important.whereas the federal circuit provides that a patent owner may,without more,send cease and desist letters to a suspected infringer,or its customers,without being subjected to personal jurisdiction in the suspected infringer home state,see,akro luker,citing various district court cases,the eleventh circuit does not appear to have a similar 
here,the district court correctly applied federal circuit law governing personal jurisdiction to all claims because the question of infringement is a critical factor in determining liability under the claims,at.see also silent drive,at applying regional circuit law to claims where analysis with respect to counts is not intimately linked to patent law elecs.for imaging,coyle,applying regional circuit law where facts underlying claims were not intimately involved with facts relating to declaratory action of.
to establish a claim of tortious interference under florida law,breckenridge must prove the existence of business relationships between breckenridge and the letter recipients defendants knowledge of those business relationships defendants intentional and unjustified interference with those business relationships and damages because of defendants interference.gossard adia,so d.a claim of unfair competition in florida arises under the common law and,while elusive of precise definition,requires a plaintiff to prove,at minimum,competition and unfairness.practice mgmt,old dominion ins,so d.as the district court correctly noted,metabolite letters would neither be unjustifiable nor unfair if the implication of infringement contained therein is true.accordingly,because the issues in this case are intimately linked to patent law,federal circuit law regarding due process must be applied to the question of personal jurisdiction over metabolite with respect to all claims.
the next question,then,is whether,under federal circuit law,the exercise of personal jurisdiction over metabolite satisfies the requirements of due process.this court employs a test,in which we determine whether the defendant purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum,the claim arises out of or relates to those activities,and assertion of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and fair.akro,at.with respect to the last prong,the burden of proof is on the defendant,which must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable under the test articulated by the supreme court in burger king.id.quoting burger king,at.
the district court held that quite clear federal circuit precedent established that,where a letter makes only a cursory attempt at soliciting business,principles of fair play and substantial justice defeat the reasonableness of jurisdiction in a declaratory action for breckenridge,d at citing silent drive,at hildebrand steck,red wing shoe.the district court found that because i n this case,metabolite has no other contacts with florida,other than its three attorney letters,the court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over metabolite.id.
the district court correctly stated this court law that personal jurisdiction may not be exercised constitutionally when the defendant contact with the forum state is limited to cease and desist letters,without more.red wing shoe,at.however,the district court erred in concluding that metabolite attorney letters represented the extent of its contacts with florida.in several prior decisions,we have attempted to clarify what other activities permit a district court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant in compliance with due process,but cases like the present indicate that there is a need in the district courts for clearer guidance on this issue.
in silent drive,plaintiff silent drive,an iowa corporation,sought jurisdiction over the defendant,a texas corporation with its principal place of business in texas,in iowa federal district court in a declaratory action for.at.the defendant sent two letters to silent drive informing it of an injunction obtained in texas and enclosed a copy of its patent for academic purposes only.id.at.there was no license agreement at issue in silent drive.in addition to the cease and desist letters,the defendant only contact with iowa was that it had issued a news release describing the injunction and patent and sent a copy of the news release to a potential customer of silent drive in iowa.id.at.we concluded that due process requirements were not satisfied because the letters primarily were related to the injunction,which was obtained for misappropriation of trade secrets and was unrelated to the patent at issue id.at.
in hildebrand,the plaintiff,a colorado resident,filed a patent infringement suit against the defendants,all ohio corporations,in colorado federal district court.at.because one week earlier,one of the defendants had filed an action for declaratory judgment of,invalidity,and tortious interference in ohio federal district court,the colorado district court granted that defendant motion to dismiss in colorado and transfer the case to ohio.id.the ohio district court determined that it had personal jurisdiction over hildebrand,and we reversed.id.at.there was no license agreement at issue in hildebrand.hildebrand contacts with ohio,in addition to the cease and desist letters,were that he had attempted to negotiate license agreements with two of the defendants id.at.we held that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over hildebrand would be unconstitutional because a ll of the contacts were for the purpose of warning against infringement or negotiating license agreements,and he lacked a binding obligation in the forum.id.at.
in red wing shoe,the plaintiff,a minnesota corporation,sought jurisdiction over defendant louisiana corporation in minnesota federal district court in an action for declaratory judgment of,invalidity,and unenforceability.at.the defendant sent red wing shoe a series of letters alleging infringement and offering a license.id.in addition,the defendant had licensees,all of which sold products in minnesota and six of which maintained retail stores in minnesota or possessed a minnesota business registration.id.at.the defendant received royalty income from its licensees for sales made in minnesota,but exercise d no control over the sales activities of its licensees and,indeed had no dealings with its licensees in minnesota.id.at.we held that the mere receipt of royalty income from sales in the forum state was insufficient to ground personal jurisdiction.id.at volkswagen woodson,d f inancial benefits accruing to the defendant from a collateral relation to the forum state will not support jurisdiction if they do not stem from a constitutionally cognizable contact with that state.we explained that,because the defendant had no relationship with its licensees beyond the receipt of royalty income,the minnesota activities of the defendant licensees were essentially unilateral and could not be attributed to the defendant.id.at.we concluded that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant in red wing shoe would not comport with principles of fairness.id.at.
in contrast,we found due process requirements to be satisfied in akro.over a course of three years,the defendant,a california resident,sent cease and desist letters to akro in ohio,the forum state,which indicated that the defendant had entered into an exclusive license agreement with one of akro competitors,also an ohio corporation.at.the license agreement,in addition to specifying royalty payment terms,granted the licensee the power to litigate infringement suits on the defendant behalf and also required the defendant to defend and pursue any infringements against his patent.id.at.in explaining why personal jurisdiction was proper,we first reasoned that,in determining the scope of the defendant contacts with the forum state,the plaintiff need not be the forum resident toward whom any,much less all,of the defendant relevant activities were purposefully directed.id.at citing calder jones,d keeton hustler magazine,d.thus,we looked to the defendant relationship with its exclusive licensee to determine the extent of the defendant forum state contacts.we found that,by virtue of the license agreement terms regarding infringement litigation,the defendant in akro the license agreement continuing obligations in the forum state.id.at.because the license agreement in akro obligated the defendant beyond the mere receipt of royalty income,we found akro distinguishable from red wing shoe.indeed,given those facts,we held that it could scarcely be more clear that the defendant purposefully directed activities at residents of ohio within the meaning of the due process inquiry.id.
in genetic implant systems,we clarified the holding in akro and explained that a defendant obligations under an exclusive license agreement may subject it to personal jurisdiction in the forum state even if the licensee is not incorporated or headquartered in the forum state,so long as the exclusive licensee conducts business there.the defendant in genetic implant had sold the patented product directly in the state of washington until the issuance of its patent,at which time it entered into an exclusive distribution and marketing agreement with a delaware corporation that continued to sell the patented product in washington.id.at.the defendant sent three letters to an accused infringer in washington,and the accused infringer sought a declaratory judgment of in washington federal district court.id.
as in akro,we concluded that personal jurisdiction over the defendant was proper.id.first,we stated that,although the defendant relationship was with an exclusive distributor rather than an exclusive licensee,t he appointment of a distributor to sell a product covered by a patent is analogous to a grant of a patent license in that the agreement surrender s the patentee right to exclude the distributor under the patent.id.at.then,in analyzing the defendant contacts with washington,we emphasized as most significant the defendant arrangement with its distributor and the distributor product sales in the state.id.at.we noted that,as in akro,the agreement between the patentee and distributor in genetic implant created a relationship beyond the payment of royalties.although the defendant retained the sole right to pursue patent infringement claims,the defendant agreed to indemnify the distributor for liability arising from any third party patent infringement action related to the distributor sale,use,or making of the covered products,and authorized the distributor to use its trademarks in marketing and distribution.id.at.in addition,we noted that the defendant had itself conducted business in the forum state prior to entering into the exclusive distributorship agreement,and had developed a valuable customer base and generated goodwill through advertising and educational initiatives that potentially enhanced the future sales of its exclusive distributor.id.at.
finally,we acknowledged that the case differed from akro in that the distributor in genetic implant was not headquartered in the forum state.id.at.however,we explained that the distinction between and distributors is not tenable the distributor is present in washington in the sense that it promotes and sells the patented products in the state thus,it is transacting business.id.as such,we concluded that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant comported with due process requirements.
in sum,our case law has held as follows where a defendant has sent cease and desist letters into a forum state that primarily involve a legal dispute unrelated to the patent at issue,such as an injunction obtained for misappropriation of trade secrets,the exercise of personal jurisdiction is improper.silent drive,at.likewise,a defendant may not be subjected to personal jurisdiction if its only additional activities in the forum state involve unsuccessful attempts to license the patent there.hildebrand,at.the same is true where the defendant has successfully licensed the patent in the forum state,even to multiple licensees,but does not,for example,exercise control over the licensees sales activities and,instead,has no dealings with those licensees beyond the receipt of royalty income.red wing shoe,at.
in contrast,the defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in the forum state by virtue of its relationship with its exclusive forum state licensee if the license agreement,for example,requires the,and grants the licensee the right,to litigate infringement claims.akro,at.finally,the defendant will also be subject to personal jurisdiction in the forum state if the exclusive licensee or licensee equivalent with which it has established a relationship is not headquartered in the forum state,but nonetheless conducts business there.genetic implant,at.
thus,the crux of the due process inquiry should focus first on whether the defendant has had contact with parties in the forum state beyond the sending of cease and desist letters or mere attempts to license the patent at issue there.where a has a relationship with an exclusive licensee headquartered or doing business in the forum state,the inquiry requires close examination of the license agreement.in particular,our case law requires that the license agreement contemplate a relationship beyond royalty or payment,such as granting both parties the right to litigate infringement cases or granting the licensor the right to exercise control over the licensee sales or marketing activities.
here,in addition to sending letters into the forum state,which we presume qualify as cease and desist letters metabolite has entered into an exclusive license with pamlab,a company that,while not headquartered or incorporated in florida,conducts business in florida.as part of the license agreement,metabolite granted pamlab the right to sue for patent infringement with metabolite written consent,and the parties agreed to discuss in good faith the appropriate action,if any,with respect to third party infringers of the licensed patents,and to cooperate reasonably in any enforcement actions.metabolite granted pamlab full control of the prosecution or maintenance of any patent or application that metabolite abandons or permits to lapse and agreed to provide pamlab with an executed power of attorney for that purpose.metabolite further agreed to provide consultation to pamlab in the science,medicine and marketing of vitamins and related products,from time to time.
that this exclusive license agreement not only contemplated an ongoing relationship between pamlab and metabolite beyond royalty payments but has actually resulted in such a relationship is obvious from the facts of this case.metabolite coordinates with pamlab in sending cease and desist letters and in litigating infringement claims in florida and elsewhere and,as is the case here,licensor and licensee are often represented jointly by counsel.as such,we hold that,through its relationship with pamlab,which sells products in florida,metabolite has purposefully availed itself to the privilege of conducting activities within florida.
finally,we turn to the third prong of the akro test whether metabolite has provided a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction over it would offend principles of fair play and substantial justice.see akro,at.the supreme court has provided a list of five factors to consider in determining the fairness of asserting personal jurisdiction over a defendant,consisting of the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.burger king,at.
the only argument made by metabolite regarding the first factor,raised below and reargued here,is its assertion that as a small company that does not have a sales force,defending this suit in florida would place it under a significant burden.it states that litigation in florida would disrupt the active research laboratory and other personal and professional commitments of allen in colorado.this argument is unconvincing,as litigation in florida will not prevent allen himself from remaining in colorado,at least for the vast majority of the time.we also view metabolite general assertion of hardship,without supporting evidence,as unpersuasive.
second,florida has an interest in adjudicating this dispute greater than the partial interest recognized by the district court.although,as the district court noted,the principal dispute between the parties is one of federal patent law,that does not diminish florida interest in protecting its companies and residents.here,resolution of the dispute will affect not only breckenridge and the florida branches of the retailers that received the letters,which florida has an interest in protecting from unfair competition and t
