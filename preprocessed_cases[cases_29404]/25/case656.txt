this is an appeal from a decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences board in interference,declared on december,between falkner et,patent the falkner patent and inglis et,application serial the inglis application.the administrative patent judge apj designated inglis as the senior party.on december,the board issued a final decision,holding that falkner could not antedate inglis september,priority date,and entered judgment against falkner on the sole count of the interference.it ordered that falkner was not entitled to claims of the falkner patent.it further ordered that inglis was entitled to claims,and of the application.falkner filed a timely notice of appeal.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a a and and.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the board.
background 
a.the invention 
some vaccines against a virus the target virus incorporate harmless fragments of the target virus genetic material into a second virus,called a viral vector.when a person is vaccinated,the viral vector produces harmless fragments of the target virus,ultimately conferring immunity against it.to prevent the viral vector from itself causing a harmful infection in the inoculee,it must be attenuated.attenuation is achieved by deleting or inactivating one or more genes responsible for the vector growth and infectiousness.however,because the vaccine is produced by essentially growing the vector virus accompanied by its inserted target virus gene,attenuation makes it difficult to manufacture the vaccine.the traditional solution to this problem has been to inactivate genes known as inessential genes.with inessential genes inactivated,the viral vector is substantially less pathogenic.at the same time,because the vector virus can still fully reproduce itself,albeit more slowly,the vaccine can be produced in commercial quantities.however,the traditional approach carried a disadvantage,namely the risk that the vector virus,though attenuated,could still cause a harmful infection in the inoculee.
the inventors discovered a way of making vaccines safer by deleting or inactivating an essential,rather than an inessential,gene from the viral vector genome,while at the same time solving the production problem by growing the vaccines in cells that were complementarily modified to produce the absent essential viral gene product on behalf of the vector virus.thus,the modified vector virus could be readily grown in these cells,but not in other cells,such as those of an inoculee.
this approach is applicable to many different kinds of vector viruses,adenoviruses,herpesviruses,poxviruses and retroviruses.the subject matter of this interference,however,is directed specifically to vaccines in which the vector virus is a poxvirus.for many vector viruses,there is a risk that vectors that have been attenuated in essential genes can swap genes with the host cell genome,thereby reacquiring their deleted genes and reverting to virus.this risk can be minimized through the use of viruses that are cytoplasmic,meaning that they are unlikely to enter the cell nucleus.because a cell genes are located in the nucleus,cytoplasmic viruses such as poxvirus can not swap genes with the cell genome and possibly revert to a virulent virus.
defining the count and assigning priority 
the sole count of the interference was either a vaccine according to claim of falkner patent or a vaccine according to claim of inglis application.claim of the inglis application reads 
a vaccine comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and an effective immunizing amount of a mutant virus,wherein said mutant virus is a mutant poxvirus and has a genome which has an inactivating mutation in a viral gene,said viral gene being essential for the production of infectious new virus particles,wherein said mutant virus is able to cause production of infectious new virus particles in a complementing host cell gene expressing a gene which complements said essential viral gene,but is unable to cause production of infectious new virus particles when said mutant virus infects a host cell other than a complementing host cell for prophylactic or therapeutic use in generating an immune response in a subject.
emphasis added 
claim of the falkner patent reads 
a vaccine comprising a a defective poxvirus that lacks a function imparted by an essential region of its parental poxvirus,wherein i said defective poxvirus comprises a dna polynucleotide encoding an antigen and said dna polynucleotide is under transcriptional control of a promoter,and ii the function can be complemented by a complementing source and b a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
the administrative patent judge apj designated claims of the falkner patent and claims,and of the inglis application as corresponding to the interference count both parties sought the benefit of applications to establish dates of constructive reduction to practice the alj accorded the inglis application filed june,the benefit of several applications,dating back to september,likewise,the apj accorded the falkner patent issued june,from an application filed february,the benefit of applications,but these dated back only to april,consequently,the apj designated inglis as the senior party.
board decision 
the specifications of all of inglis earlier applications were similar.although they focused on herpesvirus vectors,they contained several passages related to vaccines.because falkner believed that these passages did not adequately describe and enable the poxvirus invention,he challenged both inglis entitlement to priority as to the count and the patentability of inglis corresponding claims.falkner brought these challenges in three preliminary motions before the board.in each,as the moving party,falkner carried the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.see a see also kubota shibuya,explaining that t he term burden of proof means the burden to establish the proposition at issue by a preponderance of the evidence.
falkner brought his first preliminary motion pursuant to a arguing that the claims in inglis involved application that corresponded to the count were unpatentable because they failed to meet the written description requirement of.in support of his argument,he stated,inter alia,that the specification of inglis application did not identify any essential genes in poxvirus or describe the inactivation of such genes,vaccines based on vaccinia a type of poxvirus had not yet been produced,and the bulk of the inglis specification was directed not to poxviruses but to herpesviruses.the board denied falkner motion,based in part on his failure to address the perceived shortcomings of the claims in light of the specification.
second,falkner moved pursuant to g g to deny inglis the priority benefit of his earlier applications,arguing that they did not sufficiently describe and enable the claims in question falkner argued that without the benefit of these applications inglis would be unable to establish constructive reduction to practice earlier than falkner.falkner would win priority as to the count,and inglis corresponding claims would be unpatentable.in support of his motion,falkner alleged deficiencies in inglis benefit specifications similar to those raised in his first motion.the board carefully articulated the legal standard,correctly explaining that benefit with respect to priority in an interference is granted with respect to counts not claims and that a ll that is necessary for a party to be entitled to benefit of an earlier filed application for priority purposes is compliance with with respect to at least one embodiment within the scope of the count.board op.at citing hunt treppschuh,ccpa holding that where a parent application is relied upon as a prior constructive reduction to practice,the,first paragraph requirements need only be met for an embodiment within the count.after careful review of the record,the board held that falkner had failed to meet his burden of proof.
third,falkner moved for judgment pursuant to a that the claims in inglis involved application that corresponded to the count were anticipated and therefore unpatentable.he argued that because inglis earlier applications had failed to adequately describe and enable the full scope of his current claims,the current claims could not be accorded the benefit of for the purpose of antedating prior the board explained that require benefit applications to comply with,first paragraph,with respect to the full scope of what a party now claims,rather than with respect to merely one embodiment within the scope of the interference count.after carefully considering the written description and enablement issues,the board denied the motion.as a result of the denial of falkner several motions,inglis remained the senior party,and the board ordered judgment as to the subject matter of the count in favor of inglis.
issue and standard of review 
on appeal,falkner essentially reiterates the arguments that he made before the board.while we recognize that each of these three arguments is distinct,they are nonetheless all related,and under the facts of this particular case,we need only to resolve the following common issue whether the inglis benefit applications adequately describe and enable a vaccine.falkner also argues that the board committed other errors,such as initially designating inglis as the senior party and failing to afford falkner an opportunity for briefing prior to making this designation.these arguments lack merit,and we shall not further discuss them.we turn,therefore,to the central issues in this case written description and enablement.
written description is a question of fact,judged from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art as of the relevant filing date.see,mahurkar.enablement is a question of law involving underlying factual inquiries.see genentech,novo nordisk,see also in re wands,holding that whether undue experimentation is required is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations includ ing the quantity of experimentation necessary,the amount of direction or guidance presented,the presence or absence of working examples,the nature of the invention,the state of the prior art,the relative skill of those in the art,the predictability or unpredictability of the art,and the breadth of the claims.
this court applies the standards of the administrative procedure act apa in reviewing decisions of the board.see dickinson zurko,d holding that governs our review of pto appeals.accordingly,we will set aside actions of the board if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,and we set aside factual findings that are unsupported by substantial evidence.see in re mcdaniel,citing see also in re sullivan,substantial evidence review of factual findings.we review questions of law de novo.see rapoport dement.
substantial evidence is defined as that which a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.see in re zurko.it requires an examination of the record as a whole,taking into account both the evidence that justifies and detracts from an agency opinion.see in re gartside.an agency decision can be supported by substantial evidence,even where the record will support several reasonable but contradictory conclusions.see see also in re jolley.
ii.discussion 
contents of the inglis priority applications 
the claims that correspond to the count of the interference are directed to a novel type of vaccine that is comprised of a vector virus in the poxvirus family.conceptually,poxviruses are a subgenus of viruses that includes the species vaccinia.all of the prior falkner applications described poxvirus vaccine vectors in detail,and to the exclusion of other types of vaccine vectors,herpesvirus vaccine vectors.these applications provided five detailed working examples regarding the preparation and use of vaccines from defective poxviruses.they also described the use of a particular species of poxvirus vaccine vector,namely vaccinia virus.
in contrast,the inglis applications described vaccine vectors in general,and then focused on the subgenus of herpesviruses,for which they provided a detailed example.nevertheless,at least three passages discussed the poxvirus invention and specifically mentioned vaccinia virus.for example,after introducing the concept of vaccine vectors,the specification states that t ypically members of the pox virus family,vaccinia virus,are used as vaccine vectors.the specification later discusses the deletion of essential genes from vaccine vector genomes,noting that the invention can be applied to any virus where one or more essential gene s can be identified and deleted from or inactivated within the virus genome emphasis added.moreover,it provides that the virus may comprise an orthopox virus,for example,vaccinia virus,which may comprise a heterologous sequence encoding an immunogen derived from a pathogen.finally,it reads 
for example vaccinia virus,a poxvirus,can carry and express genes from various pathogens,and it has been demonstrated that these form effective vaccines when used in animal experimental systems.the potential for use in humans is vast,but because of the known side effects associated with the widespread use of vaccinia as a vaccine against smallpox,there is reluctance to use an unmodified vaccine in humans.there have been attempts to attenuate vaccinia virus by deleting genes such as the vaccinia growth factor gene however,such attenuated viruses can still replicate in vivo,albeit at a reduced level.no vaccinia virus with a deletion in an essential gene has yet been produced,but such a virus,deleted in an essential gene as described above,with its complementing cell for growth,would provide a safer version of this vaccine.
the application provides a detailed example of an embodiment that comprised not a poxvirus,but a herpesvirus,including the identity of the deleted essential sequences therein.nevertheless,for the reasons discussed below,we find no error in the board determinations on the adequacy of written description and enablement in the various inglis disclosures.
enablement 
because the adequacy of the disclosure is judged from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art,we start our review of the board decision by noting that the parties stipulated to a high level of skill in the art.they defined the skilled artisan as having years experience creating recombinant poxvirus,as being familiar with the poxvirus literature,the use of poxvirus as a vector for the expression of heterologous genes,and having the needed technical skill to practice the experimentation described in the scientific literature relating to recombinant virus,including poxvirus.the board agreed with the parties stipulation as to level of skill.
the board did not err in finding inglis claims to be enabled as a matter of law,in light of its articulated underlying factual findings.in support of its conclusion,it noted that there is extensive disclosure of the selection of an essential gene,its deletion or inactivation and the production of a mutated virus with said deleted or inactivated gene,albeit for herpesvirus.moreover,because the differences between the herpesviruses and poxviruses were well known,this would have aided the person of ordinary skill in the art in her application of the lessons of the herpesvirus example in the construction of poxvirus vaccines.the board observed that the mere fact that the experimentation may have been difficult and time consuming does not mandate a conclusion that such experimentation would have been considered to be undue in this art.indeed,great expenditures of time and effort were ordinary in the field of vaccine preparation.thus,the board found the inglis applications to be enabling.
reviewing the board legal conclusion of enablement,as based on its underlying findings of fact,we can not say that the board erred.with respect to a skilled artisan ability to identify essential poxvirus genes,as discussed below we note that there was undisputed testimony that as of the time of filing of the earliest inglis application publications in professional journals had disclosed the dna sequence of the poxvirus genome along with the locations of the essential regions.the person of ord
