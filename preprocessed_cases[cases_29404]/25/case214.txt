at issue in this appeal is congress deceptively simple prohibition on our review of district court remand orders,see d,and the voluminous body of case law it has spawned.because we interpret the district court opinion in this case as a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and not as a discretionary remand of pendent claims,we conclude that d bars review of the remand order.that the district court based its remand on a decision and on briefing does not,contrary to the defendants argument,alter this conclusion.accordingly,we dismiss the appeal of the remand order for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
on november,charles dawalt and sue king collectively dawalt,both kentucky citizens and both users of the prescription pain medication oxycontin,sued purdue pharma,its subsidiaries and its collectively purdue on behalf of a class of kentuckians in state court,namely in the boone county circuit court.dawalt alleged wrongful manufacture,marketing,promotion,sale and distribution of oxycontin,a drug that purdue developed,patented and,following approval by the food and drug administration in may of,manufactured and promoted.
broadly speaking,dawalt claims fell into two categories,both of which he purported to premise exclusively on state law.dawalt first sought relief for injuries stemming from purdue alleged negligence and fraud.he then asserted a claim for medical monitoring under kentucky law,asking that the court require purdue to notify people who have received oxycontin of its potential harm provide for regular medical examinations create a registry of relevant information fund further studies of the effects of the drug and publish and disseminate information to doctors,the medical community in general and class members.along with premising the complaint on state law,dawalt sought to ensure that the claims would be heard in state court by stipulating that the claim for damages of each and every plaintiff and class member is for less than,the jurisdictional requirement for the diversity jurisdiction statute.ja.
on december,purdue removed the case to federal district court,claiming that the court had diversity jurisdiction under because neither purdue nor its subsidiaries nor its were incorporated or had their principal place of business in kentucky.in the alternative,purdue invoked the doctrine,claiming that the district court had jurisdiction under because oxycontin was subject to comprehensive federal regulation.ja.in its notice of removal,purdue further argued that dawalt purported to limit damages from severe disabling injuries relating to addiction and other adverse consequences including mental,emotional harm,death,and loss of consortium,ja,ineffective under sixth circuit law.
a flurry of motions followed,many of which concerned dawalt attempt to rephrase his complaint to avoid the implication that each class member would recover over.dawalt,for example,moved to delete all references to death and future medical care,remove one reference to severe medical problems and exclude punitive damages and attorneys fees.ja.based on these changes,dawalt filed a motion to remand on january.purdue responded that,while it was improper for a party to attempt to improve its chances of obtaining a remand through pleadings,dawalt claims still exceeded the jurisdictional requirement.
on march,dawalt filed a reply memorandum urging the district court not to consider the medical monitoring claims in calculating the amount in controversy because those claims may be invalid under a case then pending before the kentucky supreme court and ultimately decided as wood laboratories.purdue responded by stressing that district courts measure the amount in controversy at the time of removal and that the discovery that a claim is invalid does not deprive a court of jurisdiction even if the remaining claims do not exceed.because wood was not settled law in kentucky,purdue further argued,it could not be said to a legal certainty that the medical monitoring claims were invalid at the time of removal.on august,the kentucky supreme court decided wood,holding that medical monitoring claims are invalid under kentucky law absent proof of present physical injury.see at.the following month,the district court struck a named defendant,partners against pain,from the complaint because that defendant was a website established by purdue and not a corporate entity or an entity capable of being sued.
a year later,on september,the district court remanded the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court first noted that dawalt damage stipulation was of no legally binding consequence and therefore insufficient to warrant remand.op.at.yet even without the stipulation,the court reasoned,dawalt claims did not suffice to meet the jurisdictional requirement because wood had recently determined that medical monitoring is not a legally recognized cause of action under kentucky law.id.at.because wood precluded medical monitoring claims,the court continued,purdue had failed to show under zahn international paper,d,that the minimally injured class member would meet the jurisdictional requirement.op.at.the court used this reasoning both to grant purdue motion to dismiss the medical monitoring claims and to declare that it had no diversity jurisdiction over the entire case.
the district court next addressed the possibility that purdue could invoke jurisdiction under.after reviewing dawalt complaint,the court concluded that the complaint raise d kentucky state law claims only,that these claims can be decided by looking solely to state law,and that they are not preempted by federal law.id.at.
lastly,the district court refused to certify the case for interlocutory appeal.purdue request for certification,the court stated,arises from the realization that this court has concluded that the requisite amount in controversy for all putative class members has not been shown,and therefore that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over these proceedings.id.at.citing d,the court observed that circuit courts typically lack jurisdiction to review such remand orders.
appeals in which both parties agree that the lower court erred but for which no appellate relief may be obtained are not an everyday occurrence in the courts of appeal.today,however,that is what the pertinent federal statute requires us to do.
a year after the district court issued its remand order and while purdue appeal before this court was pending,our circuit addressed the meaning of in olden lafarge,cir.we concluded that congress adoption of overruled the supreme court opinion in zahn and required district courts to aggregate the claims of class members to calculate the amount in controversy for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,a ruling at odds with the district court jurisdictional holding.while the supreme court has subsequently granted review of this issue,see exxon allapattah services,d,both parties agree that this panel is bound by the olden decision and that,in determining our appellate jurisdiction,we should assume that the district court misconstrued.the parties also agree that the district court decision is a final one under,which grants the courts of appeal jurisdiction to review final decision s of the district courts.
yet the acknowledgment of a mistake made in a final decision by a district court,the parties further agree,does not end our inquiry.just as the mere occurrence of a harm does not open the door to a federal forum,see,united states bean,d,so too the mere fact that a district court matter how obvious or clear the not permit appellate review,absent a congressional grant of authority,see,swint chambers county comm n,d.see generally sheldon sill,how.courts created by statute can have no jurisdiction but such as the statute confers.
while empowers us to review final decisions of the district court,d divests us of some of that authority in the context of remand orders.except for remand orders under which relates to civil rights cases and which is not relevant to this appeal,d provides that 
an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.
the language of the provision is not only broad but venerable as well.the present codification dates back to a comparable federal rule that has existed since and,with a short break,even before then.see,in re pennsylvania.gay ruff.brandeis,and cases cited.
things are not as straightforward as they appear,however.despite the statute seemingly unequivocal language barring review of non remand orders,the supreme court has held that the provision is not that simple.it must be read in conjunction with c,which in relevant part states 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
according to thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d,d and c must be construed together,so that only remand orders issued under c and invoking the grounds specified removal was improvident and without immune from review under d.id.at.quoting the improvident and without jurisdiction language of a previous version of c.section d,the court concluded,will bar appellate review save when a district court has not merely erred in applying the requisite provision for remand but has remanded a case on grounds not specified in the statute and not touching the propriety of the removal.id.at.in applying this rule,thermtron held that an appeals court had the authority to review a remand order premised on the district court crowded docket and nothing else,an explanation that had nothing to do with the propriety of the removal or the court jurisdiction.see id.at.
two decisions of the court since thermtron help to illustrate when remand orders may be reviewed and when they may not be.in things remembered,petrarca,d,the court held that d barred appellate review of a district court remand order on grounds of untimely removal,regardless of whether the action was removed under a the general removal statute or the bankruptcy removal statute.congress,the court noted,has placed broad restrictions on the power of federal appellate courts to review district court orders remanding removed cases to state court.things remembered,at.section d thus applies not only to remand orders made in suits removed under the general removal statute,but to orders of remand made in cases removed under any other statutes,as well.id.at.quoting united states rice.brackets omitted.
the following court term,in quackenbush allstate insurance,d,the court held that d did not bar appellate review of an remand order.the court reiterated the thermtron rule and concluded that an remand order does not fall into either category of remand order described in c,as it is not based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defects in removal procedure.id.at.
a third decision,university cohill,d,bears tangentially on our resolution of this case as cohill is explicitly not about our appellate jurisdiction under d but rather about a district court remand power under c,see things remembered,at.kennedy and ginsburg,concurring we did not find it necessary in cohill to decide whether subsection d would bar review of a remand for we affirmed the denial of mandamus by the court of appeals.in cohill,the court considered whether a federal district court has discretion under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction to remand a properly removed case to state court when all claims in the action have been eliminated and only pendent claims remain.at.the court concluded that a district court did possess such authority even though,at the time of the decision,the versions of the two remand statutes did not permit district courts to remand pendent claims.see c requiring district courts to remand any case that was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction c permitting district courts to remand any otherwise claim that was separate and independent of the claim providing the basis for removal of the case.nevertheless,the pendent jurisdiction doctrine in united mine workers gibbs,d,the court maintained,strongly supports the conclusion that when a district court may relinquish jurisdiction over a removed case involving pendent claims,the court has discretion to remand the case to state court.cohill,at.
as things remembered suggests,the court cases should not be read to permit limitless review of all remand orders.throughout,the court has stressed that when a remand has been ordered because the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction,d unmistakably commands that the order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.gravitt southwestern bell telephone,d see also things remembered,at.as long as a district court remand is based on a timely raised defect in removal procedure or lack of grounds for remand recognized by c a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the remand order under d.briscoe bell,d where the order is based on one of the enumerated grounds,review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand.thermtron,at.if a trial judge purports to remand a case on the ground that it was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction,his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals by appeal,mandamus,or otherwise.
in applying these precedents,our circuit has grouped the exceptions to d ban on appellate review of remand orders into two general categories.one deals with remand orders based on a substantive decision on the merits of a collateral issue as opposed to just matters of jurisdiction.regis assocs.rank hotels mgmt,cir.the other deals with remand orders in which a district court has jurisdiction at the time of removal,but jurisdiction is subsequently destroyed by later events,letherer alger group,cir a rule commonly referred to as the doctrine.
under the first group of cases,we have appellate jurisdiction to review a district court remand order made on grounds wholly apart from jurisdictional questions.paradigm cases are the remand that the supreme court addressed in quackenbush and the remand predicated on the state of the district court docket that the court addressed in thermtron.in keeping with these two decisions,we have held that a district court remand based on the interpretation of a forum selection clause is reviewable on appeal.regis,at.but this exception to the ban on appellate review does not apply where,as in this case,the district court based its remand on jurisdictional grounds.see,ohio wright,cir en banc dismissing for lack of appellate jurisdiction where the question of removal jurisdiction was the heart of the decision in the district court,and the district court had to examine the plausibility of the federal defense in making its ruling to remand for lack of removal jurisdiction baldridge,cir we find that the collateral issue was not collateral at all the preemption inquiry here,unlike an inquiry into the enforceability of a clause,necessarily related to the question of jurisdiction.see also godsey miller.lexis,at,fed.appx,cir unpublished this case differs from regis in that the issue of a forum selection clause is an independent contractual concern created by the actions of the parties,and is not linked to the inherent jurisdiction of the court.anusbigian,cir holding unreviewable a decision on a issue necessarily related to the question of jurisdiction.
under the second group of cases,applying the doctrine,we have held that where the district court had jurisdiction at the time of removal,the district court subsequent remand for lack of jurisdiction in light of changed circumstances is reviewable by this court on appeal.letherer,at see also first bank of pulaski curry,cir section d means only that a remand order is unreviewable on appeal when the case was remanded based on the district court conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the removed case at the time of removal.van meter state farm fire cas,cir i f a district court determines subject matter jurisdiction to have existed at the time of removal,yet remand
