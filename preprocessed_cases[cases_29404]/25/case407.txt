for years following the food and drug fda approval of isb,sigma supplied hirsch and its successors with isb that was manufactured by allied chemical allied.allied manufacturing process was unknown,but analysis of its isb indicated the presence of lead,which suggested the use of a lead compound in synthesis.sigma developed an isolation process to remove the unwanted lead,but the ultimate purity of the isb it sold was unknown.in,allied stopped supplying sigma with isb and,while sigma was looking for a new supplier,covidien was forced to notify its customers that it was completely out of lymphazurin until it could find a new supplier for isb.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.by,sigma had a new supplier,innovassynth,which synthesized isb using ammonium,resulting in residual chromium impurities.sigma reported numerous problems with the purity of innovassynth product and eventually developed its own manufacturing process for isb sometime around.
apicore was founded in and began developing an improved process for synthesizing isb.in,apicore partnered with synerx pharma llc synerx,mylan inst.predecessor,to develop and market a generic version of lymphazurin.in,apicore filed a patent application that ultimately led to the process and patents.based on the claimed process,synerx acquired by mylan inst.in filed an abbreviated new drug application anda seeking fda approval to market a generic lymphazurin the fda approved the anda in.by,isb sales were a significant portion of apicore revenue and in,covidien withdrew lymphazurin from the market for reasons other than safety or effectiveness.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.mylan inst.became the sole supplier of the isb drug product until,when aurobindo entered the market.
aurobindo sought fda approval for a generic lymphazurin,informing the fda that it had studied a number of patents describing isb manufacture and selected,inter alia,apicore patent,and that it considered the process described therein for the initial sample preparation and further,the optimization of the process.id.internal quotation marks omitted.aurobindo acknowledged to the fda that it was looking for a reagent other than silver oxide.id.internal quotation marks omitted.it eventually selected manganese dioxide,and its process resulted in isb with a which could not be removed by recrystallization.instead,it used preparatory hplc to achieve an isb purity of greater than.mylan sued aurobindo for infringement and sought a preliminary injunction,which the district court granted.
first,the district court evaluated the likelihood of success on the merits and found that aurobindo likely infringed the process patents under the doctrine of equivalents.id.at.the court found that the difference in oxidation strength between silver oxide and manganese dioxide is irrelevant under both the fwr and insubstantial differences tests for equivalence,as applied to the face of the claims,because the claims do not specify a requirement of oxidation strength.id.at.further,the court explained that,even if oxidation strength were relevant,it finds manganese dioxide to be a mild oxidant equivalent to silver oxide in the context of the process patents.id.the court credited sessler mylan expert testimony in light of record evidence that the silver oxide and manganese dioxide processes produce crude isb in similar yields.the court explained that if manganese dioxide were a substantially stronger oxidizing agent than silver oxide,a skilled artisan would expect different results.id.at.
the district court found that aurobindo did not raise a substantial question of validity of the patent based on its arguments that the process patent is invalid under because the by hplc limitation renders the claims indefinite under because the claims would have been obvious over various combinations of art and under because the claims are anticipated by sigma manufacture and sale of isb.
on the issue of indefiniteness,the district court credited sessler testimony and found that by hplc was a common and way of designating or determining purity,as seen in numerous sources,including other patents and the scientific literature.id.at.thus,the court concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial question of validity of the patent under.id.
the district court also rejected aurobindo obviousness argument,finding that aurobindo did not raise a substantial question regarding motivation to combine the references or a reasonable expectation of success.see id.at.the court noted that a purified compound is not always prima facie obvious over the prior art mixture if the process to arrive at the purified compound is itself of patentable weight.id.at citing aventis pharma deutschland gmbh lupin,fed.cir.internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that apicore process leading to the purified compound claimed in the patent constituted an invention of patentable weight itself and thus the purity claims would not necessarily have been prima facie obvious over the prior art mixture of less pure isb and closely related isomer.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.

the district court also concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial question that the patent claims were anticipated under b and g by sigma manufacture and sale of isb.see id.at.aurobindo argued that sigma had made and sold isb having a purity of greater than six years before the patent priority date.see id.aurobindo supported its position by citing a sigma certificate of analysis,which indicated that a compound named patent violet blue,with a certain product number and lot number,possessed a purity that was by hplc.id.the court rejected aurobindo argument,finding that it is not clear that,at the time of the certificate,sigma use of the term patent violet blue referred to isb because other sigma documents indicate that patent violet blue referred to several blue dye compounds with different structures and the record established that the certificate is inaccurate because it contradicts numerous other sigma documents that report a different purity for samples from the same lot.id.at.thus,the court concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial question that the patent is invalid as anticipated.id.
second,the district court found that apicore would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction and identified four hallmark examples of irreparable harm that are demonstrated by the record lost sales lost price erosion and that apicore must now directly compete with an infringer.id.at order adopting,wl,at.
the district court found a causal nexus between aurobindo infringement and apicore harm in that aurobindo product would not be on the market if it had not obtained fda approval for a product that will likely be found to be covered by the patents.order adopting,wl,at.the court noted that w ithout infringing the,and patents,aurobindo would not be able to make the isb product described in its anda because aurobindo anda application touted greater than purity for isb.report and recommendation,wl,at.
third,the district court found that the balance of equities weighed in favor of granting the injunction.id.the court emphasized that apicore stands to lose its entire isb business,which it relies on to fund research and development,and that aurobindo was aware of apicore patented process and copied it.id.thus,the court found that the balance of equities favored apicore.id.citing windsurfing int l amf,fed.cir.one who elects to build a business on a product found likely to infringe can not be heard to complain if an injunction against continuing infringement destroys the business so.
finally,the district court found that the public interest factor also favored granting the preliminary injunction.the court observed that apicore satisfied its end of the patent bargain by disclosing its method for preparing isb and that it would likely not have done so if it had known that a competitor would use that method to its isb business before it could make it to trial.id.the court emphasized that the public interest in obtaining pharmaceutical compounds can not justify entirely eliminating the exclusionary rights covered by pharmaceutical patents.id.internal quotation marks omitted.

process patents 
we first consider whether the district court erred in finding that mylan is likely to succeed on the merits because aurobindo more likely than not infringes the process patents under the doctrine of equivalents.report and recommendation,wl,at.to establish a likelihood of success on the merits,a patentee must show that it will likely prove infringement of the asserted claims and that its infringement claim will likely withstand the alleged infringer challenges to patent validity and enforceability.sciele pharma,lupin,fed.cir.citing,at.a preliminary injunction should not issue if the accused infringer raises a substantial question concerning either infringement or validity,at.
aurobindo argues that it had raised a substantial question of infringement of the process patents under the doctrine of equivalents because manganese dioxide isoleuco acid in a different way than silver oxide in that manganese dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent,whereas silver oxide is a weak oxidizing agent.additionally,aurobindo continues,manganese dioxide oxidation requires the use of an acid and the patents specifically report the use of silver oxide as not requiring an acid.
mylan responds that the district court correctly found a likelihood of success on the merits of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the court properly found that manganese dioxide and silver oxide are equivalent in the context of the process patents.specifically,the court credited sessler testimony in light of record evidence that the silver oxide and manganese dioxide processes produce crude isb in similar yields.the court explained that if manganese dioxide was a substantially stronger oxidizing agent than silver oxide,a skilled artisan would expect different results.report and recommendation,wl,at.that finding,mylan argues,was not clearly erroneous.
as set forth below,we conclude that the district court analysis of equivalence in this case was flawed,no doubt because of the sparse and confusing case law concerning equivalents,particularly the paucity of chemical equivalence case law,and the difficulty of applying the legal concepts to the facts.we will attempt to provide more clarity on these subjects.
this appeal is unusual in a first sense in that it arises from the grant of a preliminary injunction based on the doctrine of equivalents.there are few such reported decisions,but see,pfizer,teva,usa,fed.cir,owing to the fact that equivalents cases are highly factual inquir ies that rarely come clear on a premature record,dillon,fed.cir.moreover,the law on the doctrine of equivalents as applied to chemical materials is not clear,and its misapplication can lead to unsound results.this appears to be such a case.
in graver tank,the supreme court set out two frameworks for evaluating equivalence the familiar fwr test,whether the accused product performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result and the insubstantial differences test whether the accused product or process is substantially different from what is patented.graver tank linde air prod.the supreme court most recent visit with this branch of the law was in,which dealt with whether a process of purification performed at a ph of was equivalent to one performed at a ph of.hilton davis chem.the court noted that equivalence is not a prisoner of formula,id.at,but also observed that cases may not be to consideration under the fwr test,see id.at there seems to be substantial agreement that,while the fwr test may be suitable for analyzing mechanical devices,it often provides a poor framework for analyzing other products or processes.
the supreme court was surely correct in stating that cases may not be to consideration under the fwr test.that seems to be particularly true in the chemical arts.although in graver tank,the supreme court recognized the use of fwr generally in chemical cases,at today the doctrine of equivalents is applied to mechanical or chemical equivalents in compositions or devices,the court later acknowledged in that the suitability of the two tests may vary,depending on the circumstances of the case,at different linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases,depending on their particular facts.thus,the court seemingly blessed two equivalents tests,leaving to the lower courts in future cases the choice of which to apply.
the district court here applied the fwr test in evaluating the equivalence issue we will therefore review its decision first in that light.in doing so,we conclude that the district court analysis of the process claims under fwr was flawed by being unduly truncated and hence incomplete.
especially when evaluating an equivalents dispute dealing with chemical compositions having many,chemical compounds with many substituents which are usually claimed as separate limitations,and those having a medical or biological use,it is often not clear what the function or way is for each claim limitation.how a particular component of a composition,or substituent of a compound,functions in a human or animal body,or in what way,may not be known or even knowable although,as technology evolves,that may change.and precedent requires that,for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,each limitation must satisfy an equivalence test.see,at.
the result of using a claimed compound may be more easily evaluated,as the structure and uses of one compound may be directly compared with those of another.but,as indicated above,that is not how infringement under fwr is determined.it must be determined on a basis.see id.similarly,in the case of a chemical process claim,as in this case,the result of a process producing a chemical compound may be clear why else would a claim for infringement of a process claim be brought if the claimed result is not obtained but the function and way of a particular limitation of a chemical process claim may remain vague and often overlap.in some cases,way and function may be synonymous.
aurobindo argued before the district court that the function prong of the fwr test was not met because of the difference in oxidation strength between silver oxide and manganese dioxide.but the court did not seem to address that argument,which in actuality related to the way component of the fwr test.the court stated that c onverting the isoleuco acid to isosulfan blue acid is the function of the silver oxide,and then dismissed aurobindo oxidation strength argument as irrelevant to the fwr and insubstantial difference tests.report and recommendation,wl,at emphasis added.nevertheless,the court made a finding that silver oxide and manganese dioxide are equivalent in the context of the process patents,without considering the way prong of the fwr test.id.in fact,the court to consider the relative oxidation strengths of silver oxide and manganese dioxide as a consideration for claim construction,rather than its equivalents analysis.id.at stating that the relative oxidation strengths are irrelevant for both the fwr and insubstantial differences tests and that aurobindo had not argued for a narrow er claim construction that would read an oxidation strength limitation into the claims,but noting that a more factual record and claim construction proceeding could change things added.
thus,either the district court did not address the way prong of the fwr analysis having considered the relative oxidation strengths to be an issue for claim construction,and rejecting aurobindo arguments about oxidation strength because it had not argued for a narrow claim construction or it performed a way analysis without considering critical factors under that prong,namely,the relative oxidation strengths of silver oxide and manganese dioxide,as well as the use of an acid in the accused process.either characterization constitutes error in the court equivalents analysis.
the district court correctly evaluated the function aspect of the fwr test deciding,in effect,that the function of the silver oxide was to oxidize the precursor isoleuco compound to isb acid but that is not considering the way the oxidation works.manganese dioxide and silver oxide may have the same function,but the question is whether they operate in the same way.facts that might be considered in an equivalents analysis include the relative oxidation strengths of the two oxidizing agents,as argued by aurobindo,and the fact that manganese dioxide requires the use of an acid for oxidation,but silver dioxide does not,and results in a different yield.all of this in fact may at trial indicate a different way.thus,there is room for sufficient doubt as to whether silver oxide and manganese dioxide oxidize isoleuco acid in the same way so as to satisfy the way prong of the fwr test.
accordingly,the district court erred in its equivalents analysis under fwr and we reverse its determination.when the case goes back to the district court for a full trial on the merits,the court may wish to consider whether the substantiality of the differences test may be more applicable in this case.even if evaluating the function and way prongs is feasible,the fwr test may be less appropriate for evaluating equivalence in chemical compounds if it can not capture substantial differences between a claimed and accused compound.
for example,consider the compounds and ibuprofen,which chemists would not usually consider to be structural equivalents under the insubstantial differences test.chemical compounds are by their structures,and these two compounds differ substantially in structure see appendix.however,the two compounds would seem to be substantial equivalents under the fwr test.they each provide analgesia and activity function by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis way in order to alleviate pain,reduce fevers,and lessen inflammation result.see,hilton davis chem,fed.cir.lourie,dissenting.thus,a compound may appear to be equivalent under the fwr test,but not under the substantiality of the differences test.hence,the substantial differences test may be more suitable than fwr for determining equivalence in the chemical arts,at different linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases,depending on their particular facts.
in this case,the district court conducted an incomplete fwr analysis while essentially bypassing the substantial differences test,in a situation where the latter test might seemingly be more appropriate.the claims in the process patents recite a method for preparing a specifically named compound by combining another specifically depicted compound with a third specific compound,silver oxide.each of these compounds is expressly named,and an infringement analysis must not take lightly the specific recitation of these materials.the district court found that the accused process using manganese dioxide was equivalent to the claimed process using silver oxide.but the court failed to consider whether the key reagent in the process,manganese dioxide,was substantially different from the claimed reagent,silver oxide,and hence whether the substitution for,and of,silver oxide left the accused infringer outside of the bounds of the claims.
manganese dioxide and silver oxide are substantially different in many respects.for example,manganese and silver are in different groups of the periodic table.in oxide form,manganese has an oxidation state of,while silver is.those differences may well be relevant to equivalence at trial.thus,the choice of test under the doctrine of equivalents may matter in this case.
when the case returns to the district court for a full trial on the merits,the court should,in addition to providing further analysis regarding fulfillment of the fwr test,if
