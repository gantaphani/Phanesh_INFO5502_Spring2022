in this product liability case,current and past consumers of the meridia,whose actions were transferred to,or originated in,the northern district of the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of,the pharmaceutical company that marketed and distributed meridia and its affiliates.plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court failed to conduct a meaningful analysis,erred in partly excluding the testimony of one of plaintiffs experts,and erred in granting summary judgment to defendants as to plaintiffs various common law and statutory claims.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
this litigation was occasioned by the meridia.first developed in as an by boots pharmaceuticals,meridia works by slowing the body dissipation of serotonin and norepinephrine,brain chemicals that affect satiety and impulse control.meridia originally failed to gain food and drug administration fda approval.in,the rights to meridia were purchased by knoll pharmaceuticals,which began to test the drug potential to effectuate weight loss.in,the fda approved the marketing and sale of meridia as a prescription,which knoll began to market in.in,abbott laboratories abbott labs acquired knoll.abbott labs now markets meridia to doctors,pharmacies,and directly to consumers.
on march,a consumer watchdog group petitioned the fda to remove meridia from the market,alleging the drug to be ineffective and unsafe.in the wake of that petition,plaintiffs across the united states brought suit against abbott labs.although peripheral to the present appeal,these plaintiffs also sued the doctors who prescribed meridia and the pharmacies that sold it.the plaintiffs claimed to have incurred various,heart attack,stroke,tachycardia,palpitations,chest pain,high blood pressure,and claimed that meridia is ineffective.the plaintiffs also claimed that they were at increased risk of developing a future injury.some of the claims were filed originally in federal court,and abbott labs,which is an illinois company,removed many of the state court claims on the ground of diversity.
in august of,with the approval of the litigants,the judicial panel on litigation mdl panel transferred the pending federal cases to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,pursuant to.in all,nearly meridia actions from states were consolidated and assigned to the honorable james gwin.following pretrial proceedings and discovery,plaintiffs filed a master class action complaint mca complaint and a motion for class certification.the mca complaint alleged nine grounds for relief strict liability,negligence,negligence per se,violation of statutory consumer protection,unjust enrichment,medical monitoring,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warrant,and corporate responsibility.plaintiffs requested compensatory damages,punitive damages,attorneys fees,and such other or further relief as may be appropriate under the circumstances.
abbott labs filed various motions in response.first,it filed a motion to exclude all of plaintiffs expert witnesses.second,it filed a motion for summary judgment,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,with respect to all claims.third,it filed a memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification.the district court denied abbott labs motion to exclude plaintiffs experts,except that it granted in part abbott labs motion with respect to arnold schwartz,a pharmacologist,schwartz was not permitted to testify as to the physiological effects of high blood pressure.the court granted abbott labs motion for summary judgment with respect to all issues.see in re meridia prods.liab,d.
the court declined to rule on plaintiffs motion for class certification.see miami.wrestling club miami,cir we have consistently held that a district court is not required to rule on a motion for class certification before ruling on the merits of the case.jibson.educ.ass,cir marx centran,cir.rather,the court granted the pharmaceutical defendants motion for summary judgment,thereby dismissing all of the claims against defendants abbott laboratories,abbott laboratories international,abbott laboratories,and knoll pharmaceuticals this timely appeal followed.
nearly actions from states were transferred to one district,pursuant to a,for the purpose of conducting consolidated pretrial proceedings.plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court failed to conduct a meaningful review before granting summary judgment in favor of abbott labs,and that this case must therefore be remanded.we disagree.
plaintiffs cite to van dusen barrack,d,for the general proposition that the transferee district court must be obliged to apply the state law that would have been applied if there had been no change of venue.id.at.see also ferens john deere,d.plaintiffs cite to a variety of cases,in re air disaster at ramstein air base,germany,cir in re air crash disaster near chicago,cir,as examples of litigation mdl proceedings wherein the transferee district court analyzed each claim according to the rules or substantive law of the individual claimant state.
typically,we review a district court analysis de novo.see solutions,llc techlink,cir.however,where a party did not raise a argument in district court,it may not do so on appeal.see.chem.am.home assurance,cir.in this case,not only did plaintiffs fail to challenge the court choice of law,plaintiffs affirmatively argued that the court need not engage in a analysis to resolve defendants motion for summary judgment.in fact,in applying generally applicable statements of law to plaintiffs claims,the district court relied on a case,in re tmj prods.liab,cir,which plaintiffs brought to the court attention.
in the course of fashioning the applicable conclusions of law,moreover,the district court consistently erred on the side of caution.for instance,acknowledging a conflict among jurisdictions,the court presume d for purposes of this case that advertisements are sufficient to create express warranties.in re meridia,d at.similarly,rather than inquire into whether any state requires expert testimony as to causation,the court assume d arguendo that no states laws erect such a requirement.id.at.
plaintiffs did argue before the district court that the learned intermediary shields drug manufacturers from liability when a properly informed professional administers their not apply to the new jersey plaintiffs.to the extent that new jersey law applies to any participant in this litigation,plaintiffs argument is correct.in perez wyeth,the supreme court of new jersey held that the learned intermediary doctrine did not apply where,as here,the product was marketed directly to the consumer.id.at advertising of pharmaceuticals belies each of the premises on which the learned intermediary doctrine rests.for the reasons articulated in part,however,the application of new jersey substantive law would still have resulted in summary judgment for abbott labs.barron ford motor,cir b efore entangling itself in messy issues of conflict of laws a court ought to satisfy itself that there actually is a difference between the relevant laws.
in short,because plaintiffs waived the argument,no basis exists for us to remand this case to the district court for an individualized analysis.
although the heart of plaintiffs challenge on appeal is that the district court failed to conduct a meaningful analysis,plaintiffs also argue that the court erred in its application of the summary judgment standard,and in partially excluding the testimony of one of plaintiffs experts.these challenges to the district court decision fail.
