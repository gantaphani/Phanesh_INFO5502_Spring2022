the central question in this appeal arises out of a lawsuit brought by smithkline beecham gsk against abbott laboratories abbott that contains antitrust,contract,and unfair trade practice utpa claims.the dispute relates to a licensing agreement and the pricing of hiv medications,the latter being a subject of considerable controversy in the gay community.gsk claims center on the contention that abbott violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the antitrust laws,and north carolina unfair trade practices act by first licensing to gsk the authority to market an abbott hiv drug in conjunction with one of its own and then increasing the price of the abbott drug fourfold,so as to drive business to abbott own,combination drug.
during jury selection,abbott used its first peremptory strike against the only gay member of the venire.gsk challenged the strike under batson kentucky,arguing that it was impermissibly made on the basis of sexual orientation.the district judge denied the challenge.
this appeal central question is whether equal protection prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in jury selection.we must first decide whether classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to a standard higher than rational basis review.we hold that such classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny.we also hold that equal protection prohibits peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation and remand for a new trial.
during jury selection,the district judge began by asking questions of the potential jurors based on their questionnaires,and then each party counsel had an opportunity to ask additional questions.when the judge turned her attention to juror b,a male,she inquired first about his employment,as she had done with each of the previous members of the venire.juror b stated that he worked as a computer technician for the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco.during the course of the judge colloquy with juror b,the juror revealed that his partner studied economics and investments.when the district judge followed up with additional questions,the prospective juror referred to his partner three times by using the masculine pronoun,he,and the judge subsequently referred to juror b partner as he in a question regarding his employment status.responding to additional questions from the judge,juror b stated that he took an abbott or a gsk medication and that he had friends with hiv.when the time arrived for abbott counsel,weinberger,to question juror b,the questioning was brief and limited.counsel first question concerned juror b knowledge of the medications that were the focal point of the litigation you indicated that you know some people who have been diagnosed with hiv do you know anything about the medications that any of them are on juror b responded,not really.abbott counsel then continued do you know whether any of them are taking any of the medications that we are going to be talking about here,norvir or kaletra or lexiva,any of those juror b responded that he did not know whether his friends took those medications,but that he had heard of kaletra.he added that he did know much about the drug and that he had no personal experiences with it.in sum,abbott counsel asked juror b five questions,all regarding his knowledge of the drugs at issue in the litigation.abbott counsel did not ask juror b when he had taken either an abbott or gsk medication,how long ago,which medication it was,or the purpose of the medication.he also failed to ask any questions as to whether juror b could decide the case fairly and impartially.
when the time came for peremptory challenges,abbott exercised its first strike against juror gsk counsel,saveri,immediately raised a batson challenge,and the following discussion ensued 
saveri okay.so,you know,the first challenge,your honor,is a peremptory challenge of someone who is who i think is or appears to be,could be homosexual.
that use of the peremptory challenge in a discriminatory way.
the problem here,of course,your honor,is the litigation involves aids medication.the incidents sic of aids in the homosexual community is,particularly gay men.
so with that challenge,abbott wants to exclude from it looks like abbott wants to exclude from the pool anybody who is gay.so i am concerned about that.i wanted to raise it.
the court well,i do know that,number one,whether batson applies in civil,and number two,whether batson ever applies to sexual orientation.number three,how we would know i mean,the evil of batson is not that one person of a given group is excluded,but that everyone is.and there is no way for us to know who is gay and who is here,unless somebody happens to say something.
there would be no real way to analyze it.and number four,one turns to the other side and asks for the basis for their challenge other than the category that they are in,and if you have one,it might be the better part of valor to tell us what it is.
weinberger well,he 
the court or if you do want to,you can stand on my first three reasons.
weinberger i will stand on the first three,at this point,your honor.i do think any of the challenge applies.i have no idea whether he is gay or not.
saveri your honor,in fact,he said on voir dire that he had a male partner.so 
weinberger this is my first challenge.it not like we are sitting here after three challenges and you can make a case that we are excluding anybody.
the district judge then stated that she would allow abbott strike and would reconsider her ruling if abbott struck other gay men.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned with a mixed verdict.it held for abbott on the antitrust and utpa claims,and for gsk on the contract claim.it awarded in damages to gsk.
abbott appealed the jury verdict on the contract claim,and gsk.on,gsk contends that a new trial is warranted on all counts,including the contract claim,because abbott unconstitutionally used a peremptory strike to exclude a juror on the basis of his sexual orientation.we hold that the exclusion of the juror because of his sexual orientation violated batson and we remand for a new trial.
the batson analysis involves a inquiry.first,the party challenging the peremptory strike must establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.kesser cambra,cir.second,the striking party must give a nondiscriminatory reason for the strike.see id.finally,the court determines,on the basis of the record,whether the party raising the challenge has shown purposeful discrimination.id.because the district judge applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating the batson claim,we review the batson challenge de novo.united states collins,cir.
to establish a prima facie case under batson,gsk must produce evidence that the prospective juror is a member of a cognizable group counsel used a peremptory strike against the individual and the totality of the circumstances raises an inference that the strike was motivated by the characteristic in question.collins,at.a defendant satisfies the requirements of batson first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.johnson california.the burden on the challenging party at the prima facie stage is not an onerous one.boyd newland,cir.it is a burden of production,not a burden of persuasion.crittenden ayers,cir.
gsk has established a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.juror b was the only juror to have identified himself as gay on the record,and the subject matter of the litigation presented an issue of consequence to the gay community.when jury pools contain little racial or ethnic diversity,we have held that a strike of the lone member of the minority group is a relevant consideration in determining whether a prima facie case has been established.id.at.we have further cautioned against failing to look closely at instances in which the sole minority is struck from the venire this is because failure to do so would innoculate peremptory strikes against batson challenges in jury pools with scant diversity.collins,at see also united states chinchilla,cir a lthough the striking of one or two members of the same racial group may not always constitute a prima facie case,it is preferable for the court to err on the side of the defendant rights to a fair and impartial jury.
there is also reason to infer that abbott struck juror b on the basis of his sexual orientation because of its fear that he would be influenced by concern in the gay community over abbott decision to increase the price of its hiv drug.when we analyzed whether the appellant had made out a prima facie case in johnson campbell,cir,for instance,we found it significant that the struck juror sexual orientation had no relevance to the subject matter of the litigation.id.at.the converse is true as well.in alabama,the supreme court stated that when the gender of the juror coincided with the subject matter of the case,the potential for an impermissible strike based on sex increases substantially.id.at.here,the increase in the price of the hiv drug had led to considerable discussion in the gay community.upon raising the batson challenge,gsk counsel argued that the subject matter of the litigation raised suspicions regarding the purpose of the strike the problem here is the litigation involves aids medications.the incidents sic of aids in the homosexual community is,particularly gay men.the potential for relying on impermissible stereotypes in the process of selecting jurors was particularly acute in this case.see also powers ohio,viewing the totality of the circumstances,we have no difficulty in concluding that gsk has raised an inference of discrimination and established a prima facie case.
also,abbott declined to provide any justification for its strike when offered the opportunity to do so by the district court.after the judge stated that she might reject the batson challenge on legal grounds that were in fact erroneous she told abbott counsel that he could adopt those grounds,although she advised him that it might be the better part of valor to reveal the basis for his strike.abbott counsel replied that he would rely on the grounds given by the judge and further explained,i do think any of the challenge applies.i have no idea whether he is gay or not.he later added that he could not have engaged in intentional discrimination because this was only his first strike.
counsel statement that he did not know that juror b was gay is neither consistent with the record nor an explanation for his strike.first,juror b and the judge referred to juror b male partner several times during the course of voir dire and repeatedly used masculine pronouns when referring to him.given the information regarding juror b sexual orientation that was adduced during the course of voir dire,counsel statement was far from credible.see snyder,at comparing counsel proffered reasons with the plausible facts on the record.second,the false statement was it was simply a denial of a discriminatory intent and it in no way provided a reason,colorable or otherwise,for striking juror counsel denial of a discriminatory motive had the opposite effect of that intended.because the denial was demonstrably untrue,it undermines counsel argument that his challenge was not based on intentional discrimination.taking all these factors together,including the absence of any proffered reason for the challenge,a strong inference arises that counsel engaged in intentional discrimination when he exercised the strike paulino harrison paulino ii,cir see also johnson,at in the unlikely hypothetical in which counsel declines to respond to a trial judge inquiry regarding his justification for making a strike,the evidence before the judge would consist not only of the original facts from which the prima facie case was established,but also counsel refusal to justify his strike in light of the court request.
abbott counsel asked juror b only five questions and failed to question him meaningfully about his impartiality or potential biases.see collins,at.combined with abbott counsel statement,in the face of clear evidence in the record to the contrary,that he did not know that juror b was gay,the voir dire reveals that abbott strike was based not on a concern for juror b actual bias,but on a discriminatory assumption that juror b could not impartially evaluate the case because of his sexual orientation.see kesser,at.
finally,abbott attempts to offer several neutral reasons for the strike in its brief on appeal to our court,but these reasons are also belied by the record.see id.at i f a review of the record undermines many of the proffered reasons,the reasons may be deemed a pretext for racial discrimination.ordinarily,it does not matter what reasons the striking party might have offered because w hat matters is the real reason the juror was stricken,paulino castro paulino i,cir emphasis in original that is,the reason offered at the time of the strike,if true.here,abbott offered no reasons for the strike at the voir dire,but we know from the reasons offered on appeal after full deliberation by highly respected and able counsel that even the best explanations that counsel could have offered are pretextual see kesser,at.
the record reflects that had the district judge applied the law correctly,she would necessarily have concluded that abbott strike of juror b was impermissibly made on the basis of his sexual orientation.see united states alanis,cir.because gsk has established a prima facie case,abbott offered no nondiscriminatory reason for its strike of juror b at trial,and abbott does not now offer in its brief on appeal any colorable neutral explanation for the strike,only one result is possible here.the prima facie evidence that the strike was based on a discriminatory motive is unrefuted,and on appeal it is clear that abbott has no further credible reasons to advance nor evidence to offer.accordingly,we need not remand the question whether a batson violation occurred.see id.at.the record persuasively demonstrates that juror b was struck because of his sexual orientation.this court may therefore perform the third step of the batson analysis and conclude even based on a cold record,that abbott stated reasons for striking juror b was a pretext for purposeful discrimination.id.at.
we must now decide the fundamental legal question before us whether batson prohibits strikes based on sexual orientation in batson,the supreme court held that the privilege of peremptory strikes in selecting a jury is subject to the guarantees of the equal protection clause.at.batson,of course,considered peremptory strikes based on race.at stake,the court explained,were not only the rights of the criminal defendant,but also of the individual who is excluded from participating in jury service on the basis of his race.id.at.allowing peremptory strikes based on race would touch the entire community because it would undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.id.thus,the court held,the exclusion of prospective jurors because of their race would require reversal upon a finding of intentional discrimination.id.at.eight years later,in,the court extended batson to peremptory strikes made on the basis of gender.while expanding batson ambit,explained the scope of its expansion.the court stated that p arties may exercise their peremptory challenges to remove from the venire any group or class of individuals normally subject to rational basis review.at accord united states.santiago martinez,cir.thus,if sexual orientation is subject to rational basis review,abbott strike does not require reversal.
we have in the past applied rational basis review to classifications based on sexual orientation.in high tech gays defense industrial security clearance office,cir,and philips perry,cir,we applied rational basis review when upholding department of defense and military policies that classified individuals on the basis of sexual orientation.more recently,in witt department of the air force,cir,an air force reservist brought due process and equal protection challenges to her suspension from duty on account of her sexual relationship with a woman.id.at.we considered the meaning of the supreme court decision in lawrence texas,and concluded that because lawrence relied only on substantive due process and not on equal protection,it affected our prior substantive due process cases,but not our equal protection rules.witt,at.as a result,although we applied heightened scrutiny to the substantive due process challenge in witt,we did not change our level of scrutiny for the equal protection challenge.id.we stated that lawrence declined to address equal protection,and relying on philips,our decision,we continued to apply rational basis review to equal protection challenges.id.at.thus,we are bound here to apply rational basis review to the equal protection claim in the absence of a change in the law by the supreme court or an en banc court.see miller gammie,cir en banc.here,we turn to the supreme court most recent case on the relationship between equal protection and classifications based on sexual orientation united states windsor.that landmark case was decided just last term and is dispositive of the question of the appropriate level of scrutiny in this case.
windsor,of course,did not expressly announce the level of scrutiny it applied to the equal protection claim at issue in that case,but an express declaration is not necessary.lawrence presented us with a nearly identical quandary when we confronted the due process claim in witt.just as lawrence omitted any explicit declaration of its level of scrutiny with respect to due process claims regarding sexual orientation,so does windsor fail to declare what level of scrutiny it applies with respect to such equal protection claims.nevertheless,we have been told how to resolve the question.witt,at.when the supreme court has refrained from identifying its method of analysis,we have analyzed the supreme court precedent by considering what the court actually did,rather than by dissecting isolated pieces of text.id.
in witt,we looked to three factors in determining that lawrence applied a heightened level of scrutiny rather than a rational basis analysis.we stated that lawrence did not consider the possible rationalizations for the law,required under rational basis review.witt,at.we further explained that lawrence required a legitimate state interest to justify the harm that the texas law inflicted as is traditionally the case in heightened scrutiny.witt,at quoting lawrence,at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,we looked to the cases on which lawrence relied and found that those cases applied heightened scrutiny.witt,at.applying the witt test here,we conclude that windsor compels the same result with respect to equal protection that lawrence compelled with respect to substantive due process windsor review is not rational basis review.in its words and its deed,windsor established a level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation that is unquestionably higher than rational basis review.in other words,windsor requires that heightened scrutiny be applied to equal protection claims involving sexual orientation.
examining witt first factor,windsor,like lawrence,did not consider the possible rational bases for the law in question as is required for rational basis review.the supreme court has long held that a law must be upheld under rational basis review if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify the classifications imposed by the law.mcgowan maryland.this lowest level of review does not look to the actual purposes of the law.instead,it considers whether there is some conceivable rational purpose that congress could have had in mind when it enacted the law.
this rule has been repeated throughout the history of modern constitutional law.in williamson lee optical,the court repeatedly looked to what the legislature might have concluded in enacting the law in question and evaluated these hypothetical reasons.id.at.in united states railroad retirement board fritz,the court emphasized that deference to explanations was central to rational basis review 
where,as here,there are plausible reasons for congress action,our inquiry is at an end.it is,of course,constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision,because this court has never insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute.this is particularly true where the legislature must necessarily engage in a process of.the task of classifying persons for benefits inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,and the fact the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative,rather than judicial,consideration.
id.at internal citations omitted.more recently,the supreme court has again stated that under rational basis review,it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.fed.commc comm beach commc n.
in windsor,instead of conceiving of hypothetical justifications for the law,the court evaluated the essence of the law.windsor.at.windsor looked to doma design,purpose,and effect.id.at.this inquiry included a review of the legislative history of doma.windsor quoted extensively from the house report and restated the house conclusion that marriage should be protected from the immorality of homosexuality.id.at.unlike in rational basis review,hypothetical reasons for doma enactment were not a basis of the court inquiry.in its brief to the supreme court,the bipartisan legal advisory group offered five distinct rational bases for the law.see brief on the merits for respondent the bipartisan legal advisory group of the house of representatives at,windsor,wl.windsor,however,looked behind these justifications to consider congress avowed purpose the principal purpose,it declared,is to impose inequality,not for other reasons like governmental efficiency.windsor.at.the result of this more fundamental inquiry was the supreme court conclusion that doma demonstrated purpose raise d a most serious question under the constitution fifth amendment.id.at emphasis added.windsor thus requires not that we conceive of hypothetical purposes,but that we scrutinize congress actual purposes.windsor careful consideration of doma actual purpose and its failure to consider other unsupported bases is antithetical to the very concept of rational basis review.id.at.
witt next factor also requires that we conclude that windsor applied heightened scrutiny.just as lawrence required that a legitimate state interest justify the harm imposed by the texas law,the critical part of windsor begins by demanding that congress purpose justify disparate treatment of the group.windsor.at emphasis added.windsor requires a legitimate purpose to overcome the disability on a class of individuals.id.at.as we explained in witt,w ere the court applying rational basis review,it would not identify a legitimate state interest to justify the disparate treatment of the group.witt,at.
rational basis is ordinarily unconcerned with the inequality that results from the challenged state action.see mcgowan,at applying the presumption that state legislatures have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that,in practice,their laws result in some inequality.due to this distinctive feature of rational basis review,words like harm or injury rarely appear in the court decisions applying rational basis review.windsor,however,uses these words repeatedly.the majority opinion considers doma effect on eight separate occasions.windsor concerns the resulting injury and indignity and the disadvantage inflicted on gays and lesbians.at.
moreover,windsor refuses to tolerate the imposition of a status on gays and lesbians.section of doma violates the equal protection component of the due process clause,windsor tells us,because it tells those couples,and all the world,that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition.id.at.windsor was thus concerned with the public message sent by doma about the status occupied by gays and lesbians in our society.this message was in itself a harm of great constitutional significance under doma,married couples have their lives burdened,by reason of government decree,in visible and public ways.id.windsor concern with doma message follows our constitutional tradition in forbidding state action from denoting the inferiority of a class of people.brown bd.of,internal quotations omitted citation omitted.it is the identification of such a class by the law for a separate and lesser public status that make s them unequal.windsor.at.doma was practically a brand upon them,affixed by the law,an assertion of their inferiority.strauder west virginia.windsor requires that classifications based on sexual orientation that impose inequality on gays and lesbians and send a message of status be justified by some legitimate purpose.
notably absent from windsor review of doma are the strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of laws and the extremely deferential posture toward government action that are the marks of rational basis review.erwin chemerinsky,constitutional law ed.after all,under rational basis review,it is for the legislature,not the courts,to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the new requirement.lee optical,at.windsor failure to afford this presumption of validity,however,is unmistakable.in its parting sentences,windsor explicitly announces its balancing of the government interest against the harm or injury to gays and lesbians the federal statute is invalid,for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and injure those whom the state,by its marriage laws,sought to protect in personhood and dignity.at emphasis added.windsor balancing is not the work of rational basis review.
in analyzing its final and least important factor,witt stated that lawrence must have applied heightened scrutiny because it cited and relied on heightened scrutiny cases.witt,at.part iv,the central portion of windsor reasoning,cites few cases,instead scrutinizing congress actual purposes and examining in detail the inequality imposed by the law.among the cases that the court cites are romer evans,department of agriculture moreno,and lawrence.in witt,we thought it noteworthy that lawrence did not cite romer,a rational basis case.witt,at.the citation to moreno,however,is significant because the court recognized in lawrence that moreno applied a more searching form of rational basis review,despite purporting to apply simple rational basis review.lawrence,at.our court has similarly acknowledged that moreno applied heightened scrutiny.see mountain water montana dep t of pub.serv.regulation,cir.further,the court cited lawrence,which we have since held applied heightened scrutiny.witt,at.as we stated in witt,lawrence did not resolve whether to apply heightened scrutiny in equal protection cases,but,nevertheless,lawrence is a heightened scrutiny case.because windsor relies on one case applying rational basis and two cases applying heightened scrutiny,witt final factor does not decisively support one side or the other but leans in favor of applying heightened scrutiny.
at a minimum,applying the witt factors,windsor scrutiny requires something more than traditional rational basis review.witt,at.windsor requires that when state action discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation,we must examine its actual purposes and carefully consider the resulting inequality to ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or status.in short,windsor requires heightened scrutiny.our earlier cases applying rational basis review to classifications based on sexual orientation can not be reconciled with windsor.see miller,f d at.because we are bound by controlling,higher authority,we now hold that windsor heightened scrutiny applies to classifications based on sexual orientation.see miller,at see also witt,at.
in sum,windsor requires that we reexamine our prior precedents,and witt tells us how to interpret windsor.under that analysis,we are required by windsor to apply heightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation for purposes of equal protection.lawrence previously reached that same conclusion for purposes of due process.witt,at.thus,there can no longer be any question that gays and lesbians are no longer a group or class of individuals normally subject to rational basis review,at.
having established that heightened scrutiny applies to classifications based on sexual orientation,we must now determine whether batson is applicable to that classification or group of individuals.in,the court did not state definitively whether heightened scrutiny is sufficient to warrant batson protection or merely necessary.see,at n.the court explained that striking potential jurors on the basis of their gender harms the litigants,the community,and the individual jurors because it reinforces stereotypes and creates an appearance that the judicial system condones the exclusion of an entire class of individuals.id.at.it added that,when viewed against the long history of women exclusion from jury service,strikes send a message that certain individuals are presumed unqualified by state actors to decide important questions upon which reasonable persons could disagree.id.at.with concerns in mind and given that classifications on the basis of sexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny,we must answer whether equal protection forbids striking a juror on the basis of his sexual orientation.we conclude that it does.
took batson,a case about the use of race in jury selection,and applied its principles to discrimination against women.as the supreme court acknowledged,women experiences differed significantly from the experiences of african americans,at.the court did not require that,to warrant the protections of batson,women experiences had to be identical to those of african americans.id.instead,what remained constant in the court analysis was its willingness to reason from the actual experiences of the group.for women,a history of exclusion from jury service and the prevalence of invidious group stereotypes led the court to conclude that batson should extend to strikes on the basis of gender.id.at.here also we must reason from the unique circumstances of gays and lesbians in our society.
gays and lesbians have been systematically excluded from the most important institutions of.even our prior cases that rejected applying heightened scrutiny to classifications on the basis of sexual orientation have acknowledged that gay and lesbian individuals have experienced significant discrimination.see high tech gays,at witt,at canby,j,dissenting in part.in the first half of the twentieth century,public attention was preoccupied with homosexual infiltration of the federal government.gays and lesbians were dismissed from civilian employment in the federal government at a rate of sixty per month.michael klarman,from the closet to the altar.discrimination in employment was not limited to the federal government local and state governments also excluded homosexuals,and professional licensing boards often revoked licenses on account of homosexuality.id.in,the supreme court denied certiorari in a case in which a woman had been fired from her job as a guidance counselor in a public school because of her sexuality.rowland mad river local sch,brennan,dissenting from denial of certiorari.indeed,gays and lesbians were thought to be so contrary to our conception of citizenship that they were made inadmissible under a provision of our immigration laws that required the immigration and naturalization service ins to exclude individuals afflicted with psychopathic personality.see boutilier ins.it was not until that the ins ceased to interpret that category as including gays and lesbians.william eskridge,gaylaw challenging the apartheid of the closet.it is only recently that gay men and women gained the right to be open about their sexuality in the course of their military service.as one scholar put it,throughout the twentieth century,gays and lesbians were the anticitizen.margot canaday,the straight state.
strikes exercised on the basis of sexual orientation continue this deplorable tradition of treating gays and lesbians as undeserving of participation in our nation most cherished rites and rituals.they tell the individual who has been struck,the litigants,other members of the venire,and the public that our judicial system treats gays and lesbians differently.they deprive individuals of the opportunity to participate in perfecting democracy and guarding our ideals of justice on account of a characteristic that has nothing to do with their fitness to serve.
windsor reasoning reinforces the constitutional urgency of ensuring that individuals are not excluded from our most fundamental institutions because of their sexual orientation.responsibilities,as well as rights,enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.windsor.at.jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an american citizen.f or most citizens the honor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process.powers,at.it gives gay and lesbian individuals a means of articulating their values and a voice in resolving controversies that affect their lives as well as the lives of all others.to allow peremptory strikes because of assumptions based on sexual orientation is to revoke this civic responsibility,demeaning the dignity of the individual and threatening the impartiality of the judicial system.
gays and lesbians may not have been excluded from juries in the same open manner as women and african americans,but our translation of the principles that lie behind batson and requires that we apply the same principles to the unique experiences of gays and lesbians.gays and lesbians did not identify themselves as such because,for most of the history of this country,being openly gay resulted in significant discrimination.see kenji yoshino,covering,yale.the machineries of discrimination against gay individuals were such that explicit exclusion of gay individuals was unnecessary homosexuality was unspeakable.id.at.in,the court noted that strikes based on gender were a recent phenomenon because women participation on juries was relatively recent,at.being out about one sexuality is also a relatively recent phenomenon.to illustrate how recently the change occurred,in,only one quarter of americans reported knowing someone who was gay.by,this number increased to percent of americans.klarman,from the closet,at.as we have indicated,gays and lesbians who were out were punished for their openness,sometimes through imprisonment or exclusion from civil society.
batson must also protect potential jurors,litigants,and the community from the serious dignitary harm of strikes based on sexual orientation because,as in the case of gender,to allow such strikes risks perpetuating the very stereotypes that the law forbids.it is well known that prejudices often exist against particular classes in the community,which sway the judgment of jurors,and which,therefore,operate in some cases to deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that protection which others enjoy.miller el dretke miller el ii,quoting strauder,at internal quotation marks omitted.these stereotypes and their pernicious effects are not always known to us.prejudice rises not from malice or hostile animus alone.it may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful,rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves.bd.of trustees of of alabama garrett,kennedy,concurring.stereotypes of gays and lesbians depict them as wealthy and promiscuous,and as disease vectors or child molesters.perry schwarzenegger,d.empirical research has begun to show that discriminatory attitudes toward gays and lesbians persist and play a significant role in courtroom dynamics.see jennifer hill,the effects of sexual orientation in the courtroom a double standard,of homosexuality.
as illustrated by this case,permitting a strike based on sexual orientation would send the false message that gays and lesbians could not be trusted to reason fairly on issues of great import to the community or the nation.strikes based on preconceived notions of the identities,preferences,and biases of gays and lesbians reinforce and perpetuate these stereotypes the constitution can not countenance group stereotypes rooted in,and reflective of,historical prejudice,at.
the history of exclusion of gays and lesbians from democratic institutions and the pervasiveness of stereotypes about the group leads us to conclude that batson applies to peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation.
abbott urges us to proceed with caution in light of the significant sensitivities and privacy interests at stake in applying batson to strikes based on sexual orientation.we agree that,as the california court of appeal put it when it extended wheeler protection,the state equivalent of batson,to gays and lesbians,no one should be outed in order to take part in the civic enterprise which is jury duty.people garcia,d.for gays and lesbians,keeping one sexual orientation private has long been a strategy for avoiding the ramifications job loss,being disowned by friends and family,or even potential physical danger that accompanied open acknowledgment of one sexual orientation for most of the twentieth century and sometimes even today.for some individuals,being forced to announce their sexuality risks intruding into the intimate process of that is coming out,a process that can be at once affirming and emotionally fraught.equally important,coming out for many gays and lesbians is a moment of celebrating one dignity and identity.deciding when,and how,and to whom one comes out is a vital part of this process,and it should not be in the name of affording a group that has long been discriminated against the constitutional rights to which it is entitled.
these concerns merit careful consideration,but they do not warrant the conclusion that the constitution necessitates permitting peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation.concerns that applying batson to sexual orientation will jeopardize the privacy of gay and lesbian prospective jurors can be allayed by prudent courtroom procedure.courts can and already do employ procedures to protect the privacy of prospective jurors when they are asked sensitive questions on any number of topics.further,applying batson to strikes based on sexual orientation creates no requirement that prospective jurors reveal their sexual orientation.a batson challenge would be cognizable only once a prospective juror sexual orientation was established,voluntarily and on the record.california successful application of wheeler protections to sexual orientation for the past thirteen years illustrates that problems with administration can be overcome,even in a large judicial system that comes in contact with a diverse population of court users.see garcia,d at.
abbott contends that any exclusion of a juror in violation of batson would have been harmless because none of gsk claims should have been submitted to the jury.it asserts that there was not sufficient evidence to support any of those claims.
we have held that t here is no harmless error analysis with respect to batson claims,turner marshall,cir see also gray mississippi,holding that the right to an impartial adjudicator,be it judge or jury is among those constitutional rights so basic that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.there are two reasons for this.
first,it is impossible to determine whether a jury verdict would have been different had the jury been constitutionally selected.see vasquez hillery,w hen a petit jury has been selected upon improper criteria or has been exposed to prejudicial publicity,we have required reversal of the conviction because the effect of the violation can not be ascertained.second,even if it were possible to find that a jury verdict had been unaffected by the error,this would not render the error harmless,as the harm from excluding a juror in violation of batson is far greater than simply the effect upon the verdict.
in powers ohio,the supreme court held that a defendant may object to the exclusion of jurors even if the defendant and the excluded
