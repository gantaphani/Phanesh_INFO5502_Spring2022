background 
the patent claims methods of analyzing sequences of genomic deoxyribonucleic acid dna.genetic information is encoded in dna,which carries instructions for the development and function of all life.dna sequences spell out instructions for synthesis of shorter sequences of ribonucleic acid rna,which in turn provide templates for synthesis of proteins.an individual complete set of dna is known as his genome,and a particular sequence of dna within the genome that codes for a given protein or functional rna molecule is referred to as a gene.genes are the individual units defining heredity,and a person overall collection of genes is known as his genotype.the site on a chromosome occupied by a particular gene is the genetic locus.genes typically contain both coding regions,called exons,and regions,called introns.exons are regions of the dna sequence of the gene that are expressed,ultimately decoded and translated into the protein sequence.introns are regions that are not expressed these regions do not code for protein.
each individual has his own unique genotype,inherited from his two parents.variation of the precise genetic sequence within a particular gene among different people is known as genetic polymorphism,and the various alternative forms mutations of the gene are referred to as individual alleles.detection of specific alleles can be useful for a variety of purposes,including diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders and diseases correlated with those alleles,anemia,hemophilia,and cystic fibrosis.
in the,malcolm simons,the named inventor of the patent,working with gtg discovered an interesting feature of genomic dna.simons discovered that certain dna sequences in coding regions exons of certain genes are correlated with regions introns within the same gene,regions in different genes,or regions of the genome that are not part of any gene.dna regions between genes are referred to by the patent as intergenic spacing sequences and have been referred to colloquially as junk dna,because,at least historically,they appeared to serve no function.patent ll.
simons found that the correlated coding and regions tend to be inherited together,with only rare shuffling.in other words,the regions are in linkage disequilibrium,meaning that the coding and regions appear linked together in individuals genomes more often than probability would dictate.patent ll.see also,henderson dictionary of biology ed.l inkage disequilibrium is a condition in which certain alleles at two linked loci are associated with each other.the correlated coding and regions may be linked even though the two sequences are located far apart from one another on the chromosome.
simons concluded that alleles of a particular gene may be detected,using laboratory techniques,not by looking for the coding region of the gene itself but instead by amplifying and analyzing regions known to be linked to the coding region.between and,simons and gtg filed several patent applications related to the discovery.one of these applications ultimately became the patent.claim of the patent recites 
a method for detection of at least one coding region allele of a genetic locus comprising 
a amplifying genomic dna with a primer pair that spans a region sequence,said primer pair defining a dna sequence which is in genetic linkage with said genetic locus and contains a sufficient number of region sequence nucleotides to produce an amplified dna sequence characteristic of said allele and 
b analyzing the amplified dna sequence to detect the allele.
patent ll.claim is thus broad in scope it encompasses methods of detecting a coding region allele by amplifying and analyzing any linked region,which could be found within the same gene as the coding region,within a different gene,or within an intergenic region.
according to gtg,the methods of the patent have various advantages over prior art methods involving direct analysis of a coding region.for example,gtg stated that analysis of relatively short regions of sequences,of a size which can be amplified,can provide more information than prior art analyses such as cdna rflp analyses which involve the use of significantly larger dna sequences patent prosecution history,applicant amendment and remarks of,at.
in,gtg sued several pharmaceutical and companies,including merial and bms,in the united states district court for the district of colorado for infringement of the patent.gtg claims against merial and bms were severed and transferred to the district of delaware.gtg alleged infringement of at least one claim of the patent and,in bms case,infringement of a second patent not at issue in this appeal.merial and bms subsequently moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b rule b for failure to state a claim,arguing that the claims of gtg patents covered ineligible subject matter under.
after briefing and oral argument,the district court granted defendants motions,holding that claim of the patent is invalid for claiming a law of nature,which is subject matter.a claim is unpatentable if it merely informs a relevant audience about certain laws of nature,even ones,and any additional steps collectively consist only of,routine,conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community.the claim involved here,claim of the patent,does just that and no more.genetic techs.bristol myers squibb,d,citing mayo collaborative servs.prometheus,d.the district court did not evaluate the validity of other claims of the patent under,noting that gtg had not specified which of those claims it was asserting against merial and bms.

we have repeatedly recognized that in many cases it is possible and proper to determine patent eligibility under on a rule b motion.see,oip,at content extraction,at buysafe,google.in many cases,too,evaluation of a patent claim subject matter eligibility under can proceed even before a formal claim construction.c laim construction is not an inviolable prerequisite to a validity determination under.bancorp,sun life assurance of canada,see also content extraction,at.here,there is no claim construction dispute relevant to the eligibility issue.
section establishes that any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof may be eligible for a patent,subject to the conditions and requirements of the patent act.but the supreme court has long held that this provision contains an important implicit exception laws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas are not patentable.ass for molecular pathology myriad genetics,d quoting mayo.at.phenomena of nature,though just discovered,mental processes,and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable,as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work.gottschalk benson,d.groundbreaking,innovative,or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the inquiry.myriad.at.
in the past several years,most notably in its mayo and alice decisions,the supreme court has articulated a now test for patent eligibility under.the test distinguish es patents that claim laws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas from those that claim applications of those concepts.alice.cls bank int l,d citing mayo.at.as set forth in alice 
first,we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those concepts.if so,we then ask,what else is there in the claims before us we have described step two of this analysis as a search for an inventive concept,an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.
id.alterations,citations,and quotation marks omitted.
as noted above,claim of the patent is the only claim before us.we begin at step one of the test and ask first whether claim is directed to a concept,a law of nature,natural phenomenon,or abstract idea.alice.at.we find that it is.claim is directed to the relationship between and coding sequences in linkage disequilibrium and the tendency of such dna sequences to be representative of the linked coding sequences a law of nature.
claim recites a method of detecting an allele of interest at a locus,a location on the chromosome where multiple variations of a particular gene are known by amplifying a sequence of region dna known to be linked with the allele and then analyzing the region to detect the allele.in somewhat plainer terms,claim covers a method of detecting a coding region of a person genome by amplifying and analyzing a linked region of that person genome.
claim covers any comparison,for any purpose,of any region sequence known to be linked with a coding region allele at a locus.the patent states that t he method can be used to detect alleles of genetic loci for any eukaryotic organism,patent ll,and is generally applicable to detection of any type of genetic trait,id.at ll.the patent does not limit its scope to methods of detecting any particular alleles linked to any particular sequences,although the specification does provide some examples of linked alleles known to be diagnostic of inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.see generally,patent.claim broadly covers essentially all applications,via standard experimental techniques,of the law of linkage disequilibrium to the problem of detecting coding sequences of dna.
the product of the method of claim is information about a patient natural genetic makeup at least one coding region allele.the claim relies on the existence of linkage disequilibrium between the and coding regions,the tendency of these regions to be linked.linkage disequilibrium is indisputably a universal,inherent feature of human dna,and the patent itself notes that the claims are based on this fact.the present invention is based on the discovery that amplification of intron sequences that exhibit linkage disequilibrium with adjacent and remote loci can be used to detect alleles of those loci.patent ll.
claim of the patent is in this respect quite similar to the claims invalidated in mayo itself.in mayo,the supreme court considered method claims that likewise required analysis of a biological sample the blood of a patient being treated with a thiopurine drug and in which the focus of the claimed advance over the prior art was allegedly newly discovered information about human biology the likelihood that a patient could suffer toxic side effects from particular doses of the drug.mayo.at.claim,for example,states that if the levels of tg in the blood of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopurine drug exceed about pmol per x red blood cells,then the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side effects.id.the court concluded that the claims were necessarily directed to an underlying law of nature or natural phenomenon,even if implementation of the method involves substantial human labor and ingenuity 
while it takes a human action the administration of a thiopurine drug to trigger a manifestation of this relation in a particular person,the relation itself exists in principle apart from any human action.the relation is a consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds are metabolized by the body entirely natural processes.and so a patent that simply describes that relation sets forth a natural law.
id.at.we agree with the district court that just as the relationship at issue in mayo was entirely a consequence of the body natural processes for metabolizing thiopurine,so too is the correlation here between variations in the regions and allele presence in the coding regions a consequence of the naturally occurring linkages in the dna sequence.genetic,d at.
in our court recent ariosa sequenom decision,we considered genetic testing method claims remarkably similar to the claim here and found,at step one of the test,that they too were directed to unpatentable subject matter.ariosa diagnostics,sequenom.the claims in ariosa covered a method of detecting fetal dna by amplifying and analyzing fetal dna cffdna sampled from a pregnant woman blood.id.at.the court found that the claims are directed to matter that is naturally occurring and that the inventors there did not purport to create or alter any of the genetic information encoded in the cffdna.id.at.the focus of the claimed advance over the prior art was allegedly newly discovered information about human biology paternally inherited cffdna is to be found in maternal blood using established detection techniques.so too in the present case the patent claim focuses on a newly discovered fact about human biology the linkage of coding and regions of dna,involves no creation or alteration of dna sequences,and does not purport to identify novel detection techniques.
the similarity of claim to the claims evaluated in mayo and ariosa requires the conclusion that claim is directed to a law of nature.the sole function of the primer pair defining a dna sequence which is in genetic linkage with a genetic locus is to amplify a sequence of dna in linkage disequilibrium with a sequence of coding dna of interest.patent ll.the method comprises amplifying genomic dna with a primer pair that spans an intron sequence and defines a dna sequence in genetic linkage with an allele to be detected.id.at ll.the claim is directed to a natural law the principle that certain and coding sequences are in linkage disequilibrium with one another we hold that claim is directed to unpatentable subject matter at the first step of the test.
we thus proceed to step two of the analysis.at step two,after identifying a claim directed to unpatentable subject matter,we must examine the elements of the claim to determine whether it contains an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea or law of nature into a application.alice.at internal quotation marks omitted citing mayo.at.the question is whether the claims do significantly more than simply describe a natural relation.mayo.at.the inventive concept necessary at step two of the analysis can not be furnished by the unpatentable law of nature or natural phenomenon or abstract idea itself.that is,under the framework,a claim directed to a newly discovered law of nature or natural phenomenon or abstract idea can not rely on the novelty of that discovery for the inventive concept necessary for patent eligibility instead,the application must provide something inventive,beyond mere,routine,conventional activity.mayo.at see also myriad.at ariosa,at.s imply appending conventional steps,specified at a high level of generality,to laws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas can not make those laws,phenomena,and ideas patentable.mayo.at.claims directed to laws of nature are ineligible for patent protection when,apart from the natural laws themselves they involve,routine,conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.mayo.at.
we conclude that the additional elements of claim are insufficient to provide the inventive concept
