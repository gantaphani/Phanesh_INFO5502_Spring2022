the question in this patent case is whether the patent in suit is invalid for double patenting.the district court held on summary judgment that an earlier patent,which stemmed from the same application as the patent in suit,could not be used as a reference against the patent in suit for double patenting purposes.squibb pharmachemie,mlc july.because we disagree with a key conclusion on which the district court summary judgment was based,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
research corporation technologies,is the owner of patent the patent,and squibb is the exclusive licensee under that patent.the patent claims methods for treating malignant tumors with certain platinum coordination compounds and compositions containing those compounds in amounts sufficient to cause regression of those tumors.appellant pharmachemie,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration,seeking fda approval to market a drug covered by the patent.research corporation technologies,and squibb collectively brought suit charging pharmachemie with patent infringement under e.as a defense,pharmachemie asserted that the patent was invalid for double patenting over patent the patent,which was issued in and expired in.
the double patenting issue in this case turns on whether is entitled to invoke section of the patent act,as a defense against the claim of double patenting.that issue in turn depends on an interpretation of the prosecution history of the and patents.
the patent can be traced to an application filed with the patent and trademark office in.that application,serial the application,disclosed and claimed compounds corresponding generally to the compounds that were ultimately claimed in the patent.in addition,the application claimed methods of treatment and compositions corresponding to the claims that were ultimately included in the patent.
in the course of the prosecution of the application,the examiners imposed two restriction requirements.the first,imposed in,required that the applicants elect either the compound claims,classified in art class,or the method of treatment and composition claims,classified in art class.in addition,the restriction requirement directed the applicants to elect a single disclosed species for examination on the merits.as a result of the restriction requirement,the applicants elected the compound claims and withdrew the method of use and composition claims from further consideration at that time.the examiner then rejected the elected compound claims on the basis of lack of utility.
in,a different examiner issued a second restriction requirement on the application.that restriction requirement identified four different compound groups within the compounds claimed in the application as constituting independent and distinct inventions.the four groups were organometallic platinum compound s classified in class,subclass platinum compounds containing heterocyclic amines or heterocyclic substituents classified in class,subclass and many various subclasses compounds of the above type with platinum and no l moiety and compounds with platinum containing various anionic ligands.in addition,the examiner expressly stated that the restriction requirement segregating the compound claims from the method of use and composition claims was maintained.the applicants did not file a divisional application in response to either of the restriction requirements,but instead appealed the final rejection of the claims to the pto board of appeals.
in,while that appeal was pending,the applicants filed a continuation application,serial the application,and abandoned the application.the application presented all of the original claims of the application for examination.a new examiner examined the application for restriction only and imposed a new restriction requirement.the restriction requirement differed from the and requirements that had been imposed in connection with the application.the restriction requirement mandated that the claims be separated into four groups,but unlike the restriction requirement,it did not segregate the compound claims from the method of use and composition claims.instead,the first two of the four groups set forth in the restriction requirement referred to art groups that included methods of use and compositions as well as compounds.the first group consisted of o rganometallic platinum compound s classified in class,subclass compounds and class,subclass methods of use and compositions.the second group consisted of p latinum compounds containing heterocyclic amines or heterocyclic substituents classified in class,subclasses and many various subclasses compounds,and class subclass compositions and methods of use.the third group set forth in the restriction requirement consisted of c ompounds of the above type with platinum and no l moiety.the fourth group consisted of c ompounds with platinum containing various anionic ligands.
the applicants responded to the restriction requirement by electing four claims,which corresponded to the claims that were ultimately included in the patent that issued two years later.before that patent issued,however,the applicants filed a divisional application,serial the divisional application.after a preliminary amendment,the divisional application included claims,denominated claims.claims were cancelled shortly thereafter.the remaining claims,in slightly rewritten form,claimed the compound groups and the methods of use and compositions originally claimed in both the and the applications.following the filing of the divisional application,the patent issued,containing the four compound claims that had been elected from the application.
the examiner issued a restriction requirement with respect to the divisional application.the office action began with the statement restriction has been required between the following inventions,after which the examiner divided the claims into three groups claim,which is drawn to platinum ii complexes classified in class,subclass claim,which is directed to platinum iv complexes classified in class,subclass and claims,which are drafted to composition and method sic classified in class,subclass.in the same office action,the examiner then set forth a second,restriction requirement,which replicated the restriction requirement that had earlier been imposed on the claims of the application.the applicants responded to that office action by asserting that the two restriction requirements seemed to be somewhat in conflict in that any invention elected in accordance with the requirements of the first would necessarily involve election of one or more of the groups set forth in the second.in an effort to comply with the requirements,however,the applicants elected claim of the divisional application.
in,after further unsuccessful appellate proceedings,the applicants filed another divisional application,which again consisted of the original application.in preliminary amendments,the applicants canceled the original claims and added,as claims,the claims that had been claims of the divisional application.another examiner was assigned to the application and another restriction requirement was issued.this time,the examiner divided the claims into two groups,one consisting of claim,drawn to platinum iv complexes,classified in class,subclass,and the other consisting of claims,drawn to methods of use and compositions,classified in class,subclass.in,that application matured into the patent.the four claims of the patent corresponded generally to four of the method of use and composition claims of the divisional application.
the district court noted that the question whether section of the patent act is available to depends on whether the applicants were required by a restriction requirement to prosecute the claims that ultimately became part of the patent separately from the claims that became part of the patent.the court concluded that the statutory requirement was satisfied because it is evident that the original restriction requirement remained in effect and required the applicants to pursue their method of treatment and pharmaceutical composition claims in a divisional application.this restriction requirement was never cancelled,revoked,or withdrawn.accordingly,the court concluded,
the divisional application pursuing method of treatment and pharmaceutical composition claims was filed as a result of the restriction requirement and was not a voluntary act over the years,the applicants made repeated attempts to traverse the pto restriction requirement but were not permitted to combine compound claims with method of treatment and composition claims.
because the court concluded that section barred the assertion of double patenting as a basis for pharmachemie to assert the invalidity of the patent,and because pharmachemie abandoned any other defense against claim of infringement,the court entered final judgment of infringement.pharmachemie appealed.
section of the patent act provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
if two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in one application,the director may require the application to be restricted to one of the inventions.if the other invention is made the subject of a divisional application which complies with the requirements of section of the patent act it shall be entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the original application.a patent issuing on an application with respect to which a requirement for restriction under this section has been made,or an application filed as a result of such a requirement,shall not be used as a reference either in the patent and trademark office or in the courts against a divisional application or against the original application or any patent issued on either of them,if the divisional application is filed before the issuance of the patent on the other application.
as section has been interpreted by this court,is entitled to invoke the statutory prohibition against the use of the patent as a reference against the divisional application that resulted in the patent only if the divisional application was filed as a result of a restriction requirement and is consonant with that restriction requirement.see geneva,glaxosmithkline plc,gerber garment,lectra.the district court held that the divisional application that led to the patent was filed as a result of,and was consistent with,the restriction requirement issued in.according to the court,that restriction requirement resulted in the divisional application that ultimately resulted in the patent,because the restriction requirement remained in effect and required the applicants to pursue their method of treatment and pharmaceutical composition claims in a divisional application.although the restriction requirement was issued against the application,and not against the application,from which the divisional was filed,the court ruled that the restriction requirement applied to the later application because it was never cancelled,revoked,or withdrawn.
our review of the district court summary judgment order in this factually complex case presents a relatively straightforward question whether the district court was correct to conclude,as a matter of law,that the restriction requirement was applicable to the application and therefore resulted in the divisional application the district court held that it was and that the patent therefore can not be cited as a reference against the patent for double patenting purposes.pharmachemie,on the other hand,argues that the restriction requirement was not in effect at the time of the filing of the divisional application that matured into the patent,and that the patent therefore can not be said to have been filed as a result of that restriction requirement.
we agree with pharmachemie.the continuation application,which was filed in,began a new proceeding in which all of the original claims of the application were once again presented for examination in,when the examiner for the application issued the restriction requirement for that application,she did not reinstate or even advert to the restriction requirement.in fact,the restriction requirement that she issued at the outset of the prosecution of the application was different from,and inconsistent with,the restriction requirement.the restriction requirement,unlike the restriction requirement,grouped compounds together with methods of use and compositions in at least two of the four invention groups,while the restriction requirement directed that compounds be segregated from methods of use and compositions.moreover,the examiner examined the method of use and composition claims for subject matter of the elected groups readable on the elected species as reflected in the subsequent office action.this suggests that the applicant could have complied with the restriction requirement in a way that would have been contrary to the categories set forth in the restriction requirement.by imposition of a new and different restriction requirement and failing to make any reference to the restriction requirements imposed in connection with the parent application,the examiner made clear that the previous restriction requirements did not carry over to the application.
argues that the examiner in effect adopted the restriction requirement in the course of the prosecution of the application.suggests that the restriction requirement of incorporated the restriction requirement of and thus resulted in a six or restriction requirement,part explicit and part implicit.there is no indication in the record,however,that the pto intended one of the two restriction requirements imposed on the application to carry forward to the application,but not the other.moreover,the record does not indicate that the applicant proceeded under the assumption that the restriction requirement continued in effect.during prosecution of the divisional application,when a restriction requirement similar to the requirement appeared in conjunction with a restriction requirement similar to the restriction requirement,the applicant noted that the two requirements were somewhat in conflict and that any invention elected in accordance with the requirements of the first would necessarily involve election of one or more of the groups set forth in the second.
there was,to say the least,some confusion at various points as to how the various claims should be sorted out for purposes of restriction.but even though at some points restriction requirements were imposed that were similar to,or even identical to,earlier restriction requirements,each requirement was nevertheless separately imposed with respect to each separate application.the record thus does not support the inference that any of the various restriction requirements automatically carried forward,in part or in whole,from one application to the next for that reason,we can not sustain the district court summary judgment order,which was based on the court conclusion that the restriction requirement continued in effect with respect to the continuation application that was filed in.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
in light of the complexity of the factual record in this case,we go no further than to address the ground on which the district court ruled.whether further analysis of the sequence of applications,restriction requirements,and responses by the applicants may reveal other grounds for concluding that the protection of section should be extended to some or all of the claims of the patent is a matter for the district court to address in the first instance.
vacated and remanded.
my colleagues have peered deep into the recesses of patent examination,plucked out a routine and unreviewable administrative restriction requirement for facilitating examination of complex created a new standard of administrative review and a new ground of patent invalidity.i must,respectfully,dissent.
whether or not the patent applicant here in suit was given proper or consistent restriction requirements by the various examiners,the issuance of these actions was entirely discretionary with the commissioner.when the examiners accepted the applicant elections and the divisional applications filed in compliance therewith,these actions are not rulings of law they are discretionary actions reviewable,if at all,under the strictures of the administrative procedure act.it is not disputed that the applicant made the required election for each restriction requirement,and that the divisional and continuing applications at issue were accepted by the examiner as properly filed.the district court reviewed these procedures and found that protected the patentee from citation of the earlier patent against the later one 
a patent issuing on an application with respect to which a requirement for restriction under this section has been made,or on an application filed as a result of such a requirement,shall not be used as a reference either in the patent and trademark office or in the courts against a divisional application or against the original application or any patent issued on either of them 
thus the district court held that under the patent at issue was not an available reference.
if my colleagues on this panel now intend to require that the minutiae of the various discretionary restriction requirements and the acceptance by the examiners of the applicant compliances with those requirements are subject to appellate review,the standard of review is that of the administrative procedure act,not the de novo untangling of internal procedures for which my colleagues remand to the district court.see dickinson zurko,d 
restriction requirements are not appealable within the pto 
the pto has myriad procedures to guide and facilitate the conduct of patent examination.rules of operation are essential to the effective performance of a complex agency with many employees and an enormous volume of work the pto patent examination procedures fill a thick manual of fine print.in addition,pto regulations fill volume of the code of federal regulations.over scientists and engineers apply these procedures to the most advanced science and technology of the age.
early in the evolution of patent examination the patent office adopted the discretionary restriction practice,to simplify the search and examination of complex inventions.in electing to require restriction the patent examiner requires the applicant to select a specified aspect of the claimed subject matter,the examiner having first divided the subject matter into groups of claims based on classification for search purposes.the applicant then selects the aspect to be examined,and usually also traverses the requirement,a formality grounded in administrative protocols.examination then proceeds as to the selected subject matter.the aspects are then removed from consideration in that case they may be rejoined or they may be moved into one or more divisional applications for examination.lest the first patent be citable as prior art against a divisional illogical event that apparently had patent act precluded this event by enacting.thus the patentee was shielded from this unintended substantive consequence of an examination procedural convenience.in applied materials,advanced semiconductor materials america,this court explained 
the purpose of is to accommodate administrative convenience and to protect the patentee from technical flaws based on this unappealable examination practice section,viewed overall,assures that the technicalities of restriction practice are not elevated from their purpose of examination convenience to a potential taint on the validity of the ensuing patents.
in the present case,four different examiners imposed somewhat variant restriction requirements,reflecting their divergent views of how the subject matter should be divided for search and examination.some examiners grouped all of the platinum compounds together and all of the uses together another put the compositions with the compounds,another with the uses another separated the different kinds of platinum compounds another included the corresponding composition and use claims with each type of platinum compound.some required an election of species some did not.
to each examiner restriction requirement,the applicant made the requisite election from among the examiner categories,while duly traversing the requirement.none of the examiners objected to the applicant compliance with any of the restriction requirements.none rejected a later filed application on an earlier one.none of these actions is appealable to the board of appeals or the courts.the court of customs and patent appeals explained that a restriction decision is not an actual rejection on grounds of patentability,but simply a procedural requirement.the court explained in in re hengehold,
on considering,and and the intent unmistakably evinced by the clear language therein,it is evident to us that congress decided not to regard the procedure involved in matters of division or restriction as a rejection.instead,section denominates restriction procedure as a requirement.it is apparent,then,that congress intended to differentiate between whatever requirements and objections an examiner might make on the one hand,and matters involving actual rejections of claims on the other,at least insofar as its provision of statutory rights of appeal to the board accruing from such actions in and of themselves.
at citations omitted.restriction requirements are like other pto requirements that are matters of a discretionary,procedural or nonsubstantive nature.id.at.see also in re harnisch,ccpa 
in the pto,patent applications are examined for compliance with the statutory provisions of title,united states code,as set forth in sections,and.these are considered to be examinations on the merits.there are also procedural questions arising under section and related pto rules concerned with restriction practice.
the only remedy available to an applicant who is dissatisfied with the restriction requirement is a petition to the director for review 
after a final requirement for restriction,the applicant,in addition to making any reply due on the remainder of the action,may petition the director to review the requirement.petition may be deferred until after final action on or allowance of claims to the invention elected,but must be filed not later than appeal.a petition will not be considered if reconsideration of the requirement was not requested see.
such a procedure implements standard administrative practice relative to agency actions.see generally martin occupational safety health review comm n,d because applying an agency regulation to complex or changing circumstances,calls upon the agency unique expertise and policymaking prerogatives,we presume that the power authoritatively to interpret its own regulations is a component of the agency delegated lawmaking powers.
indeed,should there be any imperfections in the agency interpretations or applications of the regulations with respect to the examiner theory of restriction or compliance by the applicant,they are not grounds of invalidity.see magnivision,bonneau,
procedural lapses during examination,should they occur,do not provide grounds of invalidity.absent proof of inequitable conduct,the examiner or the applicant absolute compliance with the internal rules of patent examination becomes irrelevant after the patent has issued.
id.at.such internal agency procedures are not judicially reviewable.see hyatt boone,
regularity of routine administrative procedures is presumed,and departure therefrom,should such have occurred,is not grounds of collateral attack.courts should not readily intervene in the operations of an administrative agency,especially when the agency practice is in straightforward implementation of the statute.
the presumption of validity would collapse if the pto administration of the restriction protocols could be turned into satellite litigation of consequence.in american hoist derrick sowa sons,the court referred to 
the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job,which includes one or more patent examiners who are assumed to have some expertise in interpreting the references and to be familiar from their work with the level of skill in the art and whose duty it is to issue only valid patents
