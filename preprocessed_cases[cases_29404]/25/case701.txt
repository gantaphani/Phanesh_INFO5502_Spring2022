discussion 
merck acquired the patent from its original owner istituto gentili.the patent issued on november.its term has been extended for days,measured as a portion of the time consumed by regulatory review and approval by the food and drug administration.see.the sole claim of the patent is 
a method of treatment of urolithiasis and inhibiting bone reabsorption which consists of administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of biphosphonic acid.
the product has been given the common name alendronic acid.
merck product,marketed under the brand name fosamax,is biphosphonic acid monosodium salt trihydrate,also called alendronate salt.in september of merck received food and drug administration approval to market fosamax for treatment of osteoporosis and paget disease.teva,a generic drug manufacturer,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda to sell a generic version of fosamax.merck duly sued teva in accordance with e.teva defense was that the patent is invalid or not infringed,and alternatively that merck is not entitled to any extension of the patent term because the approved product is not the acid but the monosodium salt.teva stated that it did not literally infringe because the claim requires biphosphonic acid and teva anda is for the monosodium salt.teva also raised the defense that united states patent to helmut blum et anticipates the claim.
infringement 
the district court ruled that the claim is infringed by teva product.the court found that the claimed method whereby biphosphonic acid is used to treat urolithiasis and bone reabsorption disorders such as osteoporosis is infringed by administration of the acid salt.the therapeutic agent of the claim is biphosphonic acid,whose application is exemplified in the specification in formulations that include the salt and admixtures of the biphosphonic acid with a material.the patent refers to formulation of various biphosphonic acids for administration as the sodium salt,in the salt form,in the form of na salt,and as biphosphonic acid,sodium salt.
specification table is headed some typical pharmaceutical formulations containing acid,and shows the diphosphonic acid formulated in three ways as opercolated capsules containing biphosphonic acid,sodium salt as effervescent granulates where the formulation includes biphosphonic acid,sodium carbonate,and sodium bicarbonate and formulations suitable for injection where the ingredients include biphosphonic acid and sodium hydroxide.the witnesses qualified in the field of the invention testified that a pharmacologist of ordinary skill in the field would understand that the active agent is biphosphonic acid,and that the method of treatment of bone disorders includes use of the active agent in the form of the salt.
this usage is clearly presented in the specification.in addition to the formulations in table,patent tables and compare the potency of various biphosphonates that are listed as the acids in the form of the salt,and the specification describes various biphosphonic acids in the form of the salt 
difluoromethanebiphosphonic acid in the form of the na salt 
dichloromethanebiphosphonic acid in the form of the sodium salt 
patent,lines.the specification describes the unusually high activity of biphosphonic acid in an in vivo rat model for inhibition of bone resorption,exemplified in application as the salt.the footer in table refers to the compounds as various aminobiphosphates and includes the compound ahbubp,which is defined as the biphosphonic acid here at issue,although the phosphate terminology generally refers to salts.thus throughout the specification the inventors described the acid active agent as encompassing the acid and its salt forms.
in evidence were several technical publications that describe treatment with biphosphonic acids in terms that include treatment using the salt form.in an article entitled alendronate a new biphosphonate for the treatment of osteoporosis,the caption names the product bisphosphonic acid and figure depicts the sodium salt.in an article entitled rationale for the use of alendronate in osteoporosis,a diagram of the structure of the sodium salt is labeled both as alendronate and as amino hydroxybutylidene bisphosphonic acid.an article entitled advances in the management of paget disease of bone refers to three different diphosphonates by their common names,using a description encompassing the acid and salt forms eudronic acid disodium eudronate,clodronic acid clodronate,and pamidronic acid pamidronate.these are the same usages employed in the specification.
in construing patent claims,the court must apply the same understanding as that of persons knowledgeable in the field of the invention.patents are written not for laymen,but for and by persons experienced in the field of the invention.voice techs.group,vmc.see hoechst celanese chems,a technical term used in a patent document is interpreted as having the meaning that it would be given by persons experienced in the field of the invention,unless it is apparent from the patent and the prosecution history that the inventor used the term with a different meaning.
the district court found that a person skilled in the treatment of osteoporosis and urolithiasis would have a medical degree,knowledge of the methods of treatment of patients with these disorders,and knowledge of the pharmacology and usage of biphosphonates.the court determined how such persons would understand the claim in light of the specification,its prosecution history,and customary usage in the field of the invention.see toro white consol.

the claim herein is directed to a method of treatment of urolithiasis and inhibiting bone reabsorption,by administering an effective amount of the specified biphosphonic acid.the evidence of all the qualified witnesses was that persons in this field would understand that the acid is the active agent and that the acid is administered when it is in the form of the salt.there was no evidence that the claimed method of treatment is not achieved by the acid salt.the record shows that teva and zenith,as well as merck,label their products with the free acid equivalent.
the record contains extensive evidence that persons experienced in this field use the same lexicography as did the inventors in referring to the active ingredient in the form of the salt.see multiform desiccants,at the inventor words must be understood and interpreted by the court as they would be understood and interpreted by a person in that field of technology.recker,an expert on behalf of merck,testified that the patent uses the word acid to encompass the sodium salt,and
