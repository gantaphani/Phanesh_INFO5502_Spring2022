in ruling on such a motion the district court does not determine the merits of the substantive issues since in deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration,a court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.at t,at.aegon very limited claim to the district court was that an arbitrator,not a court,should decide whether the agreement was effective at the time aaa received aegon demand for arbitration and if it was,whether the billing dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision.in light of these questions,the district court did not abuse its discretion by not addressing esi claim that the agreement was terminated by the purported agreement.

the agreement does contain an arbitration provision,and parties give up the right to have a court decide the merits of any dispute which they have agreed to arbitrate.first options of,kaplan,d.congress enacted t
