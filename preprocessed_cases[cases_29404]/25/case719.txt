background 
abbott is the exclusive licensee of the and patents collectively the,respectively entitled quantitative analysis apparatus and method and chemical analysis apparatus and method.the written descriptions of the and patents are substantially identical,being generally directed to devices and methods for performing chemical analysis.the field of the invention sections of both patents described the technical field disclosed in the patents as follows 
the invention is in the field of quantitative chemical analysis,and is particularly useful in the detection and analysis of small amounts of chemical substance in such biological fluids as milk,blood,urine.
the technology at issue involves the reaction of three chemical constituents a substance to be detected called an analyte,ligand,or antigen,a substance that is complementary to and binds to the substance to be detected called a reactant or antibody,and an indicator called a detector,which also binds to the substance to be detected.the patents are particularly directed to chemical analysis related to the immune system and its reactions.proteins produced by the immune system bind to particular foreign substances as a natural defense mechanism.the technology at issue here exploits the ability of the immune system to create proteins antibodies or reactants that bind with particularity to a substance to be detected ligand or analyte.the indicator and the reactant bind to the analyte.the reactant immobilizes the analyte,and the indicator provides an indication of the presence of the analyte.the indication can be one of two types,a qualitative indication or a quantitative indication.qualitative analysis provides an indication of the presence or absence of the analyte in the sample.a quantitative indication provides information about the quantity of the analyte present in the test sample.in the disclosed invention quantitative analysis is performed using a device that includes a number of analyte detection zones,wherein the number of zones in which analyte is detected is directly proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample.
an exemplary embodiment of a test device as shown in figure of the patent is reproduced below.the test device includes a test medium comprised of a filter paper strip that permits a liquid test sample to flow downward therethrough.the test medium contains reaction zones,which include therein reactant,bound to the medium within the reaction zones.as the test solution flows through the reaction zone,the reactant bound therein reacts by binding with the analyte if any present within the test sample.an indicator also reacts with the analyte,by binding therewith,thus providing a moiety derived from the analyte,and desirably a tagged or labeled form of the analyte called an analyte derivative that functions as an indication of the presence of the analyte.
in operation,the liquid sample is applied to the test strip and flows downward.the labeled or tagged analyte in the liquid sample is trapped by the reactant in the test zones.the label or tag associated with the analyte provides an indication of the analyte.the number of zones within which analyte is indicated provides a measurement of the concentration of the analyte within the liquid sample.
on december,abbott filed a complaint for patent infringement against syntron alleging infringement of both and seeking damages and a permanent injunction.at trial the allegations of infringement were narrowed to claims,and of the patent of which claims and are independent and claims,and of the patent of which claims and are independent.claim of the patent is exemplary of the asserted claims of that patent,and provides 
a method for the analysis of an analyte which is a member of a binding pair in a test solution comprising the steps of 
a providing a immobilized reactant in each of one or more reaction zones spaced successively along a flow path defined by a liquid permeable medium,wherein said reactant is the other member of said binding pair and is capable of binding with the analyte to form a predetermined product 
b flowing said solution along the medium and sequentially through the reaction zone s and 
c detecting the presence of analyte,said reactant or said predetermined product in the reaction zone s,wherein the number of zones in which detection occurs is related to the persence of analyte in the solution.
claim of the patent is exemplary of the asserted claims of that patent,and provides 
a device generating a signal indicative of the presence of an analyte in a liquid solution suspected of containing said analyte,said device comprising 
a a liquid permeable solid medium comprising a solution contact portion and one or more spaced reactive zones separated from said contact portion 
b a solution suspected of containing said analyte and having traversed said medium,including said reactive zone s 
c a reactant bound to said medium only at said reactive zone s,said reactant being specific for and bound to said analyte or a reaction product comprising said analyte and a chemical moiety and 
d a labeled antibody specific for and bound to said analyte or said reaction product in said reactive zone s wherein said device provides a detectable signal in said reactive zone s as an indication of the presence or absence of said analyte in said solution.

abbott requests review of the jury findings as to four claim recitations bound immobilized specific for and predetermined amount.abbott argues that under the proper claim construction the judgment of noninfringement can not stand and that judgment of infringement should be entered in its favor or,alternatively,a new trial should be granted.
we must sustain the judgment of noninfringement as to an asserted claim if any one of the noninfringement findings as to that claim is based on proper jury instructions and is supported by substantial evidence.see teleflex,ficosa am.thus,in order to prevail as to a particular claim,abbott must establish as to each ground of noninfringement that either the jury instruction as to that element was erroneous and prejudicial,ecolab paraclipse,or the jury verdict was not supported by substantial evidence,cybor,at,at.
bound and immobilized 
abbott argues that the jury finding of noninfringement based on the failure to satisfy the claim terms bound and immobilized is not sustainable because of error in the jury instruction.
all of the asserted claims require a reactant that is either bound or immobilized.the parties agree that these recitations as properly construed have the same meaning.the district court adopted,and instructed the jury using the following definition of bound 
nondiffusively bound means a reactant immobilized in the reaction zone so as to provide a detectable signal indicating the presence or absence of analyte in the solution,and the reactant is not capable of detaching from the medium,spreading out,and moving along the test strip a reactant is nondiffusively bound only if it is found in such a manner that a sufficient and reproducible amount of reactant remains bound in the reactive zone or zones to conduct both quantitative and qualitative assays.
tr.at.abbott objected to the district court construction,urging instead that the disputed recitations require only that the reactant be immobilized sufficiently to permit detection of the analyte in the reaction zone.appellant br.at.
on appeal abbott urges that the adoption of an instruction including the underscored language was error because it interpreted the claim to require quantitative analysis.syntron urges that the inclusion of the quantitative language in the jury instruction was proper.
the first step in the analysis is to determine the ordinary meaning of the claim terms.digital telegenix,see also inverness med.switz.gmbh warner lambert,vitronics conceptronic.dictionary definitions provide evidence of a claim term ordinary meaning.inverness,at,at.the parties have conceded that the recitations bound and immobilized are to be construed consistently.starting with the words themselves,is an adverb defining the verbs immobilized and bound.webster defines bound as held in chemical or physical combination combined.webster third international dictionary webster.webster defines immobilize as to make immobile fix in place or position render incapable of movement.id.at.the plain meaning of immobilized requires that the reactant not move relative to the medium,and the recitation bound further defines how that immobilization is provided,by requiring that the reactant be chemically or physically combined with the medium so as to be immobilized.
diffusively defines the degree or character of the recitations bound and immobilized.diffusive,the adverb form of which is diffusively,means having the quality of diffusing tending to diffuse characterized by diffusion.id.at.webster defines diffusion as the process whereby particles as molecules and ions of liquids,gases,or solids intermingle as the result of their spontaneous movement caused by thermal agitation and in dissolved substances move from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.id.at emphasis added.thus,a dissolved substance that moves diffusively moves from a region of high concentration to one of lower concentration within the liquid,disperses within the liquid.
taking the words together,the plain meaning of bound and immobilized chemical or physical combination of the reagent and the medium,such that the reagent does not dissolve and move within the liquid from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.this definition closely mirrors the first portion of the construction adopted by the district reactant is not capable of detaching from the medium,spreading out,and moving along the test bears no resemblance to the underscored portion of the instruction.none of the pertinent dictionary definitions supports the underscored portion.the plain meaning of the claim recitation,therefore,does not support the district court narrowing construction.
the usage of the disputed claim terms in the context of the claims as a whole also informs the proper construction of the terms.see rf,pac.keystone.here,the language of the asserted claims suggests that quantitative analysis should not be read as a requirement of the recitations bound or immobilized.in claim of the patent,for example,element c requires detecting the presence of analyte.similar language is found in each of the asserted claims.this language is broad enough to encompass both qualitative and quantitative analysis,and therefore,militates against the narrow definition used to instruct the jury.syntron appears not to argue to the contrary on appeal.rather,syntron urges that the underscored language,in fact,broadens rather than narrows the construction of bound.appellee br.at.according to syntron,the jury instruction did not require quantitative analysis,but rather defined the quality of binding between the reactant and the test strip.we can not agree,as the language sufficient and reproducible amount of reactant remains to conduct both quantitative and qualitative assays is an additional requirement beyond the ordinary meaning of the claim language 
thus,the construction adopted by the district court and used to instruct the jury was erroneous insofar as it included the underscored language requiring a sufficient amount to conduct quantitative assays.because we have found that the jury was improperly instructed,and syntron does not argue that the instruction was harmless error,we can not affirm the judgment of noninfringement on the basis of the accused products not incorporating a bound and immobilized reactant.abbott urges that we enter jmol in its favor instead of ordering a new trial.however,we think the issue of whether jmol or a new trial should be granted is an issue best addressed in the first instance by the district court.moreover,we must determine whether the judgment of noninfringement as to any of the claims can be sustained on other grounds.
specific for 
the jury also found noninfringement of claims,of the patent because it concluded that the accused device did not meet the specific for claim recitation.abbott urges that the district court construction of specific for was in error,and that jmol of infringement in its favor as to those elements should have been entered or a new trial granted.abbott urges that the jury instruction included two errors,the inclusion of the language particular to in the instruction and the failure to instruct the jury that the claim language does not mean that the reactant must bind only one analyte.appellant br.at.
as to the first assigned error,the inclusion of the language particular to,abbott waived this argument by agreeing to that portion of the adopted construction.the jury instruction for specific for stated that the term meant particular to and capable of binding with the analyte or chemical moiety of interest.tr.at.the district court further stated that p articular to means capable of preferentially reacting or binding with the analyte or chemical moiety from among the thousands of molecules potentially in the test sample.id.the disputed phrase was present in the proposed jury instructions submitted by abbott at.abbott also stated during trial the court has defined specific to to mean particular to and capable of binding with the analyte of interest,a nd the plaintiff believes that that claim term is properly defined.tr.at.abbott can not wait until after the jury returns a verdict against it and then on jmol request a different construction by attempting to have the district court delete a portion of the construction that abbott itself agreed to.see interactive gift express,compuserve,holding that the presentation of the adopted construction to the district court constituted a waiver,precluding the party from proposing a new construction either on jmol or on appeal.abbott,therefore,can not assign error to the district court use of a definition including the language particular to.the jury in reaching its verdict was bound by the district court instruction construing the claims.the jury was not charged with the task of reaching a new claim construction through review of the sources used in interpreting the claims such as dictionaries,the specification,or the prosecution history.
regarding the second error urged by failure to instruct the jury that particular to does not mean that the reactant must bind only one analyte the instruction adopted by the district court implicitly incorporated this portion of the proposed instruction.specifically,the jury instruction stated that p articular to means capable of preferentially reacting or binding with.tr.at emphasis added.the jury instruction did not require that the reaction occur solely with the analyte,but rather that the reaction with the analyte be the preferred reaction.thus,the additional language urged by abbott was redundant of language that it also proposed and which the court used to instruct the jury.there was no error,therefore,in failing to instruct the jury that particular to does not mean that the reactant must bind only one analyte.
in addition to errors in the jury instruction,abbott also argues that substantial evidence does not support the jury verdict and that judgment of infringement is required under the district court instruction.even where a party proposes the adopted instruction,that party is not estopped from arguing that the jury failed to properly apply that instruction.moba,diamond automation.in moba the district court refused to grant jmol based on the jury implicit interpretation of the claim construction.id.on appeal,moba argued that because diamond had agreed to the construction used to instruct the jury,it was estopped from contesting the verdict.id.this court reversed,holding that diamond was not so estopped because it was simply arguing that there was a lack of substantial evidence to support the verdict under the district court own instructions.id.as the court explained,diamond did not wish to alter the district court claim construction on appeal,but sought enforcement of the trial court claim construction.id.
here,under the district court claim construction,the jury found that the accused devices did not include a reactant which is specific for the analyte.the undisputed evidence showed that the reactant employed in the accused devices binds identically to the analyte human chorionic gonadotropin hcg and to another protein called luteinizing hormone lh that possesses an identical protein binding site to that of hcg.order denying jmol at.the agreed upon claim construction,however,required the reagent to be capable of preferentially reacting or binding with the analyte from among the thousands of molecules potentially in the test sample.tr.at.the undisputed fact,as admitted by abbott own witness,is that the reactant employed by syntron in the accused devices binds identically with the analyte hcg and another substance lh.tr.at.thus,the jury could have reasonably concluded that the reagent did not preferentially bind with the analyte from among the thousands of molecules.the issue here is solely whether the jury could have reasonably concluded that the reagent did not meet the recitation as construed by the district court in the instructions.we conclude that it could have.on this ground,therefore,we affirm the judgment of noninfringement as to claims,of the patent.
predetermined amount 
the jury found noninfringement of claim of the patent,concluding that the accused device did not meet the predetermined amount claim recitation.the district court defined predetermined amount as an amount determined beforehand and instructed the jury accordingly.tr.at.abbott does not challenge the instruction as such having agreed to the instruction at trial,but for purposes of jmol seeks to interpret the claim language more broadly,t he amount of analyte or bound reactant need not be precisely known or reproducible.appellant br.at.as we have discussed above,abbott can not seek to modify an agreed claim construction on appeal.see interactive gift express,at,at.
the jury found that the accused devices did not include an an amount determined beforehand as required under the construction adopted for this recitation.special verdict at.the district court refused to grant jmol that syntron infringed this limitation.order denying jmol at.as stated by the district court 
the record suggests that the amount of bound antibody in the accused devices is unknown and variable from test to test syntron manufacturing process merely involves placing the capture antibody solution on the test strip,and eyeballing it to make sure that the solution is on it.
id.at.based on this evidence the district court concluded that a reasonable jury could have found that the amount of reactant was not determined beforehand id.we agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could have found that the amount of reagent was not determined beforehand.thus,we affirm the judgment of noninfringement as to claim of the patent.
syntron seeks to alternatively support the judgment of noninfringement as to claims and of the patent based on the argument that the district court construction of the claim term analyte in those claims was erroneous,and that under the proper claim construction no reasonable jury could have found that the limitation was satisfied.
the district court construed analyte to mean the substance of interest,the substance that the test is designed to detect if present in the liquid being tested.syntron objected to this construction before the district court and urges on appeal that the district court should have instructed the jury that the analyte limitation required quantitative analysis.syntron does not argue that the plain meaning of the word analyte requires quantitative measurement.nor could it.although the word analyte is not defined in general dictionaries of the english language,the term is used in specific fields of technology including analytical chemistry,and within that field is defined as the component of a sample that is to be determined.see,douglas skoog et,fundamentals of analytical chemistry ed.the components of a sample that are to be determined are often referred to as analytes.this definition corresponds closely to the definition adopted by the district court,that is,the substance that the test is designed to detect if present in the liquid being tested.
the law is clear,however,that a patentee may be his own lexicographer see renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,and syntron argues that abbott did so here,defining analyte to require quantitative analysis because the patentee explicitly defined the term in the specification as any chemical moiety which is to be measured quantitatively.appellee br.at.however,t he patentee lexicography must,of course,appear with reasonable clarity,deliberateness,and precision before it can affect the claim.id.emphasis added quoting in re paulsen.thus,the issue is whether the patentee here defined analyte with reasonable clarity,deliberateness,and precession.the definition cited by syntron is provided in
