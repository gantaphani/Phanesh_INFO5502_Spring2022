apotex,apotex appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,which found that apotex filing of an abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic version of the antibiotic ceftin willfully infringed patent the patent and patent the patent owned by glaxo group limited and smithkline beecham collectively glaxo.glaxo group apotex,d.while we affirm the district court determination that apotex anda infringes the and patents pursuant to e,and also affirm that the patents at issue are not invalid,we reverse the district court finding that apotex anda filing constituted willful infringement.we hold that the mere filing of an anda can not constitute an act of willful infringement compensable by attorney fees under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,also known as the act.
background 
a.the and patents 
glaxo is the owner by assignment of a series of patents directed to antibiotics in the cephalosporin family.in the,glaxo developed the cephalosporin compound of cefuroxime,the subject of patent.cefuroxime required intravenous or intramuscular injection because of bioabsorption difficulties and was therefore of limited usefulness.glaxo then synthesized a family of cefuroxime esters that were capable of oral administration and obtained patent the patent,which issued may.the patent claimed,among other compounds,a compound known as cefuroxime axetil hereinafter ca.the patent disclosed ca in the forms of an impure amorphous compound and a purer crystalline compound.crystalline compounds contain a structure whereby molecules are arranged in a regularly repeating order.by contrast,amorphous is often defined as the opposite of crystalline and refers to a structure where molecules are randomly distributed with respect to one another.see glaxo group ranbaxy,explaining that amorphous compounds lack an ordered arrangement.
after the issuance of the patent,glaxo scientists continued development on ca because of persistent difficulties with bioabsorption.on july,glaxo filed the application that matured into the patent,a continuation of patent application ser.the application.the patent is directed to a highly pure amorphous form of ca that offers superior bioavailability and stability than crystalline forms of ca.according to the patent,the discovery that an amorphous ca compound provided a better pharmaceutical formulation ran counter to the expectations of those familiar with cephalosporin compounds.patent,ll.the patent issued on december,and expired on july.
the patent has fourteen claims,of which claims and are most relevant to the current appeal 
cefuroxime axetil in amorphous form essentially free from crystalline material,and having a purity of at least aside from residual solvents.
an antibacterial pharmaceutical composition containing an antibacterially effective amount of cefuroxime axetil according to claim in admixture with one or more pharmaceutical carriers or excipients.
id.at,ll,ll.emphasis added.
in addition to the patent,glaxo holds the patent claiming a method for preparing highly pure amorphous ca.the patent,which,like the patent,is a continuation of the application,issued on april.the patent contains a terminal disclaimer and expired on july,along with the patent.the one independent claim of the patent reads 
a process for preparing a highly pure,substantially amorphous form of cefuroxime axetil which comprises preparing a highly pure solution of cefuroxime axetil and spray drying said solution to recover highly pure,substantially amorphous cefuroxime axetil.
patent,ll.emphasis added.spray drying is a technique by which a solution is atomized into droplets and then instantaneously dried,creating an amorphous rather than a crystalline form of the compounds suspended in the solution.see id.at,ll.
the commercial embodiment of the and patents is ceftin,a drug formulation approved by the food and drug administration fda that has been very successful in the marketplace.glaxo has generated almost billion in sales from ceftin in the drug fifteen years on the market.
on april,apotex filed an anda seeking approval by the fda to market a generic version of ceftin.apotex creates its generic drug by dissolving excipients zinc chloride and sorbitol into a solution of water and acetone along with approximately pure crystalline ca mixing the resulting solution spray drying the solution under nitrogen collecting,compacting,and milling the resulting spray dried amorphous particles into granules mixing the granules with additional excipients compressing the resulting blend into a tablet core and coating the tablet.apotex spray dried solution creates an amorphous comprised of ca,sorbitol,and zinc chloride by mass.on november,the patent office issued to apotex patent the patent relating to apotex unique use of zinc chloride as a stabilizing excipient for ca.
apotex anda filing is atypical in that it did not contain a certification pursuant to j a.under the act,most patentees and nda holders must list patents related to their approved drugs in the fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations publication the orange book.b.reciprocally,a generic company has an obligation to consult the orange book before filing an anda and certify that either i no patent information is listed in the orange book for the proposed generic drug ii that the listed patents have expired iii that the listed patents will expire before the generic company markets its product or iv that the patents listed are invalid or will not be infringed by the generic drug a paragraph iv certification.j a i iv.
in the current case,however,ca was approved under,a provision of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act relating to antibiotics.drug manufacturers who utilized section to obtain fda approval are exempt from listing the patents related to their antibiotic in the orange book.correspondingly,anda applicants attempting to market generics of such antibiotics are not required to file a certification under j a.see pub,title i,d,stat.accordingly,glaxo did not list the or patent in the orange book,and apotex therefore did not file a paragraph iv certification in its anda application.
procedural history 
glaxo brought a declaratory judgment action against apotex after the filing of apotex anda,alleging anticipatory infringement and artificial infringement pursuant to e a.section e a provides a jurisdictional basis for a declaratory judgment suit against a generic manufacturer and states 
it shall be an act of infringement to submit 
a an application under section j of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent,i f the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such act to engage in the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.
e a see also glaxo,novopharm,stating that e provided patentees with a defined act of infringement sufficient to create case or controversy jurisdiction to enable a court to promptly resolve any dispute concerning infringement and validity eli lilly medtronic,d explaining that e and e have a very limited and technical purpose and that such purpose is to enable the judicial adjudication upon which the anda and paper nda schemes depend.
on june,the district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing apotex from marketing its generic ca product pending resolution of the case.as part of its order enjoining apotex,the court issued a claim construction for claim of the patent,finding that the phrase cefuroxime axetil having a purity of at least meant that the ca claimed must have no more than degrading,unwanted impurities.the district court further clarified that impurities do not include excipients.this court affirmed the preliminary injunction in its unpublished decision of glaxo group apotex.
after issuance of the preliminary injunction,the district court conducted a bench trial.at trial,the district court found that apotex infringed the patent because apotex anda stated that its products do not contain more than impurities,excluding excipients with respect to the patent,the court construed the term pure in claim to mean the absence of impurities,where excipients are not considered to be impurities.the court then dismissed apotex argument that claim phrase a highly pure solution of cefuroxime axetil required that the solution consist only of ca.instead,the court found that claim encompassed the spray drying of solutions like that used by apotex,which consist of ca and excipients,and found apotex to infringe the patent.
the district court also dismissed apotex counterclaim of invalidity.the district court rejected the evidence of anticipation proffered by apotex witness jay siegel.siegel testified that he was able to use the patent to create highly pure amorphous ca.he admitted,however,to deviating from the example of the patent in which amorphous ca synthesis is disclosed.in addition,siegel had reviewed the patent prior to performing his experiments.both facts led the district court to conclude that siegel experiments were highly suspect and therefore insufficient to prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.
as its final determination,the district court found apotex infringement to be willful and awarded glaxo attorney fees under as an exceptional case.relying heavily on the fact that apotex did not receive an opinion from competent patent counsel,the district court found that apotex did not exercise due care in filing its anda.

infringement of the 
on appeal,apotex argues that the district court erred in construing the phrase having a purity of at least of claim of the patent to cover formulations with more than of other ingredients.apotex argues that claim covers only pure ca and that any other compounds added to ca render the ca impure for purposes of meeting the purity limitation of claim.under this definition,apotex formulation,which contains only amorphous ca,would not infringe the patent.
to properly construe a claim term,a court first considers the intrinsic evidence,starting with the language of the claims.vitronics conceptronic.claim terms should be construed consistently with their ordinary and customary meanings,as determined by those of ordinary skill in the art,llc intuitive surgical.in construing the terms of a patent,the court must also examine the specification to determine whether the patentee used the claim term consistent with its ordinary meaning or acted as his own lexicographer in defining the term.see,renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,at.
in the present case,apotex construction of the phrase having a purity of at least is both contrary to the ordinary meaning of such a phrase in the pharmaceutical arts and belied by the specification of the patent.the specification describes in detail the types of molecules that are considered impurities,including among the typical impurities compounds related to ca such as the and of ca.patent,ll.the patent therefore uses the term impurities in a manner similar to its ordinary usage,where impurity is considered as an unwanted reaction product formed during synthesis.glaxo,d at.in contrast,excipients are inactive ingredients that are routinely and purposefully added to the active ingredient to enhance the performance of the active ingredient.id.at.to one of ordinary skill in the art,excipients are almost universally used with the active ingredient,and therefore do not act to affect the purity of the drug.id.at.this common understanding of purity is aptly demonstrated by apotex patent application for its,which stated that,in the case of pure amorphous cefuroxime axetil,the process of manufacture will preferably be to dissolve the zinc salt along with the cefuroxime axetil in suitable solvent and then evaporate the solvent apotex statement strongly suggests that the purity of ca remains unaffected by the addition of excipients such as the zinc chloride used by apotex in its generic product.
apotex construction also violates the principle that claims should rarely,if ever,be construed to exclude a preferred embodiment.vitronics,at.were we to count excipients as impurities for purposes of claim,we would be forced to limit claim to pharmaceutical formulations in which ca composed at least of the formula.the specification of the patent provides,however,that c ompositions may contain between of the active ingredient patent,ll,ll.the specification also provides a list of pharmaceutical examples related to claim,all of which contain less than amorphous ca.
because apotex construction conflicts with the ordinary understanding of the phrase having a purity of at least,would exclude all preferred embodiments of claim,and is in conflict with the specification of the patents,this court affirms the district court construction of the patent.based on this construction,apotex anda admission that its generic ca products contain less than by weight impurities of ca supports the district court finding of infringement of the patent.
infringement of the patent 
apotex arguments as to the proper claim construction for the patent fail on the same logic as the patent.apotex argues that the district court erred in construing the term pure to mean the absence of impurities,where excipients are not considered to be impurities.under apotex definition of pure,claim of the patent would cover methods of spray drying where the solution to be spray dried contained only highly pure ca.because the term pure should be construed such that it is consistent with the ordinary meaning of that term,we construe the patent consistently with the patent and affirm the district court construction.based on this construction,a highly pure solution of cefuroxime axetil may include a solution that contains excipients along with pure ca.apotex method of producing its amorphous ca product by spray drying excipients and pure ca therefore infringes the claims of the patent.
invalidity 
on appeal,apotex advances two theories for invalidating the and patents that the district court claim construction of purity and pure renders the patents invalid for purposes of,and that glaxo patent enables one of ordinary skill in the art to produce pure ca in an amorphous form,thereby anticipating or rendering obvious the and patents pursuant to b.we hold that neither of apotex theories overcomes the presumption of validity provided to an issued patent by.
apotex argues that the district court claim construction of purity and pure renders the patents at
