carnegie mellon university cmu and three rivers biologicals,collectively appellants appeal from the decision of the united states district court for the northern district of california holding that roche,roche molecular systems,roche diagnostic systems,roche biomedical laboratories,the perkin elmer corporation,and laboratory corporation of america holdings collectively roche do not infringe the patents in suit and that certain claims are invalid for lack of written description.because we conclude that the district court did not err in holding the claims invalid for failure to meet the written description requirement,we affirm the court judgment of invalidity.because we conclude that the court did not err in its infringement analysis,we affirm the court judgment of noninfringement.
background 
proteins,one of the most versatile biomolecules,can serve many important roles,including as signal receptors,structural elements,or enzymes.they are encoded by particular deoxyribonucleic acid dna sequences known as genes.the process by which cells use the information contained in genes to make corresponding proteins is referred to as expression.expression involves two steps,transcription and translation.during transcription,the information contained in a gene is copied into messenger ribonucleic acid mrna.the cell then assembles amino acids in the proper sequence during translation to make the protein based on the information contained in the mrna.
one gene in the bacterium coli,called the coli pola gene,encodes a protein known as coli dna polymerase i.since at least the,the coli pola gene has been the subject of scientific study.the coli pola gene consists of two structural gene or gene coding region and a promoter,which is a dna sequence that is involved in initiating transcription.the expression of a gene can be regulated through the use of a promoter by controlling the level of transcription.
some valuable proteins are either difficult to purify from their natural sources or occur in minute quantities in nature.thus,methods have been developed in the field of biotechnology to synthesize useful quantities of specific proteins by controlling the mechanism by which living cells make proteins.carnegie mellon roche,d.
one method involves introducing foreign genes into a bacterium,which can then replicate as the bacterium grows and divides.such a method involves several steps,including isolating and cloning the gene that encodes the protein of interest and introducing the cloned gene into the host bacterium.the latter is accomplished by incorporating the gene into a cloning vector.certain types of vectors include bacteriophages and plasmids,which are small circular loop s of dna found in bacteria,separate from the chromosome,that replicate like a chromosome.id.recombinant dna techniques are used to modify plasmids by recombining cloned genes and other segments of dna that contain control sequences.the plasmid is then introduced into the host bacterium where it will replicate as the bacterium grows and divides.
the patents in suit,patents the patent,the patent,and the patent relate to novel recombinant plasmids for the enhanced expression of an enzyme,to the preparation by gene cloning of such plasmids,to bacterial strains containing said plasmids,and to methods for the conditional control of the expression of said enzyme.patent.
the patents teach that the enzyme of interest is dna polymerase i pol i,which,as discussed above,is encoded by the structural gene known as pola.id.in the prior art,scientists encountered difficulties cloning pola into multicopy plasmids because the increase in expression of dna polymerase i above the natural level of expression was found to be lethal to a host bacterium.id.the claimed inventions overcome that problem by constructing a novel plasmid containing the entire and undamaged pola gene coding region enzymatically excised from a dna molecule,which contains essentially none of or at the most only a portion of the activity of its natural promoter.id.the patents disclose that severely damaging the natural pola promoter sequence constituted a significant discovery of the present invention since it eliminates or greatly reduces the unregulated expression of pol i,which would otherwise be lethal to the cell.id.by cloning the gene for dna polymerase i into a vector along with a foreign promoter whose activity is conditionally controlled,one can obtain an amplified amount of dna polymerase throughout the specification,the patents teach that the host bacterial strain that is used to achieve that objective is coli.
the patents in suit share a common specification,and the claims are directed to recombinant plasmids that contain gene coding regions for the expression of dna polymerase i from any bacterial source.for example,claim of the patent reads as follows 
a recombinant plasmid containing a cloned complete structural gene coding region isolated from a bacterial source for the expression of dna polymerase i,under operable control of a conditionally controllable foreign promoter functionally linked to said structural gene coding region,said foreign promoter being functional to express said dna polymerase i in a suitable bacterial or yeast host system.
patent claim emphasis added.claim of the patent recites 
a recombinant plasmid providing for activity isolated from a bacterial source,said plasmid capable of being placed in a bacterial host system such that the host system can grow and divide.
patent claim emphasis added.similarly,claim of the patent reads 
a recombinant plasmid containing a dna coding sequence for the expression of dna polymerase activity,wherein said dna coding sequence is derived from a source that encodes a bacterial dna polymerase,said source not containing an amber mutation affecting expression of said dna polymerase activity,such that when said plasmid is transformed into a bacterial host system the host system can grow and divide thereby replicating said plasmid.
claim emphasis added.
roche commercially manufactures recombinant dna polymerases.the accused product at issue in this appeal involves a recombinant plasmid referred to as,which causes host cells to express an enzyme known as thermus aquaticus taq dna polymerase.on august,appellants filed suit against roche asserting that its product,infringes the and patents the district court held a claim construction hearing on january,and issued its claim construction ruling on march.the court construed the term dna polymerase as requiring exonuclease activity.carnegie mellon roche,no.c si,wl,at.roche filed separate motions for summary judgment seeking judgment that claims,and of the patent were invalid for lack of written description under our holding in regents of university of california eli lilly,claims,and of the patent were not infringed and claims,and of the patent were invalid for lack of written description under our holding in gentry gallery,berkline,or,in the alternative,under eli lilly.
on may,the district court granted roche motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.carnegie mellon roche,d.in doing so,the district court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the enzyme in the accused product possessed exonuclease activity.because the undisputed evidence indicated that the accused products lacked that element,the court concluded that summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent was required.
on august,the district court granted roche motion for summary judgment of invalidity as to the patent.carnegie mellon roche,no.c si,wl.the court determined that the specification of the patent made clear that lethality was an essential feature of the invention and thus,under gentry gallery,the claims of the patent must contain that feature in order to comply with the written description requirement.because the claims omit the feature of lethality,the court concluded that those claims of the patent were invalid.
on june,relying on eli lilly,the district court granted roche motion for summary judgment of invalidity with regard to the patent.carnegie mellon roche,d.the court concluded that while the claims of the patent claim recombinant plasmids containing a cloned complete structural gene coding region from any bacterial sources for the expression of dna polymerase i,the application only described recombinant plasmids containing the encoding gene region for coli dna polymerase i and thus failed to adequately support the generic claims of the patent.
on january,cmu initiated a second patent infringement action against roche,alleging that roche infringed the patent.roche moved for summary judgment that claims,and were invalid under the written description requirement of.on september,the district court granted that motion.carnegie mellon roche,no.c si.again relying on eli lilly,the court determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether the patent complies with the written description requirement under and granted roche motion.roche also moved for summary judgment of noninfringement of claims,and of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents,and on february,the court granted that motion.carnegie mellon roche,no.c si.
roche additionally asserted that the patents were unenforceable based on inequitable conduct committed by appellants during the prosecution of each of the asserted patents.the district court held a bench trial on that issue from august to august.on march,the court issued its ruling,holding that roche failed to present clear and convincing evidence that appellants committed inequitable conduct.carnegie mellon roche,no.c si,wl.as such,the court concluded that none of the patents was unenforceable.
on may,the district court entered final judgment in favor of roche.appellants timely appealed the district court grant of summary judgment with regard to noninfringement and invalidity.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
on appeal,appellants challenge the district court grant of summary judgment of invalidity with regard to claims,and of the patent,claims,and of the patent,and claims,and of the patent.in addition,appellants challenge the court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims of the patent and claims,and of the patent.while the decisions of the district court regarding the,and patents were rendered in separate opinions and judgments,the appeals were consolidated for argument in this court and we decide all of them together.we first consider appellants arguments relating to validity.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,reapplying the standard applicable at the district court.see rodime plc seagate.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in addition,in deciding a motion for summary judgment,t he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
written description 
section,paragraph of the patent act sets forth the written description requirement as follows 
the specification shall contain a written description of the invention,and of the manner and process of making and using it,in such full,clear,concise,and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,or with which it is most nearly connected,to make and use the same,and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.
emphasis added.thus,paragraph of requires a written description of the requirement separate and distinct from the enablement requirement.mahurkar,see festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d noting that a number of statutory requirements must be satisfied before a patent can issue including that the patent application describe,enable,and set forth the best mode of carrying out the invention emphasis added see also in re curtis,we interpret,to require a written description requirement separate and apart from the enablement requirement.in re ruschig,holding that the written description requirement is a requirement separate from enablement under,paragraph.
the basic function of a patent specification is to disclose an invention.it has long been the case that a patentee can lawfully claim only what he has invented and described,and if he claims more his patent is void.morse,how.the written description serves a quid pro quo function in which the public is given meaningful disclosure in exchange for being excluded from practicing the invention for a limited period of time.of rochester searle,quoting enzo biochem.to satisfy the written description requirement,the applicant does not have to utilize any particular form of disclosure to describe the subject matter claimed,but the description must clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that he or she invented what is claimed.in re alton,citing in re gosteli,quotations omitted.in other words,the applicant must convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that,as of the filing date sought,he or she was in possession of the invention,at,and demonstrate that by disclosure in the specification of the patent.whether the written description requirement is satisfied is a inquiry that will depend on the nature of the claimed invention,enzo,at,and the knowledge of one skilled in the art at the time an invention is made and a patent application is filed.such knowledge may change as time progresses.see in re wallach,discussing how it is now a routine matter to convert between an amino acid sequence and the dna sequences that can encode it such that an applicant need not specify each possible permutation of nucleic acid sequences for a particular protein.
our case law has examined compliance with the written description requirement in the context of biotechnological inventions in the past.in regents of university of california eli lilly,we held,inter alia,that generic claims directed to recombinant prokaryotic microorganisms comprising any vertebrate and mammalian cdna were not adequately supported by the specification that only disclosed rat insulin cdna.id.at.we stated that a n adequate written description of a dna,such as the cdna of the recombinant plasmids and microorganisms of the claimed invention,requires a precise definition,such as by structure,formula,chemical name,or physical properties,not a mere wish or plan for obtaining the claimed chemical invention.id.at internal quotations omitted.we further held that a description of a genus of cdnas may be achieved by means of a recitation of a representative number of cdnas,defined by nucleotide sequence,falling within the scope of the genus or of a recitation of structural features common to the members of the genus,which features constitute a substantial portion of the genus.id.at.
the and patents 
appellants challenge the district court conclusion that certain claims of the and patents are invalid under in light of our holding in eli lilly.according to appellants,eli lilly is distinguishable from the present case because the invention in eli lilly was tied to a specific cdna sequence,whereas the invention here involves a combination of well known elements that create a generic biotechnological tool.appellants further argue that the court erred by failing to conduct a factual inquiry as required by capon eshhar.appellants contend that at the time of the invention,both dna polymerase i and the pola gene were well known in the art.in addition,appellants assert that the court improperly made factual determinations,improperly relied on the declaration of roche expert while dismissing the declarations of its own experts,and failed to draw inferences in appellants favor.
in response,roche argues that the district court correctly determined that the claims of the patent encompass more than the subject matter described in the specification and thus correctly found them invalid.roche asserts that eli lilly applies to the present case as there was nothing in the eli lilly decision to suggest that that holding was limited to inventions involving novel dna sequences.roche further asserts that the court considered appellants evidence and correctly concluded that they failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.
we agree with roche that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the written descriptions of the and patents fail to adequately describe the claimed invention.we first consider the claims at issue.claim of the patent,a representative claim,recites 
a recombinant plasmid containing a cloned complete structural gene coding region isolated from a bacterial source for the expression of dna polymerase i,under operable control of a conditionally controllable foreign promoter functionally linked to said structural gene coding region,said foreign promoter being functional to express said dna polymerase i in a suitable bacterial or yeast host system.
patent claim emphases added.similarly,claims,and of the patent,also representative claims,read as follows 
a recombinant plasmid containing a dna coding sequence for the expression of dna polymerase activity,wherein said dna coding sequence is derived from a source that encodes a bacterial dna polymerase,said source not containing an amber mutation affecting expression of said dna polymerase activity,such that when said plasmid is transformed into a bacterial host system the host system can grow and divide thereby replicating said plasmid.
the recombinant plasmid of claim wherein said dna polymerase activity includes activity.
the plasmid of claim wherein said activity is under operable control of a conditionally controllable foreign promoter,said foreign promoter being functional to express said activity in said host system.
a method of producing an enzyme possessing dna polymerase activity comprising the steps of 
transforming a recombinant plasmid having a dna coding sequence for the expression of dna polymerase activity that is under operable control of a conditionally controllable foreign promoter into a bacterial host system,said dna polymerase coding sequence derived from a source that encodes a bacterial dna polymerase,said source not containing an amber mutation affecting expression of said,dna polymerase activity and 
allowing the host system to grow and divide for at least twenty generations thereby replicating said plasmid.
claim,emphases added.
the appealed claims of the patent are directed to recombinant plasmids that contain a dna coding sequence that is broadly defined,and only by its function,encoding dna polymerase moreover,the generic claims are not limited to a single bacterial species,but broadly encompass coding sequences originating from any bacterial species.similarly,the appealed claims of the patent are broadly directed to recombinant plasmids that contain a dna coding sequence,again,only defined by function,encoding an enzyme with either dna polymerase or activity.those claims are also not limited to a single bacterial species,but cover all bacterial species.
as a preliminary matter,we reject appellants assertion that this case is distinguishable from eli lilly.contrary to appellants assertion,nothing in eli lilly indicates that that holding was limited to inventions involving novel dna sequences.indeed,in university of rochester,we rejected a similar argument.see rochester,at.
in eli lilly,we held that the claimed genera of vertebrate and mammal cdna were not described by the general language of a patent written description supported only by the specific nucleotide sequence of rat insulin.at.that holding was premised on the basic principle that a person of skill in the art must be able to visualize or recognize the identity of the members of the genus.id.thus,to satisfy the written description requirement for a claimed genus,a specification must describe the claimed invention in such a way that a person of skill in the art would understand that the genus that is being claimed has been invented,not just a species of the genus.
the guidelines for examination of patent applications under the,written description requirement,guidelines,which we find to be an accurate description of the law by the agency responsible for examining patent applications,and thus persuasive authority,provide further guidance for determining whether the written description requirement is met for claims drawn to a genus.the guidelines state 
the written description requirement for a claimed genus may be satisfied through sufficient description of a representative number of species by disclosure of relevant,identifying characteristics,structure or other physical chemical properties,by functional characteristics coupled with a known or disclosed correlation between function and structure,or by a combination of such identifying characteristics,sufficient to show the applicant was in possession of the claimed genus.
a representative number of species means that the species which are adequately described are representative of the entire genus.thus,when there is substantial variation within the genus,one must describe a sufficient variety of species to reflect the variation within the genus.
satisfactory disclosure of a representative number depends on whether one of skill in the art would recognize that the applicant was in possession of the necessary common attributes or features of the elements possessed by the members of the genus in view of the species disclosed.for inventions in an unpredictable art,adequate written description of a genus which embraces widely variant species can not be achieved by disclosing only one species within the genus.
guidelines.at emphases added.
here,while the claims of the and patents encompass a genus of recombinant plasmids that contain coding sequences for dna polymerase or activity from any bacterial source,in contrast,the narrow specifications of the and patents only disclose the pola gene coding sequence from one bacterial source,coli.significantly,the specification fails to disclose or describe the pola gene coding sequence for any other bacterial species.
the district court concluded that the disclosure of the coli pola gene was not representative of and failed to adequately support the entire claimed genus.based on the record evidence indicating a lack of a genuine issue of material fact on the issue,we agree.notably,the record indicates that at the time of the invention,only three bacterial pola genes,coli,aerogenes,and pneumoniae,out of thousands of bacterial species had been cloned,and only coli was described in the patents.according to roche expert,bambara,bacteria constitute a large class of organisms that include thousands,and potentially millions,of unidentified species.in addition,at the time of the invention,persons of ordinary skill in the art knew that dna polymerase i was not a single enzyme,but a family of enzymes encoded by a family of genes that varied from one bacterial species to another.bambara stated that those enzymes were encoded by genes that were distinct from the coli pola gene.
significantly,the written descriptions of the and patents clearly indicate that the pola gene is critical to the claimed invention.indeed,the patents disclose that a significant discovery of the present invention involved the need to severely damage the pola promoter sequence when constructing the recombinant plasmid in order to avoid the unregulated expression of dna polymerase i,which otherwise would be lethal to the cell.patent.the specifications disclose that t he novel plasmid of the present invention contains the entire and undamaged pola gene coding region enzymatically excised from a dna molecule and emphasize that it is an important feature of this invention that the cloned pola gene fragment contains essentially none of or at the most only a portion of the activity of its natural promoter.id.
however,although the written descriptions of the patents emphasize that the recombinant plasmids must be carefully constructed in order to overcome the lethality problem,particularly with regard to the promoter,the patents fail to disclose the nucleotide sequence or other descriptive features for a pola gene including the promoter sequence from any bacterial source other than coli.indeed,in t
