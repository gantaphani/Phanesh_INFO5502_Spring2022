opinion of the court 
a pharmaceutical company holding the patent on a drug sues the manufacturer of a generic version of that drug for patent infringement.the and the generic manufacturer later settle,with the former paying the latter not to produce a generic until the patents at issue expire.in ftc actavis,the supreme court recognized that such a settlement commonly known as a reverse payment where large and unjustified,can sometimes unreasonably diminish competition in violation of the antitrust laws.to answer the antitrust question,actavis explained,it is not normally necessary to litigate patent validity because the size of the unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable surrogate for a patent weakness.id.at.
these two sets of consolidated appeals involve allegations that the companies holding the patents for lipitor and effexor xr delayed entry into the market of generic versions of those drugs.the companies did so,plaintiffs say,by engaging in an overarching monopolistic scheme that involved fraudulently procuring and enforcing the underlying patents and then entering into a settlement agreement with a generic manufacturer.with a single exception,every complaint asserts one of these monopolization claims against the.the cases were assigned to the same district judge,who ultimately dismissed the bulk of plaintiffs claims.
in this opinion,we address two questions of federal jurisdiction.first,do plaintiffs allegations of fraudulent procurement and enforcement of the patents require us to transfer these appeals to the court of appeals for the federal circuit that court has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from civil actions arising under patent law.a.but not all cases presenting questions of patent law necessarily arise under patent law.see christianson colt indus.operating.where,as here,patent law neither creates plaintiffs cause of action nor is a necessary element to any of plaintiffs claims,jurisdiction lies in this court,not the federal circuit.
the second jurisdictional question we confront is confined to one of the lipitor appeals,rp healthcare,pfizer.that case,brought by a group of california pharmacists,involves claims solely under california law and was filed in california state court.following removal the district court declined to remand the case to state court,citing potential patent defenses.that was error,as federal jurisdiction depends on the content of the plaintiff complaint,not a defendant possible defenses.before final judgment,however,the remaining defendants were voluntarily dismissed,thus raising the possibility that,notwithstanding the district court failure to remand the case,it possessed diversity jurisdiction before the time it entered judgment.see caterpillar lewis.but because the state of the record before us is unclear with regard to the citizenship of the parties,we can not reach the merits of this appeal until that question is resolved.we will accordingly remand the rp healthcare appeal to the district court so it can conduct jurisdictional discovery and address the matter in the first instance.
it is necessary to begin by discussing the regulatory framework that forms the foundation for the issues presented by these appeals.
apparently most if not all reverse payment settlement agreements arise in the context of pharmaceutical drug regulation,and specifically in the context of suits brought under statutory provisions allowing a generic drug manufacturer seeking speedy marketing approval to challenge the validity of a patent owned by an drug owner.actavis,at.with the drug price competition and patent term restoration act,stat,as amended,known as the act,congress attempted to balance the goal of mak ing available more low cost generic drugs with the value of patent monopolies in incentivizing beneficial pharmaceutical advancement.king drug smithkline beecham,cir.alteration in original quoting,pt,at,cert.denied.the act seeks to accomplish this purpose,in part,by encouraging manufacturers of generic drugs to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand name drugs so consumers can enjoy lower drug prices.id.alteration in original quoting,at.in actavis,the supreme court identified four relevant features of regulatory framework.at see also king drug,at.
first,a drug manufacturer seeking to market a new,pioneer prescription drug must obtain approval from the food and drug administration fda.see b.this approval process involves testing that is long,costly,and comprehensive.actavis,at.
second,following fda approval of a drug,a generic manufacturer can file an abbreviated new drug application anda indicating that the generic has the same active ingredients as,and is biologically equivalent to,the drug.caraco pharm,novo nordisk,citing j a iv.the anda process furthers drug competition by allowing the generic to on the pioneer approval efforts.actavis,at.
third,the act sets forth special procedures for identifying,and resolving,related patent disputes.id.the new drug applicant is required to list any patents issued relating to the drug composition or methods of use.see b.if the fda approves the new drug,it publishes this patent information,without verification,in its orange book officially known as approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence applications.king drug,at citing caraco,at.in its anda,the generic manufacturer must assure the fda that its proposed generic drug will not infringe the brand patents.caraco,at.one method of assurance is known as paragraph iv certification,whereby the generic may assert that the relevant listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the generic drug.j a vii iv.the filing of a paragraph iv certification means provoking litigation,caraco,at,as the patent statute treats it as an act of automatic infringement,see e a.if the patentee brings an infringement suit within days,the fda is required to withhold approving the generic for a period.if the courts decide the matter during that period,the fda will follow that determination if not,the fda may move forward on its own.see j b iii.
fourth,provides a special incentive for a generic to be the first to file an anda taking the paragraph iv route.actavis,at.from the time it begins marketing its generic,the enjoys a exclusivity period during which no other generic can compete with the drug.see j b iv.this exclusivity period can prove valuable,possibly worth several hundred million dollars.actavis,at quoting scott hemphill,paying for delay pharmaceutical patent settlement as a regulatory design problem.the right to exclusivity belongs to the alone and is nontransferable.see j d.however,does not preclude the underlying from marketing a version of its drug known as an authorized generic during the exclusivity period.see mylan,fda,cir.teva pharm.indus.crawford,cir.see also king drug,at apotex,fed.cir.
in actavis,the supreme court addressed whether settlements in the context are subject to antitrust scrutiny.the court concluded that such settlements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.at.that is so,the court held,because a n unexplained large reverse payment itself would normally suggest that the patentee has serious doubts about the patent survival,thus suggest ing that the payment objective is to maintain supracompetitive prices to be shared among the patentee and the challenger rather than face what might have been a competitive market.id.at.
actavis rejected an approach known as the scope of the patent test,a rule that absent sham litigation or fraud in obtaining the patent,a reverse payment settlement is immune from antitrust attack so long as its anticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent.ftc watson,cir,rev sub nom.actavis.the court concluded that it would be incongruous to determine antitrust legality by measuring the settlement anticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy,rather than by measuring them against procompetitive antitrust policies as well.actavis,at.instead,the court precedents indicated that patent and antitrust policies are both relevant in determining the scope of the patent monopoly and consequently antitrust law immunity that is conferred by a patent.id.the court viewed these cases as seek ing to accommodate patent and antitrust policies,finding challenged terms and conditions unlawful unless patent law policy offsets the antitrust law policy strongly favoring competition.id.at see id.at roberts,dissenting the majority seems to think that even if the patent is valid,a patent holder violates the antitrust laws merely because the settlement took away some chance that his patent would be declared invalid by a court.finally,the court observed,among other things,that it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question unless,perhaps,to determine whether the patent litigation is a sham.id.at majority opinion.such antitrust questions are to be addressed under the traditional analysis.see id.at.
in in re lipitor antitrust litigation,et,plaintiffs are a putative class of of branded lipitor,a putative class of,and four asserting claims.we will refer to these three groups of plaintiffs collectively as the lipitor plaintiffs.defendants are pfizer,ranbaxy,and their respective corporate affiliates they will be referred to collectively as the lipitor defendants.there is also a fourth group of plaintiffs several pharmacists raising claims under california law that we will refer to independently as the rp healthcare plaintiffs.in addition to suing the lipitor defendants,the rp healthcare plaintiffs also named additional parties as defendants whose relevance we will explore in part v,infra.
developed atorvastatin,the active ingredient in its blockbuster drug lipitor.one of the pharmaceutical products of all time,lipitor reduces the level of bad ldl cholesterol in the bloodstream,in partnership with pfizer,launched lipitor in.the two companies merged in,and we will refer to them collectively as pfizer.
in,pfizer obtained the original patent for lipitor.that patent designated patent the patent claims protection for atorvastatin.initially scheduled to expire in may,pfizer eventually secured extensions on the patent term through march.pfizer obtained additional,patent protection for lipitor in december,when the patent and trademark office pto issued patent the patent.that patent claims atorvastatin calcium,the specific salt form of the active atorvastatin molecule in lipitor.the lipitor plaintiffs assert that pfizer committed fraud with regard to the procurement and enforcement of the patent.in particular,the lipitor plaintiffs allege that pfizer submitted false and misleading data to the pto to support its claim that the inhibiting activity of atorvastatin calcium was surprising and unexpected.the patent expired on june.following lipitor launch,pfizer obtained five additional patents,all of which,according to the lipitor plaintiffs,could not block further generic versions of the drug from coming to market.pfizer listed all lipitor patents in the fda orange book,with the exception of the process patents,which can not be listed.the lipitor plaintiffs allege fraud only with regard to the procurement and enforcement of the patent.
after obtaining anda status for generic lipitor in august,ranbaxy notified pfizer of its paragraph iv certifications,which contended that none of the valid patent claims that covered lipitor would be infringed by the sale,marketing,or use of its generic.pfizer sued ranbaxy in the district court for the district of delaware within the period prescribed by,alleging that ranbaxy generic would infringe the and patents.pursuant to,the filing of pfizer lawsuit stayed fda approval of ranbaxy anda for months.
after a bench trial,the district court ruled that pfizer patents were valid and enforceable and would be infringed by ranbaxy generic.pfizer ranbaxy labs,supp.on appeal,the federal circuit largely agreed,affirming the district court ruling that the patent would be infringed.pfizer ranbaxy labs,fed.cir.the federal circuit reversed in part,however,holding that claim of the patent was invalid due to what amounted to a scrivener error in the drafting of the claim.id.at.on remand,the district court enjoined fda approval of ranbaxy anda until march,the date of the patent expiration.also in response to the federal circuit ruling,pfizer applied for a reissuance of the patent to cure the drafting error.ranbaxy filed an objection to the reissuance with the pto.
in july,as the statutory window halting ranbaxy generic market entry was closing,pfizer filed a citizen petition with the fda stating that the amorphous noncrystalline form of atorvastatin used in generic lipitor including ranbaxy,as identified in its anda may be inferior in quality to branded lipitor crystalline form.lipitor.the lipitor plaintiffs claim that this citizen petition was a sham.in may,the fda informed pfizer that it had not yet reached a decision,citing the need for further review and analysis.the fda denied the petition in a decision issued on november.
around the same time as their lipitor patent dispute,pfizer and ranbaxy were also locked in litigation regarding a separate drug called accupril.after ranbaxy received anda approval and began marketing a generic accupril product in conjunction with teva pharmaceuticals,pfizer sued ranbaxy and teva in the district of new jersey.on march,the district court issued a preliminary injunction halting ranbaxy sales of generic accupril,subject to pfizer posting a million bond to cover ranbaxy damages in the event the injunction was improvidently granted.the federal circuit affirmed without prejudice to an ultimate resolution of the merits.pfizer teva pharm.usa,fed.cir.on june,in light of the disputed patent expiration,the district court vacated the preliminary injunction.the only issues that remained contested were pfizer limited claims for past damages and ranbaxy counterclaim as secured by the preliminary injunction bond.
in march,pfizer again sued ranbaxy in the district of delaware,this time claiming that ranbaxy generic lipitor would infringe pfizer two process patents.not long after,on june,pfizer and ranbaxy publically announced that they had reached a litigation settlement which the lipitor plaintiffs allege constituted an unlawful reverse payment regarding scores of patent litigations around the world,including the lipitor and accupril disputes.in particular,the settlement ended the accupril litigation with prejudice,all domestic patent infringement litigation between pfizer and ranbaxy pertaining to lipitor,and all foreign litigation between the two companies over lipitor.as a result of the settlement,ranbaxy received a licensed entry date of november,for generic lipitor,pfizer and ranbaxy negotiated similar market entry dates for generic lipitor in several foreign jurisdictions,ranbaxy paid million to pfizer in connection with the accupril litigation,and pfizer million injunction bond from the accupril litigation was cancelled.ranbaxy also withdrew its objection to the patent reissuance.the pto reissued the patent in march.
as part of the agreement,ranbaxy delayed entry of its generic to march,when the patent was set to expire.due to its anda status,ranbaxy was entitled to days of market exclusivity.the agreement consequently had the effect of maintaining a bottleneck over the entry of generic lipitor from later anda filers.any other generic manufacturer that wanted the period to begin earlier than november would need a court to hold that all of pfizer orange patents were invalid or not infringed.pfizer helped to forestall this possibility,the lipitor plaintiffs say,through a combination of several lawsuits against subsequent anda filers.the fda approved ranbaxy lipitor anda on november,the day ranbaxy license to the unexpired lipitor patents commenced.
beginning in november,the lipitor and,as well as the rp healthcare plaintiffs,filed separate antitrust actions in various federal jurisdictions.the cases were referred to the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml for coordination.in january,the rp healthcare plaintiffs withdrew their federal suit and refiled in california state court raising claims solely under california law.that suit was removed to federal court two months later.
the jpml transferred each case to the district of new jersey,and assigned the matters to judge peter sheridan.see in re lipitor antitrust,supp.in re lipitor antitrust,wl.thereafter,the and plaintiffs filed amended class action complaints the plaintiffs likewise filed complaints joining the consolidated proceedings.the complaints are substantively identical,raising the same two claims first,a monopolization claim under section of the sherman act or a state analogue against pfizer,asserting that the company engaged in an overarching anticompetitive scheme that involved fraudulently procuring the patent from the pto walker process fraud,enforcing the patent and certain process patents through sham litigation,filing a sham citizen petition with the fda,and entering into a settlement with ranbaxy.second,the lipitor plaintiffs raise a claim under section of the sherman act or a state analogue against both pfizer and ranbaxy,challenging the settlement as an unlawful restraint of trade.we will refer to these claims,respectively,as the section monopolization claim and the section restraint of trade claim.
the rp healthcare plaintiffs amended complaint raises an altogether different claim under california antitrust statute,the cartwright act,cal.bus.code et.they allege that pfizer,ranbaxy,a japanese company called daiichi sankyo and an affiliate,and two large pharmacies entered into a per se unlawful market allocation agreement regarding lipitor.this agreement,according to the rp healthcare plaintiffs,extended the life of pfizer patents and fixed prices for lipitor and its generic equivalents at supracompetitive levels.
the lipitor defendants filed motions to dismiss all complaints under federal rule of civil procedure b.on october,the district court denied the rp healthcare plaintiffs motion to remand to california state court,reasoning that there may be many patent issues raised as defenses in this case which would engender federal jurisdiction.lipitor.and on may,the district court stayed proceedings pending the supreme court decision in actavis.in light of actavis,the district court reopened the case and permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs on the pending motions to dismiss.
on september,the district court dismissed the lipitor plaintiffs complaints to the extent they were based on anything other than the settlement.in re lipitor antitrust,wl.in particular,the district court rejected the walker process,sham litigation,and sham fda citizen petition aspects of the lipitor plaintiffs monopolization claims.id.at.the court also granted leave to file amended complaints focused solely on the reverse payment.id.at.

in in re effexor xr antitrust litigation,et,plaintiffs are a putative class of of branded effexor xr,a putative class of,two individual payors,and four asserting claims.we will refer to these parties collectively as the effexor plaintiffs.defendants are wyeth,teva pharmaceutical industries,and their respective corporate affiliates.we will likewise refer to these parties collectively as the effexor defendants.
in,the pto issued a patent for the compound venlafaxine hydrochloride.that patent was assigned to american home products,wyeth predecessor.eight years later,in,the fda granted wyeth approval to begin marketing effexor,a drug used to treat major depression.effexor active ingredient is venlafaxine hydrochloride the patent for that compound expired on june.in,wyeth introduced effexor xr,an extended release,version.wyeth obtained three patents for effexor xr,all of which expired on march.the effexor plaintiffs contend that wyeth obtained the effexor xr patents through fraud on the pto,improperly listed those patents in the fda orange book,and enforced those patents through serial sham litigation.
on december,teva filed a paragraph iv certification challenging the validity of wyeth effexor xr patents.as the first company to file an anda with a paragraph iv certification for generic effexor xr,teva was entitled to period of marketing exclusivity.wyeth brought suit against teva for patent infringement in the district of new jersey.
in october,shortly after the district court held a markman hearing on claim construction,wyeth and teva reached a settlement.under the settlement,which the effexor plaintiffs allege constitutes an unlawful reverse payment,wyeth and teva reached an entry date of july,for generic effexor xr,nearly seven years before the expiration of wyeth patents related to that drug.wyeth further agreed that it would not market an effexor xr during teva exclusivity period.in return,teva would pay wyeth royalties for the license,beginning at during the period.if wyeth chose not to introduce an after days and no other generic entered the market,teva was required to pay wyeth royalties for the next days and thereafter for up to months.moreover,in accordance with the settlement,wyeth granted teva a license to begin selling generic immediate release effexor effexor ir for two years prior to the june expiration of the original venlafaxine hydrochloride patent and agreed that it would not compete with teva marketing of generic effexor ir during that period.teva,for its part,would pay wyeth royalties during the first year and during the second year.
wyeth and teva filed the settlement agreement with the district court presiding over the patent infringement litigation.in accordance with a consent decree,the federal trade commission ftc had the right to weigh in on wyeth settlements and to raise objections in advance.it offered no objection.the settlement was also submitted to the ftc and the department of justice pursuant to section of the medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,pub,stat,codified at note.the district court thereafter entered orders vacating its prior markman rulings,dismissing the case,and adopting the terms of the settlement as a consent decree and permanent injunction.effexor.
following the settlement,between april and august,wyeth brought patent infringement suits against sixteen other companies that sought to market a generic effexor xr.all suits settled under terms stipulating that wyeth patents were valid and infringed.
beginning in may,several of effexor xr filed class action complaints in the southern district of mississippi challenging the lawfulness of the settlement agreement.the cases were consolidated and,on september,the court transferred the action to the district of new jersey.
after transfer,the filed an amended consolidated class action complaint,a group of joined the case with a consolidated class action complaint of their own,four filed complaints,and two individual payors together filed their own complaint.the complaints are substantially similar each alleges a monopolization claim against wyeth under section of the sherman act or analogous state statutes,asserting that wyeth fraudulently induced the pto to issue the three patents covering effexor xr walker process fraud,wrongfully listed those patents in the orange book,enforced those patents through serial sham litigation,and entered into a settlement with teva.the complaints also raise a claim under section of the sherman act or a state analogue against both wyeth and teva,challenging the settlement as an unlawful restraint of trade.as with the lipitor appeals,we will refer to these claims,respectively,as the section monopolization claim and the section restraint of trade claim.though otherwise similar to the other complaints,the individual payors complaint names only wyeth and its affiliates as defendants.they also raise additional claims not relevant to these appeals.
the effexor defendants filed motions to dismiss under rule b,but the district court stayed proceedings pending the supreme court decision in actavis.after actavis was issued,the district court vacated the stay,reopened the case,and called for supplemental briefing on the pending motions to dismiss.on october,the but no other party filed an amended complaint.
on october,the district court granted in part and denied in part the effexor defendants motions to dismiss.in re effexor xr antitrust,wl.it rejected the effexor plaintiffs challenges to the settlement and dismissed with prejudice the section restraint of trade claims.id.at.however,the district court declined to dismiss the effexor plaintiffs walker process allegations against wyeth.id.at.at the effexor plaintiffs request,the court granted final judgment on the restraint of trade claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.
these timely appeals followed.on february,the effexor defendants moved this court to transfer the effexor appeals to the federal circuit on the ground that the effexor plaintiffs complaints assert claims that arise under patent law.we denied the motion without prejudice to the effexor defendants raising the jurisdictional argument in their merits briefs.
the district court possessed jurisdiction,at a minimum,under the following statutes with respect to the lipitor and effexor and,the district court had jurisdiction under and a.with respect to the lipitor and effexor,the district court had jurisdiction under d.and with respect to the effexor independent payors,the district court had jurisdiction under a and.
the lipitor and effexor defendants contend that the district court also had jurisdiction over each of these cases under a,thus necessitating transfer of these appeals to the federal circuit.the rp healthcare plaintiffs,for their part,argue that the district court did not possess jurisdiction at all they say their case properly belongs in california state court.
though our jurisdiction to reach the merits of these appeals is disputed,it is familiar law that a federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.united states ruiz,see also bender williamsport area sch,brown keene,pet.we therefore,for purposes of this opinion,have jurisdiction under.our review of the jurisdictional questions at issue is plenary.in re nfl players concussion injury,cir.
like all other federal courts,we are a court of limited jurisdiction,possessing only that power authorized by constitution and statute.kokkonen guardian life ins.of.as an article iii court established by congress,our appellate jurisdiction is purely statutory.heike united states.
the united states courts of appeals have general appellate jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.but carved out of jurisdictional grant is the court of appeals for the federal circuit.congress vested that court with exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the united states in any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents.id.a emphasis added.the federal district courts,in turn,have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents.id.a.thus,the federal circuit jurisdiction is fixed with reference to that of the district court,and turns on whether the action arises under federal patent law.holmes,vornado air circulation.so if the district court here had jurisdiction over at least one claim in a particular case under a,the federal circuit has exclusive jurisdiction of that appeal.see apotex,thompson,fed.cir.see also james moore george pratt,moore federal practice,ed.the minimum jurisdictional requirement is the existence of at least one claim under the patent statutes,and in a mixed case,the federal circuit has jurisdiction to decide all of the issues involved in the appeal.footnote omitted.in that circumstance,we would lack jurisdiction and be required to transfer these appeals to the federal circuit.see in re arunchalam,cir.per curiam.
the discussion that follows applies to both sets of appeals.consequently,unless otherwise indicated,we will refer to the lipitor and effexor plaintiffs collectively as the plaintiffs and the lipitor and effexor defendants collectively as the defendants.
the supreme court pathmarking decision addressing the federal circuit jurisdiction is christianson colt industries operating.at the time,the federal circuit jurisdictional statute vested that court with exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the united states if the decision of a district court was based,in whole or in part,on.a.then,as now,a granted the district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents.section a uses the same operative language as,the statute that gives the district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.emphasis added.
christianson held that l inguistic consistency requires that courts apply the same jurisdictional test to determine whether a case arises under as it would under a.at.under a,then,jurisdiction extends only to those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.id.at.as in the context,the determination whether a claim arises under patent law must be made in accordance with the rule.and as appropriately adapted to a,that rule provides that the answer to whether a claim arises under patent law must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.id.quoting franchise tax bd.of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust.
for those cases in which federal patent law does not create the cause of action,it is not necessarily sufficient that a claim alleges a single theory under which resolution of a question is essential.id.at.rather,if on the face of a complaint there are reasons completely unrelated to the provisions and purposes of the patent laws why the plaintiff may or may not be entitled to the relief it seeks,then the claim does not arise under those laws.id.alterations in original quoting franchise tax,at.thus,christianson explained,a claim supported by alternative theories in the complaint may not form the basis for a jurisdiction unless patent law is essential to each of those theories.id.
the complaint in christianson contained an antitrust count that the court understood as raising a monopolization claim under section of the sherman act and a claim under section.see id.even though the claims included allegations of patent invalidity,the court held that the federal circuit lacked jurisdiction because the issue,while arguably necessary to at least one theory under each claim,was not necessary to the overall success of either claim.id.
as to the complaint section monopolization claim,the court first identified the thrust of the allegations,namely,that colt,the defendant,embarked on a course of conduct to illegally extend its monopoly position with respect to the described patents and to prevent plaintiffs from competing.id.but because the rule focuses on claims,not theories,the court emphasized that just because an element that is essential to a particular theory might be governed by federal patent law does not mean that the entire monopolization claim arises under patent law.id.at.one such theory involved allegations that certain colt trade secrets were not protected under state law because their underlying patents were invalid.but after parsing the complaint,the court observed that this monopolization theory was only one of several,and the only one for which the issue is even arguably essential.id.because there were reasons completely unrelated to the provisions and purposes of federal patent law why the plaintiffs may or may not be entitled to the relief they sought under their monopolization claim,the claim did not arise under patent law.id.at quoting franchise tax,at.
the same result obtained with regard to the plaintiffs section claim.that claim involved allegations that colt engaged in a to protect its trade secrets.and like the section monopolization claim,one theory of recovery involved assertions that colt patents protecting its trade secrets were invalid.whether or not the issue was an essential element of that theory,the court noted,plaintiffs could have supported their claim with any of several theories having nothing to do with the validity of colt patents.id.at.instead,the appearance on the complaint face of an alternative,theory compel led the conclusion that the claim did not arise under patent law.id.
four working principles underlie the court decision in christianson.first,whether a claim arises under federal patent law is made by reference to the complaint.see holmes,at.second,for jurisdictional purposes,regardless of how a complaint labels its claims or counts,courts are to look to the complaint and its allegations as a whole to identify the plaintiff claims and any theories undergirding those claims.third,in the antitrust context,courts must attend to the thrust of the plaintiff allegations and then determine the theories that explain why certain alleged conduct was anticompetitive.and finally,after distinguishing between claims and theories,courts then must ascertain whether each theory supporting a claim necessarily requires the resolution of a substantial question of patent law.if one theory does not,the federal circuit lacks appellate jurisdiction.see clearplay,abecassis,fed.cir.christianson embraces a distinctly approach to arising under jurisdiction.it is not enough that patent law issues are in the air.instead,resolution of a patent law issue must be necessary to every theory of relief under at least one claim in the plaintiff complaint.emphasis added.
applying these principles,we conclude that the actions brought by the lipitor and effexor plaintiffs do not arise under patent law.we note at the outset a clear and undisputed aspect of our jurisdictional inquiry.federal and state antitrust law,not federal patent law,creates plaintiffs claims.this case,like christianson itself,turns on the second head of arising under jurisdiction.and so we must decide whether plaintiffs complaints state at least one claim upon which their right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.christianson,at.
defendants do not argue that plaintiffs section restraint of trade claims arise under patent law.those claims relate only to the and settlements.defendants instead home in on plaintiffs section monopolization claims.recall that the thrust of those claims is that pfizer and wyeth each engaged in an overall scheme to monopolize the markets for their respective branded lipitor and effexor xr drugs.those schemes,plaintiffs allege,were furthered in part by the companies fraudulent procurement and enforcement of certain patents relating to the drugs.but the schemes were also furthered by the settlements and,in the lipitor appeals,the filing of a sham fda citizen petition.
the fraudulent procurement of a patent known as walker process fraud,see walker process,food mach.chem,recognizing that a patentee knowing and willful misrepresentation of facts to the pto can strip the patentee of immunity under the antitrust laws requires a plaintiff to show,among other things,that the patentee committed fraud before the pto,that the fraud caused the patent to issue,and that the patentee enforced the fraudulently procured patent,unitherm food,fed.cir,rev on other grounds.walker process fraud has for some time been considered by courts to present a substantial question of patent law.see in re ddavp antitrust,cir.in re ciprofloxacin antitrust,fed.cir.t he determination of fraud before the pto necessarily involves a substantial question of patent law.nobelpharma ab implant innovations,fed.cir.en banc in relevant part w hether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a patentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws is to be decided as a question of federal circuit law.and to the extent plaintiffs sham litigation and false orange book listing theories depend on a successful showing of walker process fraud,they too could present substantial questions of patent law.see ddavp,at nobelpharma,at.we recognize as well that the substantiality of these theories may be open to debate following gunn minton.that case held,in the context of a state legal malpractice claim,that hypothetical,questions of patent law that do not change the result of prior federal patent litigation do not present a substantial issue.id.at.we need not definitively address the substantiality of plaintiffs walker process,sham litigation,and false orange book listing theories in light of gunn.for even assuming that these theories do present substantial questions of patent law,plaintiffs right to relief on their section monopolization claims does not depend upon them.
here,plaintiffs could obtain relief on their section monopolization claims by prevailing on an alternative,theory,namely,that pfizer and wyeth monopolized the market in their respective branded drugs by engaging in a settlement.and in lipitor the plaintiffs could also prevail on the additional law theory that pfizer filed a sham citizen petition with the fda.see ddavp,at w hether a fda petition was a sham is an issue independent of patent law.see also apotex acorda therapeutics,cir.
actavis teaches that antitrust claims do not present a question of patent law.see at t he size of the unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable surrogate for a patent weakness,all without forcing a court to conduct a detailed exploration of the validity of the patent itself.the court did acknowledge,however,that questions of patent validity may still arise from time to time.see id.at i t is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question unless,perhaps,to determine whether the patent litigation is a sham.but even where questions are presented,it does not follow that patent law is necessary for relief on every theory of liability supporting an antitrust claim.in the present appeals,s ince there are reasons completely unrelated to the provisions and purposes of federal patent law why plaintiffs may or may not be entitled to the relief they seek under their monopolization claim,the claim does not arise under federal patent law.christianson,at brackets,citation,and some internal quotation marks omitted.these considerations lead us to conclude that the presence of theories of liability supporting the lipitor and effexor plaintiffs monopolization claims vests jurisdiction over their appeals in this court,not the federal circuit.
defendants do not quarrel with any of the principles that guide our analysis.they instead assert that plaintiffs settlement allegations constitute monopolization claims separate and apart from the walker process fraud,sham litigation,and false orange book listing theories.the allegations of fraudulent procurement and enforcement of the lipitor and effexor patents,in defendants view,involve distinct anticompetitive conduct that occurred years before the settlements and,in lipitor,the sham fda citizen petition.
we reject this approach to arising under jurisdiction.defendants in effect ask that we rewrite plaintiffs complaints,which plead related theories as aspects of an overall monopolistic scheme.a monopolization claim under section of
