background 
on july,when she was approximately two months old,ashlyn received a series of vaccinations,including vaccinations against diphtheria,tetanus commonly known as lockjaw,pertussis commonly known as whooping cough,polio,and haemophilus influenzae type b.that same day,the markoviches observed that ashlyn began to rapidly blink her eyes,events that we refer to herein as the eye blinking episodes.the markoviches allege that,at that time,they were not concerned by the eye blinking episodes because they thought the episodes were merely an indication that ashlyn was tired.
the episodes continued after july.on august,ashlyn became unresponsive for approximately twenty minutes,during which time all of ashlyn extremities jerked aggressively.the markoviches immediately called.ashlyn was taken to the fairview ridge emergency room,where she was diagnosed with having suffered a seizure.another seizure occurred about two weeks later,on september.ashlyn continued to suffer seizures almost daily,sometimes experiencing three or more seizures a day,including seizures documented on october,and,november,january and,march and,april,and,june,july,and,august and,september,october and,november,and december.final decision.at.ashlyn also experienced seizures that consisted of eye blinking episodes between and times per day.melissa markovich aff.throughout this entire time,beginning with her hospitalization at the fairview ridge emergency room,ashlyn was examined at several different hospitals by numerous doctors.nevertheless,the seizures persisted.
on january,ashlyn was admitted to the mayo clinic to determine whether a single focus of seizure onset is likely that would be susceptible to surgical removal.final decision.at.during that evaluation,a neurologist diagnosed ashlyn as having experienced four types of seizures repeated eye blinking clonic movement of the face,arm,and leg generalized seizures with or without focal onset and partial motor seizures.id.at emphasis added.following the evaluation,the neurologist discussed treatment options with markovich.
on august,the markoviches filed a petition for compensation under the act,alleging that ashlyn suffered the seizures as a result of her vaccination.on january,the special master held a status conference,indicating that an onset hearing was necessary in order to determine whether the markoviches petition was as having been filed more than three years after the date on which the first symptom or manifestation of onset of the injury occurred.on november,the special master held the onset hearing to determine whether the onset of the seizures occurred on july,the date of ashlyn initial eye blinking episode,or on august,the date when ashlyn was hospitalized and diagnosed with having a seizure.
on july,the special master found that the date of the occurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset of the seizures was july,and found that the markoviches petition was pursuant to a because the petition was filed on august,more than three years later.see special master report,slip op.at.accordingly,the special master dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.id.the court of federal claims affirmed the special master decision on october.final decision.at.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
under the vaccine act,the court of federal claims reviews the special master decision to determine if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.e b.we effectively review the special master decision under the same standard,since we review the trial court legal determination de novo as to whether the special master acted in a manner not in accordance with the law.althen sec y of health human,citing hines sec y of health human.while we owe no deference to either the special master or the trial court on questions of law,whitecotton sec y of health human,we review factual findings for clear error,hines,at.
the vaccine act was established to increase the safety and availability of vaccines.see.under the vaccine act,congress established a vaccine injury compensation program through which claimants could petition to receive compensation for injuries.see a.congress included a table in the vaccine act that lists injuries that may occur as a result of the administration of vaccines.see vaccine injury table.in relevant part,the vaccine act sets forth 
in the case of a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table which is administered after october,if a injury occurred as a result of the administration of such vaccine,no petition may be filed for compensation under the program for such injury after the expiration of months after the date of the occurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injury.
it is not disputed that the vaccines that were administered to ashlyn are listed in the vaccine injury table and that ashlyn suffers from seizure disorders as a result of the administration of such vaccines.the question in this case is what standard should be applied in determining the date of the occurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injury,and whether the eye blinking episode that occurred on july,meets that standard.if so,the markoviches petition is,having been filed more than months after the july,episode.
the markoviches argue that the standard for statute of limitations purposes should be a subjective one,focusing on the particular view of a specific parent.the markoviches suggest that the limitations period was not triggered until they knew that any injury or symptom had occurred,or there was a reasonable basis of an injury that is separate,distinct and apart from a normal activity.br.for appellant.the markoviches assert that the eye blinking episode that the seizure diagnosis can not be considered a triggering event because it was an everyday event,which they thought meant only that ashlyn was tired.the markoviches argue that the triggering event for statute of limitations purposes should be august,when,for the first time,the markoviches became aware of an injury.the markoviches also urge that we follow the logic of setnes united states,which,according to the markoviches,establishes that there must be a recognizable sign of a vaccine injury before there is a manifestation of onset of injury that would trigger the statute of limitations.the markoviches argue that,pursuant to the logic of setnes,the first manifestation of onset,the seizure suffered on august,but not the first symptom,the eye blinking episode on july,should start the statute of limitations because the eye blinking symptom could not reasonably alert the markoviches that anything was wrong with ashlyn.
the government responds that the standard for statute of limitations purposes should be objective,focusing not on a particular parent view but on recognized standards of the medical community.the government argues that,using an objective standard,the court of federal claims correctly held that the july,eye blinking episode constituted the first symptom of the seizure disorder,triggering the running of the limitations period.the government points out that the markoviches own expert testimony proves that the eye blinking episode constituted the onset of the seizure disorder.the government also asserts that the markoviches reliance on the setnes decision,which is not binding on this court,is misplaced and distinguishable.
we begin our analysis with the language of the vaccine act,which expressly bars a petition for
