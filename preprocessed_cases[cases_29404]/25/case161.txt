the issue presented in this appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing a complaint against four foreign banks for lack of personal jurisdiction.the complaint alleges an international conspiracy of foreign banks,corrupt internet payment service providers,and illegal prescription drug dealers pharmacists to sell illegal prescription drugs over the internet.
one plaintiff,john doe,an arlington,virginia resident,purchased prescription drugs online from the canadian pharmacy,paying for the drugs with his visa debit card.when the drugs never arrived,he canceled the transaction at his united bank that issued his debit card,and the bank refunded his payment.thereafter,he received a voluminous number of spam emails for prescription drugs.and the other plaintiff,unspam technologies,doing business as project honey pot hereafter project honey pot,is a delaware corporation that was formed to pursue the enforcement of internet spam laws by tracing and identifying spam emails,including solicitations for illegal prescription drugs.
the plaintiffs commenced this case as a putative class action,naming as defendants two pharmacists,who were russian citizens,and six foreign banks.they alleged that the defendants participated in a global internet conspiracy to sell illegal prescription drugs,in violation of the laws of the united states and virginia.the two pharmacists were dismissed,one voluntarily and the other for lack of service,and two of the six banks were also dismissed voluntarily.the district court dismissed the other four banks for lack of personal jurisdiction.
challenging the dismissal of the four banks on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in failing to recognize that,because the banks were alleged to be part of a global conspiracy,any single member constitutionally sufficient contacts with virginia would subject every coconspirator to personal jurisdiction in virginia.the plaintiffs,however,rest application of their theory of jurisdiction on only supposition and speculation about a conspiracy and the grossly attenuated contacts of its members with virginia.therefore,they have failed to show that any of the banks has constitutionally sufficient contacts with virginia,or with the united states,to subject them to personal jurisdiction in a court in virginia.accordingly,we affirm.
in october,john doe attempted to buy prescription drugs from an online pharmacy called canadian pharmacy.he paid for the drugs with his visa debit card,issued to him by a united bank.after several weeks,when doe had not received his drugs,he attempted to contact the pharmacy directly,but was unsuccessful.he then notified his bank,which credited his account for the full purchase price and assigned him a new visa debit card.since that transaction,doe claims that he has received a voluminous number of spam emails.
project honey pot maintains a network of honey pots,with the sole purpose of tracking and identifying spam emails in an effort to combat such emails.it claims that its network has allow ed spammers,phishers,and other to be tracked throughout their entire spam life cycle.project honey pot claims to have processed,on its virginia servers,spam emails from online pharmacies associated with a global conspiracy to sell illegal prescription drugs over the internet.
project honey pot and doe commenced this action,seeking an injunction against spam email that solicits illegal prescription drugs,as well as damages,and claiming that l awsuits of this kind are another effective way of deterring harvesters of email addresses and the spammers who buy their harvested email lists.project honey pot states that since it started collecting data in,it has identified over million spam servers,over thousand harvesters of email addresses,over million dictionary attackers,and since april,has identified over thousand comment spam server ip addresses.
the plaintiffs claim,based on internet research conducted by it and others and the comparison of telephone numbers and transaction identifiers,that the defendant pharmacists andrey chernuk and boris livshits were behind canadian pharmacy.they allege that chernuk and livshits used not only canadian pharmacy but other similar trade names to solicit the sale of illegal prescription drugs sales made without valid prescriptions and sales of counterfeit drugs marketed with false advertising.the plaintiffs also claim that the defendant pharmacists have a relationship with a internet payment service provider called chronopay and that chronopay,in turn,has contracts with various banks throughout the world to process internet credit card transactions.while the international visa network includes thousands of banks,the plaintiffs claim that six foreign banks have processed a majority of chronopay transactions kittsnevis anguilla national bank,in kitts zao raiffeisenbank,in moscow,russia dnb nord banka,in copenhagen,denmark bank standard commercial bank closed joint stock company,in baku,azerbaijan azerigazbank,in baku,azerbaijan and rietumu bank,in riga,latvia.
because these banks processed a majority of chronopay transactions for illegal prescription drugs without enforcing visa stated rules for rejecting such transactions,the plaintiffs allege that the banks are part of a global conspiracy to sell illegal prescription drugs.as the plaintiffs claim,a customer online visa charge,such as doe charge,is presented by online pharmacists to an internet payment service provider,such as chronopay,which in turn presents it to a participating visa bank in this case possibly one of the six banks,which then processes the transaction through the international visa network,ultimately charging the customer account in his home state in this case,virginia.in short,the plaintiffs contend that the banks participation was essential to the conspiracy.
the plaintiffs complaint alleges violations of the false marking act,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et the federal can spam act of,et and the virginia computer crimes act,ann.et as well as common law claims for conspiracy,negligence,and unjust enrichment.
the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed kitts nevisanguilla national bank and rietumu bank.the four remaining banks filed motions to dismiss pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,contending that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them and that the plaintiffs service of process on them was ineffective.the district court granted the motions of bank standard and azerigazbank to dismiss under rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction by order dated november.additionally,it granted the plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint within days,but the plaintiffs elected not to file one.
a few days after dismissing the two banks,the court ordered the plaintiffs to show cause why the motions to dismiss filed by zao raiffeisenbank and dnb nord should not also be granted on the same grounds.after briefing,the district court granted these banks motions to dismiss under rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction by order dated december.at the same time,it rejected the plaintiffs request for jurisdictional discovery.
the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the district court orders dismissing the four banks for lack of personal jurisdiction.at that point in time,however,the two defendant pharmacists were still in the case.the plaintiffs thereafter voluntarily dismissed livshits,and the district court dismissed chernuk because of the plaintiffs failure to effect timely service on him.
after all defendants had been dismissed,the plaintiffs filed a rule e motion on april,asking the court to vacate its order granting the motions of zao raiffeisenbank and dnb nord to dismiss.they relied,in part,on discovery that they had conducted to bolster their position.the district court denied the motion,finding the following fatal flaws with the plaintiffs arguments 
first,plaintiffs can not show that these defendants have had any direct contacts with virginia.second,plaintiffs new evidence still does not link the defendant banks with virginia customers,chernuk,livshits,or the single transaction at issue in this ca
