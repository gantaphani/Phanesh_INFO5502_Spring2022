this is an appeal from a patent interference proceeding before the united states patent and trademark office pto board of patent appeals and interferences board.the board granted the board of regents of the university of washington uw motion declaring that no existed on the grounds that the invention of the corresponding claims of reissue application the reissue application to eli lilly lilly are separately patentable over that of patent the patent assigned to uw.bd.of regents of the of eli lilly,patent interference,wl bd.int.june.because the director of the pto director interpretation of n as establishing a test for determining whether two parties are claiming the same patentable invention is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation,and the board committed no reversible error in applying the test to determine that the patent and the corresponding claims of the reissue application do not define the same patentable invention,we affirm.
background 
on november,lilly filed the reissue application to surrender its own patent the patent and requested an interference between its reissue application and the patent.the board declared an interference on august,between the reissue application and the patent.the claimed subject matter relates to a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cdna sequence that codes for human protein c,which plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation and generation of fibrinolytic activity in vivo.lilly filed new claims and of the reissue application and requested that only claim of the patent be designated as corresponding to the sole count in the interference a plasmid or transfer vector of foster claim of the patent.
claim of the patent,which is the independent claim from which claim depends,reads 
a bacterial plasmid or bacteriophage transfer vector comprising cdna coding for the amino acid sequence of,starting with alanine,number,and ending with proline,number,said cdna sequence coding for human protein 
claim recites 
the plasmid or transfer vector of claim,comprising the cdna sequence of,from bp base pair to bp.
uw patent was a continuation of,and was accorded the benefit of,patent issued,which was filed on august.lilly reissue application was accorded the benefit of the february,filing date of the patent issued.accordingly,in the declaration of interference in which claim of the patent was the interference count,lilly was made the presumptive senior party.
during the preliminary motions period,uw filed a motion for judgment on the ground that there is no,explaining that the parties cdna molecules have different sequences,chemical structures.the board agreed that the evidence established the differences and found that lilly claims do not define the same patentable invention as claim of the patent.thus,the board granted uw motion for no and dismissed the interference.
after failing to instigate an interference with the patent based upon claim,lilly filed a motion to redefine the interfering subject matter by designating claim of the patent as also corresponding to the sole count in the interference.lilly proposed two alternative constructions of claim of the patent a narrow construction claiming the specific cdna sequence recited in figure of the patent species claim construction,and a broad construction claiming any cdna sequence that codes for human protein c genus claim construction.applying a test pursuant to its regulation,n,the board found that,whether claim of the patent is construed as a genus or as a species,the corresponding claims of the reissue application do not define the same patentable invention as claim of the patent,and determined that there is no between the corresponding claims of the reissue application and claim of the patent.accordingly,the board dismissed as moot lilly motion to redefine the interfering subject matter by designating claim of the patent as also corresponding to the count.lilly timely appealed to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.
ii.standard of review 
an agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference,and that interpretation will be accepted unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d citing bowles seminole rock sand.am.express united states.
this court reviews a board decision pursuant to the permissive rules governing a patent interference proceeding for abuse of discretion.abrutyn giovanniello,citing gerritsen shirai.an abuse of discretion occurs if the decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary,or fanciful is based on an erroneous conclusion of law rests on clearly erroneous fact findings or involves a record that contains no evidence on which the board could rationally base its decision.id.this court reviews the legal conclusion of obviousness without deference.in re gartside.anticipation is a question of fact,and this court upholds the decisions of the board on factual matters if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board findings.in re hyatt.
iii.discussion 
this case presents the question of whether the director test for determining whether two parties claim the same patentable invention reflects a permissible reading of n,promulgated pursuant to a,where a species claim to a presumptive senior party allegedly anticipates a genus claim to a presumptive junior party.we also consider whether the board reasonably has applied the test to dismiss as moot a motion to redefine the interfering subject matter by designating a claim as corresponding to a count.
pursuant to authority granted by,the director established the current interference rules to implement the patent law amendments act of.patent interference proceedings,fed.reg.section of the united states code,title,governs patent interference proceedings,which are designed to determine whether two patent applications or a patent application and an issued patent are drawn to the same patentable invention and,if so,which of the competing parties was first to invent the duplicative subject matter.see conservolite,widmayer.the statutory basis for declaring an interference proceeding,a,reads in pertinent part 
whenever an application is made for a patent which,in the opinion of the director,would interfere with any pending application,or with any unexpired patent,an interference may be declared the board of patent appeals and interferences shall determine questions of priority of the inventions and may determine questions of patentability.
a emphases added.the plain meaning of this statute demonstrates that congress has expressly indicated its preference that the declaration of an interference pursuant to be discretionary.barton adang,the plain meaning of this statute is clear from the use of the permissive term may that the director has discretion whether to declare an interference.see also in re alappat,en banc when statutory interpretation is at issue,the plain and unambiguous meaning of a statute prevails in the absence of clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary.section a states that the board shall determine questions of priority once an interference proceeding is declared.this authority for the board to determine questions of priority,however,does not vitiate the director discretion to begin or discontinue an interference once declared.see a.accordingly,the mandatory language only instructs the board of its jurisdiction over an active interference.see id.
lilly concedes that a permits some discretion,and lilly also does not raise any general challenge to the director reliance on the test to determine whether two parties are claiming the same patentable invention.lilly,however,argues that the director discretion under a is bridled by statutory mandate that requires issuance of only one patent to the first inventor.see g.specifically,where a genus claim to a presumptive junior party is allegedly anticipated by a species claim to a presumptive senior party,lilly argues that the proper test for whether two claims are the same patentable invention is a test,the claimed invention of party a is the same patentable invention as the claimed invention of party b when the claimed invention of party a anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention of party b,or the claimed invention of party b anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention of party 
we conclude that the board properly rejected lilly arguments.under regulations promulgated by the director,an interference proceeding is declared when two parties are claiming the same patentable invention.i.according to the regulations,an exists only if both parties to an interference have at least one claim that defines the same patentable invention.id.j.the phrase same patentable invention is defined as follows 
invention a is the same patentable invention as an invention b when invention a is the same as or is obvious in view of invention b assuming invention b is prior art with respect to invention invention a is a separate patentable invention with respect to invention b when invention a is new and in view of invention b assuming invention b is prior art with respect to invention 
id.n.the first sentence of n states that same patentable invention means that the invention of one party anticipates or renders obvious the other party invention.section n also defines separate patentable invention to mean that the invention of one party is new and nonobvious in view of the other party invention.
the director,in an amicus brief,interprets n as requiring a test to determine whether two parties claim the same patentable invention.the test assures that an interference proceeding will be conducted only when warranted.the director approach rejects a wooden requirement under the test of declaring an interference proceeding where a species claim allegedly anticipates a genus claim.if the interference proceeding,however,leads to a conclusion that the genus claim was invented first,it is possible that both the genus and the species are separate patentable inventions.thus,the director test avoids the proliferation of unnecessary,wasteful interference proceedings concluding that both parties are entitled to patents in situations in which the claimed inventions do not define the same patentable invention,but merely overlap in scope.this is the clear application of discretion that is inherent in the authority granted pursuant to a of the statute.
because the test is an interpretation of the director own regulations,the director interpretation of them is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.citing seminole,at.see also united states cleveland indians baseball,d giving substantial judicial deference to the internal revenue service reasonable longstanding interpretation of its own regulations thomas jefferson shalala,d noting that the agency interpretation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation quoting seminole,at.udall tallman,d stating that when an interpretation of an administrative regulation is required,a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt citing seminole,at.see generally richard pierce,administrative law treatise ed.we have formulated the degree of this deference,under our jurisprudence,variously as substantial,am.express,at,and,in the context of a ruling of the board,as considerable respect,kubota shibuya,citing ford motor credit milhollin,d.see also bayer ag carlsbad,morganroth quigg,stating that the director interpretation of the regulatory provisions governing abandonment and revival of patent applications is entitled to considerable deference.but see dethmers automatic equip,subjecting the pto interpretation of its own reissue rule to a de novo standard of review,cert.denied,d.
the deferential standard of seminole is easily met here the critical phrase assuming invention b is the prior art with respect to invention a comfortably bears the meaning the director assigns.because it is not conclusively known which of the two inventions is the prior art and the critical phrase does not require that invention b is the invention of the presumptive senior party,the director may interpret the phrase to mean that both uw and lilly may be the assumed prior art invention thus,the claimed invention of party b uw is assumed to be prior art party a lilly and the claimed invention of party b lilly is assumed to be prior art party a uw.thus,under the director chosen test,to determine whether two parties are claiming the same patentable invention,the claimed invention of party b uw must anticipate or render obvious the claimed invention of party a lilly and the claimed invention of party b lilly must anticipate or render obvious the claimed invention of party a uw.in the circumstances of this case,where the agency interpretation of its own regulation is at least as plausible as competing ones,there is little,if any,reason not to defer to the agency construction.
besides being textually defensible,the director reading of n comports with the pto notice of final rule that accompanied the promulgation of the regulation.fed.reg.at.according to the notice of final rule,the pto addressed the issue of genus and species claims by stating that genus and species claims define separate patentable inventions if the species is separately patentable from the genus.id.at t he standard of patentability will not be applied on a mutual basis.thus,if a species is patentable over a genus,the species is a separate patentable invention from the genus.
furthermore,the test for determining whether two parties claim the same patentable invention is reasonable and consistent in light of the precedent concerning inventions.on the one hand,this court has explained,case law firmly establishes that a later genus claim limitation is anticipated by,and therefore not patentably distinct from,an earlier species claim.eli lilly barr,cert.denied,d.on the other hand,earlier disclosure of a genus does not necessarily prevent patenting a species member of the genus.see,squibb ben venue.
a primary issue unleashed by application of the test has been whether,under that test,an should exist whenever there exists a theoretical possibility of an interference,or rather only when the parties claims define the same patentable invention.this court case law suggests that the test is because it concludes there is no even if an interference proceeding would have led to the conclusion that the species was invented before the genus.on the other hand,the test is because it concludes there is an even if an interference proceeding would have led to the conclusion that the genus was invented before,and separately patentable from,the species.section n reasonably can be interpreted to require an election between either a or a test.the director has reasonably opted for a test to avoid subjecting broad patents for basic inventions to interferences,some of which would have been unnecessary.to read the regulation,as lilly and our colleague in dissent urge,to require the continuance of an interference proceeding where a genus claim to a presumptive junior party is allegedly anticipated by a species claim to a presumptive senior party,is a plausible alternative reading,but a reading which in the director discretion he has chosen not to accept.
while lilly objections would perhaps support an alternative test where a species claim to a presumptive senior party allegedly anticipates a genus claim to a presumptive junior party,we can not conclude that they compel it.the director view that a presumptive senior party with a species claim and a presumptive junior party with a genus claim are not so differently situated with regard to determining a separate patentable invention as to require revision of the director test simply can not be said to be unreasonable.accordingly,we hold that the director interpretation of n as establishing a test for determining whether two parties are claiming the same patentable invention is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the language of the regulation.
