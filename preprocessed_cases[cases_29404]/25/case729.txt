the issue in this case is whether california medical marijuana statutes preempt a local ban on facilities that distribute medical marijuana.we conclude they do not.
both federal and california laws generally prohibit the use,possession,cultivation,transportation,and furnishing of marijuana.however,california statutes,the compassionate use act of cua health,added by initiative,as approved by voters,and the more recent medical marijuana program mmp et,added by stats,ch,have removed certain state law obstacles from the ability of qualified patients to obtain and use marijuana for legitimate medical purposes.among other things,these statutes exempt the collective or cooperative cultiva tion of medical marijuana by qualified patients and their designated caregivers from prosecution or abatement under specified state criminal and nuisance laws that would otherwise prohibit those activities.
the california constitution recognizes the authority of cities and counties to make and enforce,within their borders,all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi.this inherent local police power includes broad authority to determine,for purposes of the public health,safety,and welfare,the appropriate uses of land within a local jurisdiction borders,and preemption by state law is not lightly presumed.
in the exercise of its inherent land use power,the city of riverside city has declared,by zoning ordinances,that a m edical marijuana dispensary a facility where marijuana is made available for medical purposes in accordance with the cua riverside municipal code rmc,is a prohibited use of land within the city and may be abated as a public nuisance.rmc,e,q,table the city ordinance also bans,and declares a nuisance,any use that is prohibited by federal or state law.rmc,e,q.
invoking these provisions,the city brought a nuisance action against a facility operated by defendants.the trial court issued a preliminary injunction against the distribution of marijuana from the facility.the court of appeal affirmed the injunctive order.challenging the injunction,defendants urge,as they did below,that the city total ban on facilities that cultivate and distribute medical marijuana in compliance with the cua and the mmp is invalid.defendants insist the local ban is in conflict with,and thus preempted by,those state statutes.
as we will explain,we disagree.we have consistently maintained that the cua and the mmp are but incremental steps toward freer access to medical marijuana,and the scope of these statutes is limited and circumscribed.they merely declare that the conduct they describe can not lead to arrest or conviction,or be abated as a nuisance,as violations of enumerated provisions of the health and safety code.nothing in the cua or the mmp expressly or impliedly limits the inherent authority of a local jurisdiction,by its own ordinances,to regulate the use of its land,including the authority to provide that facilities for the distribution of medical marijuana will not be permitted to operate within its borders.we must therefore reject defendants preemption argument,and must affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
legal and factual background 
medical marijuana laws.
the federal controlled substances act csa et prohibits,except for certain research purposes,the possession,distribution,and manufacture of marijuana,c schedule i,par.c,a,a.the csa finds that marijuana is a drug with no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states,b b,and there is no medical necessity exception to prosecution and conviction under the federal act united states oakland cannabis buyers cooperative,d.
california statutes similarly specify that,except as authorized by law,the possession,cultivation,harvesting,or processing,possession for sale,and transportation,administration,or furnishing of marijuana are state criminal violations.state law further punishes one who maintains a place for the purpose of unlawfully selling,using,or furnishing,or who knowingly makes available a place for storing,manufacturing,or distributing,certain controlled substances.the drug den abatement law additionally provides that every place used to unlawfully sell,serve,store,keep,manufacture,or give away certain controlled substances is a nuisance that shall be enjoined,abated,and prevented,and for which damages may be recovered.in each instance,the controlled substances in question include marijuana.see,subd.d.
however,california voters and legislators have adopted limited exceptions to the sanctions of this state criminal and nuisance laws in cases where marijuana is possessed,cultivated,distributed,and transported for medical purposes.in,the electorate enacted the cua.this initiative statute provides that the state law proscriptions against possession and cultivation of marijuana,shall not apply to a patient,or the patient designated primary caregiver,who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the patient personal medical purposes upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician,subd.d.
in,the legislature adopted the mmp.one purpose of this statute was to e nhance the access of patients and caregivers to medical marijuana through collective,cooperative cultivation projects.stats,ch,subd.b.accordingly,the mmp provides,among other things,that q ualified patients and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients,who associate within the state of california in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes,shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under s ection possession,cultivation,harvesting,and processing,possession for sale,transportation,sale,furnishing,or administration,maintenance of place for purpose of unlawful sale,use,or furnishing,making place available for purpose of unlawful manufacture,storage,or distribution,or place used for unlawful sale,serving,storage,manufacture,or furnishing as statutory nuisance.
the cua and the mmp have no effect on the federal enforceability of the csa in california.the csa prohibitions on the possession,distribution,or manufacture of marijuana remain fully enforceable in this jurisdiction.gonzalez raich,d.
riverside ordinances.
as noted above,the riverside ordinances at issue declare as a prohibited use within any city zoning classification a m edical marijuana dispensary defined as a facility where marijuana is made available in accordance with the cua and any use prohibited by state or federal law.rmc,table a.the rmc further provides that any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of the ordinance is a public nuisance which may be abated by the city,e,
c.the instant litigation.
since,defendant inland empire patients health and wellness center,inland empire,has operated a medical marijuana distribution facility in riverside.defendants meneleo carlos and filomena carlos the carloses are the owners and lessors of the riverside property on which inland empire facility is located.their mortgage on the property is financed by defendant east west bancorp,bancorp.defendant lanny swerdlow is the lessee of the property,and defendant angel city west,angel,provides the property with management services.swerdlow is also a registered nurse and the manager of an immediately adjacent medical clinic doing business as thcf health and wellness center thcf.though thcf has no direct legal link to inland empire,the two facilities are closely associated,and thcf provides referrals to inland empire upon patient request.defendant william joseph sump ii is a board member of inland empire and the general manager of inland empire riverside facility.
in january,the planning division of riverside community development department notified swerdlow by letter that the definition of medical marijuana dispensary in riverside zoning ordinances is an definition,referring to all three types of medical marijuana facilities,a dispensary,a collective and a cooperative,and that,as a consequence,all three facilities are banned in the city of riverside.in may,the city filed a complaint against the carloses,bancorp,swerdlow,angel,thcf,sump,and various doe defendants for injunctive relief to abate a public nuisance.inland empire was later substituted by name for one of the doe defendants.the complaint alleged that defendants were operating a medical marijuana distribution facility in violation of the zoning provisions of the rmc 
thereafter,the city moved for a preliminary injunction against operation of inland empire facility after a hearing,the trial court granted the preliminary injunction,prohibiting the defendants and all persons associated with them,during the pendency of the action,from using,or allowing use of,the subject property to conduct any activities or operations related to the distribution of marijuana.
the trial court found the case was controlled by city of claremont kruse th,d kruse,which held that cities may abate,as nuisances,uses in violation of their zoning and licensing regulations,and that neither the cua nor the mmp preempts local zoning and licensing regulation of facilities that furnish,distribute,or make available medical marijuana including,in kruse itself,a moratorium on all such facilities within city boundaries.moreover,though the court insisted it was not holding that federal prohibitions on the possession,distribution,or cultivation of marijuana preempted state medical marijuana laws,it nonetheless concluded that riverside could use its zoning regulations to prohibit the activity of dispensing medical marijuana especially given the conflict between state and federal laws.
the court of appeal affirmed the order.the appellate court agreed with defendants that the city could not assert federal preemption of state law as authority for its total ban on medical marijuana dispensing facilities.however,the court rejected defendants argument that riverside zoning prohibition of such facilities was preempted by state law,the cua and the mmp.in the court of appeal view,riverside provisions do not duplicate or contradict the state statutes concerning medical marijuana,nor do they invade a field expressly or impliedly occupied by those laws.
we granted review.we now conclude the court of appeal judgment must be affirmed.
principles of preemption.
as indicated above,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi.land use regulation in california historically has been a function of local government under the grant of police power contained in article xi,section we have recognized that a city or county power to control its own land use decisions derives from this inherent police power,not from the delegation of authority by the state.big creek lumber county of santa cruz cal th,d,big creek lumber,fn.omitted.consistent with this principle,when local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control,such as the location of particular land uses,california courts will presume,absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,that such regulation is not preempted by state statute,at,d,see it solano county bd.of supervisors cal th,d.
however,local legislation that conflicts with state law is void,sherwin williams city of los angeles cal th,d,sherwin williams.a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.ibid.
local legislation is duplicative of general law when it is coextensive therewith.citation.
similarly,local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.citation.
finally,local legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area citation,or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality.citations.sherwin williams,supra,cal th,d,see great western shows,county of los angeles cal th,d,great western shows california grocers city of los angeles cal th,d.
the contradictory and inimical form of preemption does not apply unless the ordinance directly requires what the state statute forbids or prohibits what the state enactment demands.big creek lumber,supra,cal th,d,great western shows,supra,cal th,d,sherwin williams,supra,cal th,d.thus,no inimical conflict will be found where it is reasonably possible to comply with both the state and local laws.
in addition,w e have been particularly reluctant to infer legislative intent to preempt a field covered by municipal regulation when there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.big creek lumber,supra,cal th,d,quoting fisher city of berkeley cal d.the common thread of the cases is that if there is a significant local interest to be served which may differ from one locality to another then the presumption favors the validity of the local ordinance against an attack of state preemption.big creek lumber,supra,at,d,quoting gluck city of los angeles d.
b.the cua and the mmp do not preempt riverside ban.
when they adopted the cua in,the voters declared their intent t o ensure that seriously ill californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon a physician recommendation,subd.b a,t o ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction,subd.b b,and t o encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of the substance,subd.b c.
but the operative steps the electorate took toward these goals were modest.in its substantive provisions,the cua simply declares that no physician may be punished or denied any right or privilege under state law for recommending medical marijuana to a patient,subd.c,and two specific state statutes prohibiting the possession and cultivation of marijuana,sections and respectively,shall not apply to a patient,or the patient designated primary caregiver,who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the patient personal medical use upon a physician recommendation or approval,subd.d.
when it later adopted the mmp,the legislature declared this statute was intended,among other things,to c larify the scope of the application of the cua and facilitate the prompt identification of qualified medical marijuana patients and their designated primary caregivers in order to protect them from unnecessary arrest and prosecution for marijuana offenses,to p romote uniform and consistent application of the cua among the counties within the state,and to e nhance the access of patients and caregivers to medical marijuana through collective,cooperative cultivation projects stats,ch,subd.b.
again,however,the steps the mmp took in pursuit of these objectives were limited and specific.the mmp established a program for issuance of medical marijuana identification cards to those qualified patients and designated primary caregivers who wish to carry them,and required responsible county agencies to cooperate in this program,subds.a d.it provided that the holder of an identification card shall not be subject to arrest for possession,transportation,delivery,or cultivation of medical marijuana,within the amounts specified by the statute,except upon reasonable cause to believe the card is false or invalid or the holder is in violation of statute,subd.e see,subd.a.
the mmp further specified that certain persons,including a qualified patient,or the holder of a valid identification card,who possesses or transports marijuana for personal medical use,or a designated primary caregiver who transports,processes,administers,delivers,or gives away,in amounts no greater than those specified by statute,marijuana for medical purposes to or for a qualified patient or valid cardholder shall not be subject,on that sole basis,to criminal liability under section possession of marijuana,cultivation of marijuana,possession of marijuana for sale,sale,transportation,importation,or furnishing of marijuana,maintaining place for purpose of unlawfully selling,furnishing,or using controlled substance,knowingly providing place for purpose of unlawfully manufacturing,storing,or distributing controlled substance,or place used for unlawful selling,furnishing,storing,or manufacturing of controlled substance as nuisance,subd.a.
finally,as indicated above,the mmp declared that q ualified patients,persons with valid identification cards,and the designated primary caregivers of such persons,who associate within the state of california in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes,shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under section,or,italics added.however,an amendment adopted in declares that no medical marijuana cooperative,collective,dispensary,operator,establishment,or provider,other than a licensed residential or elder medical care facility,that is authorized by law to possess,cultivate,or distribute medical marijuana,and that has a storefront or mobile retail outlet which ordinarily requires a local business license,shall be located within feet of a school,subds.a e,as added by stats,ch.
our decisions have stressed the narrow reach of these statutes.thus,in ross ragingwire telecommunications,cal th,d,ross,a telecommunications company discharged an employee from his supervisory position after an drug test disclosed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol,a chemical found in marijuana.the employee sued,urging that his termination for this reason violated both the state fair employment and housing act feha and public policy.the employee complaint alleged that he ingested medical marijuana,as a qualified patient under the cua,to alleviate his chronic back pain,but was nonetheless able to perform his duties satisfactorily.hence,the complaint asserted,the employer was obliged,under the feha,to accommodate his disability by accepting his use of medical marijuana.the trial court sustained the employer demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.
the court of appeal affirmed,and we upheld the court of appeal judgment.we noted that neither the cua findings and declarations,nor its substantive provisions,mention employment rights,except in their protection of physicians who recommend medical marijuana to patients.
the employee urged that such rights were implied in the voters declaration of their intent in the cua t o ensure that seriously ill californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes,subd.b a.we rejected this notion.as we observed,p laintiff would read this declaration as if it created a broad right to use marijuana without hindrance or inconvenience,enforceable against private parties such as employers.ross,supra,cal th,d.on the contrary,we stated,the only right to obtain and use marijuana created by the cua is the right of a patient,or a patient primary caregiver,to possess or cultivate marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician without thereby becoming subject to punishment under sections and of the health and safety code.citation.ross,supra,at,d.
in reaching this conclusion,we emphasized the cua modest objectives ross,supra,cal th,d,pointing out that the initiative proponents had consistently described the proposed measure to the voters as motivated only by the desire to create a narrow exception to the criminal law for medical marijuana possession and use under the circumstances specified,at,d.we endorsed the observation that the proponents ballot arguments reveal a delicate tightrope walk designed to induce voter approval,which we would upset were we to stretch the proposition limited immunity to cover that which its language does not,at,d,quoting people galambos th,d.
in people mentch cal th,d,mentch,a defendant charged with cultivation and possession for sale of marijuana sought to raise the defense,among others,that he was immune from conviction as a primary caregiver protected by the cua.two witnesses testified they had medical marijuana recommendations and obtained their marijuana from the defendant,paying him in cash for their supplies.the defendant testified that he himself had a medical marijuana recommendation had studied how to grow marijuana had thereafter opened a caregiving and consultancy business to give people safe access to medical marijuana and supplied medical marijuana to five patients.the defendant also stated that he took a couple of patients to medical appointments on a sporadic basis,and that he provided shelter to one patient during a brief part of the time he was selling her marijuana.mentch,at,d.
finding insufficient evidence on the point,the trial court declined to provide a primary caregiver instruction,and the defendant was convicted as charged.the court of appeal reversed the convictions.the appellate court concluded that evidence the defendant grew medical marijuana for qualified patients,counseled them on how to grow and use medical marijuana,and occasionally took them to medical appointments was sufficient to warrant a primary caregiver instruction.mentch,supra,cal th,d.
we reversed the court of appeal.we first examined the cua definition of a primary caregiver as the individual designated by a qualified medical marijuana patient who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing,health,or safety of that person,subd.e,italics added.this language,we reasoned,impl ied an ongoing caretaking relationship directed at the core survival needs of a seriously ill patient,not just one single pharmaceutical need.mentch,supra,cal th,d.further,we observed,the ballot arguments for proposition,which became the cua,suggested that a patient would be primarily responsible for noncommercially supplying his or her own medical marijuana,but that a primary caregiver should be allowed to act for a seriously or terminally afflicted patient who was too ill or bedridden to do so.accordingly,we held that a person can not establish primary caregiver status simply by showing he or she was chosen and used by a qualified patient to assist the patient in obtaining and ingesting medical marijuana.instead,we concluded,a primary caregiver must prove,at a minimum,that he or she consistently provided care in such areas as housing,health,and safety,independent of any help with medical marijuana,and undertook such general caregiving duties before assuming responsibility for assisting with medical marijuana.
alternatively,the defendant urged that the mmp,specifically section,provides a defense against charges of cultivation and possession for sale to those who assist patients and primary caregivers in administering,or learning how to cultivate or administer,medical marijuana.by failing to so advise his jury,the defendant insisted,the trial court breached its sua sponte duty to instruct on any affirmative defense supported by the evidence.
we responded that the defendant reading of the mmp was too broad.we explained that while the mmp does convey additional immunities against cultivation and possession for sale charges to specific groups of people,it does so only for specific actions it does not provide globally that the specified groups of people may never be charged with cultivation or possession for sale.that is,the immunities conveyed by section have three defining characteristics they each apply only to a specific group of people they each apply only to a specific range of conduct and they each apply only against a specific set of laws.mentch,supra,cal th,d.
moreover,we noted,section declares only that the specified groups of people engaged in the specified conduct shall not on that sole basis be subject to criminal liability under the specified laws.hence,we determined,section,subdivision b,which grants immunity from certain state marijuana laws to one who provides assistance to a qualified patient or primary caregiver,in administering medical marijuana to the patient or acquiring the skills necessary to cultivate or administer marijuana for medical purposes to the patient,affords the specified criminal immunities only for providing the described forms of assistance.this subdivision,we said,does not mean the defendant could not be charged with cultivation or possession for sale on any basis mentch,supra,cal th,d,original italics.on the contrary,to the extent he went beyond the immunized range of conduct,administration,advice,and counseling,he would,once again,subject himself to the full force of the criminal law.ibid.because it was undisputed that the defendant did much more than administer,advise,and counsel,we said,the mmp afforded him no defense,and no instruction was required.mentch,at,d.
similarly,the mmp provision at issue here,section,provides only that when particular described persons engage in particular described conduct,they enjoy,with respect to that conduct,a limited immunity from specified state marijuana laws.as previously noted,section simply declares that q ualified patients,persons with valid identification cards,and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards,who associate in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions for the possession,furnishing,sale,cultivation,transportation,or possession for sale of marijuana,or for providing or maintaining a place for the manufacture,processing,storage,or distribution of marijuana.italics added see people urziceanu th,d urziceanu.
recognizing the limited reach of the cua and the mmp,court of appeal decisions have consistently held that these statutes,by exempting certain medical marijuana activities including the collective cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana under specified circumstances from the sanctions otherwise imposed by particular state antimarijuana laws,do not preempt local land use regulation of medical marijuana collectives,cooperatives,and dispensaries,even when such regulation amounts to a total ban on such facilities within a local jurisdiction borders.
thus,in kruse,supra,th,d,the defendant application for a business license to operate a medical marijuana dispensary was denied by claremont city manager in september.the grounds cited were that such a facility was not a permitted use under claremont land use and development code.the denial letter advised the defendant he could appeal to the city council,and could also seek an amendment to the code.he did not seek such an amendment,and he began operating his facility on the day his permit was denied.meanwhile,he filed an administrative appeal.therein he urged that a code amendment was unnecessary because state law,the cua and the mmp rendered a medical marijuana caregivers collective a legal but not conforming business anywhere in the state where it is not regulated.kruse,supra,at,d.he further alleged that,before beginning operations,he had given the city notice and opportunity to adopt such regulations if it chose.
in late september,while the administrative appeal was pending,the city adopted a day moratorium on the issuance of any permit,variance,license,or other entitlement for operation of a medical marijuana dispensary within its boundaries.the city manager promptly advised the defendant that adoption of the moratorium rendered his appeal moot.thereafter,the city extended the moratorium several times,ultimately for a period ending on september.
defendant continued to operate his facility.after he ignored two cease and desist orders,he was cited,tried,convicted,and fined for operating without a business license in violation of city ordinances.thereafter,he continued to operate despite the issuance of yet another cease and desist order and a succession of administrative citations.accordingly,in january,the city sued for injunctive relief to abate a public nuisance.the trial court issued a temporary restraining order,a preliminary injunction,and ultimately,in may,a permanent injunction.among its other conclusions of law,the court determined that the cua did not preempt the city moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries,because there is nothing in the text or history of the cua that suggests that the voters intended to mandate that municipalities allow such facilities to operate within their city limits.kruse,supra,th,d.
on appeal,the defendant urged,inter alia,that the cua and the mmp preempted the city moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries and precluded the city from denying permission to operate such a facility.the court of appeal rejected this and the defendant other claims and affirmed the judgment.
on the issue of preemption,the appellate court first found no express conflict between the state medical marijuana statutes and the city action.by their terms,the court of appeal observed,the cua and the mmp do no more than exempt specific groups and specific conduct from liability under particular criminal statutes.
second,the court of appeal concluded,there was no implied preemption under either state statute.the court reasoned as follows neither provision addresses,much less covers,the areas of zoning,land use planning,and business licensing.the city moratorium ordinance was not inimical to the state statutes,in that it did not conflict with those laws by requiring what they forbid or prohibiting what they require.nor does the cua or the mmp impose a comprehensive regulatory scheme demonstrating that the availability of medical marijuana is a matter of statewide concern,thereby preempting local zoning and business licensing laws.kruse,supra,th,d.in particular,the cua statement of intent t o ensure that seriously ill californians have the right of access to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes kruse,at,d does not demonstrate a matter of preemptive statewide concern,for that declaration by the voters did not create a broad right to use marijuana without hindrance or inconvenience citation,or to dispense marijuana without regard to local zoning and business licensing laws ibid.additionally,there is no partial state coverage of medical marijuana in terms indicating clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action.indeed,the cua expressly states that it does not preclude legislation prohibiting conduct that endangers others,and the mmp explicitly provides that it does not prevent a local jurisdiction from adopting and enforcing laws that are consistent with its provisions.
in sum,the court of appeal concluded,n either the cua nor the mmp compels the establishment of local regulations to accommodate medical marijuana dispensaries.the c ity enforcement of its licensing and zoning laws and its temporary moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries do not conflict with the cua or the mmp.kruse,supra,th,d.
though it did not involve a complete moratorium or ban,the court of appeal in county of los angeles hill th,d hill similarly concluded that the cua and the mmp do not preempt a local jurisdiction from applying its zoning and business licensing powers to regulate medical marijuana dispensaries.in particular,the hill court observed,the collective cultivation provision of the mmp,section,does not confer on qualified patients and their caregivers the unfettered right to cultivate or dispense marijuana anywhere they choose.hill,supra,at,d.
the county ordinance at issue in hill placed various restrictions on the establishment and operation of medical marijuana dispensaries it provided that such a facility could operate in a c zone,but it required the operator to obtain a conditional use permit and a business license,and it prohibited the location of a dispensary within feet of a school,playground,park,public library,place of worship,childcare facility,or youth facility county ordinances declared generally that any use of property in violation of zoning laws was a public nuisance.hill,supra,th,d.
the county brought a nuisance action alleging that the defendants were violating the ordinance by operating a medical marijuana dispensary in an unincorporated area of the county without obtaining a business license,a conditional use permit,and a zoning variance to allow operation within feet of a public library.the defendants did not deny they were operating next to a public library without the required authorizations.instead,they urged that the ordinance requirements were unconstitutional and preempted by state law.the trial court disagreed.it issued a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against operation of the defendants facility without the necessary permits.hill,supra,th,d.
the defendants appealed,and the court of appeal affirmed.the appellate court rejected the defendants claims that the county regulations were inconsistent with the mmp,and thus preempted.the defendants acknowledged that section as then in effect added by stats,ch,former section expressly authorized a city or other local governing body to adopt and enforc e laws consistent with the mmp.however,the defendants insisted this provision only permitted local restrictions that were the same as those imposed by the mmp.hill,supra,th,d.the court of appeal disagreed,indicating that former section showed the legislature expected and intended that local governments adopt additional ordinances.hill,supra,at,d.the defendants also conceded that section,then recently adopted to impose a minimum foot distance between a medical marijuana facility and a school,subd.b,added by stats,ch,explicitly permits a local jurisdiction to adopt ordinances or policies that further restrict the location or establishment of a medical marijuana cooperative,collective,dispensary,operator,establishment,or provider,subd.f.nonetheless,the defendants insisted,the foot limit established by subdivision b,added by stats,ch,impliedly preempted a local jurisdiction from imposing greater distance restrictions.the court of appeal dismissed this argument,noting the plain words of subdivision f.
finally,the court of appeal found no merit in the defendants contention that because section affords qualified collective cultivation projects a limited immunity from nuisance prosecution under the state drug den abatement law,section,the county was precluded from applying its own nuisance laws to enjoin operation of a medical marijuana dispensary in violation of its zoning ordinance.noting that the immunity provided by section only applies where the nuisance prosecution is premised solely on the basis of the collective activities described in that section,the court of appeal concluded that the mmp does not prevent the c ounty from applying its nuisance laws to medical marijuana dispensaries that do not comply with its valid ordinances.hill,supra,th,d.
we now agree,for the reasons expressed below,that the cua and the mmp do not expressly or impliedly preempt riverside zoning provisions declaring a medical marijuana dispensary,as therein defined,to be a prohibited use,and a public nuisance,anywhere within the city limits.we set forth our conclusions in detail.
no express preemption.
as indicated above,the plain language of the cua and the mmp is limited in scope.it grants specified persons and groups,when engaged in specified conduct,immunity from prosecution under specified state criminal and nuisance laws pertaining to marijuana.mentch,supra,cal th,d,kruse,supra,th,d.the cua makes no mention of medical marijuana cooperatives,collectives,or dispensaries.it merely provides that state laws against the possession and cultivation of marijuana shall not apply to a qualified patient,or the patient designated primary caregiver,who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the patient personal medical use upon a physician recommendation,subd.d.
though the cua broadly states an aim to ensure a right of seriously ill persons to obtain and use medical marijuana as recommended by a physician,subd.b a,the initiative statute actual objectives,as presented to the voters,were modest ross,supra,cal th,d,and its substantive provisions created no broad right to use medical marijuana without hindrance or inconvenience,at,d,see kruse,supra,th,d urziceanu,supra,th,d cua created no constitutional right to obtain medical marijuana.there is no basis to conclude that the cua expressly preempts local ordinances prohibiting,as a nuisance,the use of property to cooperatively or collectively cultivate and distribute medical marijuana.
the mmp,unlike the cua,does address,among other things,the collective or cooperative cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana.but the mmp is framed in similarly narrow and modest terms.as pertinent here,it specifies only that qualified patients,identification card holders,and their designated primary caregivers are exempt from prosecution and conviction under enumerated state antimarijuana laws solely on the ground that such persons are engaged in the cooperative or collective cultivation,transportation,and distribution of medical marijuana among themselves.
the mmp language no more creates a broad right of access to medical marijuana without hindrance or inconvenience ross,supra,cal th,d,than do the words of the cua.no provision of the mmp explicitly guarantees the availability of locations where such activities may occur,restricts the broad authority traditionally possessed by local jurisdictions to regulate zoning and land use planning within their borders,or requires local zoning and licensing laws to accommodate the cooperative or collective cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana hence,there is no ground to conclude that riverside ordinance is expressly preempted by the mmp 
no implied preemption.
the considerations discussed above also largely preclude any determination that the cua or the mmp impliedly preempts riverside effort to facilities that dispense medical marijuana.at the outset,there is no duplication between the state laws,on the one hand,and riverside ordinance,on the other,in that the two schemes are coextensive.the cua and the mmp decriminalize,for state purposes,specified activities pertaining to medical marijuana,and also provide that the state antidrug nuisance statute can not be used to abate or enjoin these activities.on the other hand,the riverside ordinance finds,for local purposes,that the use of property for certain of those activities does constitutes a local nuisance.
nor do we find an inimical contradiction or conflict between the state and local laws,in the sense that it is impossible simultaneously to comply with both.neither the cua nor the mmp requires the cooperative or collective cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana that riverside ordinance deems a prohibited use of property within the city boundaries.conversely,riverside ordinance requires no conduct that is forbidden by the state statutes.persons who refrain from operating medical marijuana facilities in riverside are in compliance with both the local and state enactments.compare,great western shows,supra,cal th,d,ordinance banning sale of firearms or ammunition on county property was not inimical to state statutes contemplating lawful existence of gun shows ordinance did not require what state law forbade or prohibit what state law demanded.
further,there appears no attempt by the legislature to fully occupy the field of medical marijuana regulation as a matter of statewide concern,or to partially occupy this field under circumstances indicating that further local regulation will not be tolerated.on the contrary,as discussed in detail above,the cua and the mmp take limited steps toward recognizing marijuana as a medicine by exempting particular medical marijuana activities from state laws that would otherwise prohibit them.in furtherance of their provisions,these statutes require local agencies to do certain things,and prohibit them from doing certain others.but the statutory terms describe no comprehensive scheme or system for authorizing,controlling,or regulating the processing and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes,such that no room remains for local action.
the presumption against preemption is additionally supported by the existence of significant local interests that may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.amici curiae league of california cities et point out that california cities and counties are diverse in size,population,and use.as these amici curiae observe,while several california cities and counties allow medical marijuana facilities,it may not be reasonable to expect every community to do so.
for example,these amici curiae point out,s ome communities are predominantly residential and do not have sufficient commercial or industrial space to accommodate facilities that distribute medical marijuana.moreover,these facilities deal in a substance which,except for legitimate medical use by a qualified patient under a physician authorization,is illegal under both federal and state law to possess,use,furnish,or cultivate,yet is widely desired,bought,sold,cultivated,and employed as a recreational drug.thus,facilities that dispense medical marijuana may pose a danger of increased crime,congestion,blight,and drug abuse and the extent of this danger may vary widely from community to community.
thus,while some counties and cities might consider themselves well suited to accommodating medical marijuana dispensaries,conditions in other communities might lead to the reasonable decision that such facilities within their borders,even if carefully sited,well managed,and closely monitored,would present unacceptable local risks and burdens.see,great western shows,supra,cal th,d,noting,in support of holding that state gun show regulations did not occupy field,so as to preclude los angeles county complete ban of gun shows on county property,that firearms issues likely require different treatment in urban,as opposed to rural,areas.under these circumstances,we can not lightly assume the voters or the legislature intended to impose a one size fits all policy,whereby each and every one of california diverse counties and cities must allow the use of local land for such purposes 
city of stockton cal th,d,on which defendants rely,is readily distinguishable.there,a state law,the uniform controlled substances act ucsa,established a comprehensive scheme for the treatment of such substances,specifying offenses and corresponding penalties in detail.included among the sanctions provided by the ucsa was a defined program for forfeiture of particular categories of property,including vehicles,used to commit drug crimes.under this system,vehicles were subject to forfeiture if they had been employed to facilitate the manufacture,possession,or possession for sale of specified amounts,as explicitly set forth,of particular controlled substances.vehicle forfeiture under the ucsa required proof beyond reasonable doubt that the subject property had been so used.provisions of the ucsa stated that law enforcement,not revenue,was the principal aim of forfeiture,that forfeiture had potentially harsh consequences for property owners,and that law enforcement officials should protect innocent owners interests by providing adequate notice and due process in forfeiture proceedings.
the city of stockton adopted an ordinance providing for local forfeiture of vehicles used simply to acquire or attempt to acquire any amount of any controlled substance,even if the offense at issue was a misdemeanor warranting only a fine and no jail time,and was not eligible for forfeiture under the ucsa.stockton ordinance permitted forfeiture upon proof by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle had been used for the described purpose.forfeited vehicles were to be sold at auction,with net proceeds payable to local law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies.
under these circumstances,the majority concluded,t he comprehensive nature of the ucsa in defining drug crimes and specifying penalties including forfeiture is so thorough and detailed as to manifest the legislature intent to preclude local regulation.the ucsa accordingly occupies the field of penalizing crimes involving controlled substances,thus impliedly preempting the city forfeiture ordinance calling for forfeiture of vehicles involved in the acquisition or attempted acquisition of drugs regulated under the ucsa,supra,cal th,d.the majority explained that the legislature comprehensive enactment of penalties for crimes involving controlled substances,but exclusion from that scheme of any provision for vehicle forfeiture for simple possessory drug offenses,manifests a clear intent to reserve that severe penalty for very serious drug crimes involving the manufacture,sale,or possession for sale of specified amounts of certain controlled substances,at,d.
as indicated above,there is no similar evidence in this case of the legislature intent to preclude local regulation of facilities that dispense medical marijuana.the cua and the mmp create no scheme for the control and regulation of marijuana for medicinal use.these statutes,both carefully worded,do no more than exempt certain conduct by certain persons from certain state criminal and nuisance laws against the possession,cultivation,transportation,distribution,manufacture,and storage of marijuana 
the gravamen of defendants argument throughout is that the mmp authorizes the existence of facilities for the collective or cooperative cultivation and distribution of medical marijuana,and that a local ordinance prohibiting such facilities thus can not be tolerated.but defendants reliance on such decisions as cohen board of supervisors cal d,cohen and city of torrance transitional living centers for los angeles,cal d city of torrance for this proposition is misplaced.
cohen,addressing a local ordinance that closely regulated escort services,stated that i f the ordinance attempted to prohibit conduct proscribed or permitted by state law,either explicitly or implicitly,it would be preempted.cohen,supra,cal d.however,cohen made clear there is no preemption where state law expressly or implicitly allows local regulation,at.as indicated,the mmp implicitly permits local regulation of medical marijuana facilities.
similarly,in city of torrance,supra,cal d,a state statute promoting the local community care of mental patients specifically provided that local zoning rules or use permit denials could not be used to exclude psychiatric care facilities from areas in which hospitals or nursing homes were otherwise allowed.by contrast,the mmp imposes no similar limits,express or implicit,on local zoning and permit rules.
more fundamentally,we have made clear that a state law does not authorize activities,to the exclusion of local bans,simply by exempting those activities from otherwise applicable state prohibitions.thus,as discussed in nordyke king cal th,d,nordyke,a state statute,penal code section,made it a crime to possess firearms in any state or local public building,but exempted a person who,for the purpose of sale or trade,brought an otherwise lawfully possessed firearm into a gun show conducted in compliance with state law.under an alameda county ordinance,it was a misdemeanor to bring any firearm onto county property.the ordinance specified certain exceptions,but these did not include gun shows.hence,a principal effect of the ordinance was to forbid the presence of firearms at gun shows on county property,thus making such shows impractical.
gun show promoters challenged the ordinance,arguing,inter alia,that penal code section prohibited the outlawing of guns at gun shows on public property,and thus preempted the ordinance contrary provisions.we disagreed.as we explained,section merely exempts gun shows from the state criminal prohibition on possessing guns in public buildings,thereby permitting local government entities to authorize such shows.it does not mandate that local government entities permit such a use nordyke,supra,cal th,d,first italics added.
similarly here,the mmp merely exempts t
