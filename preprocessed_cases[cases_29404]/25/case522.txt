background 
the dispute before us involves patented methods for using the drug rosuvastatin calcium.rosuvastatin calcium is one member of a widely prescribed class of drugs known as statins,which serve to reduce circulating cholesterol by competitively inhibiting hydroxy methylglutaryl coa reductase,or hmg coa reductase,a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.astrazeneca markets rosuvastatin calcium under the brand name crestor and holds the rights to three related patents relevant to this appeal.patent the patent claims rosuvastatin compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.patent the patent claims methods of using rosuvastatin compounds to treat heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hefh,a genetic condition characterized by impaired cholesterol metabolism and clinically elevated blood cholesterol,and patent the patent claims methods of using rosuvastatin compounds to lower the cardiovascular disease risk for individuals who have normal cholesterol levels but demonstrate elevated circulating protein crp,another risk factor associated with various cardiovascular disorders.the composition patent expires in,while the and method of use patents expire in and,respectively 
astrazeneca filed a new drug application nda to market rosuvastatin calcium and obtained approval from the food and drug administration fda on august.as required by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of popularly known as the hatch waxman act,hereinafter the act,astrazeneca notified the fda of all patents that it believed could be infringed by the unlicensed manufacture,use,or sale of rosuvastatin calcium to be published in the fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations known as the orange book.see b.among those patents,astrazeneca listed the,and patents.the approved nda and astrazeneca corresponding crestor labeling cover several indications for using rosuvastatin calcium,including treatment of hefh in pediatric patients and preventative use in patients with elevated crp.while these indications may fall under astrazeneca method patents,the fda also approved rosuvastatin calcium for treating homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh and hypertriglyceridemia uses not claimed by either of the or patents.thus,the fda approved rosuvastatin calcium for a number of different treatment indications,some of which may be protected by astrazeneca and patents,the hefh and elevated crp indications,as well as others not subject to any such patent rights,treatment of hofh and hypertriglyceridemia.
appellees are generic pharmaceutical manufacturers that filed abbreviated new drug applications andas with the fda seeking to market generic rosuvastatin calcium.as set forth at j a i,the act only allows anda filers to obtain approval for marketing drugs for uses that have been approved under a preexisting nda.in this case,appellees further restricted their andas,requesting approval to offer their generic rosuvastatin formulations for treating only hofh and hypertriglyceridemia while omitting or carving out patented indications directed toward hefh and elevated crp.mylan proposed labeling is representative 
indications and usage 
rosuvastatin calcium tablets are an hmg coa reductase inhibitor indicated for

patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh to reduce ldl c,and apob 
it appears undisputed that none of appellees andas sought approval to market rosuvastatin calcium specifically for the hefh or indications disclosed in the and patents.
appellees andas also addressed each patent listed in the orange book.the act requires each anda applicant to certify that the orange book contains no patent information relevant to their anda paragraph i certification,the listed patents have expired paragraph ii certification,the applicant will not enter the market until the listed patents expire paragraph iii certification,or the applicant believes that the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the applicant generic compositions paragraph iv certification.j a vii i iv.the act specifies that filing an anda containing a paragraph iv certification constitutes an act of infringement.e glaxo,novopharm.where the orange book lists a method of use patent that does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval,an applicant may instead submit a statement under j a viii averring that the anda excludes all uses claimed in the patent section viii statement.warner lambert apotex.
accordingly,appellees filed paragraph iv certifications with regard to the composition patent,but,having only sought approval for unpatented methods of using generic rosuvastatin calcium for treating hofh and hypertriglyeridemia,they submitted section viii statements regarding the and method of use patents appellees notified astrazeneca of their anda filings in late as required under j b ii.
in december,astrazeneca responded by suing appellees for infringement of the composition patent under e.after a bench trial,the district court ruled on june,in favor of astrazeneca on infringement,validity,and enforceability of the patent,enjoining appellees from making,using,or selling rosuvastatin calcium until the patent expires in.appellees have separately appealed that decision.in re rosuvastatin calcium patent,d,appeal docketed,to.
while the infringement matter remained pending before the district court,astrazeneca brought a second e action against appellees in april that ultimately gave rise to this appeal astrazeneca alleged that appellees anda filings infringed and would cause infringement of the and method patents,even though appellees had not requested approval for any patented indications and had filed section viii statements to that effect.in particular,astrazeneca complaints stated 
on information and belief,the fda will require the label for the appellees rosuvastatin calcium tablets to include information relating to the use to treat pediatric patients to years of age having hefh.
on information and belief,the labeling associated with the appellees rosuvastatin calcium tablets causes their andas to be an application for a drug the use of which is claimed in the patent in violation of e a.
on information and belief,the appellees rosuvastatin calcium tablets,if approved by the fda,will be prescribed and administered to human patients to treat hefh,which uses will constitute direct infringement of the patent on information and belief,appellees will actively induce,encourage,and aid and abet this prescription and administration,with knowledge and specific intent that these uses will be in contravention of astrazeneca rights under the patent 
each complaint also included analogous counts alleging infringement of the patent.in short,astrazeneca alleged that appellees andas,as filed,violated e as application s for a drug the use of which is claimed in the and patents if approved by the fda,appellees proposed activities will induce infringement of the and patents and the fda will require appellees to make labeling amendments explicitly incorporating the indications covered by the and patents.
appellees moved to dismiss on three grounds.first,appellees argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over astrazeneca claims because e creates a case or controversy only if the accused anda contains a paragraph iv certification,but appellees instead filed section viii statements concerning the asserted method patents.in addition,appellees argued that the infringement claims were unripe because astrazeneca alleged that the fda might,at some undetermined point in the future,require that appellees amend their andas to include the patented indications.finally,appellees argued that,even if the court could exercise jurisdiction,the complaints failed to state a claim under e because astrazeneca had not alleged and could not allege that appellees andas included paragraph iv certifications or sought approval to market rosuvastatin calcium for uses claimed in the or patents.
the district court dismissed astrazeneca infringement claims,ruling that it lacked jurisdiction because astrazeneca had not presented a valid e claim based on appellees anda filings.astrazeneca,wl,at.the court also held that astrazeneca claims were unripe to the extent that they relied on presumptive future labeling amendments.id.at.

discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and we review any underlying factual findings for clear error.hewlett packard acceleron llc.like the district court,we test the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law,accepting as true all allegations of fact.bradley chiron.we also review statutory interpretation,which is a question of law,without deference.waymark porta.
as described,astrazeneca complaints advanced two basic theories of patent infringement under e.first,astrazeneca alleged that,as filed,appellees andas infringe the and method patents because their approval would result in unlicensed sales of a drug having,uses,inevitably infringing astrazeneca method patents contrary to the plain language and legislative aims of e.astrazeneca also asserted that the fda would ultimately block appellees formal efforts to carve out the patented indications by requiring amendments extending their andas to include all approved indications for rosuvastatin calcium including those covered by the and patents.the district court dismissed these claims on separate grounds,and we address each in turn.
appellees andas as filed 
the district court dismissed astrazeneca primary e infringement claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court reasoned that e creates in the anda context a limited,technical,and artificial cause of action where none would otherwise exist,so that in such cases a district court jurisdiction turns on whether a plaintiff asserts a valid claim under section e i n the absence of a section e claim,there is no justiciable case or controversy between the parties.astrazeneca,wl,at.concluding that astrazeneca had failed to state a valid e claim because appellees andas excluded all methods of using rosuvastatin calcium claimed in the asserted patents,the district court dismissed astrazeneca claims pursuant to.b.
astrazeneca protests that,by alleging patent infringement under e,it has asserted a claim for relief arising under federal patent law and has thus met the basic jurisdictional requirements specified in and a.in addition,astrazeneca argues that e is not a statute and that the district court improperly conflated its jurisdictional analysis with scrutiny of the claims on their merits.appellees defend the district court dismissal as properly premised on jurisdictional grounds.
as a preliminary matter,we agree with astrazeneca that its infringement claims based on appellees existing andas were within the district court jurisdiction.the district courts have original jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents.a.the supreme court has described e as creating a highly artificial act of infringement triggered upon submission of an anda containing an erroneous paragraph iv certification.eli lilly medtronic,d.we have further explained that e provided a new cause of action so that courts could promptly resolve infringement and validity disputes before the anda applicant had engaged in the traditional statutorily defined acts of infringement.glaxo,at.by enacting e,congress thus established a specialized new cause of action for patent infringement.when patentees pursue this route,their claims necessarily arise under an act of congress relating to patents.in short,o nce congress creates an act of infringement,jurisdiction in the district courts is proper under a.allergan,alcon.
in allergan,we addressed a similar jurisdictional challenge to an infringement suit brought under e.there,as here,the plaintiff held method patents directed toward certain uses of a drug,competitors filed andas seeking to market the drug for other uses,and the plaintiff brought suit claiming that the andas infringed its method of use patents under e.id.at.the defendant competitors argued that e did not provide jurisdiction because their andas sought approval for uses not covered by the asserted patents,but we held that section e makes it possible for the district court to exercise its section a jurisdiction in the situation in which an anda has been filed.id.at.in other words,the requirements for jurisdiction in the district courts are met once a patent owner alleges that another filing of an anda infringes its patent under e,and this threshold jurisdictional determination does not depend on the ultimate merits of the claims.
consistent with allergan,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that its jurisdiction hinged on whether astrazeneca asserted a valid claim under e.astrazeneca alleged that the appellees anda filings infringed its listed patents under e,and nothing more was required to establish the district court subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to a.
while the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over astrazeneca claims,its judgment of dismissal was nevertheless correct,for we agree with the district court underlying determination that astrazeneca failed to state a viable claim for relief under e.see samish indian nation united states,the court can affirm the trial court on any basis in the record.susquehanna valley alliance three mile island nuclear reactor,cir returning that count to the district court for the entry of a dismissal under.b,rather than under.b,would be a futile exercise.
we are guided in this conclusion by the language of e itself and by our decision in warner lambert.section e provides as follows 
it shall be an act of infringement to submit a an application,an anda under section j of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act codified at j for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such act to engage in the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent.
e emphases added.in warner lambert,we construed the term the use as used in e a to mean the use listed in the anda based on our evaluation of the statutory language,its context within the act,and the legislative history behind its enactment.at.accordingly,we held that it is not necessarily an act of infringement under e to submit an anda for a drug if just any use of that drug is claimed in a patent rather,infringement of method claims under e requires filing an anda wherein at least one use listed in the anda is claimed in a patent.id.at.
relying on warner lambert,the district court determined that astrazeneca had not stated a claim under e as a predicate to its decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the district court held that warner lambert defined the boundaries of e claims by establishing that anda applicants could carve out patented uses from their andas even if those uses were.astrazeneca,wl,at.the district court therefore concluded that there can be no cause of action for infringement of a method of use claim under e unless the accused anda actually seeks approval for a patented indication.id.at.because appellees had excluded any patented treatment indications from their andas the district court concluded that astrazeneca does not have a claim under section e.id.
