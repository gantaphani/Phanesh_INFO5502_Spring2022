this is an appeal from the united states patent and trademark office pto board of patent appeals and interferences board.the board upheld the examiner rejection of claims of patent the patent in a reexamination proceeding.in re swanson,reexamination may.previously,this court had affirmed a district court judgment that claims and of the patent were not invalid.abbott labs.syntron bioresearch,abbott labs.ii.we hold that under a,as amended in,despite consideration of patent deutsch in the initial examination and our prior decision,there was a substantial new question of patentability regarding whether deutsch anticipated and made obvious claims that made reexamination warranted.as the patentee does not raise additional objections to the board rejections over deutsch,the board finding that claims of the patent were anticipated and would have been obvious in light of deutsch is affirmed.
a.the patent 
the patent was filed on february,by melvin swanson and patrick guire.the patent discloses a method of quantitatively analyzing small amounts of biological fluids,such as milk,blood,and urine,or other solutions,to detect the presence of a particular substance the analyte.in the method disclosed,one or more reaction zones containing a bound reactant are spaced out on a test strip made of a solid.patent.a test solution is applied to the test strip and moves along a flow path,encountering these zones sequentially.when a solution containing the requisite analyte reaches each of the reaction zones,a predetermined product forms.id.selected detectors in the reaction zones indicate,preferably by a change of color,the presence of analyte,reactant,or predetermined product.id.the specification does not limit the invention to any one type of detection and suggests that the analyte can be substantially all chemical substances that are reactive with a reactant to form a product.id.
claim,the independent claim at issue,is characteristic of the patent and claims a method of detection in which the analyte and reactant form a binding pair 
a method for analysis of an analyte which is a member of a binding pair in a test solution comprising the steps of 
a providing a immobilized reactant in each of one or more reaction zones spaced successively along a flow path defined by a liquid permeable medium,wherein said reactant is the other member of said binding pair and is capable of binding with the analyte to form a predetermined product 
b flowing said solution along the medium and sequentially through the reaction zone s and 
c detecting the presence of analyte,said reactant or said predetermined product in the reaction zone s,wherein the number of zones in which detection occurs is related to the presence sic of analyte solution.
id.a preferred embodiment is an immunoassay,in which the pair is an pair.
in addition to claim,there are three dependent claims relevant to this appeal claims,and.claim limits the pair by requiring that one part of the pair be labeled with a chemical moiety,and wherein such detecting step comprises detecting the presence of said chemical moiety.id.claims and additionally limit the chemical moiety to including an enzyme and being a radioisotope,respectively.id.
patent deutsch also discloses a method of detecting binding pairs in order to determine the presence of a ligand the analyte in a biological fluid sample.in deutsch,a test strip is prepared in which a reagent is immobilized in a downstream portion of the strip and the test solution is applied to the other end.the edge of the strip is then immersed in developing fluid which progresses upstream.deutsch.when the developing fluid reaches the test solution,the two liquids combine and advance through the reaction zone s to the terminating end.id.if analyte is present,it binds with the reagents in the reaction zones and forms a detectable product.the detectable product may be labeled with any chemical substance or moiety having a detectable characteristic including radioactivity.id.a preferred embodiment is an immunoassay,or immunoreaction,in which the reactant contains an antibody capable of specifically binding to the antigen in the test sample.
patent weiss teaches a similar immunoassay method for visually detecting the presence of an analyte in biological fluid.in weiss,the visual readout is an indicator that is either fixated in the reaction zone in the presence of the analyte or released in the presence of the analyte,in which case the release can be observed by the presence of the indicator material in the fluid front of the test solution moving forward on the strip.weiss cols.
patent tom discloses another immunoassay method,in which one of the reagents comprises a signal creating system.tom.tom signal producing system includes radioactive substances,enzymes and chromogenic substances id.
initial examination 
the examiner initially rejected all the claims in the application that resulted in the patent as obvious under,in light of various combinations of references.office action,september,original office action.the method claimed in original claim was nearly identical to the one claimed in claim of the issued patent,differing primarily in that it required multiple reaction zones and did not require that the pair be a binding pair claim was rejected along with claims,and under as being unpatentable over either morison or bauer et al in view of peurifoy et id.at.the examiner explained that morison and bauer each disclose a method that is basically the same as that disclosed by the applicants,and that it would have been obvious that the reagent in morison and bauer could be separated into multiple reaction zones to permit quantification,as described in peurifoy.id.in the application as filed,claim was dependent on claim and added the limitation that the analyte and reactant be a specific binding pair.claim further specified that the reactant in the binding pair of claim include an antibody.the examiner rejected these and similar dependent claims under as being unpatentable over either morison or bauer et al in view of peurifoy et al as applied to claims,and above,and further in view of any one of et al,brown et al and deutsch et original office action at.the examiner explained that it would be obvious that any known reaction within reasons sic could be incorporated in the modified method and apparatus of either morison and sic bauer,as see for example,the immunoreactions of et al,brown et al and deutsch.id.at.
the claims were amended,and on december,the patent was granted.subsequently,the patent was assigned to surmodics,surmodics or patentee,the real party at interest in the current proceedings,who exclusively licensed the patent to abbott laboratories abbott.
abbott syntron 
on december,abbott sued syntron bioresearch,syntron for infringement of two patents,one of which was the patent.syntron counterclaimed that the patents were invalid,claiming,inter alia,that claims and of the patent were invalid in light of deutsch.on october,the jury returned a special verdict finding that the asserted claims of the were not infringed and that syntron had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the claims were anticipated,obvious,or otherwise invalid.the district court entered judgment accordingly.abbott labs.syntron bioresearch,abbot labs i.abbott appealed,and syntron to this court.
on appeal,we and the judgment of noninfringement of the patent and affirmed the judgment of validity on all asserted claims of the patent.abbott labs.syntron bioresearch,abbott labs.ii.in particular,we sustained the judgment that deutsch did not anticipate the asserted claims,noting that the burden having been on syntron to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the claims were anticipated,we can not conclude that the jury verdict on anticipation was not supported by substantial evidence.id.at.we explained that the only issue raised regarding anticipation was whether deutsch teaches flowing said solution along the medium.we agreed that the jury reasonably could have found it did not because the jury could have reasonably interpreted the language of the claims standing alone,as requiring that the solution itself provide the required flow.id.
reexamination 
following the appeal,syntron filed a request for an ex parte reexamination of the patent,claiming that there was a substantial new question of patentability.see a.the examiner granted the request.after reviewing the claims in light of prior art,the examiner rejected claims,and as anticipated by deutsch and claims and as anticipated by weiss under b,and claim as obvious under in light of deutsch and a secondary reference,tom.office action,at reexamination office action.
the board affirmed the examiner rejections.in re swanson,reexamination may.first,the board rejected the patentee argument that weiss lacks detection in the reaction zone and agreed with the examiner that,detection may occur in a reaction zone by determining if dye has been displaced from the particle or not.id.at.the board also rejected the patentee argument that weiss invention,which included using an indicator that is adsorbed by the antiligand,and which can be associated and dissociated with the ligand,did not meet the labeled requirement of claim.second,the board affirmed the examiner finding that deutsch anticipated claims,and,rejecting the patentee argument that deutsch can not anticipate the claims since it uses a developing fluid to provide the required flow through the test medium.the board agreed with the examiner that the claim is open to additional steps as it uses the term comprising and that claim does not contain a limitation requiring that the test solution itself provide the flow.id.at.lastly,the board rejected the patentee claim that reexamination was improper as to deutsch because deutsch does not raise a substantial new question of patentability as required by.the board found that the reference did raise a substantial new question of patentability despite having been cited in the original office action because it was not cited in regard to the presently rejected claims and it was not relied upon for the same reason the examiner now relied upon it.the board also dismissed the patentee argument that deutsch could not raise a substantial new question of patentability because a jury had affirmed a finding of validity over the reference and the federal circuit had affirmed.id.at.
surmodics filed this timely appeal,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
surmodics objects to the rejection of claims on two grounds.first,it argues that the board erred in affirming the examiner determination that weiss anticipated claims and.second,it argues that the reexamination of claims on the basis of deutsch was improper under a because deutsch does not raise a substantial new question of patentability.according to surmodics,the consideration of anticipation by deutsch in the district court litigation precludes a finding of a new question of patentability for the purposes of the reexamination,and it argues that to find otherwise would raise substantial questions regarding the constitutionality of the statute.in addition,surmodics argues that the examiner consideration of deutsch in the original proceedings also precludes finding a new question of patentability.
the pto rejection based on weiss did not include any claims not also rejected under deutsch.as we conclude that neither the district court action nor the initial examination bars the pto consideration of deutsch in the reexamination proceedings,and the patentee does not challenge the rejection of claims in light of deutsch on the merits,we consider only whether deutsch raised a substantial new question of patentability and do not reach the issue of whether the board properly found claims and anticipated by weiss.
we review the board legal conclusions including statutory interpretation de novo.in re am.acad.of sci.tech,stevens tamai,in interpreting statutes,we give effect to the intent of congress by look ing not only to the particular statutory language,but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.crandon united states,d.we review the board findings of fact for substantial evidence.in re gartside.
a.the reexamination statute and the amendment to a 
any person may file a request for an ex parte reexamination of an issued patent based on prior art patents or printed publications.congress intended reexaminations to provide an important quality check on patents that would allow the government to remove defective and erroneously granted patents.see also in re recreative techs,the reexamination statute purpose is to correct errors made by the government and if need be to remove patents that never should have been granted.quoting patlex mossinghoff.
the pto,however,may only grant a reexamination request if it determines that a substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent concerned is raised by the request.a see also id.the substantial new question of patentability requirement prevents potential harassment of patentees by act ing to bar reconsideration of any argument already decided by the pto,whether during the original examination or an earlier reexamination.i,cong.this court,in in re portola packaging,interpreted this statutory intent as precluding reexamination based on prior art previously considered by the pto in relation to the same or broader claims.id.at.congress disagreed with the restrictive scope of reexamination imposed by this court.see no,at t he federal circuit incorrectly interpreted congress original intent underlying the reexamination statute and limited the application of the process.in congress amended a to include an additional sentence,explaining that the amendment overturns the holding of in re portola packaging,a federal court decision imposing an limit that reaches beyond the text of the patent act.id.the reexamination statute now provides,in pertinent part 
within three months following the filing of a request for reexamination under the provisions of section of this title,the director will determine whether a substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent concerned is raised by the request,with or without consideration of other patents or printed publications the existence of a substantial new question of patentability is not precluded by the fact that a patent or printed publication was previously cited by or to the office or considered by the office.
a emphasis added.according to the house report accompanying the bill,under the amended a,the appropriate test to determine whether a substantial new question of patentability exists should not merely look at the number of references or whether they were previously considered or cited but their combination in the appropriate context of a new light as it bears on the question of the validity of the patent.see also,at while this bill clarifies that previously considered prior art will not necessarily bar a request for reexamination,the bill does not eliminate the requirement for a substantial new question of patentability to be present for the agency to permit reexamination.
we have not had the opportunity to evaluate the scope of the substantial new question of patentability requirement since the amendment.thus,this appeal presents issues of first impression.in determining the scope of the substantial new question requirement under the amended statute,w e begin,as always,with the language of the statute.duncan walker,d.we then turn to the legislative history to further elucidate congress intent.see timex united states,beyond the statute text,tools of statutory construction include legislative history.deluxe united states,explaining that in a matter of statutory interpretation,where the text itself does not clearly exclude alternate interpretations,we look first to the legislative history for illumination of the intent of congress.ethicon,quigg,using legislative history in construing a section of the statutory provisions on reexamination see also garcia united states,d in surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the legislature intent lies in the committee reports on the bill,which represent the considered and collective understanding of those congressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.
district court proceedings 
the patentee first argues that the district court consideration of deutsch in determining the validity of the patent necessarily precludes the reference from raising a new question of patentability in subsequent reexamination proceedings.the district court and this court did consider the precise question at issue on reexamination whether deutsch satisfies the flowing limitation of the asserted claims and,thus,anticipates them.and both courts upheld the validity of the patent in light of deutsch.nevertheless,the statutory language,legislative history,and different purposes underlying reexamination and federal court proceedings suggest that the determination of a substantial new question is unaffected by these court decisions.
the statute does not define what constitutes a substantial new question of patentability.however,the language added in the amended statute specifically discusses references previously cited by or to the office or considered by the office,a emphases added,but does not address any prior citation or consideration by courts.similarly,the legislative history for both the original and amended reexamination statute suggest that congress was concerned only with the consideration of issues in prior pto examinations,not prior civil litigation.for example in passing the original reexamination statute,congress stated that this new procedure will permit any party to petition the patent office to review the efficacy of a patent,subsequent to its issuance,on the basis of new information about preexisting technology which may have escaped review at the time of the initial examination of the patent application,and explained that the substantial new question requirement bars reconsideration of any argument already decided by the office,whether during the original examination or an earlier reexamination.i,at,cong,emphasis added.the legislative history of the amendment similarly states that the test for a substantial new question of patentability should focus on what the examiner considered,at.not once in the legislative history did congress refer to references or issues addressed in prior civil litigation.see.i,cong,ethicon,at explaining that nothing in the text or legislative history of the reexamination statute supports a finding that one of the purposes of reexamination was to avoid duplication of efforts by the pto and courts.
the focus on previous examinations rather than prior litigation follows from the fact that reexamination s are conducted according to the procedures established for initial examination,and pto examination procedures have distinctly different standards,parties,purposes,and outcomes compared to civil litigation,in re etter.in particular,the two forums take different approaches in determining validity and on the same evidence could quite correctly come to different conclusions.ethicon,at.
in civil litigation,a challenger who attacks the validity of patent claims must overcome the presumption of validity with clear and convincing evidence that the patent is invalid.if this statutory burden is not met,c ourts do not find patents valid,only that the patent challenger did not carry the burden of establishing invalidity in the particular case before the court.ethicon,at internal citations omitted emphasis in original.therefore,a prior holding of validity is not necessarily inconsistent with a subsequent holding of invalidity,stevenson sears roebuck,and is not binding on subsequent litigation or pto reexaminations.see ethicon,at rejecting the pto argument that it was bound by a court decision upholding a patent validity mendenhall cedarapids,a prior decision that a patent has previously survived an attack on its validity serves only to inform the district court in re trans texas holdings,holding that the pto during reexamination is not bound by a district court claim construction.
in pto examinations and reexaminations,the standard of preponderance of substantially lower than in a civil case,in re caveney,there is no presumption of validity,etter,at and the examiner is not attacking the validity of the patent but is conducting a subjective examination of the claims in light of prior art,id.at.and unlike in district courts,in reexamination proceedings c laims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation,consistent with the specification trans.holdings,at quoting in re yamamoto.thus,considering an issue at the district court is not equivalent to the pto having had the opportunity to consider it.see ethicon,at p recise duplication of effort does not occur because the pto and the courts employ different standards of proof when considering validity.
in ethicon,we held that because of these differences between reexaminations and court proceedings,the pto did not have authority to stay a patent reexamination proceeding pending the outcome of a case in a district court given the requirement in that all reexaminations be conducted with special dispatch.at.we explained that the suspension of pto reexamination proceedings does not prevent duplication instead,it improperly precludes access to the forum where there is no presumption of validity.id.at.in reaching this holding,we noted that if the district court determines a patent is not invalid,the pto should continue its reexamination because,of course,the two forums have different standards of proof for determining invalidity.at.the pto has recognized that while ethicon did not directly interpret the meaning of a substantial new question of patentability,its reasoning is directly applicable to the issue of whether district court proceedings affect the substantial new question inquiry.thus,prior to ethicon the pto had held that a substantial new question of patentability would not be found if the same issue had been addressed by a federal court,see in re wichterle,comm r pat.trademarks,but it revised its position in the wake of ethicon,instructing examiners that a final court decision of a claim validity will not preclude a finding of a substantial new question of validity based on the same art because of the different standards of proof employed by the federal district court and the office,mpep.
we agree with the pto current position.section language and legislative history,as well as the differences between the two proceedings,lead us to conclude that congress did not intend a prior court judgment upholding the validity of a claim to prevent the pto from finding a substantial new question of validity regarding an issue that has never been considered by the pto.to hold otherwise would allow a civil litigant failure to overcome the statutory presumption of validity to thwart congress purpose of allowing for a reexamination procedure to correct examiner errors,without which the presumption of validity never would have arisen.see patlex,at a defectively examined and therefore erroneously granted patent must yield to the reasonable congressional purpose of facilitating the correction of governmental mistakes.
surmodics argues that this reading of the an executive agency to find patent claims invalid after an article iii court has upheld their the constitutionally mandated separation of powers,and therefore must be avoided.we disagree.the supreme court has repeatedly held that congress can not vest review of the decisions of article iii courts in officials of the executive branch.plaut spendthrift farm,d citing hayburn cases,dall.see also chi.air lines,waterman.it has been the firm and unvarying practice of constitutional courts to render no judgments not binding and conclusive on the parties and none that are subject to later review or alteration by administrative action.but the examiner rejection of claims in the patent pursuant to reexamination does not disturb this court earlier holding.there,the court held that syntron had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the patent was invalid and concluded that,based on the evidence presented,the jury could have found that this burden was not met.abbott labs.ii,at.the examiner did not reverse that holding and find
