the medicines company medicines is the owner of patent the patent and the patent.in response to an abbreviated new drug application anda submitted by mylan,mylan,medicines filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging that mylan anda infringed claims,and of the patent,and claims and of the patent.mylan counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the asserted claims were invalid.
the district court held on summary judgment that the asserted claims of the patent were not infringed because mylan did not satisfy the efficient mixing limitation of those claims.after conducting a bench trial,the court held that the asserted claims of the patent were infringed because those claims did not include an efficient mixing limitation.
we hold that both the and patents include a batches limitation that requires batch consistency,which,according to the patents in suit,is achieved through efficient mixing.efficient mixing is therefore required by the asserted claims of both patents.we further construe efficient mixing as defined by example of the patents specification.we therefore reverse the district court judgment of infringement with respect to the patent,and affirm its summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to the patent.we do not address the validity of the patents in suit.
background 
the and patents are directed to pharmaceutical formulations or batches of the drug bivalirudin produced through a process that consistently minimizes impurities.bivalirudin is a synthetic peptide used to prevent blood clotting in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.this clinical application arises from the drug ability to act as a reversible inhibitor of thrombin,a key enzyme in the cascade of biochemical reactions responsible for the formation of blood clots.bivalirudin pharmacological properties were known in the art,well before the filing of the patents in suit,and were covered by a patent owned by medicines that expired in,patent.
the claimed inventions of the and patents are directed to minimizing impurities in batches of bivalirudin that have been compounded with a base.see patent,ll.patent,ll.bivalirudin as an active ingredient is typically distributed or sold as a dry powder that must be compounded with a base,before being reconstituted in a clinical setting and administered to a patient as an intravenous injection.reconstitution involves dissolving the drug in dry powder form in an aqueous solvent such as water or saline.because dissolving bivalirudin by itself without a base results in an acidic solution not suitable for injection,commercial forms of bivalirudin compound bivalirudin with a base,which increases the ph of the reconstituted drug to a clinically acceptable level.
medicines received approval from the food drug administration fda to market a bivalirudin drug product in,and has sold the approved product since under the tradename angiomax,well before the critical date of the patents in suit.in approving angiomax,the fda required medicines to limit the level of an impurity generated during the compounding process that shortens bivalirudin shelf life to less than percent.is formed when the ninth amino acid of bivalirudin peptide chain converts from asparagine to aspartic acid.consequently,medicines was required to reject any angiomax batch determined to have an level higher than percent.see united states barr,supp,f.
between and,medicines and its contract manufacturer,ben venue laboratories bvl,produced and sold numerous batches of compounded bivalirudin having levels of less than percent.although the old compounding process,medicines mylan,supp,used by medicines and bvl to produce angiomax resulted in variable and sometimes high levels of impurities,id.at,the overriding majority of these batches in fact had levels below percent the level specified in the asserted claims.as the district court observed,of prior art angiomax batches had levels at or below about and medicines sold dozens of these batches prior to the critical date.id.at.
in and,however,medicines produced two batches of angiomax with levels above the percent limit specified by the fda.after failing to solve the problem of inconsistent batches internally,medicines retained a consultant,gary musso,who together with gopal krishna,an employee of medicines at the time,identified the compounding process used by bvl as the source of the problem.krishna and musso are the named of the and patents.
the process of compounding bivalirudin generally involves three steps forming a bivalirudin solution by dissolving the drug in an aqueous solution mixing the bivalirudin solution with a solution containing a base and removing solvents to yield the final compounded drug product.see medicines,supp.at.the and patents explain that in mixing the solution into the bivalirudin solution,concentrated sites in the compounding solution that have much higher ph levels are formed.see,patent,ll.these localized hot spots catalyzed the degradation of bivalirudin to,resulting in undesirable high levels of the impurity in some instances.see,id.
based on this principle,krishna and musso developed an improved,efficient mixing process for mixing the solution with the bivalirudin solution that minimized the formation of these hotspots.see medicines,supp.at.this improved efficient mixing process resulted in batches that consistently satisfied the fda percent limit on the level of.moreover,based on krishna and musso experiments,medicines discovered that the level of batches compounded using the improved efficient mixing process never exceeded percent.see id.at.
this batch consistency of bivalirudin drug products compounded using efficient mixing is the invention disclosed and claimed by the patents in suit,which were filed on the same day and share nearly identical specifications.see medicines mylan,wl,at.
representative claim of the patent provides 
pharmaceutical batches of a drug product comprising bivalirudin wherein the batches have a ph adjusted by a base,said ph is about when reconstituted in an aqueous solution for injection,and wherein the batches have a maximum impurity level of that does not exceed about as measured by hplc.

the emphasized claim limitation is common to both patents,and we refer to this shared limitation as the batches limitation.the term pharmaceutical batches is defined by the patents as follows 
as used here,batch or pharmaceutical batch refers to material produced by a single execution of a compounding process of various embodiments of the present invention.batches or pharmaceutical batches as defined herein may include a single batch,wherein the single batch is representative of all commercial batches see generally,manual of policies and procedures,center for drug evaluation and research,mapp,guidance on the packaging of test batches at,and wherein the levels of,for example,total impurities,and largest unknown impurity,and the reconstitution time represent levels for all potential batches made by said process.batches may also include all batches prepared by a same compounding process.

seeking to market a generic version of angiomax,mylan submitted an anda to the fda in.in its anda,mylan stated that it would limit the level of its generic product to less than percent.see medicines,supp.at.mylan also made a paragraph iv certification under the provisions of the act,j a vii iv,asserting that its product would not infringe the and patents listed in the fda orange book,or that these patents were invalid.in response,medicines filed suit in the district court alleging infringement of the and patents under e.mylan filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of invalidity.
the parties disputed the meaning of two claim terms pharmaceutical batches and efficiently mixing.with respect to pharmaceutical batches,the district court construed the term consistent with the definition set forth in the patents specification to refer to either a single batch,wherein the single batch is representative of all commercial batches made by a compounding process,and wherein the levels of,for example,total impurities,and largest unknown impurity,and the reconstitution time represent levels for all potential batches made by said process or all batches prepared by a same compounding process.medicines,wl,at emphasis added.the district court construction to which both parties ultimately consented adds the emphasized language to the specification definition of batches,thereby clarifying that the definition requires a particular process.see id.at.
with respect to efficiently mixing,the district court relied on two examples set forth in the patents specifications comparing medicines old compounding process using inefficient mixing conditions example with the improved efficient mixing process developed by krishna and musso example.see id.at see also patent,patent.the court ultimately agreed that medicines had disclaimed the inefficient mixing conditions of example and adopted mylan proposed construction of efficiently mixing to require not using inefficient mixing conditions such as described in example.medicines,wl,at.
based on these claim constructions,the district court held on summary judgment that mylan anda did not infringe the patent because the material facts concerning mylan compounding process were not in dispute and these undisputed facts show ed that mylan compounding process is more inefficient than the inefficient mixing process of example.see medicines v mylan,wl,at.with respect to the patent,however,the court held that efficiently mixing was not a claim limitation and determined that factual disputes concerning the level of mylan anda product precluded summary judgment.see id.at.
the district court conducted a bench trial with respect to infringement and validity of the patent.in its opinion,the court rejected mylan invalidity contentions and held that mylan anda infringed the patent as a matter of law.in so holding,the district court appeared to assume that any batch with an level below percent would infringe the claims,even though the court had earlier determined that the prior art disclosed such batches.the court reasoned that mylan anda specification would allow it to market a drug product with levels from,a range that includes the patent claimed ranges of,and w hat a generic applicant asks for and receives approval to market,if within the scope of a valid claim,is an infringement.see medicines,supp.at quoting sunovion,teva pharms.usa,fed.cir.the court again rejected mylan argument that the claims of the patent required efficient mixing and entered final judgment in favor of medicines on all claims and counterclaims with respect to the patent.id.at.
mylan has appealed the district court judgment of infringement and no invalidity of the patent,and medicines has the district court summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
shortly after the completion of briefing in this case,the panel issued an opinion holding the and patents invalid under the bar of b based on date batches of angiomax produced by bvl for medicines.see medicines hospira,fed.cir.accordingly,in this case,we reversed the district court judgment with respect to the patent and dismissed medicines regarding the patent as moot.
the full court subsequently granted medicines petition for rehearing en banc in hospira,and on rehearing held that medicines relationship with bvl did not give rise to an invalidating commercial offer for sale under pfaff wells electronics.see medicines hospira,fed.cir.en banc.we reopened and stayed this appeal when the court granted rehearing in hospira.following the court en banc decision,we requested the parties submit supplemental briefs.we now decide this appeal on the merits 
discussion 
our review of the district court summary judgment is plenary.see,glaxo grp.torpharm,fed.cir.we review the district court factual findings after a bench trial for clear error and the court legal conclusions de novo.see,braintree,novel,fed.cir.the district court claim constructions present pure questions of law subject to de novo review because the court made no factual findings concerning extrinsic evidence in construing the disputed claim terms.see,in re papst licensing dig.camera patent,fed.cir.
mylan argues on appeal that the district court erred by declining to interpret the claims of the patent to require efficient mixing as part of the batches limitation.we agree with mylan that efficient mixing is required by the batches limitation and is therefore a limitation of both the and patents.
the batches limitation restricts the claims of the patent as well as the patent to batches hav ing a maximum impurity level of that does not exceed about.at the outset,we note that the batches limitation can not be literally construed to cover individual batches of bivalirudin having levels that do not exceed about.such a construction would render the claims of the patent invalid in light of medicines numerous sales of angiomax batches having levels below percent.see medicines,supp.at.
rather,properly construed,what the batches limitation requires is the use of a process that achieves batch consistency.this requirement follows from simply reading the batches limitation against the specification definition of the term batches,as slightly revised by the district court with the agreement of the parties to clarify that the batches must be made by a particular compounding process.see medicines,wl,at.that definition limits the batches claimed by the patents in suit to either all batches prepared by a same compounding process,or a single batch wherein the levels of represent levels for all potential batches made by said process.patent,ll.emphasis added patent,ll.the batches limitation therefore requires a process that achieves consistency between batches produced from the same compounding process,batch consistency.
there is no real dispute that the claims require batch consistency vis the batches limitation.indeed,to the extent that medicines old compounding process resulted in angiomax batches having inconsistent levels,see medicines,supp.at,medicines agrees that batch consistency is the result of following the patent s in suit and is what distin guishes them from the prior art.see oral argument at,medicines hospira,fed.cir,id.at q.the point six limitation is not enough to distinguish the prior art it the consistency limitation,right yes.
the patentee,however,takes the position that the batches limitation is not necessarily limited to a compounding process that achieves batch consistency.instead,according to medicines,the batches limitation is satisfied whenever an accused infringer consistently produces batches having levels below percent,and that the claims do not require the use of a particular process that achieves batch consistency.
we disagree,for several reasons.first,adopting medicines interpretation of the batches limitation would yield an unworkable claim construction.under medicines interpretation,proof of infringement would necessitate assessments of whether an accused infringer production of future or potential batches would be likely to generate levels greater than about.to illustrate,if a defendant using the same compounding process produced fifty batches each having an level below percent,each of those fifty batches would infringe.but the defendant would not know whether any of the batches infringed until all fifty batches had been produced because if even one of those batches was determined to have an level higher than percent,none of the batches would infringe.see oral argument at,medicines mylan,fed.cir.for an ongoing commercial compounding process,this approach can not provide reasonable certainty regarding the scope of the asserted claims.nautilus,biosig instruments,geneva,glaxosmithkline plc,fed.cir.a claim is indefinite if its legal scope is not clear enough that a person of ordinary skill in the art could determine whether a particular composition infringes or not.morton int l,cardinal chem,fed.cir.c laims must be sufficiently precise to permit a potential competitor to determine whether or not he is infringing.
medicines interpretation also fails to consider the specification and prosecution history of the patents in suit,both of which demonstrate that the invention disclosed by the and patents is a compounding process that achieves batch consistency.the specification,for example,states that development of a compounding process for formulating bivalirudin that consistently generates formulations having low levels of impurities is desirable,patent,ll.emphasis added,and that the compounding process of the invention described herein may consistently generate pharmaceutical batches having the same characteristics,id.ll.emphasis added.
during prosecution of the patent as well as the patent,medicines further represented that i n the present invention,various embodiments relate to a less subjective and more consistent process for the mixing of the solution with the bivalirudin solution.emphasis added.medicines also took pains to distinguish its date sales of angiomax in observing that p harmaceutical batches as described by the patents in suit,and as prepared by the new process of the present invention have not been on offered for sale for more than one year as of the patents filing date.id.emphasis added.
finally,any remaining doubt that the batches limitation requires a compounding process is dispelled by medicines admission to the district court that w hen viewed in the context of the specification,it is readily apparent that the definition of pharmaceutical batches refers to the compounding processes described in the.medicines,wl,at.
thus,we reject medicines interpretation and conclude that the batches limitation requires the use of a compounding process that achieves batch consistency.in doing so,we note that our decision does not impermissibly add a process limitation to a product claim that does not require a process because the specification definition of batches by itself injects a compounding process as a limitation in the asserted claims 
the question remains as to what that compounding process entails.based on the intrinsic evidence of the patents in suit,the answer is that the compounding process must use efficient mixing.
the patents specification unequivocally states that the solution will be efficiently mixed,and that e fficient mixing of the solution will minimize levels of.see patent,ll.emphasis added patent,ll.indeed,apart from efficient mixing,no part of the patents disclosure teaches another method capable of producing consistent batches.in comparing the batches resulting from the inefficient mixing conditions of example with those from the efficient mixing conditions of example,the specification teaches that the characteristics of the batches generated by example may be variable,and that the efficient mixing process demonstrated in example produced batches generally and consistently having lower levels of impurities than the inefficient mixing process of example.patent,ll,ll.emphasis added patent,ll,ll.finally,the specification teaches that consistent batch es may be prepared by a compounding process comprising dissolving bivalirudin in a solvent to form a bivalirudin solution,efficiently mixing a solution with the bivalirudin solution to form a compounding solution,and removing solvents from the compounding solution.this compounding process includes all of the embodiments as described.patent,ll.emphasis added patent,ll.the specification therefore teaches efficient mixing as a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving batch consistency.
the prosecution history confirms that achieving batch consistency requires efficient mixing.medicines expedited the examination of the applications giving rise to the and patents by filing substantially the same petition to make special in both applications see medicines,wl,at.in these petitions,medicines explained the problem of high levels of batches from its old compounding process and stated that various embodiments of the present invention relate to a less subjective and more consistent process for the mixing of the solution with the bivalirudin solution.this process involves efficiently mixing the solution and the dissolved bivalirudin solution,which is not performed in the applicants prior compounding process.emphasis added.
after considering the same intrinsic evidence we have just summarized,the district court concluded that medicines had disclaimed inefficient mixing.see medicines,wl,at see also southwall,cardinal ig,fed.cir.whether we view the patentee as having disclaimed inefficient mixing or construe batches to require efficient mixing,see trustees of columbia symantec,fed.cir,at bottom,the compounding process must be one that uses efficient mixing.
medicines urges that reading the batches limitation to require efficient mixing would render the asserted claims of the patent which already recite an efficiently mixing step superfluous,and that the batches limitation extends to compounding processes that do not use efficient mixing.this is not correct.the recitation of other limitations in the claims of the patent dissolving bivalirudin in a solvent to form a first solution and removing the solvent and solution solvent means that the claims of the patents in suit would merely overlap,and overlapping patent claims are not unusual.andersen fiber composites,llc,fed.cir.divorcing efficient mixing from the batches limitation would also have the impermissible result of extend ing medicines monopoly beyond the invention disclosed,and potentially to the prior wabash appliance,plummer sargent,cochrane badische anilin soda fabrik.
for all these reasons,the reading of the batches limitation that most naturally aligns with the patent description of the invention is one that requires efficient mixing.phillips,at.and a lthough the patent claim language does not expressly recite efficient mixing,that is what they mean the situation here involves specifications that in all respects tell us what the claims mean,buttressed by statements made during prosecution accordingly,to attribute to the claims a meaning broader than any indicated in the patents and their prosecution history would be to ignore the totality of the facts of the case and exalt slogans over real meaning.ormco align,fed.cir.
the next question is what is meant by efficient mixing.medicines argues that the patents common specification defines efficient mixing as mixing that is characterized by minimizing levels of in the compounding solution,below percent in the intermediate solution medicines argues that this definition is controlling.we disagree.although this statement is taken verbatim from the specification,patent,ll,it does not purport to be definitional because it does not accord with the linguistic formula used by the patentee to signal the designation of other defined terms including batches.see patent,ll.see also,id.ll.defining drug product id,ll.defining carrier.as the district court observed,in defining terms,the patentees use d a similar format the defined term in quotation marks,followed by the terms refers to or as defined herein.medicines,wl,at see also patent,ll.because it departs from this format,the statement medicines relies on lacks the clear expression of intent necessary for a patentee to act as its own lexicographer.see,merck teva pharms.usa,fed.cir.
more importantly,medicines construction is problematic because it amounts to a mere recitation of the results obtained from efficient mixing rather than a definition of what the efficient mixing process is.before the district court,medicines conced ed that its proposed definition construes th
