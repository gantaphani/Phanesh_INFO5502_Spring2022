background 
medtronic corevalve,llc,medtronic cv luxembourg,and medtronic vascular galway collectively,medtronic sued edwards for infringement of claims,and of the patent asserted claims.the patent,entitled prosthetic valve for transluminal delivery,issued on february.filed on january,the patent descends from a number of united states,international,and french patent applications.on its face,the patent claims priority to french application french application filed on november.patent,cover page,item ll.however,because french application is not relevant to the claims asserted against edwards,the pertinent priority for the asserted claims has its genesis in french application french application,filed on october.from there,the chain of priority proceeds as follows,ending with patent application serial application,filed on january,which matured into the patent 
over the course of litigation,edwards became aware that the patent priority chain suffered from several defects for failure to comply with the requirements of and.edwards moved for partial summary judgment that these defects limited the priority date of the asserted claims to no earlier than april,the date on which patent application serial application was filed.based on the april,priority date,edwards also moved to invalidate the asserted claims on summary judgment under with earlier filed french application and international application patent cooperation treaty no.international application.
medtronic filed a for summary judgment on the priority date issue,contending that the priority chain of the patent suffered from no defects and that the asserted claims are entitled to a priority date of october,the filing date of french application.medtronic did not directly oppose edwards invalidity motion on the merits,contest any facts regarding the scope of the alleged invalidating prior art relative to the asserted claims.instead,medtronic doubled down on its priority date position because a finding that the patent is entitled to an october,priority date would defeat edwards invalidity challenge.
the district court granted edwards motion and denied medtronic.with respect to priority,the court found that the patent is not entitled to a priority date earlier than april,because it was neither in compliance with.to claim the benefit of the october,filing date of french application,nor in compliance with to claim the benefit of the october,filing date of international application.sj order,at.the district court interpreted,which governs priority claims based on an earlier filed foreign patent application,to require,inter alia,that all intermediate applications in a priority chain contain a specific reference to the foreign application from which priority is claimed.id.at.in medtronic case,not every intervening application in the priority chain that is,application,patent application serial application,and patent application serial application claimed priority to french application.thus,finding the priority record of the patent to be incomplete,the district court disallowed the patent from securing the benefit of the filing date of french application under.id.at.
for similar reasons,the district court also found that the defects in the patent priority chain rendered it unable to claim priority to international application under.citing encyclopaedia britannica,alpine electronics of america,the district court noted that under,a later filed application may claim priority based on an earlier filed application if,inter alia,the later filed application contains or is amended to contain a specific reference to the earlier filed application.sj order,at.to claim priority to international application,each intermediate application must recite every intervening application before it all the way back to international application.id.at.because the specifications of applications and each simply state that this application is also a of international application,these applications have failed to recite the correct chain of priority as required by.id.in particular,medtronic application broke the priority chain by leaving out application in making its claim for priority to international application likewise,application failed to link applications and in its priority claim to international application.the district court thus found that the patent can not claim priority back to international application under.id.
the parties did not dispute that the patent can claim priority to the patent application that was next along the priority chain,application,filed on april,because it recited its priority claim accurately.accordingly,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of edwards and set the priority date of the patent to be no earlier than april.id.
with respect to invalidity,the district court noted that apart from the priority date issue,medtronic did not rebut edwards evidence that the asserted claims of the patent were anticipated by french application under d,or that asserted claims,and were anticipated by patents that issued from french application and international application under a.id.at.upon finding the effective filing date of the patent to be april,well after the filing date of the d reference and the issuance and publication date of the a references the district court held medtronic corresponding patent claims invalid as anticipated.the district court thereafter granted summary judgment of invalidity to edwards.id.at.
on november,the district court entered final judgment against medtronic,and adjudged claims,and of the patent to be invalid under.medtronic appeals.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment under the law of the regional circuit,here the ninth circuit.teva pharm.indus.astrazeneca pharm.lp.the ninth circuit reviews summary judgment rulings without deference.dealertrack,huber.determination of a patent priority date is purely a question of law if the facts underlying that determination are undisputed.du pont de nemours macdermid printing solutions,llc.this case presents no disputed issues of fact relevant to the district court determinations.
medtronic appeal asks us to determine whether the district court erred in holding that the patent could not claim the benefit of an earlier priority date for failure to comply with the requirements of both and.medtronic recognizes,however,that it must demonstrate compliance with both and to overcome the final judgment of invalidity because that finding rests entirely on the district court priority date determination.thus,the parties agree that an affirmance of the district court determination under either or would seal the fate of the patent.oral argument at,medtronic corevalve,llc edwards lifesciences,available at.aspx fl.therefore,we need to examine the district court analysis only with respect to one of the two provisions governing priority we choose.
section allows a later filed patent application to claim the benefit of an earlier filing date in the united states if,among other requirements it contains or is amended to contain a specific reference to the earlier filed application submitted at such time during the pendency of the application as required by the director.we recently clarified that the specific reference requirement mandates each intermediate application in the chain of priority to refer to the prior applications.encyclopaedia b
