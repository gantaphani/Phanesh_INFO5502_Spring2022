plaintiff humana medical plan,and humana insurance company collectively,humana brought suit against glaxosmithkline,and glaxosmithkline plc collectively,glaxo alleging that glaxo was obligated to reimburse humana for expenses humana had incurred treating its insureds injuries resulting from glaxo drug,avandia.humana runs a medicare advantage plan.its complaint asserts that,pursuant to the medicare act,glaxo is in this instance a primary payer obligated to reimburse humana as a secondary payer.the district court dismissed the action,agreeing with glaxo that the medicare act did not provide medicare advantage organizations maos with a private cause of action to seek such reimbursement.humana filed a timely appeal.
the medicare secondary payer act,in b a,provides humana with a private cause of action against glaxo.even if we were to find,as appellees suggest,that this provision is ambiguous,we would nonetheless be required to defer to regulations issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.the regulations make clear that the provision extends the private cause of action to maos.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
glaxo manufactures and distributes avandia,a type diabetes drug that has been linked to substantially increased risk of heart attack and stroke.thousands of avandia patients have alleged various injuries resulting from their use of the drug and glaxo has begun entering into agreements to settle these claims as part of the settlement process,where the claimant is insured by medicare,glaxo sets aside reserves to reimburse the medicare trust fund for payments it made to cover the costs of treatment for the claimants injuries.
while most individuals receive medicare benefits directly from the government,individuals can elect instead to receive their benefits through private insurance companies that contract with the government to provide medicare advantage ma plans.a.glaxo has not,to date,included reimbursement of ma plans in the settlement agreements that it has reached with avandia claimants enrolled in ma plans,although maos have paid the costs of treatment of injuries for these claimants humana ma plan provides benefits to approximately one million people,and humana filed this lawsuit to seek reimbursement from glaxo for the costs of treating its enrollees injuries.
on november,humana filed its class action complaint in the eastern district of pennsylvania humana sought,on behalf of itself and a class of maos damages under the medicare secondary payer act msp act,which provides a private cause of action,b a,allowing double damages for failure to reimburse a secondary payer and equitable relief in the form of an order compelling glaxo to identify settling avandia claimants to the maos that cover them.
on december,glaxo filed a motion to dismiss.the district court heard oral argument on the motion and,on june,granted it.in dismissing the action,the district court noted that part c of the medicare act the medicare advantage or ma statute contains its own secondary payer provision,a.in re avandia,sales practices,and prods.liability,wl,at.june.the district court observed that this provision references the msp act without fully adopting or incorporating it and that its language is permissive,whereas the language of the msp act is mandatory.id.given the existence of the ma statute provision,specifically relevant to maos,the district court held that the private cause of action within the msp act did not apply to maos,nor did the secondary payer provision in the ma statute create a private right of action for maos.id.at.next,the district court analyzed whether an implied private right of action for humana existed according to the test laid out by the supreme court in cort ash,d.in re avandia,wl,at.although the district court found that humana met the first prong of the test,as it was a member of the class the statute was enacted to benefit,it found that humana failed on the other three prongs there was no clear legislative intent to create a remedy for humana,it was not consistent with the legislative scheme to imply a remedy,and the cause of action was one traditionally litigated under state law.id.the district court therefore found that no implied private right of action existed.
additionally,the district court found that the statute silence on the existence of a private right of action for maos does not create ambiguity,but rather indicates congress intent not to create a private right of action for maos.id.at.with no ambiguity in the plain text of the statute,the district court held that the judicial deference to regulations required by chevron,natural resources defense council,d,did not come into play.accordingly,the court did not defer to the cms regulation that granted maos parity with medicare recovery from primary payers,see f.in re avandia,wl,at.
finally,humana sought an order from the district court ordering glaxo to disclose information about settlements that humana enrollees entered into with glaxo.the district court declined to grant humana the equitable relief it sought.it found that humana,and not glaxo,had access to information about which avandia claimants were enrolled in humana ma plan and that humana could use this information to remind claimants of their obligation to disclose any settlement they might reach with glaxo id.
humana filed a timely notice of appeal.humana asks this court to determine whether the district court erred in holding that the private cause of action in the msp act,b a,did not provide humana with a cause of action here.america health insurance plans,representing the health insurance industry,filed an amicus brief in support of humana.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review

iii.analysis 
humana asks this court to determine whether the private cause of action for double damages created by the medicare secondary payer act,b a,provides it and other maos with the right to bring suit we find that the plain text of the provision sweeps broadly enough to include maos and that,even if we determined the statute to be ambiguous on this point,deference to cms would require us to find that maos have the same right to recover as the medicare trust fund does.we will therefore reverse the decision of the district court.
a.the medicare statute 
subchapter xviii of chapter of title of the united states code is entitled health insurance for aged and disabled,and is more commonly known as the medicare statute.to.the medicare statute divides benefits into four parts.part a,hospital insurance benefits for aged and disabled,and part b,supplementary medical benefits for aged and disabled,create,describe,and regulate traditional,medicare.to j to.part c,inserted with the passage of the balanced budget act of,pub,creates the program now known as medicare advantage,which allows for the creation of ma plans and is described in detail below.to.finally,part d provides for prescription drug coverage for medicare enrollees.to.
part c allows medicare enrollees to obtain their medicare benefits through private insurers maos instead of receiving direct benefits from the government under parts a and a.cms pays an mao a fixed amount for each enrollee,per capita a capitation.the mao then administers medicare benefits for those enrollees and assumes the risk associated with insuring them.maos like humana are thus responsible for paying covered medical expenses for their enrollees.part c allows maos some flexibility as to the design of their ma plans.the mao is required to provide the benefits covered under parts a and b to enrollees,but it may also provide additional benefits to its enrollees.a.
part c also includes one of the two provisions that lie at the heart of this case.entitled organization as secondary payer,this provision states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,an mao may in the case of the provision of items and services to an individual under an ma plan under circumstances in which payment under this title is made secondary pursuant to section b of this title charge or authorize the provider of such services to charge,in accordance with the charges allowed under a law,plan,or policy described in such section 
a the insurance carrier,employer,or other entity which under such law,plan,or policy is to pay for the provision of such services,or 
b such individual to the extent that the individual has been paid under such law,plan,or policy for such services.
a the mao secondary payer provision.
this provision the part c secondary payer provision b for its definitions of primary payers and its positioning of medicare as a secondary payer.that provision is located within b,the medicare secondary payer act,enacted in.it provides that medicare can not pay medical expenses where payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made under a workmen compensation law or plan of the united states or a state or under an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan including a plan or under no fault insurance.b a ii.further,a business shall be deemed to have a plan if it carries its own risk whether by a failure to obtain insurance,or otherwise in whole or in part.id.glaxo,which pays out of its own pocket to settle the claims,is and therefore a primary payer in this instance.
the msp act also gives the secretary the authority to make conditional payments in circumstances where a primary payer is actually responsible for the cost of medical treatment but has not made or can not reasonably be expected to make payment with respect to such item or service promptly.b b i.in such a circumstance,the primary plan must subsequently reimburse the medicare trust fund.b b ii.if the primary plan fails to reimburse the fund,the united states may bring an action against any or all entities that are or were required or responsible to make payment under a primary plan.b b iii.the government may then collect double damages,in accordance with paragraph a.id.
paragraph a the msp private cause of action provision is the other provision central to this case.it states 
there is established a private cause of action for damages which shall be in an amount double the amount otherwise provided in the case of a primary plan which fails to provide for primary payment or appropriate reimbursement in accordance with the requirements of the msp act.
the medicare statute thus creates two separate causes of action allowing for recovery of double damages where a primary payer fails to cover the costs of medical treatment.when the medicare trust fund makes a conditional payment and the primary payer does not reimburse it,the united states may bring suit pursuant to b b iii.additionally,a private cause of action with no particular plaintiff specified exists pursuant to b a anytime a primary payer fails to make required payments exactly how broadly this latter provision sweeps will determine the outcome of this appeal.
textual arguments 
msp private cause of action provision 
the plain text of the msp private cause of action lends itself to humana position that any private party may bring an action under that provision.it establishes a private cause of action for damages and places no additional limitations on which private parties may bring suit.b a.accordingly,we find that the provision is broad and unambiguous,placing no limitations upon which private,actors can bring suit for double damages when a primary plan fails to appropriately reimburse any secondary payer.
glaxo presents no argument that undermines this facially clear reading.the msp private cause of action provision allows for damages where the primary plan has failed to pay in accordance with paragraphs and a.id.paragraph a,in turn,consistently refers to payments under this subchapter.b a.glaxo contends that payments under this subchapter refers to payments made by the medicare trust fund and excludes payments from the mao to private entities,which are instead made pursuant to private contracts of insurance between the mao and the participant.id.at.
in contrast,humana argues that because subchapter refers to the medicare act as a whole,and not in particular to parts a or b under which the government provides benefits directly to enrollees,payments made by private providers under parts c or d are also covered.humana supports this assertion by highlighting other places in the medicare act where congress intentionally limited the applicability of a provision to payments made under particular parts of the medicare act.appellants br.these provisions refer specifically to payment made under part a or part b of this subchapter,a,or payment made under part b of this subchapter,c.see also f requiring secretary to establish guidelines as to whether payment may be made for certain expenses under part a or part b of this subchapter.
this language makes clear that subchapter refers to the medicare act as a whole.since the msp act and its private cause of action provision do not attach any narrowing language to payments made under this subchapter,that phrase applies to payments made under part c as well as those made under parts a and accordingly,that language can not be read to exclude maos from the ambit of the private cause of action provision.
it is worth noting that,although the msp act was enacted before part c,which created maos,private medicare risk plans were authorized under in,before the passage of the msp act.act of,a,pub,stat.thus,at the time it enacted the msp act,congress was aware that private medicare providers existed.had it intended to prevent them from suing under the private cause of action provision,congress could have done so explicitly.
mao secondary payer provision 
glaxo raises a number of arguments stemming from its contention that the msp private cause of action provision can not be read in a vacuum.glaxo urges this court to analyze the relationship between maos and the msp act by beginning with the mao secondary payer provision.the plain text of the mao secondary payer provision,glaxo avers,makes clear that maos do not have a federal cause of action anywhere under the medicare act.further,because this provision specifically defines the relationship of maos to secondary payer status and the msp act,it controls those relationships,and the msp private cause of action does not apply to maos 
in glaxo argument,the mao secondary payer provision,by stating that an mao may charge or authorize the provider of services to charge the primary payer,gives maos the right to include in their policy contracts provisions making them secondary payers in situations in which a primary payer would be liable under the msp act.a.it does not,however,provide a federal remedy for the enforcement of that right.see alexander sandoval,d stating that statute does not create private cause of action unless congress intended to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.at oral argument,glaxo asserted that this provision was intended to preempt state law that could preclude an mao from positioning itself as a secondary payer,as certain personal injury laws might.
under the interpretation urged by glaxo,no rights to reimbursement are granted to an mao by the medicare act.instead,such rights can be secured by the mao contract with an individual insured that is,the insurance policy.this policy may define an mao as a secondary payer,according to the definition contained in the msp act,and it may also contain rights of reimbursement and subrogation then,if a primary payer were to fail to reimburse the mao,the mao could sue to enforce its contractual rights in state court.it could be made whole either by recovering from the primary payer through subrogation or,if the insured has received payment from the primary payer,from the insured directly.
the district court accepted this interpretation of the mao secondary payer provision.wl,at see also parra pacificare of arizona,civ,wl,finding congress did no more than provide maos with right to charge bill a beneficiary for reimbursement,notwithstanding and sic state law or regulation to the contrary.it is important to remember,though,that humana does not contend that a endows it with a private right of action.instead,it hangs its hat entirely on the msp act provision.thus,a is relevant only inasmuch as it assists us in interpreting the msp private cause of action provision,and we are not persuaded that it undermines the meaning of the plain text of that provision.
glaxo further contends that the reference to b in the mao secondary payer provision,far from incorporating the entirety of the msp act into part c,in fact makes clear that only the definition of a primary payer from the msp act is incorporated there.appellees br.this argument is unavailing for the same reason humana is not arguing that the mao secondary payer provision provides a cause of action through its reference to the msp act,but that the language of the msp private cause of action is itself broad enough to encompass an mao such as humana,regardless of the existence of a.in order to find these arguments persuasive,we would need to determine that,although private insurers providing medicaid services could have brought suit under the msp private cause of action provision before the enactment of the ma secondary payer provision,once that text became law,the msp private cause of action was closed to them.we will not reach this conclusion.
glaxo final argument based on the text of the mao secondary payer provision is that the permissive nature of the language there an mao may charge a primary plan,in contrast to the mandatory nature of the language in the msp act payment under this subchapter may not be made means that maos can not be authorized to bring suit under the msp private cause of action.a b a.glaxo reads far too much into this distinction.no mao,acting rationally,would decline to position itself as a secondary payer in order to charge primary payers where appropriate.accordingly,the fact that congress employs permissive language when establishing rules for private,entities and mandatory language when creating rules for the secretary,a federal official over whom congress exercises control,has no effect on the proper interpretation of msp private cause of action.
in short,there is nothing in the text or legislative history of the ma secondary payer provision that demonstrates a congressional intent to deny maos access to the msp private cause of action.
court decisions 
none of the decisions cited by glaxo or the district court provide us with sufficient reason to conclude that,in contravention of the plain text of the msp private cause of action provision,an mao may not bring suit under it.the district court found that no federal private cause of action exists under the msp act by relying on two cases,neither of which had plaintiffs who made an argument based on the msp act provision at issue here.
in care choices hmo engstrom,cir,the sixth circuit considered the argument of care choices,a hmo,that it had an implied federal private right of action allowing it to recover the cost of an insured medical expenses,where the participant had collected damages from the tortfeasor who had injured her.that court declined to find an implied private right of action in the provision allowing care choices to occupy status.in so doing,it compared the language of the msp act private cause of action provision with e finding the contrast to support its holding that e was not intended to create any private right of action.id.at.whether care choices could have brought suit as a private actor under the msp act was neither raised nor addressed and thus the decision of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit can not guide us here.
similarly,in nott aetna healthcare,d,the court considered whether e or a created a federal scheme for enforcement of a hmo subrogation rights that would completely preempt conflicting state laws.the nott court noted explicitly that b b ii,the government cause of action for reimbursement,was not implicated in the case,id.at,and it nowhere mentioned the b a private cause of action.relying substantially on care choices,it held that t here is no federal cause of action created by either subsection and thus no preemption.id.at.
once again,because the decision does not discuss whether a private insurer providing medicare services can bring suit under the msp private cause of action,it is of limited relevance here 
in contrast,the decision of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit in bio medical applications of,central states health and welfare fund,cir,does specifically consider the msp private cause of action provision.there,the court held that the demonstrated responsibility provision of the applied only to situations in which the primary payer was a tortfeasor and not to the case before it,in which the primary plan was actually a primary insurer.id.at.in explicating this point,it noted that a tortfeasor could be held liable as a primary payer under the msp act only when medicare sues for reimbursement from a primary plan and not when the plaintiff is a private party.id.at.it buttressed this distinction between medicare and private parties with a number of arguments from the statute text and legislative history id.at.however,the private party bringing suit in bio medical was neither an mao nor a hmo,and the court there did not consider how such an entity would fit into the dichotomy it described.as the remainder of this opinion will demonstrate,we believe that denying an mao the rights to recovery provided to medicare would undermine the very purpose of the ma program and that congress did not intend this result.
legislative history and policy 
although we find the text of the statute to be unambiguous,we nonetheless include here a discussion of the legislative history and policy rationales that support our conclusion.
congress goal in creating the medicare advantage program was to harness the power of private sector competition to stimulate experimentation and innovation that would ultimately create a more efficient and less expensive medicare system.see,at,conf.stating that ma program was intended to enable the medicare program to utilize innovations that have helped the private market contain costs and expand health care delivery options.it was the belief of congress that the ma program would continue to grow and eventually eclipse original medicare as the predominant form of enrollment under the medicare program.id.at.the ma program was thus,like the msp statute,designed to curb skyrocketing health costs and preserve the fiscal integrity of the medicare system.fanning united states,cir.
it would be impossible for maos to stimulate innovation through competition if they began at a competitive disadvantage,and,as cms has noted,maos compete best when they recover consistently from primary payers.policy and technical changes to the medicare advantage and the medicare prescription drug benefit programs,fed.reg.when they faithfully pursue and recover from liable third parties,maos will have lower medical expenses and will therefore be able to provide additional benefits to their enrollees id.if medicare could threaten recalcitrant primary payers with double damages and maos could not,maos would be at a competitive disadvantage,unable to exert the same pressure and thus forced to expend more resources collecting from such payers.it is difficult to believe that it would have been the intent of congress to hamstring maos in this manner.
although the legislative history is nowhere explicit that maos may bring suit for double damages under the msp private cause of action or using any other provision,it does make clear that maos were intended to enjoy a status parallel to that of traditional medicare 
under original,the federal government alone set legislative requirements regarding reimbursement,covered
