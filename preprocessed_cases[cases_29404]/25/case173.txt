james shortt pleaded guilty to one count,of a indictment,charging him with participating in a conspiracy to distribute and dispense and to cause to be distributed and dispensed anabolic steroids and human growth hormone,in violation of a,e,and.the version of the sentencing guidelines,which contained no provision to address the illegal distribution of human growth hormone and certain forms of anabolic steroids,provided for an offense level of,for a sentencing range of zero to six months imprisonment.considering this deficiency in the sentencing guidelines,as well as factors listed in a,the district court imposed a variance sentence of imprisonment of months and day.
on appeal,shortt challenges his sentence as unreasonable,arguing principally that the factors the district court considered were already accounted for in the sentence recommended by the sentencing guidelines or otherwise should not have been considered.concluding that the district court,in the circumstances of this case,did not abuse its discretion in imposing a variance sentence,we affirm.
shortt,a physician licensed in south carolina and wisconsin,practiced medicine in columbia,south carolina,since at least.as a regular and substantial part of his practice,shortt prescribed and dispensed anabolic steroids and human growth hormone to athletes solely to enhance their performance.for bodybuilders not subject to testing,shortt prescribed injectable steroids.for athletes subject to testing,he designed programs,drugs,and testing to avoid discovery of the athletes use of such steroids and human growth hormone.professional athletes relying on shortt flew into columbia from all over the country,and they included more than dozen professional football players from the national football league carolina panthers.
to hide the athletes use of steroids and human growth hormone,shortt prescribed substances in forms that carried fewer detectable chemical.he also monitored athletes testosterone levels to be sure that they remained within ranges that aroused no suspicion blew no whistles,as he repeatedly said.typifying his counseling is the following excerpt from an audiotape recording of shortt conversation with a football player 
and for you guys professional football players,what i am looking for is nondetectable performance enhancement.so,immune modulation is always a good thing.natural testosterone is always a good thing.and when we get to it in a to it in a minute,you could probably do well with a little bit of growth hormone.actually,you could do with a medium amount of growth hormone.
so that that all i would do with you right there.a small amount of dhea,not enough to blow any whistles,and testosterone.usp testosterone.
now,ways to deliver it.do use a shot,because that always got a carrier molecule on it.a cream,a gel,or a buccal.now,you ca swallow it,your stomach will degrade it.but you can get troches lozenges,put them between your cheek and your gum.and in you guys cases,i would probably use the cream.and the reason for that is,it would take much of a stretch for somebody to say,okay,spit in the cup.and if you do,you will come up sky high on it,should somebody test it.nobody has,you know.it in their best interest to level the playing field,but it not in their best interest to bust the whole damn team,you know.i mean,really.so,they not going to want to do that.so,a little bit of testosterone will probably start you out.
following an undercover investigation of shortt medical practice,shortt was indicted by a grand jury for participating in a conspiracy to dispense anabolic steroids and human growth hormone not for legitimate medical purposes and outside the usual course of professional practice,in violation of a,e,and.he was also charged in counts alleging overt acts over a period of three and years through during the course of the conspiracy.
pursuant to a plea agreement,shortt pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count,and during the course of pleading guilty,he admitted to the facts proffered by the government,including the facts and drug quantities alleged in the counts of overt acts.
the presentence report recommended a sentencing offense level of,pursuant to c.the report also recommended a enhancement under for shortt use of a special skill as a doctor and a reduction under a for acceptance of responsibility.the final offense level of,combined with a criminal history category i,yielded a sentencing range of zero to six months imprisonment.in setting forth these calculations,the presentence report noted that the guidelines do not address steroids in cream form or in the form of a troche,which is similar to a lozenge and is taken orally and sucked until it is dissolved.the report pointed out that a troche is distinguishable from a pill,capsule,or tablet,which is addressed in the guidelines.the presentence report also observed that the sentencing commission had not promulgated a guideline for violations of e,which prohibits the distribution of human growth hormone in the absence of an explicit guideline,the probation officer determined the offense level for distribution of human growth hormone by reference to the amount paid by the user of the substance,but this reference did not increase the sentence as calculated solely for the distribution of steroids.at the conclusion of the report,the probation officer noted that he had no information concerning the offense or the offender which would warrant a departure from the prescribed sentencing guidelines.he did note,however,that the attorney indicated he will file a motion for a variance prior to sentencing in which he will request that the court sentence a defendant outside the applicable guideline range,pursuant to a a and b.
the district court conducted a lengthy sentencing hearing,receiving the testimony of witnesses and the arguments of counsel.the court then observed that neither party had objected to the presentence report and accepted its recommendations as accurate calculations under the sentencing guidelines.after considering the factors contained in a,however,the court decided to impose a variance sentence because a sentence within the zero to range as recommended by the sentencing guidelines does not serve the factors of a.it sentenced shortt to months and day imprisonment.as the court stated,by ordering a sentence of months and day shortt will be eligible to earn good time credit and can thereby reduce his sentence by percent.the court identified two a factors that were not adequately served by the guidelines recommended sentence the nature and circumstances of the offense,see a and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense,see a a.the court then gave seven reasons that prompted it to select the variance sentence that it imposed.
first,shortt made elaborate efforts to conceal his wrongdoing.as the court stated,the bodybuilders,who were not tested,were given straight injectable anabolic steroids,whereas the athletes were treated with methods designed to conceal the use of contraband.
second,the court was troubled by the defendant cavalier attitude toward the use of steroids,referring to how shortt and the professional football players joked about being caught.
third,the court pointed to the scope of the offense.during the three and year period for which the government had records of shortt conduct,shortt made dispensations of anabolic steroids,either for prescriptions or refills.and these include d milliliters of injectable anabolic steroids,milliliters of anabolic steroid cream,troches or lozenges,and anabolic steroid tablets.by the defendant own admission he had athletes,flying from all over,to receive his services.
fourth,the court observed that because human growth hormone was not specifically addressed by the sentencing guidelines,the guidelines recommended sentence did not reflect the seriousness of the offense.the court stated,the end result is there is no penalty imposed at all because of the use of prescriptions for the human growth hormone.
fifth,the court referred to the fact that shortt dispensed steroids to an overweight teenager years old a particularly vulnerable victim.the court recognized that it was not clear whether there might have existed a medical need for the treatment,but nonetheless observed that dispensing steroids to convert the teenager fat into muscle was consistent with shortt other illegal conduct in this case.
sixth,the court concluded that it could not ignore the fact that the steroids were dispensed to professional athletes.as the court stated 
drugs such as human growth hormone and steroids irreparably tarnish the career achievements of many athletes whose records and accomplishments are called into question.in that sense then the victims of crimes such as the one at issue here include not only the athletes themselves,but also sports fans in living rooms all over the country.
seventh and finally,the court pointed to shortt lack of remorse.even during allocution,shortt stated that he considered the dispensation of steroids and human growth hormone somewhat equivalent to healing and repairing.
from the district court judgment,shortt filed this appeal,raising the single question of whether the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence by improperly applying the a factors.
following united states booker,d,our procedure for sentencing has become established.a sentencing court must begin by properly calculating the sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines.it must then determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors set forth in a and,if not,select a sentence within statutory limits that does serve those factors.united states moreland,cir quoting united states green,cir.when a district court concludes that a variance outside the recommended guideline range,see moreland,at serves the purposes of sentencing as stated in a,we review the district court sentencing judgment for abuse of discretion.see green,at.
applying the version of the sentencing guidelines,the report in this case recommended an offense level of for a sentencing range of zero to six months imprisonment and identified no grounds for a departure.neither the government nor the defendant challenged this conclusion,and the district court accepted the recommendation as a correct application of the sentencing guidelines.likewise,on appeal,neither party challenges the application of the sentencing guidelines or the guidelines recommended sentence of zero to six months imprisonment.
because the court found,however,that a sentence within the range of zero to six months would not adequately serve the sentencing purposes mandated by congress in a,it imposed a variance sentence of months and day imprisonment.the issue of reasonableness raised on this appeal thus depends on whether the district court properly applied the a factors.
section of title mandates that defendants be sentenced for federal offenses in accordance with the provisions of this chapter so as to achieve the purposes set forth in subparagraphs a through d of section a to the extent that they are applicable in light of all the circumstances of the case.emphasis added.that specific mandate is repeated in the first sentence of a,which provides the court shall impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph of this subsection.emphasis added see also b.section a then provides that in determining a particular sentence,a sentencing court must consider seven enumerated factors thus,a serves two functions.first,it prescribes that every sentence comply with the four announced purposes for sentencing.second,it lists seven factors that a court must consider in determining a particular sentence,and included as one of the factors is the list of announced purposes for sentencing in a.
a sentence that does not serve the announced purposes of a is unreasonable.see moreland,at green,at.likewise,a sentence that is greater than necessary to serve those purposes is unreasonable.see a requiring the imposition of a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary.because the sentencing guidelines were designed to achieve the a purposes,see b,a cmt.historical review of original introduction,a sentence selected from the range recommended by the sentencing guidelines is presumptively reasonable.see united states johnson,cir green,at.of course,the presumption is rebuttable,and therefore a variance sentence is not presumptively unreasonable.but a variance sentence must,to be reasonable,serve the four sentencing purposes of a.
the sentencing purposes identified in a a to d are the four foundational purposes of sentencing that have long prevailed throughout our jurisprudence punishment,deterrence,incapacitation,and rehabilitation.see generally ilene nagel,structuring sentencing discretion the new federal sentencing guidelines.criminology.although still relevant,the fourth purpose,rehabilitation,was recognized by congress and the sentencing commission to be insufficient,standing on its own,to justify a particular sentence,at,as reprinted in.the sentencing reform act of came about in response to widespread dissatisfaction with the existing system of indeterminate sentencing,which was characterized by unwarranted disparity and by uncertainty about the length of time offenders will serve in prison.id.at,as reprinted in at.this existing system was largely based on an outmoded rehabilitation model emphasis added,which led to inconsistent terms of imprisonment without success in rehabilitating prisoners.id.at,as reprinted in at.while congress did not,in the act,abandon rehabilitation as a sentencing purpose,it nonetheless intended that purpose to have a reduced importance.to reform the system,it elevated the other three punishment,deterrence,and incapacitation.indeed,the senate committee drafting the act placed special emphasis on the first stated purpose a a the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense.id.at,as reprinted in at.as it observed,the first purpose should be reflected clearly in all sentences.id.emphasis added.
the proper application of a therefore requires a sentencing court to focus on the four purposes of sentencing,as applicable in a particular case,and to consider,in determining a sentence that achieves those purposes,the seven factors listed in a.a sentence that fails to fulfill the purposes can not be saved,even if it is supported by consideration of the six other factors.
in this case,the district court recognized that the last two purposes a c the need to incapacitate and a d the need to rehabilitate were not implicated by the circumstances.rather,at the heart of the sentencing court concern was the question whether a zero to six months sentence of imprisonment properly reflected the seriousness of shortt offense and provided a just punishment for it a a.the court correctly understood that a failure to recognize the seriousness of the offense would promote disrespect for the law.
reviewing the circumstances of this case in light of the stated purposes for sentencing,we conclude that the district court concerns were well founded and that it acted within its discretion in imposing the variance sentence.
a doctor illegal dispensing of steroids and human growth hormone has a particularly pernicious effect.in the name of enhancing athletic performance,a doctor dispensing steroids and human growth hormone exposes an athlete to numerous health risks,including extreme mood swings,liver and kidney tumors,liver and prostate cancer,heart attacks,high blood pressure,and infertility.see.i,at.the perversion of the doctor professional responsibility to prescribe drugs for the health of his patients is at the core of the violation seriousness.indeed,it was this seriousness of conduct that had drawn the attention of congress,even at the time of the conspiracy in this case,prompting it to direct the sentencing commission to increase penalties for the illicit dispensing of anabolic steroids.see anabolic steroids control act of,stat.
the maximum sentence for such either a or e is five years imprisonment.yet,the sentencing guidelines applicable to shortt conduct re
