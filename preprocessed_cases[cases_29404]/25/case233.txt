karen robinson and her husband suing for loss of consortium brought a products liability suit against mcneil consumer healthcare in an illinois state court.the case was removed to a federal district court in illinois under the diversity jurisdiction.mcneil parent,johnson johnson,was a defendant in the district court,but the jury found in its favor and the appellants do not challenge the finding,so it is out of the case.
the district judge ruled that virginia law governed the substantive issues in the case.that law both rejects strict liability as a basis for a products liability suit,harris,sensenbrenner rust,orling neale,architects,va lust clark equipment,cir applying virginia law compare restatement second of torts,so that a plaintiff has to prove negligence and deems contributory negligence a complete defense to a claim of negligence,litchford hancock,fein wade.
after a trial the jury found that mcneil had been negligent,and calculated robinson compensatory damages at million.but the jury also found that she had been contributorily negligent,and contributory negligence is a complete defense to negligence under the law of judge entered judgment for mcneil.the robinsons appeal,but since robinson claim is derivative from his wife,we need discuss it,and for the sake of simplicity we pretend that his wife is the only plaintiff.
mcneil manufactures and sells children motrin,an drug though there also a prescription version,as we have occasion to note.the active ingredient is ibuprofen,a drug nsaid,used primarily to alleviate pain and fever,that is also the active ingredient in advil.the warnings section on the label of the bottle of motrin that robinson bought for her child begins allergy alert ibuprofen may cause a severe allergic reaction which may include hives,facial swelling,asthma wheezing,shock.after additional warnings of side effects the label says stop use and see a doctor if an allergic reaction occurs.she read the warnings before buying the drug.
in september,four or five months later,she awoke in the middle of the night with a headache and took two teaspoonfuls of the children motrin that she had dose suggested for a child six to eight years reading the warnings the specifics of which she had forgotten on the label.when she awoke the next morning she noticed a rash on her chest.the rash worsened throughout the day.that night she woke up with a fever and took two more teaspoonfuls of the motrin,again without reading the warnings.the next morning she went to see her doctor,who gave her a dose of benadryl and prescribed a medrol pack,both being drugs for treating allergic reactions.she mentioned that she had taken children motrin he did not react.
later that day she noticed that the rash on her chest was sprouting blisters,and her fever increased.after waking up late that night she again took two teaspoonfuls of the motrin without reading the warnings.the next morning,with her condition deteriorating rapidly,she went back to her doctor,who immediately ordered her hospitalized.she was diagnosed with ten toxic epidermal necrolysis,an especially severe form of sjs syndrome.ten is a rare but disease that causes severe blistering and consequent sloughing off of skin over much of the body,together with serious damage to the mouth,eyes,throat,and esophagus.roujeau,robert stern bruce wintroub,cutaneous drug reactions,harrison principles of internal medicine,anthony fauci et,ed ghislain roujeau,treatment of severe drug syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis,visited july.the treatment for the disease is similar to that given burn victims.
robinson survived,but sixty percent of her skin had sloughed off,and she lost the vision in one eye and has only limited vision in the other,which requires constant medical treatment she is expected to go blind eventually.she has required multiple operations on her throat and esophagus as a result of the damage to those organs caused by the disease.
the initial legal question presented by these unhappy facts is choice of law.virginia as we said makes contributory negligence a complete defense to liability for negligence.today that is distinctly a minority position,restatement third of torts apportionment of liability comment a,contrary to the prediction in pennsylvania aspell,that a rule of law not likely to be changed in all time to come is that there can be no recovery for an injury caused by the mutual default of both parties.illinois makes the victim negligence a partial defense under the rubric of comparative fault,which merely reduces the damages awarded the plaintiff unless the plaintiff negligence exceeds the defendant,in which event the plaintiff negligence is a complete defense.ilcs c board of trustees of community college district coopers lybrand,miller illinois central,cir illinois law.the jury was not asked to decide whether robinson negligence exceeded mcneil,as it should have been asked if,as the plaintiff argues,the tort law of illinois rather than of virginia governs the case.
several states have a connection to the events giving rise to robinson claim and therefore a potential,though for most of the states an attenuated,interest in the application of their law.she had bought the bottle of children motrin in georgia but was living in virginia when she took the drug and her initial medical treatment was administered there,after which she spent a month in the burn unit in a hospital in baltimore where she was diagnosed with ten.she moved with her husband and child to illinois the following year.mcneil is a new jersey corporation headquartered in pennsylvania we do not know where the drug was manufactured or the label composed and affixed to the bottle.
the applicable conflicts rule is of course that of illinois,the forum state,and it uses the common but loose most significant relationship test.barbara sales,intel,townsend sears,roebuck.that test points presumptively to the law of the jurisdiction in which the tort occurred that is,the lex loci delicti.id.and cases cited there.this there is no tort without an injury,rozenfeld medical protective,cir illinois law rice nova biomedical,cir same,and so a tort ca be said to occur until an injury is place where the injury was inflicted.kamelgard macura,cir illinois law townsend sears,roebuck,supra,at esser mcintyre,miller,cir illinois law restatement second of conflict of laws.that was virginia.but because the injury is a continuing one,it is being experienced in illinois.indeed,robinson condition has deteriorated since she moved to illinois and probably will continue to deteriorate therefore,the plaintiff argues,illinois is the real site of the injury.
the lingering or worsening of an injury over a considerable period is common in personal injury cases,rather than an exceptional circumstance that might justify a departure from the ordinary principles of choice of law.if you suffer permanent brain damage in a motorcycle accident in virginia and later move to illinois,your suffering and treatment will continue and your condition may deteriorate.but to make the continuation or exacerbation of an injury a basis for applying illinois tort law to your case would open vistas of forum shopping.severely injured persons would move to the state whose law was most favorable to their tort claim and argue that that state had the most significant relationship to the injury because the plaintiff aggregate suffering and perhaps expense of medical treatment would be greatest there.to avoid this incentive to forum shop,the initial place of the injury is properly deemed the place in which the injury occurred.
this was clearest when lex loci delicti was the rule governing choice of law in tort cases.see restatement first of conflict of laws.under the most significant relationship test,which demoted lex loci delicti to a presumption,a party can argue for applying the law of the state in which the greatest costs of the injury were incurred.but normally the argument should fail because of the encouragement that accepting it would give to forum shopping.see reich pur cell,cal traynor,if the choice of law were made to turn on events happening after the accident,forum shopping would be encouraged but see fisher professional compounding centers of america,d,nevada law.a person who was severely handicapped for life as a result of a tort could choose among states tort laws.concern with forum shopping animates the parallel rule that makes venue proper in the jurisdiction in which the plaintiff claim accrues,which is usually the initial place of the injury.quaid baxter healthcare,green north arundel hospital ass n.
there is,however,a potential ambiguity in the concept of injury.suppose robinson symptoms had first appeared after she left virginia.it is common for a disease to have a latency period,which is to say an interval between the infection or other trauma and when the first symptoms appear,and maybe in such a case the place where they first appear should,by analogy to the discovery rule in statutes of limitations,see,ross,cir wilson sales,be deemed the place of injury.illinois intermediate appellate court so held in abbott laboratories,montgomery wyeth,cir tennessee law,but we have expressed doubt that the supreme court of illinois would agree.pittway lockheed aircraft,cir illinois law.it is true that the latency period of most diseases is too short,even if the victim realizes he has the disease before any symptoms appear,to prompt him to move to the state whose law would be most favorable to his claim.but there are important exceptions,as for asbestosis and des,and in such cases the spur to forum shopping would be great if the law of the state of the first symptoms would govern.in any event the present case is not one of latency robinson had symptoms of ten before she left virginia.
so we think virginia law does govern this case,and dooms her appeal because there was,as we shall see,at least some evidence of contributory negligence.but applying illinois rather than virginia tort law would not change the outcome of the appeal.
exactly what it means to say that a plaintiff contributory negligence did or did not exceed the defendant,a determination required by illinois rule,is unclear.fowler harper,fleming james,oscar gray,harper,james and gray on torts,ed.but davis united states,cir illinois law,suggests that it means that though both parties to the accident,injurer and victim,could have avoided the accident at reasonable otherwise both would not have been negligent and the need to compare their negligence would not of them could have avoided the accident at a lower cost than the other,and he should bear a larger share of the burden of having failed to do so.see also wassell adams,cir also illinois law.robinson appears to have been the party who could have avoided the injury at lower cost,assuming for the moment that her developing ten was caused by the motrin.for the evidence of mcneil negligence in selling children motrin,with or without a prescription and with or without additional warnings,was slight.
ibuprofen is an immensely popular drug for relief of pain and fever.although the plaintiff contends that it unreasonably dangerous,or defective in design,either contention implying if accepted that the drug should be taken off the market,at the oral argument of the appeal her lawyer said we not saying take it off the market we not saying it should be banned.so maybe the plaintiff just wants it sold by prescription only.but this would increase the drug cost because of the prescribing physician fee and the time required by the patient to obtain and fill the prescription and thus reduce its availability.
and how dangerous is ibuprofen,anyway adverse reactions which include both allergic reactions and other side effects to painkilling drugs are common,see franklin adkinson,drug allergy,allergy principles practice,elliott middleton,et,ed fred karch louis lasagna,adverse drug reactions a critical review,jama,roujeau et,supra,at donald stevenson ronald simon,sensitivity to aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,in allergy,supra,at.ibuprofen does not appear to carry a risk of serious allergic reactions or other serious side effects that is greater than is created by drugs that might be substituted for it.compare reactions.html,to reactions,www,and to reactions.html see also daniel soloman,md,mph,nonselective nsaids overview of adverse effects,acpa consumer guide to pain medication treatment,all visited july.there is also no evidence that if the risk from ibuprofen is greater,it is not offset by the drug therapeutic properties.should aspirin be salable by prescription only how about peanuts 
the prevalence of ten from all causes is estimated to be only between and cases per million users of the drug,and what fraction of that slight probability is due to ibuprofen is unknown and may be zero.for while it is true that is primarily and perhaps exclusively caused by allergic reactions to drugs,there is considerable doubt,expressed by the defendant expert witness,maja mockenhaupt,one of the world leading authorities on the disease,that ibuprofen is one of them.there is unquestionably an association between and ibuprofen because headache and fever,which are symptoms of the diseases,are commonly treated with drugs containing ibuprofen.but in such cases the causation runs from to ibuprofen rather than vice versa.when a drug is claimed to cause the very symptoms for which it is a designated treatment,determining the direction of causation is difficult at best.
mockenhaupt was confident that,if there is a causal connection,still one dose could not cause the disease.that statement was important to the defense of contributory negligence because a reasonable jury could not have found robinson negligent in taking the first dose.it was the middle of the night and she had a headache and she was taking just the child dose.furthermore,because headache is one of the earliest symptoms of the disease and robinson had both headache and rash before she took the second dose of motrin,and because,according to mockenhaupt,the disease is usually latent for four days to four weeks after the patient first develops it,the fact that robinson exhibited symptoms within a day of taking the first dose of motrin,and the further fact that she had taken ibuprofen in other forms for years without an allergic reaction,convinced mockenhaupt that robinson had developed ten before she took the first dose.
it might seem that the danger of developing ten from taking ibuprofen if there is such a danger would be reduced if it were a prescription drug.although there do appear to be any factors that predispose a person to have such a reaction to that a doctor might elicit from a patient in deciding whether to write a warning accompanying a prescription drug,because it is addressed to the prescribing doctor,can be more detailed than a warning for an drug,which is read only by the consumer.and indeed the fda requires that the package insert for prescription ibuprofen drugs warn of the risk slight as it even nonexistent that taking such a drug might cause.
but if children motrin were a prescription drug,robinson doctor would have prescribed it for her child because there is nothing to suggest that the child had some condition that might make a prescribing physician worry that the child might develop from taking the drug.if it were prescribed,this would tend to allay rather than heighten any fears that robinson might have about taking the drug herself in fact she had no fears.and anyway the warning about,being directed to the physician and thus written in technical language,would mean nothing to her.a row in the package insert for prescription children motrin which contains the same amount of ibuprofen as the version,headed skin and appendages,states that there is a to percent probability of developing a rash from taking the drug that the incidence of toxic epidermal necrosis ten in persons taking it is unknown but is less than percent and that there may be a causal relation between the drug and the disease.letter from willie pagsuyuin,director,regulatory affairs,mcneil consumer products company,to susan raigrodski,division of,analgesic and ophthalmologic drug products,see also children motrin ingredients.inc sec ingredients visited july.the current insert
