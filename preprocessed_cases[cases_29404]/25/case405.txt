ethicon,ethicon appeals from the patent and trademark office pto patent trial and appeal board the board decision in a merged inter partes reexamination affirming the examiner obviousness rejection of claims and of patent the patent.see boston sci.scimed cordis,wl,decision.because the board did not err in its obviousness conclusion,we affirm.
background 
ethicon owns the patent,which relates to intraluminal medical devices for the local delivery of drugs,stents,and methods for maintaining drugs on those devices.patent ll,ll.angioplasty can be used to alleviate blockages of blood vessels.id.ll.however,expansion of the balloon catheter during angioplasty can result in injury to the smooth muscle cells within the vessel wall,which can lead to restenosis,the gradual of the vessel.id.the patent teaches that stent coatings themselves,and stent coatings delivering drugs locally,may be capable of reducing restenosis.id.ll.the patent teaches that previously s tents with coatings made from polyvinylidenefluoride vdf homopolymers and containing agents or drugs for release have been suggested.id.ll.
claim is representative of the challenged claims and reads as follows 
a device for intraluminal implantation in a vessel comprising a stent and a pharmaceutical coating,said coating comprising a biocompatible polyfluoro copolymer that comprises about weight percent vinylidinefluoride vdf copolymerized with about fifteen weight percent hexafluoropropylene hfp and at least one pharmaceutical agent intermixed with said copolymer,wherein said coating has not been subjected to a maximum temperature greater than sic during the coating process or afterward,thereby providing an adherent coating that remains adhered to the device upon expansion of the stent.
ethicon sued boston scientific scimed boston scientific and abbott laboratories abbott and,collectively with boston scientific,requesters in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on allegations of,inter alia,infringement of the patent.subsequently,in,the requesters each filed separate requests for inter partes reexamination of the patent.the pto merged and granted the requests for inter partes reexamination.
during the reexamination,ethicon cancelled claims and by amendment.the examiner rejected remaining claims and as obvious over,inter alia,patent tuch,patent tu,and patent lo,and relied on a translation of fr.patent le morel to reject certain dependent claims.the examiner found that the evidence submitted by ethicon regarding objective indicia of nonobviousness was insufficient to outweigh the conclusion of obviousness.ethicon appealed to the board,arguing that the examiner erred in combining the prior art references and by discounting the objective indicia.
tuch discloses intravascular stents,including stents,with a coating on the surface that includes a polymer and a drug.tuch ll,ll.tu discloses implantable medical devices such as vascular grafts and heart valve leaflets made from a material.tu ll.tu lists vdf hfp copolymer first in its list of potential elastomers,id.ll,and states that the elastomer may contain drugs,heparin,for release into the surrounding environment,id.ll.lo discloses properties of vdf hfp copolymer at various weight ratios,including.lo,ll.le morel discloses stents with a vdf hfp coating.
the board affirmed the examiner rejection of claims and as obvious.the board began its analysis with tuch and found that tuch teaches that the polymer in the coating may be either biostable or bioabsorbable and lists vdf as an example of a suitable biostable polymer.decision,at.the board also found that tuch teaches that its list of polymers,which includes vinyl halide polymers and copolymers,is not exhaustive and that tuch teachings would not have limited a skilled artisan to the explicitly listed polymers or dissuaded a skilled artisan from selecting a vdf copolymer.id.at.
the board additionally found that tuch discloses a problem with coatings with low elasticity,id.at,and that biocompatibility and elasticity are useful characteristics for the polymer in its stent coatings,id.at.see also id.at.the board found that s ince tuch teaches a problem with cracking when materials having little elasticity are utilized in the polymer layer,one of ordinary skill in the art would have reasonably sought materials with high elasticity to avoid the problem when the stent is expanded.id.at.
the board then analyzed tu and lo in light of tuch teachings.tu states that i t is not desired to have the elastomer permeate the poly tetrafluoroethylene elastomer layer and migrate into the lumen.tu ll.the board found that this statement only relates to a particular embodiment and that tu also teaches that the poly tetrafluoroethylene elastomer layer can be used in medical devices such as heart valve leaflets where the vdf hfp elastomer would be in contact with blood.decision,at.the board additionally found that tu teaches that vdf hfp copolymer possesses the useful properties of biocompatibility and elasticity taught by tuch and that it is also useful for coatings containing a therapeutic substance.id.at.
the board similarly found that lo teaches that vdf hfp is advantageous with respect to flexibility,elasticity,extensibility,tensile strength,and reverse elongation.id.at.the board found that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to use vdf hfp,possessing these advantageous properties,as the polymer in tuch stent because tuch teaches a problem with coatings with low elasticity.id.the board also found that the skilled worker would have reasonably consulted lo to determine the optimal concentrations for each component,even if lo does not teach the use of vdf hfp for medical implants.id.
the board also considered ethicon evidence regarding objective indicia of nonobviousness but found that none of it was entitled to substantial weight.ethicon alleged copying by the requesters and pointed to the alleged commercial success of,unexpected results obtained by,and industry praise for certain stents sold by the requesters to support its argument that the claims would not have been obvious.
the board found that ethicon did not submit factual evidence or analysis to support its copying allegations and thus gave them little weight.decision,at.the board similarly found that the evidence submitted did not establish that the alleged commercial success,industry praise,or unexpected results were due to the claimed vdf hfp coating rather than to an unclaimed feature such as the drug or stent design.id.at.regarding unexpected results,the board also found that ethicon did not establish that the comparisons relied on were to the closest prior art or provide an expert opinion that the results pointed to would have been unexpected.id.at.
the board also concluded that under ksr international teleflex,even if tuch did not disclose a problem with its polymers,one of ordinary skill in the art would have found it obvious to have employed the known polymers of tu and lo for their known and expected properties and that the reason to combine the references could be provided by the normal desire of scientists or artisans to improve upon what is already generally known.decision,at quoting in re peterson,fed.cir.
ethicon timely appealed,and the director of the pto the director intervened pursuant to,filing a brief and participating in oral argument.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.
discussion 
our review of a board decision is limited.in re baxter int l,fed.cir.we review the board legal determinations de novo,in re elsner,fed.cir,but we review the board factual findings underlying those determinations for substantial evidence,in re gartside,fed.cir.a finding is supported by substantial evidence if a reasonable mind might accept the evidence to support the finding.consol.edison of new york nlrb.
obviousness is a question of law,based on underlying factual findings,including what a reference teaches,whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the references,and any relevant objective indicia of nonobviousness.apple samsung elecs,fed.cir.en banc.
the supreme court has cautioned that the obviousness inquiry must guard against slipping into use of hindsight and resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue.graham john deere of.city,internal citations and quotations omitted.the court has also instructed that when a patent claims a structure already known in the prior art that is altered by the mere substitution of one element for another known in the field,the combination must do more than yield a predictable result.ksr,at.similarly,likely bars patentability unless the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions.id.at.
generally,a skilled artisan would only have been motivated to combine analogous art.prior art is analogous where either the art is from the same field of endeavor,regardless of the problem addressed or even if the reference is not within the same field of endeavor,the reference still is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is involved.in re clay,fed.cir.citation omitted.whether a reference is analogous art is a question of fact.id.at.
ethicon argues that the board obviousness rejection impermissibly relies on hindsight and fails to provide any reason why one of ordinary skill in the art would have combined the prior art references to create the claimed invention.specifically,ethicon argues that tuch provides no motivation to select polymers other than those it describes and that neither tuch nor tu provide a motivation to select vdf or vdf hfp as the polymer coating.additionally,ethicon faults the board for not making certain fact findings relating to the motivation to combine references.
the director responds that substantial evidence supports the board factual findings,and the board obviousness conclusion was proper under ksr.the director contends that the claimed invention is merely the simple substitution of a coating vdf hfp known to be useful in in vivo applications,including stents,in a weight ratio known to provide a good balance between strength and elasticity,for the vdf coating disclosed in tuch.the director contends that ethicon arguments are contrary to the teachings of the references and not supported by applicable law.
we agree with the director that substantial evidence supports the board factual findings.ksr directs that an explicit teaching,suggestion,or motivation in the references is not necessary to support a conclusion of obviousness.at.the supreme court has instructed that a court must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions,id.at,and apply an expansive and flexible approach to obviousness,id.at.
here,the board made sufficient factual findings under the circumstances to support its obviousness conclusion and those findings are supported by substantial evidence.tuch teaches that the polymer must be biocompatible.tuch ll.tuch explains that coating overlayers made with materials which have little elasticity can sustain significant cracking during stent deformation and that such cracking can result in more rapid elution of drugs.id.ll.tuch teaches that inclusion of a polymer in intimate contact with a drug on the stent allows the drug to be retained on the stent in a resilient,elastic,matrix during expansion of the stent and also slows the administration of drug following implantation.id.ll.those teachings constitute substantial evidence supporting the board findings that tuch teaches that elasticity and biocompatibility are useful polymer characteristics and that coatings with low elasticity are problematic.
the board relied on tu and lo for teachings regarding an weight ratio of vdf hfp.tu teaches that the elastomer promotes the elasticity and strength of the medical devices,tu ll,and lists vdf hfp first in its list of preferred elastomers,id.at ll.lo similarly teaches vdf hfp copolymers with varying degrees of flexibility,elasticity and extensibility,lo ll,and that a weight ratio of vdf hfp achieves the optimal combination of tensile strength and reversible elongation,id,col ll.these teachings of all of the required components of the claims support the board combination of the three references to address the problem regarding elasticity taught by tuch.
ethicon also challenges certain factual findings made by the board regarding the references.first,ethicon contends that tuch never suggests that the elasticity of the polymer itself is an important characteristic and asserts that it teaches away from using coatings such as vdf hfp by recommending bioabsorbable polymers.second,ethicon asserts that tu is directed to medical devices other than stents and teaches away from allowing an elastomeric polymer such as vdf hfp to be in contact with blood.third,ethicon argues that lo is decades old,nonanalogous art that provides no motivation to combine its teachings with medical devices.ethicon asserts that lo is directed to coatings for harsh,industrial applications,not implantable medical devices.
the director responds that the challenged factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.first,the director contends that ethicon arguments are contrary to the teachings of tuch.second,the director asserts that ethicon ignores the similar properties shared by coatings suitable for the devices disclosed by tu and the patent and ignores embodiments in tu that teach that the blood contacting layer can comprise vdf hfp.third,the director contends that ethicon ignores that lo discloses properties of vdf hfp that would have been relevant to a skilled artisan considering a coating on a stent and that lo age is irrelevant absent a showing of need or the failure of others.
we agree with the director that substantial evidence supports the challenged findings.first,as discussed above,substantial evidence supports the board findings that tuch teaches that elasticity is a useful polymer characteristic and that coatings with low elasticity are problematic.additionally,tuch teaches that its polymer may be either a biostable or bioabsorbable polymer,tuch ll.emphasis added,and lists vdf as an example of a suitable biostable polymer,id.ll.although tuch states that a bioabsorbable polymer is probably more desirable,id.ll,this statement,absent clear discouragement from use,does not compel a finding that tuch teaches away from using vdf hfp as a stent coating.see tyco healthcare grp.lp ethicon,fed.cir.yet simply because the curved blade configurations are not preferred embodiments does not result in the davison patent teaching away from use of a curved blade,absent clear discouragement of that combination.quoting santarus,par,see also in re applied materials,fed.cir.a reference must be considered for everything that it teaches,not simply the described invention or a preferred embodiment.
second,although tu states that i t is not desired to have the elastomer permeate the poly tetrafluoroethylene elastomer layer and migrate into the lumen,tu ll,substantial evidence supports the board finding limiting this statement to a particular embodiment and its finding that tu teaches that the elastomer can be in contact with blood.tu teaches that its invention has a very broad application in biomedical devices,such as heart valve leaflets,id.ll,and an alternative embodiment where the combination of layers provides for better hydrophilicity due to the elastomer in the luminal layer,id.ll.see also id.ll,ll.
third,we can discern no error in the board reliance on lo.the patent states that i t would be advantageous to develop coatings for implantable medical devices that possess physical and mechanical properties effective for use in such devices patent ll.the board relied on lo for teaching the properties of vdf hfp at different ratios of copolymer.decision,at.substantial evidence supports finding that lo teachings are at least reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is involved,in re clay,at,and that a skilled artisan would have combined those teachings with tuch and tu.the normal desire of artisans to improve upon what is already generally known can provide the motivation to optimize variables such as the percentage of a known polymer for use in a known device.see in re peterson,at see also ksr,at a person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity,not an automaton.
furthermore,the age of lo does not undermine the board reliance on it for teaching the ratio of the copolymer components.the mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness of the combination of their teachings,absent evidence that,notwithstanding knowledge of the references,the art tried and failed to solve the problem.in re wright,ccpa citation omitted.ethicon presented no evidence of a need or the failure of others.
finally,ethicon argues that the board erred by discounting its proffered objective indicia of nonobviousness.ethicon asserts that copying,commercial success,industry praise,and unexpected results support the nonobviousness of the patent.
the director responds that ethicon evidence regarding objective indicia is insufficient to overcome the prima facie case of obviousness.the director contends that ethicon arguments have scant support in the record and that the board factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.
we agree with the director that the board properly weighed ethicon evidence of objective indicia.ethicon relied solely on its expert conclusory testimony to support its copying allegations.regarding unexpected results,ethicon expert never even opined that the results pointed to would have been unexpected to a person of ordinary skill in the art.moreover,the board finding that the evidence relied on by ethicon to support its claims of commercial success,industry praise,and unexpected results did not establish that any success,praise or unexpected results were due to the vdf hfp coating,rather than to an unclaimed feature such as the drug or stent design,is supported by substantial evidence.see.we can discern no reversible error in the board findings.
conclusion 
we have considered all of ethicon remaining arguments,but conclude that they are without merit.the board decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not erroneous as a matter of law.for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the board decision.
united states patent the patent is for a vascular stent having a coating of a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene in about weight percent monomer ratio.novelty is not disputed.on this inter partes reexamination requested by boston scientific scimed and abbott laboratories,the ptab held that the prior art rendered obvious the claimed vascular stent.i can not agree,for no reference or combination of references,or common knowledge or common sense,teaches or suggests or motivates the claimed stent.
claim was accepted as representative 
a device for intraluminal implantation in a vessel comprising a stent and a pharmaceutical coating,said coating comprising a biocompatible polyfluoro copolymer that comprises about weight percent vinylidine fluoride vdf copolymerized with about fifteen weight percent hexafluoropropylene hfp and at least one pharmaceutical agent intermixed with said copolymer,wherein said coating has not been subjected to a maximum temperature greater than c during the coating process or afterward,thereby providing an adherent coating that remains adhered to the device upon expansion of the stent.
patent.it was generally agreed that the novelty and advantages are due to the specific copolymer coating material for the stent.
the references cited by the pto board recite thousands of polymer and copolymer components for stent coating materials,but not the copolymer of the patent,although this copolymer was known for other uses.there is no hint,no suggestion,of its use as a coating in a vascular stent,nor were its advantages foreseen.nonetheless the board deemed it obvious and this court agrees.i respectfully dissent.
errors of fact,analysis,and law 
the board relied on three groups of references,and the court has followed this pattern on appellate review.the board first set of references was cited to show that vascular stents were known the second set was consulted to show various polymers used in medical devices and structures unrelated to vascular stents and the third set was cited to show that the patent copolymer was known for unrelated uses such as clothing,boots,helmets,electrical tapes,and linings for tanks and storage vessels.no reference or combination of references teaches or suggests or motivates or otherwise renders obvious the patent vascular stent.
the coated vascular stent references tuch 
the board provided a foundation for its analysis with the first set of references,focusing on the tuch patent,which shows vascular stents.such vascular stents were known,and the patent so states.patent the tuch reference names hundreds of monomers encompassing thousands of polymers and copolymers,and states that they may all be usable for vascular stents in various conditions.however,the specific patent copolymer is not mentioned,and although the list includes one of the patent comonomers,vinylidene fluoride,the other known monomer,hexafluoropropylene,is not mentioned.this silence can not render obvious the omitted copolymer,for nothing in tuch suggests selection of this omitted copolymer from the thousands of polymeric and other potential stent materials listed by tuch 
the polymer may be either a biostable or a bioabsorbable polymer depending on the desired rate of release or the desired degree of polymer stability,but a bioabsorbable polymer is probably more desirable since,unlike a biostable polymer,it will not be present long after implantation to cause any adverse,chronic local response.bioabsorbable polymers that could be used include poly acid,polycaprolactone,poly,poly hydroxybutyrate,poly,polydioxanone,polyorthoester,polyanhydride,poly glycolic acid,poly acid,poly glycolic carbonate,polyphosphoester,polyphosphoester urethane,poly amino acids,cyanoacrylates,poly trimethylene carbonate,poly iminocarbonate,copoly,polyalkylene oxalates,polyphosphazenes and biomolecules such as fibrin,fibrinogen,cellulose,starch,collagen and hyaluronic acid.also,biostable polymers with a relatively low chronic tissue response such as polyurethanes,silicones,and polyesters could be used and other polymers could also be used if they can be dissolved and cured or polymerized on the stent such as polyolefins,polyisobutylene and copolymers acrylic polymers and copolymers,vinyl halide polymers and copolymers,such as polyvinyl chloride polyvinyl ethers,such as polyvinyl methyl ether polyvinylidene halides,such as polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylidene chloride polyacrylonitrile,polyvinyl ketones polyvinyl aromatics,such as polystyrene,polyvinyl esters,such as polyvinyl acetate copolymers of vinyl monomers with each other and olefins,such as methacrylate copolymers,copolymers,abs resins,and acetate copolymers polyamides,such as nylon and polycaprolactam alkyd resins polycarbonates polyoxymethylenes polyimides polyethers epoxy resins polyurethanes rayon cellulose,cellulose acetate,cellulose butyrate cellulose acetate butyrate cellophane cellulose nitrate cellulose propionate cellulose ethers and carboxymethyl cellulose.
tuch,col,ll.
the tuch encyclopedia can not be taken to teach or suggest or motivate that the unmentioned copolymer of the patent should be identified and used in a vascular stent.t he breadth of these choices and the numerous combinations indicate that these disclosures would not have rendered the claimed invention obvious to try.leopharma,rea,fed.cir.nothing in the tuch reference,or any other reference,suggests use of the patent copolymer for vascular stents,even for experimentation 
a n invention would not have been obvious to try when the inventor would have had to try all possibilities in a field unreduced by direction of the prior art.
bayer schering pharma ag barr,fed.cir.
however,the board deemed it irrelevant that the patent copolymer was omitted by tuch,and erroneously found that this copolymer was a prior art element used for its established function.the board stated 
it is unnecessary that tuch disclose any shortcomi
