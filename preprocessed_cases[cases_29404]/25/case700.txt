glaxo wellcome,glaxo appeals the summary judgment finding of non infringement of its patent claims relating to a controlled sustained release formulation of bupropion hydrochloride.glaxo wellcome,impax,d.because glaxo can not prove infringement literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,this court affirms the united states district court for the northern district of california.
glaxo owns patent the patent directed to controlled sustained release tablets containing bupropion hydrochloride.pharmacologically,bupropion is a monocyclic aminoketone antidepressant.see patent issued july,the patent.these compounds treat depression and inebriation.in addition,they facilitate the cessation of smoking by producing neural stimulation in mammalian systems.see patent,ll.patent,ll.patent issued june.due to this action as a stimulant,a spike in bupropion concentrations can have the side effect of causing seizures.patent,ll.
to avoid the need for multiple dosages with the attendant fluctuations in plasma bupropion concentrations,glaxo invented a sustained release formulation of the compound.while bupropion hydrochloride itself was separately patented,glaxo obtained the patent to protect its sustained release formulation of the drug.glaxo markets this patented sustained release formulation as wellbutrin sr for treatment of depression and as zyban for smoking cessation.the key ingredient for achieving sustained release in this invention is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc,which is a partly and o cellulose.in oral preparations,hpmc extends drug release by transforming into a gel that swells upon ingestion.the hydrogel state of hpmc releases bupropion hydrochloride from an ingested tablet over a period of time.
the patent claims a sustained release tablet containing an admixture of bupropion hydrochloride and hpmc.however,many of the claims as originally filed did not recite hpmc as a limitation.during prosecution on the merits in the united states patent and trademark office patent office,the examiner rejected the claims that did not recite hpmc for lack of enablement under.glaxo amended those claims to overcome the rejection.the exemplary independent claims of the patent state 
a controlled release tablet comprising to mg of bupropion hydrochloride and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,the amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose to one part bupropion hydrochloride being to and said tablet having a surface to volume ratio of to cm and said tablet having a shelf life of at least one year at to and to relative humidity,said tablet releasing between about and percent of bupropion hydrochloride in water in hour,between about and percent in hours and not less than about percent less in hours.
a controlled sustained release tablet comprising an admixture of mg of bupropion hydrochloride and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose which after oral administration of a single one of said tablets in adult men produces plasma levels of bupropion as free base ranging between the minimum and maximum levels as shown in over twenty four hours.
a sustained release tablet containing a mixture of a mg of bupropion hydrochloride and b means for releasing between about and of bupropion hydrochloride in one hour,between and in hours and not less than in eight hours in distilled water said means comprising hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.
patent,emphases added.
impax laboratories,impax,a manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals,filed two abbreviated new drug applications andas with the united states food and drug administration fda,one proposing a generic substitute for wellbutrin sr,and the other proposing a generic substitute for zyban.in both andas,impax made a paragraph iv certification that its generic sustained release bupropion hydrochloride tablets do not infringe glaxo patent.the sustained release agent in impax proposed composition is hydroxypropyl cellulose hpc,a compound.glaxo,upon receiving notice of impax anda filings,commenced infringement actions in california,alleging infringement of claims,and of the patent and seeking an injunction to enjoin further infringing actions.
during litigation,impax moved for summary judgment of noninfringement on the basis of prosecution history estoppel.glaxo opposed and filed its own motion for summary judgment.the district judge found that t he amendments indisputably narrowed the patent with respect to sustained release.glaxo,d at.the trial court further noted at the time of the disputed amendments,anyone skilled in the art would have known that hpc and hpmc were substantially equivalent.neither party appears to challenge this equivalency.id.therefore,the district court granted impax motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.
glaxo timely appealed to this court.glaxo argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment because hpc is an infringing equivalent of hpmc.glaxo further contends that it did not surrender hpmc equivalents during prosecution of the claims.this court has exclusive jurisdiction under a.

narrowing amendment 
impax does not literally infringe the patent because hpmc,a recited claim limitation,is not present in its sustained release bupropion formulation.instead,glaxo seeks a judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.therefore,infringement depends on whether the prosecution history of the patent forecloses glaxo reliance on the doctrine of equivalents.specifically this court must examine whether glaxo narrowed claims and of the patent during prosecution,thereby presumptively surrendering the territory that embraces impax sustained release agent.
according to the supreme court in festo,a narrowing amendment made to satisfy any requirement of the patent act may give rise to an estoppel.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d festo viii.such a narrowing amendment,whether made to avoid prior art or to comply with,creates a presumption that the patentee surrendered the territory between the original claims and the amended claims.id.at.the patentee may rebut that presumption by showing that the alleged equivalent could not reasonably have been described at the time the amendment was made,or that the alleged equivalent was tangential to the purpose of the amendment,or that the equivalent was not foreseeable and thus not claimable at the time of the amendment.id.at.this court has recently acknowledged and applied these rebutting criteria.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,festo ix.
glaxo amended claims and of the patent to recite hpmc.glaxo application did not disclose any other sustained release mechanism.therefore,glaxo disclosure of hpmc alone could not support a broad generic claim to other sustained release mechanisms.nonetheless glaxo contends that this amendment did not surrender other hydrogels equivalent to hpmc.rather,glaxo contends that it only added hpmc to the claims to distinguish the sustained release agent in its invention from other disclosed excipients in the application.
the examiner rejected originally filed claims and of the patent for lack of enablement.the application claimed controlled sustained release tablets with particular plasma concentration profiles over hours and specific bupropion release rates.the application,however,did not recite the release mechanism responsible for these profiles.the disclosed rate of release,according to the examiner,distinguished the claimed unique tablet from instant release tablets known in the art.the examiner stated that bupropion rate of release is directly related to the release retarding affect sic of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.thus,the examiner considered the recitation of hpmc critical for the controlled or sustained release aspect of the claims.the examiner also noted that the application disclosure of a single species hpmc does not support claims to a generic concept.
the examiner did not require the recitation of hpmc to distinguish the claims from other disclosed excipients.those excipients had no bearing on the patentability of the claimed sustained release tablets over conventional instant release tablets.rather,the examiner required glaxo to restrict the claims to a particular controlled drug release agent,hpmc.the claims as originally written embraced all controlled sustained release tablets comprising bupropion hydrochloride.the application did not enable any sustained release agents other than hpmc,however,because it only disclosed hpmc time release and plasma profiles.indeed the original claims recited those profiles.the examiner expressly stated that only hpmc enabled claims with these profiles.the application did not enable one of skill in the art to make and use a broader genus of sustained release agents.thus,the examiner enablement argument,which glaxo did not rebut,shows that glaxo surrendered other controlled sustained release agents known to act as equivalents of hpmc.festo,at.a rejection indicates that the patent examiner does not believe the original claim could be patented.while the patentee has the right to appeal,his decision to forgo an appeal and submit an amended claim is taken as a concession that the invention as patented does not reach as far as the original claim.
glaxo also contends that claims were not narrowed upon amendment because the amendment consisted of removing the originally recited shelf life limitation and replacing it with the sustained release hpmc limitation.glaxo,relying on lockheed,states that while the overall scope of these claims was surely narrowed,the hpmc limitation itself was never narrowed by amendment because it was added while a completely unrelated limitation was deleted.see lockheed martin space loral,affirming the district court finding that prosecution history estoppel barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents,vacated by,d,remanded to.
to the contrary,the examiner explained that the original claims broadly embraced a genus of sustained release compounds.because the claims did not enable use of that broader genus,the examiner required an amendment.the sustained release tablet phrase recited in the preamble gives life and meaning to the claims,because sustained release is an essential feature of the invention.generally,a preamble limits the claimed invention if it recites essential structure or steps,or if it is necessary to give life,meaning,and vitality to the claim.catalina mktg.int l.thus,the amendment did not simply replace the shelf life limitation with an entirely new hpmc limitation.rather,the amendment limited the sustained release feature to hpmc,thereby narrowing the claims.the elimination of the shelf life limitation did not affect the question of equivalents and the question of whether the claims embrace sustained release agents beyond hpmc.
rebutting the presumption 
in its festo decision,the supreme court explained that not all narrowing amendments surrender subject matter that the doctrine of equivalents can not later recapture.the court noted 
the equivalent may have been unforeseeable at the time of the application the rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question or there may be some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question.in those cases the patentee can overcome the presumption that prosecution history estoppel bars a finding of equivalence.
festo viii,at.
this court recently gave more guidance on factors influencing a finding of foreseeability 
this criterion presents an objective inquiry,asking whether the alleged equivalent would have been unforeseeable to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the amendment.usually,if the alleged equivalent represents technology,transistors in relation to vacuum tubes,or velcro in relation to fasteners or technology that was not known in the relevant art,then it would not have been foreseeable.in contrast,old technology,while not always foreseeable,would more likely have been foreseeable.indeed,if the alleged equivalent were known in the prior art in the field of the invention,it certainly should have been foreseeable at the time of the amendment.by its very nature,objective unforeseeability depends on underlying factual issues relating to,for example,the state of the art and the understanding of a hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the amendment.therefore,in determining whether an alleged equivalent would have been unforeseeable,a district court may hear expert testimony and consider other extrinsic evidence relating to the relevant factual inquiries.
festo ix,at citation omitted.
in this case,glaxo could not have added hpc as an amendment in without drawing a new matter rejection glaxo had not recited in its application any reference to hpc or other sustained release agents beyond hpmc.glaxo also notes that the supreme court emphasized an applicant ability to claim an alleged equivalent as a hallmark of the unforeseeability excuse the patentee must show that at the time of the amendment one skilled in the art could not reasonably be expected to have drafted a claim that would have literally encompassed the alleged equivalent.festo viii,at.because it could not have added hpc to its claims at the time of amendment without drawing a new matter rejection,glaxo contends that it has on that basis alone sufficiently rebutted the festo presumption and justified its invocation of the doctrine of equivalents.for several reasons,glaxo is incorrect.
in the first place,new matter prohibitions are not directly germane to the doctrine of equivalents or the patentee proof to overcome the festo presumption.the new matter doctrine prevents an applicant from adding new subject matter to the claims unless the specification shows that the inventor had support for the addition at the time of the original filing.see kolmes world fibers.thus,the new matter doctrine ensures the temporal integrity of the amendment process in the patent office and does not apply to nontextual infringement.see turbocare div.of demag delaval turbomachinery.in fact,the quintessential example of an enforceable equivalent,technology,would always be unclaimable new matter.in that sense,the doctrine of equivalents compensates for the patentee inability to claim unforeseeable new matter.
glaxo also removes the supreme court passage in festo viii from its proper context.the supreme court ties foreseeability to whether the applicant would have been expected to know of,and thus properly claim,the proposed equivalent at the time of amendment.the supreme court passage addresses the time of amendment only and does not address the instance where the applicant could not properly claim a known equivalent because it had purposely left that known substitute out of its disclosure at the time of filing.in such an instance,the applicant should have foreseen and included the proposed equivalent in its claims at the time of filing.the supreme court states clearly in festo the patentee,as the author of the claim language,may be expected to draft claims encompassing readily known equivalents.at.the supreme court excuses an applicant from failure to claim a proposed equivalent in the event t he equivalent may have been unforeseeable at the time of application,or,as this court has explained,at the time of the amendment.festo ix,at t he time when the narrowing amendment was made is the relevant time for evaluating unforeseeability,for that is when the patentee presumptively surrendered the subject matter in question and it is at that time that foreseeability is relevant.in any event,read in context,the supreme court in festo neither excuses an applicant from failing to claim readily known equiva
