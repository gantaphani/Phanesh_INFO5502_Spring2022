mitchell kaminski kaminski marilyn coleman coleman and ovimmune,ovimmune collectively,appellants were each convicted under the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,on fifteen misdemeanor counts of introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs without intent to defraud or mislead introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs without intent to defraud or mislead failure to register a drug manufacturing facility without intent to defraud or mislead misbranding drugs while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce without intent to defraud or mislead and adulterating drugs while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce.kaminski and ovimmune appeal their convictions,and coleman and kaminski appeal the district court calculation of their sentences.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate kaminski sentence and remand his case for resentencing,and in all other respects affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
coleman and kaminski were the sole owners and operators of ovimmune,a corporation.kaminski is a medical doctor and surgeon,while coleman has a bachelor of science degree in biology from the university of south carolina and a doctor of philosophy degree in an unspecified subject from auburn university,but is not a medical doctor.coleman and kaminski theorized that chickens immunized against various diseases would produce antibodies to those diseases,that those antibodies would be transmitted to the yolks of the chickens eggs,and that humans could then treat or prevent the diseases by eating the egg yolks.accordingly,they formed ovimmune for the purpose of produc ing antibodies from hyperimmune hens for administration to man and animals to modify or act as biologic response modifiers for the prevention treatment of disease.joint appendix at articles of incorporation at.
on march,coleman requested a ruling from the united states department of agriculture usda regarding whether hyperimmune eggs are approved for human consumption.on march,the usda notified coleman that such eggs are generally recognized as safe gras for human consumption when produced in accordance with relevant regulations and,therefore,may be freely marketed as food products in the united states.at usda letter.
coleman and kaminski then proceeded to acquire a brood of hens,which they inoculated for various diseases,including chlamydia and candida a type of yeast that causes,inter alia,thrush.the eggs from the hens were shipped to a processing plant,where their yolks were pasteurized and reduced to powder.the yolks of the eggs obtained from the hens were collected in coleman basement and shipped to ohio state university osu,where they were.
ovimmune sold the candida powder to retailer for your health,fyh,which was owned by ray suen suen,for resale as a treatment for yeast infections coleman gave away and sold the chlamydia eggs and chlamydia and candida egg powders to individuals for treatment of various diseases and infections,including rheumatoid arthritis and toenail fungus.
on january,the richwood ohio gazette published a article about coleman,titled doctor conducts avian antibody research.at.the article quoted coleman as stating,immunized chickens produce eggs rich in antibodies which can cure mastitis,toenail fungus,rheumatoid arthritis.we also had proven success with patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome,fibromyalgia and similar chronic ailments.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the article reported that coleman and kaminski research was sponsored by the american medical association ama.it continued 
the doctors have been involved in medical research for a number of years.many of their current products can be found on the shelves of health food stores throughout the world.one specific formula,candidatx,is an affordable,very effective formula which controls vaginitis,toenail fungus and candidiasis.
these older successes help underwrite the expense of the new technology,allowing the doctors to serve patients at a more affordable level.
ovimmune is planning clinical trials for lupus,multiple sclerosis and patients suffering from khrone sic disease.according to coleman,at least volunteers will be needed per disease.their treatment will be conducted in cooperation with each person general physician.we be ready as soon as we have the people lined up,she commented.in all their studies,coleman and kaminski work closely with hospitals,universities,medical schools and physicians.
as coleman explained,the treatment is fairly simple.the only medication involved is eating an egg or even a portion of an egg.
another published article titled researcher offers hope to add,asserted that coleman and kaminski had treated a good number of patients suffering from fibromyalgia,chronic fatigue syndrome,crohn disease,lupus and ms and that the hyperimmune egg products were also effective in treating systemic candidiasis,candida vaginitis,toe nail fungus,athlete food,jock itch,as well as behavioral disorders in children such as add attention deficit disorder,adhd attention disorder and in one case,autism.at.the author noted coleman insistence that the products produced are considered food and not a drug.the egg products are approved by the usda and fda as gras generally regarded as safe.id.the article provided details concerning an upcoming meeting at which individuals could volunteer to participate in a clinical trial to determine whether the egg yolks could alleviate the symptoms of add.
during the early part of,coleman also contacted sally wiley wiley,a school nurse who worked for the union county,ohio,schools,and inquired about the possibility of using the district students as subjects in a study to determine the effectiveness of the egg products in treating and other ailments.coleman invited wiley to attend the volunteer meeting.
on march,a teleconference took place among coleman and kaminski,representing ovimmune,and officials of the fda.during that teleconference,the fda officials informed coleman and kaminski that fda authorization was required before ovimmune could conduct clinical trials involving human subjects or administer the egg products to humans for the purpose of treating diseases.coleman and kaminski agreed not to conduct any clinical trials and represented that they had given the eggs only to kaminski family members though they also conceded that they had contracted with fyh for distribution of the candida product and that they had no control over the advertising of that product.
notwithstanding the fda instructions and her own representations during the teleconference,coleman went ahead the very next day with the previously arranged volunteer meeting,at which she passed out egg samples and suggested that participants collect data for her concerning the eggs efficacy.wiley,the school nurse,attended the meeting and took notes.she later provided the fda with those notes and signed a sworn affidavit describing the meeting.
in may,coleman and kaminski submitted an article to the american college of nutrition in which they represented that they had distributed candida eggs free of charge to local residents over a period and collected data that suggested that consumption of the eggs lowered the incidence of toenail fungus.during a june,interview on the show well being with cindy bryant,coleman again described the ovimmune egg products as effective in treating various human ailments,including mastitis,toenail fungus,rheumatoid arthritis,cfs or chronic fatigue syndrome,fibromyalgia,add,adhd and autism as well as vaginitis and candidiasis.at trial tr.at,broadcast recording labels.at trial,the interviewer for the program testified that she knew that medical claims could only be made by a licensed physician and that she had asked coleman questions that she would only have asked of a physician.
on july,coleman sold eight plastic bags of the chlamydia product and one bag of the candida product to an undercover fda case agent,who covertly made an audio recording of the transaction.during that transaction,coleman stated that she possessed one and two degrees and that the egg products that the agent purchased had been tested and proven to be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis and toenail fungus.she also told the agent that the candida powder would cure toenail fungus.
coleman gave the agent a tour of her office,which was located in her home.in her basement research lab,she showed the agent boxes of unrefrigerated eggs.gov t ex.july,tape tr.at.when volunteers began arriving to open the eggs and collect the yolks,the agent agreed to help them.the tape transcript reveals that all of the participants,including coleman,were aware that many of the eggs were rotten and contaminated with mold.coleman twice admitted that i f we were so desperate for eggs,we throw out the whole thing,but we do have any.id.at.upon leaving the coleman residence,the undercover agent stated into the tape recorder 
i ca believe they shelling rotten eggs for the yolks are disintegrated black mold in them.some of them are dried all clumped up it like they almost dehydrated.it absolutely disgusting.to think they that stuff and feeding it to people.i would feed rotten eggs to my chickens,cooked or otherwise.
the agent went on to describe the process by and circumstances under which the egg yolks were collected 
right in that room were i would suggest a dozen pieces of dozen eggs.there were insects,weevils,i saw a centipede,dozens of small spiders,several different varieties of species crawling all over the room.in it she got the final product which she gave me some stuff from the egg for my wife for her toenail fungus which is stuff that she sells commercially to other people.it comes out of the dehydrating plant in zanesville.the other bag is from the stuff we were shucking eggs on tonight.those eggs,you break them open the egg yolks were either already broken or as soon as you jarred them in the least they fractured unless they had started to dehydrate.they looked like they were partially soft cooked even though the yolk and the egg white was fully intact.so i do know,it could have been fungus.a lot of the eggs had black spots from bacteria growing in them and if they were solid or if they did stick to the shell they went in the stuff to go to ohio state to make the stuff for pain with my arthritis and all the other problems.that is the product she was desperate for.
on july,a team led by fda special agent douglas loveland loveland executed a search warrant at coleman home,where they seized egg products.loveland also seized egg products,belonging to coleman,that were stored at osu.the products were subsequently tested and found to contain yeast,mold,and bacteria,including several forms of staphylococcus and at least one bacterium that produced a diarrheal endotoxin.coleman sent a mass message following the raid,telling her friends and customers that the fda had searched her house at gunpoint and intended to do the same to anyone who had purchased her egg products.several of her associates began inquiring into loveland background,seeking his social security number,credit report,and information concerning his military service.
on november,coleman filed a report with the union county sheriff office,alleging that the fda was somehow preventing her and postal mail from reaching her.coleman filed a second report on january,this time claiming that she had received several telephone calls from an anonymous caller who threatened her with bodily harm if she were to file that suit.at,police report attachments.
coleman did in fact file a civil suit in the union county court of common pleas on february,naming wiley the union county school nurse,john doe,and jane doe as defendants.the complaint alleged that wiley had made false statements to loveland about the form that coleman had distributed at the march,volunteer meeting.coleman sought damages in the amount of million.the lawsuit was the subject of a article in the local newspaper.
one week after coleman filed her suit,loveland tried to interview connie davis davis,a participant in the volunteer meeting held by coleman on march.according to loveland,davis was nervous about assisting in the investigation and agreed only to answer very general questions.wiley testified at the sentencing hearing that at least one other person who had attended the meeting had expressed reluctance to speak to authorities for fear of becoming a subject of publicity relating to the lawsuit.
on march,coleman called the fda office of internal affairs oia to complain that loveland had purposely delayed her receipt of the warning letter that would otherwise have informed her in advance of the raid on her home that the search warrant authorizing that raid was comprised of pages of lies that loveland pistol whipped people to get them to tell those lies about coleman in order to harm her personally and professionally and that loveland had refused to return some of the seized items despite a court order commanding him to do so.at,mem.internal quotation marks omitted.the oia advised coleman that she her attorney have recourse through the courts if she feels that the fda is acting inappropriately and decided to take no further action regarding the matter.at,mem.at.
on march,coleman forwarded to the oia a copy of a document purporting to be a motion to hold the fda in contempt of court for refusing to return the seized items.at,letter attachments.coleman letter mentioned that an oia official had discussed the motion with kaminski the previous week.the letter noted that the motion was only a draft and promised to fax you the court stamped copy when it is available.at,letter.it is undisputed that the motion was never filed.
coleman filed a third report with the union county sheriff office on may,this time alleging that loveland had poisoned coleman well with magnesium.eight days later,coleman reported a at her home and a gas leak that she suspected was the result of deliberate tampering.a report completed by detective jeff stiers stiers the following month reflects that the case arising from the alleged well contamination and gas leak was closed due to insufficient evidence of any wrongdoing.
in july and august,coleman customers and associates mounted a campaign directed to tommy thompson thompson,the secretary of the united states department of health and human services,which oversees the fda.the letters were nearly identical in tone and content,each complaining of the fda poor treatment of coleman and warning that such actions were likely to result in scandal and embarrassment for the administration.one individual sent a similar letter to lester crawford crawford,the director of the fda another wrote to united states representative deborah pryce.several of these letters mentioned loveland by name and speculated that he was acting in collusion with coleman competitors or was otherwise corrupt.in september,kaminski sent a similar letter to the oia.
coleman filed yet another police report on september,alleging that someone had broken into her home,removed paper and computer files,and deactivated her computer firewall while she was attending court proceedings.she told the police that the only people that knew she was going to be away from home and at court were her attorney and the federal government.at,narrative supplement.the following week,at coleman request,detective stiers swept her house for electronic listening devices but found nothing.stiers noted that this case,too,was closed for a lack of evidence.
procedural background 
on july,appellants were indicted in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio and charged with conspiracy to introduce into interstate commerce an unapproved and misbranded drug and to defraud one count per defendant mail fraud seven counts per defendant introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs five counts per defendant introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce four counts per defendant failure to register a drug manufacturing facility one count per defendant misbranding drugs while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce three counts per defendant and holding and causing to be held for sale adulterated drugs two counts per defendant.appellants trial began on june,and lasted a month.on july,the jury found each of the appellants guilty on five counts of introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs four counts each of introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce one count each of failure to register a drug manufacturing facility three counts each of misbranding drugs while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and two counts of holding and causing to be held for sale adulterated drugs.
the district court pronounced sentences for coleman and kaminski on april,and issued a supplementary sentencing memorandum as to them on may,the court grouped each of the two individual appellants convictions into a single count for purposes of sentencing,because all of the crimes are strict liability and had the same victim society at large.at sentencing mem.at see also sentencing guidelines b.the court applied the standard to facts regarding enhancements suggested by the probation office,except to the extent that an enhancement was premised upon conduct of which coleman or kaminski was acquitted,which conduct the court required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
the district court found that coleman had abused a position of trust to facilitate the commission of the underlying offenses by portraying herself as a physician in addition to a,rejecting coleman contention that an enhancement of her offense level on this ground was not appropriate because posing as a physician does not by itself mean that she occupied a position of trust,which is defined as a position characterized by professional or managerial discretion,substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.at sentencing mem.at quoting united states mccollister,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that coleman need not actually be a medical doctor to avail herself of the discretion normally afforded one.
similarly,the district court found that kaminski,as a medical doctor,occupied a position of trust.at sentencing mem.at citing mccollister.at a practicing physician enjoys perhaps the highest level of discretion afforded any professional.kaminski abused that position,according to the court,by providing patients several of whom testified at trial with ovimmune egg products for the treatment of ailments.accordingly,the government enhanced coleman and kaminski offense levels by two points each.
the court went on to find,pursuant to of the guidelines,that both coleman and kaminski had obstructed justice.although the primary foundation of its finding was the district court recollection of the facts set forth at trial,the court also enumerated several specific findings.at sentencing mem.at.first,the court found that coleman suit against wiley and complaints and solicitation of the complaints of others concerning loveland constituted attempts to impede the investigation and prosecution of coleman crimes.coleman does not appeal that determination.
the court also found that kaminski had obstructed justice,a finding that kaminski appeals.at the sentencing hearing,the district court initially indicated that it would impose the obstruction enhancement against kaminski on the basis of coleman actions 
based on the testimony,the court review of the documents,but more importantly and most importantly,the court recollection of the testimony and knowledge of the facts adduced at trial,the court finds that under all of these circumstances present in this case that there was an obstruction,including the lawsuit filed against sally wiley,the complaint filed against agent loveland and the reports filed with the union county sheriff office.
with respect to kaminski,the same essentially holds true and the court agrees with the probation officer analysis under and finds that kaminski is equally culpable as far as obstruction is concerned.
at sentencing tr.at.both the prosecution and kaminski defense counsel,however,indicated to the district court that they wished to present additional evidence regarding the proposed obstruction enhancement as it applied to kaminski,and the court accordingly withdrew its finding.at sentencing tr.at.
later in the course of the same hearing,the parties addressed the issue more fully,with counsel for kaminski arguing that the evidence presented at trial established that kaminski had not obstructed justice.in particular,kaminski counsel argued that suen had conceded having knowledge of the negative results of efficacy tests conducted on the egg powders,thus proving that kaminski had testified truthfully in stating that he had told suen agent about the test results.at sentencing tr.at.kaminski attorney went on to argue that kaminski could not be found to have obstructed justice by sending the september,letter to the fda,because loveland had testified that the letter had no impact on the investigation.at sentencing tr.at.the prosecution,however,contended that suen testimony that he himself had known of the results of the efficacy tests was irrelevant to the truthfulness,or lack thereof,of kaminski testimony that he kaminski had informed not suen but suen agent of the test results.at sentencing tr.at.at the conclusion of this argument,the district court imposed the obstruction enhancement upon kaminski on the basis of a finding of perjury the court has heard the evidence at trial.i agree with the probation officer,i agree with the government that kaminski did obstruct justice by providing false testimony.therefore,i am going to overrule kaminski objection.at sentencing tr.at emphasis added.
in its subsequently issued sentencing memorandum,however,the court did not mention the perjury question.instead,after engaging in a lengthy discussion of coleman actions including her defamation suit against wiley,her complaint to the fda concerning loveland activities,and her solicitation of others to investigate and complain to authorities about loveland,the court issued the following finding regarding kaminski alleged obstruction 
this court also finds that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant kaminski obstructed justice.first,on september,defendant kaminski attempted to impede the fda investigation by sending a report to internal affairs,titled oci special agent douglas loveland this addendum reports subsequent,attempted murder and computer crimes.see ex.of government binder.defendant kaminski participated in petitions to the acting commissioner of the fda,the secretary of health and human services,and congresswoman deborah pryce.presentence report psr at.the court finds that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that kaminski actions were performed in a willful attempt to impede the fda investigation by throwing up roadblocks,including leveling malicious personal attacks against sa loveland.accordingly,the actions of both defendants warrant a enhancement for obstruction of justice.
at sentencing mem.at.
after the application of the various enhancements,both coleman and kaminski fell into criminal history category i,and each had a total offense level of,giving rise to an advisory guidelines range of six to twelve months imprisonment.after noting that the guidelines dictate a sentence of imprisonment or of probation with conditions of intermittent or community confinement or home probation,the court imposed a sentence of five years probation,substituting imprisonment with six months of community confinement and six months of home detention for both coleman and kaminski.at sentencing mem.at quoting c.
in explaining its choice of sentence,the court stated as follows 
the court finds that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of defendants are such that five years of probation,with special conditions of community confinement and home detention,are appropriate.it appears to the court that profit was exhorted over science and that ovimmune products were distributed to the public without proper regard for any ensuing negative health effects.it is compelling to the court that notwithstanding the march,conference call with the food and drug administration,during which fda representatives told coleman and kaminski that they needed an investigational new drug application ind in effect before beginning human testing,defendant coleman,the very next day,held a meeting in a local church and gave away ovimmune products.indeed,the evidence showed that defendants consistently circulated this product,touting it as a talisman for whatever ails one.yet,while defendants may have believed in their products effectiveness as an immune booster and healer,evidence at trial,including corroborating photographs,demonstrated that the conditions in which at least some of the eggs were kept were unsanitary.the evidence included such details as rotten,moldy eggs a dead cat stored less than three feet from raw eggs live cats running around the basement egg residue on surfaces raw eggs remaining unrefrigerated for long periods and raw eggs covered with blood and manure.this sentence balances the nature and circumstances of the offense with the defendants lack of any prior criminal history.moreover,it allows defendants,who are and very connected to their communities and families,to maintain these bonds throughout the period of confinement.
at sentencing mem.at.the district court further stated that the confinement component of the sentences reflects the seriousness of the offenses and accomplishes the goals associated with both specific and general deterrence.at sentencing mem.at.
pursuant to b,the district court imposed restitution as a condition of both defendants probation.although defendants strict liability offenses victimized society at large,the court found that restitution to purchasers of ovimmune products would compensate for any harm wrought on the consuming public.at sentencing mem.at.at the sentencing hearing,counsel for coleman argued that the maximum amount of restitution that could be awarded assuming,arguendo,that restitution was permissible at all was,the sum total of all retail sales made by the defendants except for sales to retail distributors and sales to suen and fyh.in the sentencing memorandum,however,the court ordered restitution in the amount of,the total retail sales less sales to suen but including sales to other retailers.
ovimmune and kaminski now appeal their convictions.coleman and kaminski appeal their sentences.

the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over this federal criminal prosecution pursuant to.we possess appellate jurisdiction pursuant to and.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a district court legal conclusions regarding the sentencing guidelines de novo and a district court factual findings in applying the sentencing guidelines for clear error.united states galvan,cir quoting united states galloway,cir.we apply de novo review to the district court interpretation of the guidelines.id.
appellant coleman 
the enhancement 
the guidelines provide for a upward adjustment,or enhancement,of the offense level of a defendant who has abused a position of trust.coleman claims that the district court erred in applying this enhancement to her sentence,because she was convicted only of offenses,none of which required proof of mens rea.she argues that the erroneous enhancement,in turn,resulted in the district court improperly calculating the applicable guidelines range.even though the supreme court declared the guidelines advisory in united states booker,d,we are still required to remand for resentencing if the district court misapplies the guidelines.united states davist,cir.
in the psr that it submitted in advance of coleman sentencing,the probation office recommended the enhancement on the ground that coleman falsely portrayed herself as a medical doctor in order to promote the egg products as medical cures.at coleman psr at.in response,coleman filed a sentencing memorandum in which she argued,inter alia,that the fact that she posed as a physician did not mean that she occupied a position of trust the victims.at coleman sentencing mem.ii at.her memorandum asserts that the jury,in acquitting coleman of the fraud charge,implicitly found that she had not abused a position of trust.id.coleman argued that the nature of the offense of which she was convicted precluded the application of the enhancement.id.
while coleman counsel did once state,during the sentencing hearing,that coleman did not occupy a position of trust that statement was supported by no argument and was not the thrust of coleman objection.the true gravamen of coleman challenge to the enhancement,as set forth in her sentencing brief in the district court,was that the only issue determined at the egg powder is a drug under federal not support an application of the enhancement,particularly in light of the fact that the jury acquitted coleman of fraud.at coleman sentencing mem.ii at.
in its sentencing memorandum,the district court rejected coleman argument,ruling that coleman had,by holding herself out as a physician,assumed a position of trust that significantly facilitated her offense.at sentencing mem.at.the district court noted specifically that coleman made the false representations in the course of convincing the undercover agent to purchase the chlamydia and candida products.at sentencing mem.at.the district court expressly stated that coleman belief in the efficacy of her product,her innocence of fraud did not alter that finding.id.
on appeal,coleman reiterates her contention that the enhancement is inapplicable to crimes.she points out that,according to the commentary to the guidelines,f or this enhancement to apply,the position of public or private trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense,by making the detection of the offense or the defendant responsibility for the offense more difficult.cmt.the note provides the following illustrations 
this adjustment,for example,applies in the case of an embezzlement of a client funds by an attorney serving as a guardian,a bank executive fraudulent loan scheme,or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a physician under the guise of an examination.this adjustment does not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions are not characterized by the factors.
id.coleman relies on the fact that all of the enumerated examples are crimes requiring proof of mens rea.
neither party has submitted,and we have been unable to find,any decision by any federal court precisely on point.perhaps the most analogous case is the ninth circuit unpublished opinion in united states merz,wl cir unpublished.in merz,the defendant did not argue at sentencing whether he occupied a position of trust.he argued instead that he lacked the mens rea to abuse the position of trust that he enjoyed.id.at.the ninth circuit affirmed the district court application of the enhancement,holding that the record shows that merz abused a position of trust.he created a business and placed himself into a position of trust that provided him the freedom to commit a wrong.id.internal quotation marks omitted.merz business was that of a car courier to whom clients entrusted money with which he was to procure cars for them.and while merz,unlike coleman,was convicted of fraud,the ninth circuit rationale for applying the enhancement was not the nature of the crime but,rather,the nature of the relationship between the defendant and his victims,with the guidelines facilitated the offense.
indeed,the cases cited by coleman herself support the application of the enhancement,as they indicate that it is appropriately imposed where the conduct on which the enhancement is based rather than the underlying offense conduct is of a similar character as the examples given in the application notes.see united states peters,cir application note to lists examples of conduct that may constitute obstruction of justice.each example represents conduct substantially more egregious than that of peters.united states strachan,cir.although these examples are not exhaustive,they do provide insight into the nature of the activity by the defendant contemplated by.in reviewing them we find these illustrations to involve conduct actually much more egregious in character than that engaged in by the defendant,cert.denied,d.
in this case,coleman assumed the mantle of trust accorded to a medical there is no question that she did so affirmatively misrepresenting her professional credentials.moreover,the evidence indicates that she did so in connection with her marketing and sale of the egg powders,as the misrepresentations were invariably made to consumers of the powders or during interviews about the products.this conduct is similar in nature to the examples in the application notes misconduct by an attorney,a bank executive,or a physician while serving in the role of a trusted fiduciary.in short,coleman violated the law,and she assumed a position of trust in relation to her victims while doing so.this behavior was not substantially less egregious than that contemplated by the enhancement provision.
coleman next argues that her assumption of a position of trust did not significantly facilitate her crime.in support of this contention,she asserts that her action in claiming to be a medical doctor was irrelevant to the only issue that the jury decided in convicting,whether or not the egg powders were drugs.while the proper characterization of the powders was the only undecided issue,however,it is not the only element of the offense coleman was convicted,inter alia,of introducing unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs into interstate commerce,and holding and causing to be held for sale adulterated drugs.these marketing and selling of the egg,in turn,significantly facilitated by the consumers belief that coleman was a physician.
indeed,coleman desire to persuade others to consume her products was obviously the very reason that she made the misrepresentations,the efficacy of which was shown at the sentencing hearing via the testimony of rebecca keller keller,which demonstrated conclusively that consumers of the powder consulted coleman for medical advice.after becoming ill upon taking the egg powder,keller called coleman for instructions,which coleman gave and keller followed.at sentencing tr.at.
as we held in united states gilliam,a position of trust arises almost as if by implication when a person or organization intentionally makes himself or itself vulnerable to someone in a particular position,ceding to the other presumed better judgment some control over their affairs,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.we stated,in gilliam,that the guidelines examples of situations in which the enhancement is properly applied translate directly to the types of relationships where a fiduciary duty exists by implication.id.coleman created such relationships when she held herself out to be a medical doctor in connection with her offering of the egg powders as treatments for disease,and her customers relied on those relationships in consuming the powders.
coleman final argument on this point is that an enhancement under these circumstances is inconsistent with the rule that a court,when imposing a sentence for a crime,may not depart downward from the guidelines range on the ground that the defendant lacked mens rea.the cases that she cites for this proposition,however,all involve departures,which a district court may utilize to impose a sentence upon a defendant who inflicted less harm on his or her victims than that sought to be prevented by the statute.each of these immigration cases did involve the offense of illegal reentry after deportation,but our sister circuits held departures impermissible not due to the nature of the crimes but,rather,because the defendants had not actually perpetrated less harm than that contemplated by the statute prohibiting such reentry because the statute prohibited illegal reentry,the motives of the defendants for their illegal reentry were irrelevant.see united states,cir,vacated remanded,d united states,cir united states dyck,cir united states carrasco,cir.
in this case,the district court imposed the enhancement not because coleman had committed a more egregious harm than that sought to be prevented by the statute but,instead,because the offenses that she did commit were facilitated by the trust that she enjoyed as a putative doctor.see.in other words,the victims of coleman crime were individuals who were rendered particularly vulnerable by the trust that they reposed in coleman.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not err in finding that coleman occupied a position of trust and concluding that her abuse of that position significantly facilitated the commission of the offense.
restitution 
when the law authorizes a restitution order,we review the amount ordered under the abuse of discretion standard.united states comer,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.the district court ordered restitution pursuant to b,which provides a sentencing court with discretion to order restitution to victims as a condition of probation.coleman concedes that the district court possessed such discretion under b,but contends on appeal that the court erroneously failed,in calculating the amount of the restitution award,to account for the benefits received by retailers and consumers of the egg products.
coleman did not,however,make this argument before the trial court.rather,she contended in her sentencing memorandum and at the sentencing hearing that the distributors and individual recipients of the egg products were not properly characterized as victims,because all had indicated satisfaction with the products and requested more.coleman did not,in other words,dispute the amount of restitution awarded or argue that that amount should be calculated with reference to benefits gained by the victims.instead,she focused on the identities of the victims,as determined by ascertaining whether any of the recipients had suffered a financial loss because her contention that the district court improperly calculated the amount of restitution owed to each victim is raised for the first time on appeal,we decline to consider that argument.see,pinney dock transp.penn cent,cir,cert.denied,d 
coleman also contends that the district court erred in finding that society at large was the victim of her crimes.the statute defines a victim,for the purposes of restitution,as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered a in arguing that society suffered no direct and proximate harm,coleman again reiterates her contention that recipients of her products experienced benefits.
we rejected a similar argument in united states universal management services,cir,cert.denied,d.in universal,the defendants appealed the district court award of restitution on the ground that the fda charge against them was based only upon their failure to secure approval of their product and not upon any allegation that it was ineffective,and thus no detriment to consumers had been shown.id.at.we held,however,that restitution to consumers of the product was an appropriate remedy for the harm to the general public,because the purpose of the approval requirement is to protect consumers health and their pocketbooks.id.emphasis added.consumers purchase such products upon the mistaken assumption that the products are produced in compliance with federal regulations the economic harm to consumers contemplated by the fdca is,thus,that consumers who are deceived in this manner do not get what they pay for.id 
here,as in universal,appellants sold unapproved drugs to members of the public even after being notified that fda approval was required.in so doing,they inflicted economic harm on the consumers of their products.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering restitution.
appellant kaminski 
a.the fda compliance with its own rule 
kaminski contends that his prosecution was impermissible due to the fda failure to abide by its own final rule providing manufacturers of dietary supplements an grace period within which to comply with new labeling requirements and to provide kaminski with notice and an opportunity to correct his alleged violation.as the united sta
