plaintiff glaxosmithkline llc gsk sued banner pharmacaps,impax laboratories,roxane laboratories,mylan inc,mylan pharmaceuticals,and watson laboratories,collectively,defendants.invoking e,gsk alleged that drug products containing the molecule dutasteride that defendants propose to market fall within claims of patent,which covers dutasteride and its pharmaceutically acceptable solvates.all defendants stipulated to infringement,which is no longer an issue,but alleged that the asserted claims were invalid for anticipation,lack of utility,lack of enablement,and inadequacy of the written description.after a bench trial,the district court issued an opinion concluding that defendants did not prove the asserted claims invalid.glaxosmithkline llc banner pharmacaps,cv,wl.
defendants appeal the rejection of their writtendescription challenge.their appeal presents only one contention that solvate is not adequately described,whether construed as defendants urge or as the district court construed it.we affirm,without resolving the dispute.
background 
this case involves claims to the chemical compound dutasteride and its pharmaceutically acceptable solvates.claim of the patent,the only independent claim,reads,n bis trifluor omethyl phenylcarbamoyl aza androst en one or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof.patent,lines.the parties agree that dutasteride is the molecule identified before or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof.the other asserted claims all recite a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the compound of claim,subject to further restrictions having no effect on the issue presented here.see id.at,lines dependent claims through.
dutasteride is useful in the treatment of androgen responsive diseases.patent,lines.androgens are a class of hormones with testosterone the major circulating androgen implicated in a number of diseases,including benign prostatic hyperplasia,prostate cancer,acne,male pattern baldness and hirsutism.id.at,lines.in some target tissues,including prostate and skin tissue,testosterone produces certain effects by first being converted to dihydrotestosterone.see id.at,lines.dutasteride inhibits the enzymes that catalyze the conversion and thus mitigates some of testosterone physiological effects,which is sometimes medically desirable.see id.
the asserted claims cover not only dutasteride,but also any pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof.a solvate,by definition,is something that originates in a solution,which is a mixture of two substances a solute dissolved in a solvent.salt water is a solution,in which salt is the solute and water the solvent.a solvate is a molecule a consisting of a complex made up of solute molecules and solvent molecules b resulting from the solution.the parties agree on that much,and also on the proposition that,at least frequently,a solvate complex is crystalline,a purely structural description referring to the regular,periodic arrangement of the constituent molecules or atoms.the parties disagree about whether solvate in the context of this patent means only such crystalline complexes a dispute we need not resolve.
dutasteride has been proven effective in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia,otherwise known as enlargement of the prostate gland.gsk markets avodart and,which contain dutasteride and are approved by the food and drug administration to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.each defendant filed at least one abbreviated new drug application under j,seeking fda approval to market a generic version of avodart or.each anda included a certification under j a that the patent is invalid,is unenforceable,or would not be infringed by marketing of the proposed generic product.as authorized by e,gsk responded by suing defendants for infringement of its patent.
the district court construed pharmaceutically acceptable to mean s uitable for use when administered to the recipient thereof as a pharmaceutical.claim construction opinion at,glaxosmithkline llc,cv.the court also construed solvate of dutasteride,which is the claim term at issue here.gsk and defendants disagreed about whether the term refers only to crystalline complexes of solute and solvent molecules that is,of dutasteride the solute and some solvent or,instead,also includes complexes.gsk argued for the broader construction,defendants for the narrower.the district court acknowledged defendants considerable extrinsic evidence that,in the pharmaceutical field,solvate is limited to crystalline complexes,no matter how created,but it concluded that the specification of this particular patent direct ly contradict s any such narrow usage.see id.at relying on patent,line,through,line.the court construed a solvate of dutasteride to mean 
a complex formed by dutasteride with a solvent in which dutasteride is reacted or from which it is precipitated or crystallized.
id.at.despite potential confusion about the meaning of this language,including about what it refers to,the parties agree in interpreting the district court construction to refer to three processes of forming dutasteride solvates by a reaction of dutasteride with a solvent by precipitation of a complex from a solution of dutasteride and a solvent by crystallization of a complex from a solution of dutasteride and a solvent with the resulting complex not required to be crystalline.
defendants stipulated to infringement and have not raised any infringement issue on appeal not even conditionally,should we reverse the district court claim construction in deciding the issue they do raise on appeal.the only issue before us is defendants invalidity challenge asserting the inadequacy of the written description,a challenge that the district court rejected along with invalidity challenges asserting anticipation,lack of utility,and lack of an enabling disclosure after a threeday bench trial held after the stipulation of infringement.defendants did not dispute that dutasteride is adequately described it is precisely identified by structure.instead,they argued that solvates of dutasteride,a limitation in all asserted claims,lacked adequate support in the written description.specifically,defendants argued that the written description failed to describe the crystalline form of solvate or,more generally,a wide enough range of the solvates included in the district court construction,which need not be crystalline and could be produced through reaction,precipitation,or crystallization.
addressing the adequacy of the written description,the district court made various findings,some focused on solvate formation and some on determining which solvates were therapeutically effective.see glaxosmithkline llc banner pharmacaps,cv,wl,at,findings of fact.it found that dutasteride is the key structural feature of the solvate and what distinguish es the p atent from the prior art.id.at.it found that solvate formation has been known in the art for over years,that dutasteride is a steroid,that s teroids in particular have been known to be prone to solvate formation since,and that the universe of solvents thought to be pharmaceutically acceptable was wellknown and relatively small.id.at.the court noted that it was difficult or even impossible to predict whether a particular solvate form will offer bioavailability,at least prior to the solvate actual formation,but found that methods to determine the solubility of an already formed solvate were and routine in the art and could be done in less than a week.id.at emphasis added.
the district court concluded that defendants failed to prove the inadequacy of the written description.according to the district court,t here is no reason why a person skilled in the art would not credit a patentee with possession of a solvate merely because the patentee did not disclose solvates formed by each solvation process,reaction,precipitation,crystallization.id.at.the district court characterized example which describes dissolving dutasteride in liquid propylene glycol,see patent,lines as identifying a reacted solvate.id.at.the court found the example,in addition to what was known in the art,sufficient to meet the written description requirement.id.
