to encourage the marketing of generic drugs,the amendments to the food,drug,and cosmetic act grant companies that successfully challenge drug patents the right to sell their generic drugs without competition for days.in this case,two companies,each seeking to market a generic drug,competed for the right to exclusivity.the food and drug administration ruled that neither company could earn exclusivity by challenging the first of two patents,but it awarded exclusivity to one of the companies based on that company challenge to the second patent.the district court rejected challenges to these two decisions,and the company denied exclusivity now appeals.finding no error in the district court two thorough and opinions,we affirm in all respects.
the food,drug,and cosmetic act,fdca,provides that a company wishing to market a new drug must submit a new drug application,known as an nda,to the food and drug administration.see id.b supp.iii.usually quite lengthy,ndas must include,among other things,evidence of the drugs safety and effectiveness,as well as information about patents that cover or might cover the drugs.id.
in,congress passed the amendments to the fdca.see the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of titles,and.enacted to expedite the process by which companies gain approval to sell generic versions of drugs,the amendments allow companies seeking such approval to submit abbreviated new drug applications,known as andas,that piggyback on the information that the manufacturers submitted in their ndas.see j a a.the result is to make practical the manufacture of generic copies which theretofore had been uneconomical.mead johnson pharm.group bowen.
like ndas,andas must address patents that cover or might cover the relevant drugs.for each patent,companies can satisfy this requirement by including in their andas one of several certifications that explain why the fda should approve the application despite the patent claim on the drug.j a vii.the certification at issue in this paragraph iv certification,named for the subsection of the law that describes that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug.id.j a vii iv.in essence,applicants use paragraph iv certifications to challenge the validity of manufacturers patents.
an applicant that includes one or more paragraph iv certifications in its anda must inform both the patent holder and the company that submitted the nda on which the anda piggybacks.id.j b i.once an applicant gives notice,the fda must wait days before approving the anda,thereby giving the patent holder that much time to file a suit.id.j b iii f.if the patent holder sues,the fda must wait thirty months from the notice date before approving the anda unless the applicant wins the suit sooner or the court hearing the suit shortens the period.j b iii.
in order to encourage paragraph iv challenges,thereby increasing the availability of generic drugs,the fdca provides that the first company to win fda approval of an anda containing a paragraph iv certification has the right to sell its drug without competition for days.id.j b iv.the statute and the implementing regulation create this exclusivity period by prohibiting the fda from approving any other anda that contains a paragraph iv challenge to the same patent until days after the first company markets its drug or days after the first company wins a suit involving that patent,whichever comes first.c.
paragraph iv certifications are not the only way for anda applicants to satisfy their obligation to address all relevant patents.applicants can instead submit one or more section viii statements,named,again,after the relevant fdca j a viii.a section viii statement indicates that a patent poses no bar to approval of an anda because the applicant seeks to market the drug for a use other than the one encompassed by the patent.see j a viii.for example,if a manufacturer patent covers a drug use for treating depression,and the anda applicant seeks approval to use the drug to treat any other condition,then a section viii statement would be appropriate.thus,whereas applicants use paragraph iv certifications to challenge the validity of admittedly applicable patents,they use section viii statements to assert that patents do not apply.the fda has long required that for every patent anda applicants use either a paragraph iv certification or a section viii may not use both.as the fda puts it,either the applicant is seeking approval for the use claimed in the patent,or it is not.torpharm,thompson,d,quoting the record in that case internal quotation marks omitted.
paragraph iv certifications and section viii statements have quite different consequences.applicants submitting section viii statements have no obligation to provide notice,nor must they wait thirty months for fda approval.as the district court explained,the fda may thus approve a section viii application immediately,making it an attractive route for generic manufacturers,even though a section viii statement does not entitle a successful applicant to the period of exclusivity bestowed on paragraph iv applicants.purepac pharm.thompson,d.
in order to determine what patents cover existing drugs and hence whether any paragraph iv certifications or section viii statements are needed,applicants look in the orange book,an fda publication that includes all patent information that companies have submitted to the agency.patents which cover specific uses for be included in the orange book only if they cover drug uses that the fda has approved.b.in other words,companies can not use the orange book to claim protection for uses that the fda has not approved.the fda,however,does not evaluate patent information that companies submit to it it just passively publishes information it receives.this means that if one company submits patent information that a second company believes is false or violates the fda regulation prohibiting the listing of patents,the second having the fda verify the information accuracy with the first go to court to resolve the dispute.meanwhile,the second company must,if it submits an anda,treat the disputed patent as valid.in other words,it must include in its anda either a paragraph iv certification or a section viii statement.
this case involves gabapentin,a drug sold by pfizer,that the fda has approved for treating epilepsy.in,appellee purepac pharmaceutical company submitted an anda seeking permission to sell a generic version of pfizer drug,neurontin.purepac anda listed three patents that company,which later assigned pfizer the rights to the drug,had included in its gabapentin nda.one of the only one relevant to this the patent,a patent.seeking to sell its drug as a treatment for epilepsy,purepac submitted a section viii statement about this patent because as it read the orange book,the patent covered gabapentin unapproved use for treating neurodegenerative diseases.that is,purepac asserted that the patent posed no bar to fda approval of its anda because the patent covered a use other than the one for which purepac sought permission.given that under fda regulations,only patents may be listed in the orange book,purepac interpretation of the patent would,if true,have meant that the patent inclusion in the orange book was improper.
about a month after purepac submitted its anda,appellant torpharm,filed its own anda,similarly seeking permission to market a generic version of neurontin.unlike purepac,torpharm submitted both a paragraph iv certification and a section viii statement regarding the patent.by doing so,torpharm effectively hedged its bets on whether the information that had submitted to the fda showed that the patent covered gabapentin use for treating epilepsy or for treating neurodegenerative diseases.torpharm notice to,however,indicated that torpharm agreed with purepac interpretation of what use the patent covered the notice stated that torpharm generic drug posed no danger of infringement because a ll of the claims of the patent are directed to a method of using gabapentin and its derivatives in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.apotex,c,wl,at,quoting the record in that case internal quotation marks omitted.
the fda initially informed purepac that because claimed that the patent covered gabapentin use for treating epilepsy,purepac should have filed a paragraph iv certification.purepac protested that this represented a reversal by the fda,pointing out that when the agency first listed the patent in the orange book,the concomitant use code the code the fda assigns to identify the use that a patent the title treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.by contrast,the use code that the fda gave to another of the patents that warnerlambert had mentioned in its nda was entitled epilepsy.since the fda acknowledges that in assigning use codes it relies exclusively on the nda holder statements regarding a patent coverage,purepac,d at,purepac argued that the fda choice of use code indicated that the agency had previously decided that according to,the patent covered gabapentin use for treating neurodegenerative diseases rather than epilepsy.according to purepac,it therefore needed to file a section viii statement.
unconvinced,the fda informed purepac that the company would have to add a paragraph iv certification before its anda could be approved.purepac did not follow this instruction.instead,perhaps recognizing that complying with the fda demand would mean that torpharm would receive the exclusivity as the first company to submit an approvable anda containing all necessary paragraph iv certifications,purepac sued the fda in the united states district court for the district of columbia,arguing that the fda rejection of its section viii statement and the agency insistence that the company submit a paragraph iv certification were arbitrary and capricious.
the district court,through judge huvelle,ruled for purepac,holding that the fda should have concluded on the basis of the evidence before it that the patent covered gabapentin use for treating neurodegenerative diseases.because purepac sought approval for a different use,the district court directed the fda to accept the company section viii statement.see purepac,d at.the court ruling did not entitle purepac to exclusivity,however,as only paragraph iv certifications can earn exclusivity.it simply required the fda to accept purepac anda as of the date the company originally submitted it,which occurred before torpharm filed its anda.that was important because both purepac and torpharm andas contained paragraph iv challenges to other patents,and whichever company first submitted its anda would be eligible for exclusivity based on those other challenges.
although the district court required the fda to accept purepac section viii statement,it declined to decide what the agency should do about torpharm paragraph iv certification.noting that the fda had long insisted that paragraph iv certifications and section viii statements were mutually exclusive,the court observed that the agency has not taken a definitive position as to whether equitable considerations might ultimately persuade it to approve torpharm application with a paragraph iv certification to the patent even if the court were to direct the agency to accept purepac application with a section viii statement.id.at.this question was critical,for if the fda allowed torpharm to submit a paragraph iv certification,then torpharm would be entitled to exclusivity as the first applicant to win fda approval for an anda containing a paragraph iv challenge to the patent.the district court decided to allow the fda to address that issue on remand.the fda did not appeal.
on remand,the fda stood by its position that paragraph iv certifications and section viii statements are mutually exclusive,ruling torpharm paragraph iv certification as to the patent improper.at approximately the same time,the fda asked pfizer to consent to the removal of the patent from the orange book,pointing out that the patent claimed protection for a use that the agency had yet to approve.when pfizer consented,the fda removed the patent from the orange book.as a consequence,neither torpharm nor any other company that had submitted a application had any obligation to address the patent in its anda.in fact,the fda instructed all applicants to amend their andas by removing any section viii statements or paragraph iv certifications about the patent.this meant that no company would enjoy the exclusivity period based on the patent because no company could submit a proper paragraph iv certification regarding it.
torpharm then sued the fda,challenging the removal of the patent from the orange book and the agency refusal to accept the company paragraph iv certification.again speaking through judge huvelle,the district court rejected torpharm claim,concluding that the fda acted reasonably in not departing from its rule that a section viii statement and paragraph iv certification can not be filed as to the same patent,and that the agency corresponding conclusion that no applicant was entitled to exclusivity on the patent must be upheld.torpharm,d at.
in its decision,the district court also addressed the fda ruling about the other patent at issue in this case,the patent.whereas the patent is a patent,the patent is a patent,covering the drug overall composition and formulation.first submitted information about the patent to the fda after torpharm and purepac filed their andas,at which point both companies amended their andas by adding paragraph iv challenges to the patent.although the fdca requires applicants to provide notice when they file their amended andas,j b iii,and although the implementing regulation requires notice at the same time as filing,d,purepac did not send notice to about its paragraph iv certification until june,some weeks after the fda received,and deemed filed,purepac amended anda on may.torpharm also sent its notice to on june,the same day it mailed its amended anda to the fda.the fda,however,deemed torpharm anda to have been filed on june,the day it received the anda.this meant that purepac,despite the lag between its filing with the fda on may and its notice to on june,completed both tasks first.the fda thus awarded the exclusivity period to purepac.
in the district court,torpharm argued that the fda award of exclusivity to purepac effectively eliminated the statutory and regulatory requirements of simultaneous notice.the district court disagreed,concluding that neither the statute nor the regulation specify the penalty for failing to notify immediately and ruling that the fda had reasonably filled that gap by stating that if a company waits to provide notice,it runs the risk that another company will both file and provide notice first,thereby winning exclusivity.torpharm,d at.the district court also rejected torpharm challenge to the fda decision to use a rule rather than a mailbox rule,seeing nothing arbitrary or capricious in the agency choice.see id.at.
appealing both district court decisions,torpharm argues that the court erred by reversing the fda determination about the claimed scope of the patent purepac,upholding the fda decision to delist the patent and deny exclusivity based on that patent torpharm,and sustaining the fda award of exclusivity to purepac based on purepac challenge to the patent also torpharm.because the district court entered a summary judgment,we review its decision de novo and therefore,in effect,review directly the decision of the agency.lozowski mineta.we will set aside an fda decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.fda interpretations of the fdca receive deference,serono,shalala,as do its interpretations of its own regulations,id.at.
we start our analysis with the district court purepac decision.in that case the court had to answer the following question according to the information that submitted to the fda,what use of gabapentin did the patent cover in other words,setting aside the question of what use the patent actually question the fda leaves to the use did say the patent covered as noted,the fda told purepac that according to the patent covered gabapentin use for treating epilepsy.this meant that purepac,like torpharm,had to include a paragraph iv challenge to the patent in its anda.it also meant that torpharm,as the first to have submitted a paragraph iv challenge to the patent,would be eligible to earn exclusivity.
we agree with the district court that the fda conclusion about the claimed coverage of the patent was arbitrary and capricious.in the orange book,the fda assigned the patent a use code corresponding to neurodegenerative diseases.having thus concluded that asserted that the patent covered gabapentin use for treating such diseases,the fda,when evaluating purepac and torpharm andas,could not change course and decide that claimed that the patent covered the drug use for treating epilepsy.yet in rejecting purepac section viii statement,the fda did just that.because this unexplained reversal represents the height of arbitrary and capricious decision making,the district court rightly disallowed it.as we have said,w hile the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency,neither may a court sanction agency action when the agency fails to justify seeming inconsistencies in its approach.prof l pilots fed faa,internal quotation marks omitted.
torpharm argues that the fda choice of use code has no relevance because use codes are not required by statute or by the controlling regulation.appellant reply br.at internal quotation marks omitted.this misses the point.that use codes are not required by statute has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that the fda has given no reason for making one decision for purposes of selecting a use code and a different decision for purposes of determining whether anda applicants had to submit paragraph iv certifications or section viii statements.
in fact,the fda action was doubly flawed.not only did the agency make inconsistent decisions,but evidence before the fda did not support its conclusion that claimed that the patent covered gabapentin use for treating epilepsy.as the district court pointed out,repeatedly told the fda that the patent covers a method for treating neurodegenerative diseases with gabapentin.at no time did tell the fda that the patent covered a method of treating epilepsy.as the district court aptly put it,t he agency tried to construct a legal fiction about the scope of the patent and to use that construct to ignore crucial facts what actually said about that patent reach,facts that reveal the ultimate falsity of the agency fiction.purepac,d at.
torpharm points out that in each of the documents in which stated that the patent covered neurodegenerative diseases,the company also said that the patent covered the use of neurontin.according to torpharm,because neurontin has only one approved treatment of because fda regulations permit listing approved uses only,the phrase the use must have referred to the approved use,epilepsy.but as the district court explained,the fact that an fda regulation allows the listing of only patents does not prove that every patent in the orange book actually covers an approved use.the reason is obvious the fda does not evaluate information that applicants submit about patents,but simply accepts that information passively.thus,we have no reason to believe that because applicants are supposed to submit information about approved uses only,they in fact do so.such a benign view,the district court concluded,represents the triumph of hope over reality.id.here,moreover,repeated claims that the patent covered neurodegenerative diseases gave the fda ample reason to suspect that the company had chosen to ignore the regulations.the fda decision wa s thus factually unsupportable and irreconcilable with the language and intent of the fdca.for these reasons,it violate d the apa.id.at.
torpharm also calls our attention to a letter that pfizer sent to the fda confirm ing that the patent was properly listed in the orange book.appellant reply at citing the record.but pfizer did not say that the patent belonged in the orange book because it covered the only approved use of gabapentin.rather,pfizer stated that the patent belonged in the orange book because in the company opinion,the fda regulation limiting the orange book to approved uses violated the fdca.undermining torpharm position,moreover,the letter includes the following statement pfizer agrees that the patent does not claim methods of use for which neurontin has been approved.pfizer reconfirms that neither pfizer nor ever represented to fda that the patent claimed an approved use.
in essence,then,torpharm argues that the fda rightly ignored repeated explicit assertions about neurodegenerative diseases in favor of oblique references to the use and other unhelpful statements.perhaps recognizing the weakness of this position,torpharm asserts that express statements were not required by statute or any fda regulation and therefore had no regulatory significance.appellant br.at.this argument is no more convincing than the company similar claim regarding use codes.obligated like any agency to base its decisions on the entire record,see achernar broad.fcc,failure to weigh the entire record would constitute reversible error,the fda may not ignore some evidence before it just because an entity submitted that evidence despite the absence of a legal requirement to do so.
in sum,we agree with the district court that the fda determination that the patent claims the use of treating epilepsy runs counter to the evidence before the agency,and is thus arbitrary and capricious.purepac,d at quoting sinclair broad.group,fcc.according to torpharm,this conclusion contravenes the fda longstanding policy under which it refuses to determine independently what use a patent covers and instead accepts at face value the use claimed by the patent holder.but the district court did not decide that the fda should have scrutinized the claimed use,nor did it address what the patent actually covered.the court simply deemed the fda conclusion regarding what claimed about the patent to be unjustified.under the district court analysis,what use the patent actually covered had no relevance,and properly so.
having considered torpharm other challenges to purepac and finding them without merit,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
we next consider the district court rulings about the patent in torpharm.in that case,the court reviewed the fda decision against making an exception to its longstanding rule that for every patent only one of two section viii statement or a paragraph iv appropriate.although the fda had indicated in purepac that on remand it would consider granting an exception to this rule by accepting torpharm paragraph iv certification,the agency ultimately decided against such an exception,deeming the certification improper.the district court found this decision neither arbitrary nor capricious,explaining that the refusal to make an equitable exception from this rule was within the fda discretion,and torpharm has pointed to nothing in the statute or regulations to cast doubt on the rule itself.torpharm,d at.recognizing the narrow scope of review,the district court concluded that the fda rule deserved judicial deference in the absence of some indication that it conflicts with any of the constraints on the agency regulatory authority,is inconsistent with the agency own prior pronouncements,or is otherwise poorly reasoned or unpersuasive.there are no such indications here.id.citation omitted.torpharm gives us no basis for questioning the district court sound reasoning.
this,however,does not end our task,for the fda did more than simply deny torpharm an exception to the agency rule.with pfizer consent,it also removed the patent from the orange book.at that time,torpharm was defending against an infringement lawsuit that had filed against it in response to its paragraph iv challenge to the patent.before delisting the patent,therefore,the fda had to determine,as required by its regulation,whether to delay such action because torpharm had the potential to earn exclusivity by prevailing in the lawsuit.see a viii b a patent that
