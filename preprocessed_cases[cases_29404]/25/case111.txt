this case involves allegations that the drug zoloft,manufactured by pfizer,causes cardiac birth defects when taken during early pregnancy.in support of their position,plaintiffs,through a plaintiffs steering committee psc,depended upon the testimony of nicholas jewell.jewell used the bradford hill criteria to analyze existing literature on the causal connection between zoloft and birth defects.the district court excluded this testimony and granted summary judgment to defendants.the psc now appeals these orders,alleging that the district court erroneously held that an expert opinion on general causation must be supported by replicated observational studies reporting a statistically significant association between the drug and the adverse effect,and it was an abuse of discretion to exclude jewell testimony.because we find that the district court did not establish such a legal standard and did not abuse its discretion in excluding jewell testimony,we will affirm the district court orders.
this case arises from litigation involving product liability claims against pfizer,alleging that zoloft,a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri,causes cardiac birth defects.the psc introduced a number of experts in order to establish causation.the testimony of each of these experts was excluded in whole or in part.in particular,the court excluded all of the testimony of anick bérard an epidemiologist,which relied on the novel technique of drawing conclusions by examining trends often statistically across selected studies.the psc filed a motion for partial reconsideration of the decision to exclude the testimony of bérard,which the district court denied.the psc then moved to admit jewell a statistician as a general causation witness.pfizer filed a motion to exclude jewell,and the district court conducted a daubert hearing.
the district court considered jewell application of various methodologies,reviewing his expert report,rebuttal reports,party briefs,and oral testimony.the district court first examined how jewell applied the traditional methodology of analyzing replicated,significant results.while jewell discussed many groupings of cardiac birth defects,he focused on the significant findings for all cardiac defects and septal defects.jewell presented two studies reporting a significant association between zoloft and all cardiac defects kornum and.he also presented five studies reporting a significant association between zoloft and septal defects kornum,louik pedersen and bérard.after excluding two studies from its consideration the district court expressed two concerns with the remaining studies,kornum,and pedersen.first,despite the fact that the remaining studies produced consistent results,the district court did not consider them to be independent replications because they used overlapping danish populations.second,a larger study,furu included almost all the data from,kornum,and pedersen and did not replicate the findings of those studies.jewell did not explain the reasons why this attempted replication produced different results or why the new study did not contradict his opinion.
the court then examined jewell reliance on insignificant results,noting that it was very similar to bérard methodology.the court noted that jewell did not provide any evidence that the epidemiology or teratology communities value statistical significance any less than it has traditionally been understood the court also expressed concern that jewell inconsistently applied his technique of multiplying and his trend analysis.
the district court critiqued several other techniques jewell used in analyzing the evidence.first,jewell rejected on which he had previously relied in a lawsuit against another ssri,prozac.the reported insignificant associations with birth defects for zoloft but not for prozac.jewell rationalized his decision to ignore these because the heterogeneity within its zoloft studies was significant the district court accepted this explanation but questioned why jewell fails to statistically calculate the heterogeneity across other studies instead of relying on trends second,jewell reanalyzed two studies,and huybrechts both of which had originally concluded that there was no significant effect attributable to zoloft the district court questioned his rationale for conducting,and tactics for implementing,this reanalysis.finally,jewell conducted a with huybrechts and.the district court questioned why he used only those particular studies 
based on this analysis,the district court found that jewell,tasked with explaining his opinion about zoloft effect on birth defects and reconciling contrary studies,failed to consistently apply the scientific methods he articulates,has deviated from or downplayed certain principles of his field,and has inconsistently applied methods and standards to the data so as to support his a priori opinion.for this reason,on december,the district court entered an order,excluding jewell testimony,and on april,the court granted pfizer motion for summary judgment.the psc appeals the exclusion of jewell and the grant of summary judgment 
in general,courts serve as gatekeepers for expert witness testimony.a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if,inter alia,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.in determining the reliability of novel scientific methodology,courts can consider multiple factors,including the testability of the hypothesis,whether it has been peer reviewed or published,the error rate,whether standards controlling the technique operation exist,and whether the methodology is generally accepted both an expert methodology and the application of that methodology must be reviewed for reliability a court should not,however,usurp the role of the instead,an expert should only be excluded if the flaw is large enough that the expert lacks the good grounds for his or her conclusions.
central to this case is the question of whether statistical significance is necessary to prove causality.we decline to state a rule.instead,we reiterate that plaintiffs ultimately must prove a causal connection between zoloft and birth defects.a causal connection may exist despite the lack of significant findings,due to issues such as random misclassification or insufficient power conversely,a causal connection may not exist despite the presence of significant findings.if a causal connection does not actually exist,significant findings can still occur due to,inter alia,inability to control for a confounding effect or detection bias.a standard based on replication of statistically significant findings obscures the essential issue a causal connection.given this,the requisite proof necessary to establish causation will vary greatly case by case.this is not to suggest,however,that statistical significance is irrelevant.despite the problems with treating statistical significance as a magic criterion,it remains an important metric to distinguish between results supporting a true association and those resulting from mere chance.discussions of statistical significance should thus not understate or overstate its importance.
with this in mind,we proceed to the issues at hand.the psc raises two issues on appeal whether the district court erroneously concluded that reliability requires replicated,statistically significant findings,and whether jewell testimony was properly excluded.
the psc argues that the district court erroneously held that replicated,statistically significant findings are necessary to satisfy reliability.this argument seems to have been originally raised in the motion for reconsideration of bérard exclusion.explaining its decision to exclude bérard,the district court cited a previous case,whitehall labs,for the proposition that the teratology community generally requires replicated,significant epidemiological results before inferring causality the psc claims that in so doing,the district court was asserting a legal standard that required replicated,significant findings for reliability pfizer contends that the district court merely made a factual finding about what the teratology community generally accepts.
upon review,it is clear that the district court was not creating a legal standard,but merely making a factual finding.the psc argues that the district court must have created a legal standard because it did not cite any sources other than to support its assertion that the teratology community generally requires replicated,significant epidemiological findings.however,in its initial exclusion of bérard,the district court noted that it looked to the standards adopted by other epidemiologists,even the very researchers bérard cites in her report.similarly,in its order denying general reconsideration of bérard exclusion,the district court clarified that it made this factual finding after review of the published literature relied upon by bérard and other experts,as well as its review of the reports and testimony of both parties and merely used this factual finding as part of its fre analysis while the district court does cite it uses it merely to show that other courts have made similar findings regarding the prevailing standards for scientists in bérard field.
second,the course of the proceedings make clear that the replication of significant results was not dispositive in establishing whether the testimony of either bérard or jewell was reliable.in fact,the district court expressly rejected pfizer argument that the existence of a statistically significant,replicated result is a threshold issue before an expert can conduct the analysis in doing so,the district court was clear that it was not requiring a threshold showing of statistical significance.similarly,the district court did not end its inquiry after analyzing whether there were replicated,significant results.instead,the district court examined other techniques of general trend analysis,reanalysis of other studies,and.even though it ultimately rejected the application of these techniques as unreliable,it did not categorically reject alternative techniques,suggesting that it did not make a legal standard requiring replicated,significant results.
for these reasons,we find that the district court did not require replication of significant results to establish reliability.instead,it merely made a factual finding that teratologists generally require replication of significant results,and this factual finding did not prevent it from considering other evidence of reliability 
the second issue on appeal is whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to exclude jewell testimony.jewell utilized a combination of two methods the weight of the evidence analysis and the bradford hill criteria.the weight of the evidence analysis involves a series of logical steps used to infer to the best explanation.the bradford hill criteria are metrics that epidemiologists use to distinguish a causal connection from a mere association.these metrics include strength of the association,consistency,specificity,temporality,coherence,biological gradient,plausibility,experimental evidence,and analogy in his expert report,jewell seems to utilize numerous techniques in implementing the weight of the evidence methodology.jewell discusses whether the conclusions drawn from these techniques satisfy the bradford hill criteria and support the existence of a causal connection 
pfizer does not seem to contest the reliability of the bradford hill criteria or weight of the evidence analysis generally the dispute centers on whether the specific methodology implemented by jewell is reliable.flexible methodologies,such as the weight of the evidence,can be implemented in multiple ways despite the fact that the methodology is generally reliable,each application is distinct and should be analyzed for reliability.in in re paoli yard pcb litigation,this circuit noted that while differential diagnosis also a flexible methodology is generally accepted,no particular combination of techniques chosen by a doctor to assess an individual patient is likely to have been generally accepted.accordingly,we subjected the expert specific differential diagnosis process to a daubert inquiry we noted that to the extent that a doctor utilizes standard diagnostic techniques in gathering this information,the more likely we are to find that the doctor methodology is reliable.while we did not require the expert to run specific tests or ascertain full information in order for the differential diagnosis to be reliable,we did require him to explain why his conclusion remained reliable in the face of alternate causes 
this standard,while articulated with respect to differential diagnoses,applies to the weight of the evidence analysis.we have briefly encountered the bradford hill of the evidence methodology in magistrini v.one hour martinizing dry cleaning,a nonprecedential affirmance of the district of new jersey exclusion of an expert the expert followed the weight of the evidence methodology,including epidemiological findings assessed using the bradford hill criteria.the district court acknowledged that although the weight of the evidence methodology was generally reliable,t he particular combination of evidence considered and weighed here has not been subjected to peer review.similar concerns are arguably present for the bradford hill criteria,which are neither an exhaustive nor a necessary list an expert can theoretically assign the most weight to only a few factors,or draw conclusions about one factor based on a particular combination of evidence.the specific way an expert conducts such an analysis must be reliable all of the relevant evidence must be gathered,and the assessment or weighing of that evidence must not be arbitrary,but must itself be based on methods of science.to ensure that the bradford of the evidence criteria is truly a methodology,rather than a mere selection process there must be a scientific method of weighting that is used and explained.for this reason,the specific techniques by which the weight of the hill methodology is conducted must themselves be reliable according to the principles articulated in daubert 
in short,despite the fact that both the bradford hill and the weight of the evidence analyses are generally reliable,the techniques used to implement the analysis must be reliable and reliably applied.in discussing the conclusions produced by such techniques in light of the bradford hill criteria,an expert must explain how conclusions are drawn for each bradford hill criterion and how the criteria are weighed relative to one another.here,we accept that the bradford hill and weight of the evidence analyses are generally reliable.we also assume that the techniques used to implement the analysis here,trend analysis,and reanalysis are themselves reliable.however,we find that jewell did not reliably apply the techniques to the body of evidence or adequately explain how this analysis supports specified bradford hill criteria.because any step that renders the analysis unreliable under the daubert factors renders the expert testimony inadmissible,this is sufficient to show that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding jewell testimony.
it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find jewell application of trend analysis,reanalysis,and to the body of evidence to be unreliable.here,we assume the techniques listed are generally reliable and rest on the fact that they were unreliably applied.as stated in in re paoli,use of standard techniques bolster the inference of reliability nonstandard techniques need to be.additionally,if an expert applies certain techniques to a subset of the body of evidence and other techniques to another subset without explanation,this raises an inference of unreliable application of methodology 
first,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court determination that jewell unreliably analyzed the trend in insignificant results.jewell applied this technique by qualitatively discussing the probative value of multiple positive,insignificant results.in justifying this approach,he relied on a quantitative method by which one can calculate the likelihood of seeing multiple positive but insignificant results if there were actually no true effect however,after alluding to this presumably reliable mathematical calculation technique for analyzing trends in even insignificant results,jewell did not actually implement it instead he qualitatively discussed the general trend in the data.in light of the opportunity to actually conduct such quantitative analysis,his refusal to do so without explanation suggests that he did not reliably apply his stated methodology 
even assuming the reliability of jewell version of trend analysis,jewell identified trends and interpreted insignificant results differently based on the outcome of the study.the district court concluded that jewell selectively emphasize d observed consistency only when the consistent studies support his opinion.jewell emphasized the insignificance of results reporting odds ratios below but not the insignificance of those reporting odds ratios above.he also paid attention to the upper bounds of the confidence intervals associated with odds ratios below,but not to the lower bounds.
second,we interpret the district court discussion of heterogeneity as raising the concern that jewell selectively used.he did this in two ways first,without explanation,jewell performed a on two studies but not on any of the other studies.the district court questioned why jewell did not conduct a on the remaining studies instead of using the qualitative general trend analysis.while jewell was not required to do specific tests,the lack of explanation made his inconsistent application of to certain studies unreliable second,when he did perform a,jewell only included two studies utilizing exposed and paused groups even though each had a different definition of paused,without an adequate explanation for why these studies can be lumped together.he also inexplicably excluded another study kornum utilizing similar methodology.again,while there may have been legitimate reasons for these inconsistencies,the fact that he did not give an adequate explanation for doing so makes his testimony unreliable.
finally,jewell reanalyzed two studies to control for confounding by indication.the need for conducting this reanalysis on huybrechts was unclear.jewell said that he wanted to control for indication by comparing the outcomes for paused zoloft users to exposed zoloft users however,the study already controlled for indication.if jewell wanted to correct for misclassification,the original study already controlled for that as well through extensive sensitivity analyses given that the study originally concluded that zoloft was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of birth defects,this reanalysis seems.
ultimately,the fact that jewell applied these techniques inconsistently,without explanation,to different subsets of the body of evidence raises real issues of reliability.conclusions drawn from such unreliable application are themselves questionable.
using the techniques discussed above,jewell went on to evaluate the bradford hill criteria.while jewell did discuss the applicable bradford hill criteria and how he weighed the factors together,he did not explain how he drew conclusions for certain criteria,namely the strength of association and consistency.
jewell concluded that the strength of association weighs in favor of causality.in doing so,he focused on studies reporting odds ratios between two and three colvin,malm pedersen,and louik.he rationalized that such a large association is unlikely to be associated with confounding alone he later bolstered this argument by estimating the percent of the effect generally attributable to confounding by indication.he estimated this percent by observing the percent decrease in odds ratios after controlling for indication over a few studies.when pressed by counsel at the daubert hearing,jewell admitted that this was not a scientifically rigorous adjustment such reliance on ad hoc adjustments supports the district court decision to exclude jewell testimony.
similarly,while jewell found that the causal effect of zoloft on cardiac birth defects is consistent,it is not clear how he drew this conclusion.as noted above,jewell classified insignificant odds ratios above one as supporting a consistent causality result,downplaying the possibility that they support no association between zoloft use and cardiac birth defects.while an insignificant result may be consistent with a causal effect,jewell discussion is too,sometimes understating the importance of statistical significance.for example,furu a study that incorporated almost all the data in pedersen,and kornum included a larger sample but,unlike the former three studies,reported no significant association between zoloft and cardiac birth defects.insignificant results can occur merely because a study lacks power to produce a significant result,and,all else being equal,a larger sample size increases the power of a test unless there are other significant differences,we would expect furu to be better able to capture a true effect than the preceding three studies.while an insignificant result from a study does not necessarily undermine a statistically significant result from a study,the opposite argument,that an insignificant finding from a presumably study is evidence of consistency with significant findings from studies requires further explanation while there may be a reason that such a result could be consistent with the past significant effects,jewell did not meaningfully discuss why this may be without adequate explanation,this argument understates the importance of statistical significance.like the expert in magistrini,jewell should have sufficiently discredit ed other studies that found no association or a negative association with much more precise confidence intervals,or sufficiently explain ed why he did not accord weight to those studies.claiming a consistent result without meaningfully addressing these alternate explanations,as noted in in re paoli,undermines reliability 
for these reasons,the district court determined that jewell did not consistently assess the evidence supporting each criterion or explain his method for doing so.thus,it was not an abuse of discretion to find that jewell application of the bradford hill criteria was unreliable.
this is not to suggest that all of the district court criticisms were necessarily justified.for example,the fact that in his reanalysis jewell drew a different conclusion from a study than its authors did is not necessarily a problem.similarly,his imposition of a different assumption about the exposed group in huybrechts did not require expert knowledge about psychology he was merely testing the robustness of the results to huybrechts original assumption.similarly,the district court credited the claim that overlapping samples did not provide replicated results,despite the fact that jewell claimed it provided some informational value these inquiries are more appropriately left to the jury.
on the whole,however,the district court did not improperly usurp the jury role in assessing jewell credibility.there is sufficient reason to find jewell testimony was unreliable.indeed,any step that renders the analysis unreliable under the daubert factors renders the expert testimony inadmissible.the fact that jewell unreliably applied the techniques underlying the weight of the evidence analysis and the factors of the bradford hill analysis satisfies this standard for inadmissibility.
this case involves complicated facts,statistical methodology,and competing claims of appropriate standards for assessing causality from observational epidemiological studies.ultimately,however,the issue is quite clear.as a gatekeeper,courts are supposed to ensure that the testimony given to the jury is reliable and will be more informative than confusing.jewell application of his purported methods does not satisfy this standard.by applying different techniques to subsets of the data and inconsistently discussing statistical significance,jewell does not reliably analyze the weight of the evidence.selecting these conclusions to discuss certain bradford hill factors also contributes to the unreliability.while the district court may have flagged a few issues that are not necessarily indicative of an unreliable application of methods,there is certainly sufficient evidence on the record to suggest that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding jewell as an expert on the basis of the unreliability of his methods.for these reasons,we will affirm the orders of the district court,excluding the testimony of jewell and granting summary judgment in favor of pfizer.
