respondent promega corporation sublicensed the tautz patent,which claims a toolkit for genetic testing,to petitioner life technologies corporation and its subsidiaries collectively life technologies for the manufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement fields worldwide.one of the kit five components,an enzyme known as the taq polymerase,was manufactured by life technologies in the united states and then shipped to the united kingdom,where the four other components were made,for combination there.when life technologies began selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use,promega sued,claiming that patent infringement liability was triggered under f of the patent act,which prohibits the supply from the united states of all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention for combination abroad.the jury returned a verdict for promega,but the district court granted life technologies motion for judgment as a matter of law,holding that f phrase all or a substantial portion did not encompass the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention.the federal circuit reversed.it determined that a single important component could constitute a substantial portion of the components of an invention under f and found the taq polymerase to be such a component.
held the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention for manufacture abroad does not give rise to f liability.
a section f phrase substantial portion refers to a quantitative measurement.although the patent act itself does not define the term substantial,and the term ordinary meaning may refer either to qualitative importance or to quantitatively large size,the statutory context points to a quantitative meaning.neighboring words all and portion convey a quantitative meaning,and nothing in the neighboring text points to a qualitative interpretation.moreover,a qualitative reading would render the modifying phrase of the components unnecessary the first time it is used in f.only the quantitative approach thus gives meaning to each statutory provision.
promega proffered approach,which would require a factfinder to decipher whether the components at issue are a substantial portion under either a qualitative or a quantitative test,is rejected.tasking juries with interpreting the statute meaning on an ad hoc basis would only compound,not resolve,the statute ambiguity.and promega proposal to adopt an analytical framework that accounts for both the components quantitative and qualitative aspects is likely to complicate rather than aid the factfinder review.
b under a quantitative approach,a single component can not constitute a substantial portion triggering f liability.this conclusion is reinforced by f text,context,and structure.section f consistently refers to the plural components,indicating that multiple components make up the substantial portion.reading f to cover any single component would also leave little room for f,which refers to any component,and would undermine f express reference to a single component especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.the better reading allows the two provisions to work in tandem and gives each provision its unique application.
c the history of f further bolsters this conclusion.congress enacted f in response to deepsouth packing laitram,to fill a gap in the enforceability of patent rights by reaching components that are manufactured in the united states but assembled overseas.consistent with congress intent,a supplier may be liable under f for supplying from the united states all or a substantial portion of the components of the invention or under f for supplying a single component if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity.but,as here,when a product is made abroad and all components but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad,the activity is outside the statute scope.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the intersection of international supply chains and federal patent law.section f of the patent act of prohibits the supply from the united states of all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention for combination abroad.f.we granted certiorari to determine whether a party that supplies a single component of a multicomponent invention for manufacture abroad can be held liable for infringement under f.we hold that a single component does not constitute a substantial portion of the components that can give rise to liability under f.because only a single component of the patented invention at issue here was supplied from the united states,we reverse and remand.
we begin with an overview of the patent in dispute.although the science behind the patent is complex,a basic understanding suffices to resolve the question presented by this case.
the tautz patent,reissue patent no.re,claims a toolkit for genetic testing the kit is used to take small samples of genetic material in the form of nucleotide sequences that make up the molecule deoxyribonucleic acid commonly referred to as dna and then synthesize multiple copies of a particular nucleotide sequence.this process of copying,known as amplification,generates dna profiles that can be used by law enforcement agencies for forensic identification and by clinical and research institutions around the world.for purposes of this litigation,the parties agree that the kit covered by the tautz patent contains five components a mixture of primers that mark the part of the dna strand to be copied nucleotides for forming replicated strands of dna an enzyme known as taq polymerase a buffer solution for the amplification and control dna 
respondent promega corporation was the exclusive licensee of the tautz patent.petitioner life technologies corporation manufactured genetic testing kits during the timeframe relevant here,promega sublicensed the tautz patent to life technologies for the manufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement fields worldwide.life technologies manufactured all but one component of the kits in the united kingdom.it manufactured that component the taq polymerase in the united states.life technologies shipped the taq polymerase to its united kingdom facility,where it was combined with the other four components of the kit.
four years into the agreement,promega sued life technologies on the grounds that life technologies had infringed the patent by selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use to clinical and research markets.as relevant here,promega alleged that life technologies supply of the taq polymerase from the united states to its united kingdom manufacturing facilities triggered liability under f.
at trial,the parties disputed the scope of f prohibition against supplying all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention from the united states for combination abroad.section f full text reads 
whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the united states all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention,where such components are uncombined in whole or in part,in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the uni
