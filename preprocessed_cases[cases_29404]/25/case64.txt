the state of new york brought this antitrust action against defendant appellant actavis plc and its subsidiary forest laboratories,llc collectively,defendants.new york alleges that as namenda ir,defendants drug designed to treat alzheimer disease,neared the end of its patent exclusivity period in july,defendants introduced a new version called namenda xr.the patents on xr ensure exclusivity,and thus prohibit generic versions of xr from entering the market,until.faced with the prospect of competition from generic ir,defendants decided to withdraw virtually all namenda ir from the market in order to force alzheimer patients who depend on namenda ir to switch to xr before generic ir becomes available.because generic competition depends heavily on state drug substitution laws that allow pharmacists to substitute generic ir for namenda ir but not for xr,new york alleges that defendants scheme would likely impede generic competition for ir.moreover,the substantial transaction costs of switching from xr back to ir therapy would likely further ensure that defendants would maintain their effective monopoly in the relevant drug market beyond the time granted by their ir patents.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge issued a preliminary injunction barring defendants from restricting access to namenda ir prior to generic ir entry.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting new york motion for a preliminary injunction because new york has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim under the sherman act,and has made a strong showing of irreparable injunction.accordingly,we affirm the district court order issuing a preliminary injunction.
background 
this case raises a novel question of antitrust law under what circumstances does conduct by a monopolist to perpetuate patent exclusivity through successive products,commonly known as product hopping,violate the sherman act,and.this question is an issue of first impression in the circuit courts.determining whether defendants actions are unlawfully anticompetitive requires some understanding of the idiosyncratic market characteristics of the complex and pharmaceutical industry,as well as some peculiar characteristics of treatment for alzheimer disease.we begin by describing several key features of the pharmaceutical industry.
fda requirements,the hatch waxman act,and state drug substitution laws 
in compliance with the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,u,when a pharmaceutical manufacturer seeks to bring a new drug to market,it must submit a new drug application nda for approval by the food and drug administration fda.an nda must contain scientific evidence that demonstrates the drug is safe and effective,which inevitably requires a long,comprehensive,and costly testing process.actavis.drugs are generally referred to as or brand drugs.an approved brand drug enjoys a period of patent exclusivity in the market at the end of which one or more generic drugs exhibiting the same characteristics as the brand drug,may enter the market at a lower price to compete with the brand drug.
in,congress amended the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act by enacting the drug price competition and patent term restoration act the hatch waxman act or hatch waxman,stat.hatch waxman was designed to serve the dual purposes of both encouraging generic drug competition in order to lower drug prices and incentivizing brand drug manufacturers to innovate through patent extensions.to incentivize innovation,hatch waxman grants brand manufacturers opportunities to extend their exclusivity period beyond the standard year patent term it allows a brand manufacturer to seek a patent extension of up to five years to compensate for time that lapsed during the fda regulatory process,and an additional period of pediatric exclusivity if the manufacturer conducts certain pediatric studies.defendants applied for,and received,both extensions for namenda ir.
hatch waxman also promotes competition from generic substitute drugs.it permits a manufacturer that seeks to market a generic version of an drug to file what is known as an abbreviated new drug application anda.see j see also in re adderall xr antitrust,cir.an anda allows a generic manufacturer to rely on the studies submitted in connection with the brand drug nda to show that the generic is safe and effective,provided that the anda certifies that the generic drug has the same active ingredients as and is biologically equivalent or bioequivalent to the drug j a iv see also caraco pharm,novo nordisk,citing j a ii,iv.
a generic drug is bioequivalent to a brand drug if the rate and extent of absorption of the active ingredient is the same as that of the brand drug.j b i.in other words,two drugs are bioequivalent if they deliver the same amount of the same active ingredient content into a patient blood stream over the same amount of time.by enabling generic manufacturers to on a brand drug scientific studies,hatch waxman speeds the introduction of generic drugs to market,thereby furthering drug competition.actavis.at internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted see also,pt,at stating the hatch waxman act policy objective was to get safe and effective generic substitutes on the market as quickly as possible after the expiration of the patent.
by the time congress enacted the hatch waxman act,many states had enacted drug substitution laws to further encourage generic competition today,all states and the district of columbia have drug substitution laws although the specific terms of these laws vary by state,drug substitution laws either permit or require pharmacists to dispense a therapeutically equivalent,generic drug in place of a brand drug absent express direction from the prescribing physician that the prescription must be dispensed as written for example,new york drug substitution law requires a pharmacist to substitute a less expensive drug product containing the same active ingredients,dosage form and strength as the drug product prescribed provided certain conditions are met.educ.law a.
all state drug substitution laws prohibit pharmacists from substituting generic drugs that are not therapeutically equivalent to the brand drug,but state laws do not all define therapeutic equivalence in the same way thirty states,including new york and the district of columbia,adopt the fda definition of therapeutically equivalent and only allow generic substitution if the fda designates the generic as in a publication commonly referred to as the orange book.education law a public health law o.to receive an,a generic must not only be bioequivalent but pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand drug,meaning it has the same active ingredient,dosage form,strength,and route of administration as the brand drug.dep t of health human servs,fda,approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations ed,available at the orange book.the requirement is designed to provide guidance regarding which drugs are therapeutically equivalent,but,as has been observed,it also provides an opportunity for brand manufacturers to game the system.
hatch waxman and state substitution laws were enacted,in part,because the pharmaceutical market is not a market.in a market,a consumer selects and pays for a product after evaluating the price and quality of the product.in the prescription drug market,however,the party who selects the drug the doctor does not fully bear its costs,which creates a price disconnect.moreover,a patient can only obtain a prescription drug if the doctor writes a prescription for that particular drug.the doctor selects the drug,but the patient,or in most cases a payor such as a public or private health insurer,pays for the drug.as a result,the doctor may not know or even care about the price and generally has no incentive to take the price into account.see american antitrust institute amicus brief in support of appellee aai br.at see also intellectual property and antitrust professors amicus brief in support of appellee ip and antitrust br.at.as the federal trade commission has explained 
the basic problem is that the forces of competition do not work well in a market where the consumer who pays does not choose,and the physician who chooses does not pay.patients have little influence in determining which products they will buy and what prices they must pay for prescription.
fed.trade comm bureau of consumer,drug product selection,available at.ftc,drug product selection.state substitution laws are designed to correct for this price disconnect by shifting drug selection,between brand drugs and their corresponding generics from doctors,to pharmacists and patients,who have greater financial incentives to make price comparisons see aai br.at.
ii.the relevant market 
the relevant market,undisputed on appeal,is the market in the united states.defendants manufacture namenda,a memantine memantine drug designed to treat alzheimer disease.namenda is currently available in two formulations a drug,namenda ir,and a drug,namenda xr.when forest introduced namenda ir tablets in january,namenda ir was the first medication approved for individuals suffering from alzheimer disease namenda ir became one of forest drugs generating approximately billion in annual sales in and.the fda approved namenda xr in june,and forest began marketing xr in.the two drugs are the only memantine therapies in their class d aspartate nmda receptor antagonists currently on the market 
namenda ir and namenda xr have the same active ingredient and the same therapeutic effect.the relevant medical difference between the two is that ir,which is released immediately into the bloodstream,is taken twice a day while xr,which is released gradually,is taken once a day all other alzheimer disease treatments are administered once a day.
the difference between ir and xr relates to their patent protection.defendants patents on namenda ir prohibit any manufacturer from marketing a generic version of ir until july,namenda ir exclusivity period the exclusivity period for namenda xr does not expire until.a brand drug exclusivity period is significant because when that period ends and generic versions enter the market,the brand drug often loses more than to of the market within six months.this period following the end of patent exclusivity has been referred to in this litigation and throughout the industry as the patent cliff.
iii.defendants introduction of namenda xr and withdrawal of namenda ir 
namenda ir and namenda xr currently occupy the entire market.however,five generic versions of ir have tentative fda approval to enter the market on july,and seven others may enter the market as early as october.because namenda xr has a different strength and daily dosage regimen namenda ir involves two tablets of each and namenda xr involves one the generic ir versions that are poised to enter the market will be therapeutically equivalent under fda regulations to namenda ir,but not to namenda xr.therefore,pharmacists are prohibited from substituting generic ir for namenda xr under most,if not all,state drug substitution laws.
when defendants brought namenda xr to market in july approximately three years after it was approved,they adopted product extension strategies to convert patients from namenda ir to namenda xr and,thus,to avoid the patent cliff.initially,defendants sold both namenda ir and xr but stopped actively marketing ir.during that time,they spent substantial sums of promoting xr to doctors,caregivers,patients,and pharmacists.they also sold xr at a discounted rate,making it considerably less than namenda ir tablets,and issued rebates to health plans to ensure that patients did not have to pay higher for xr than for ir.the parties have referred to defendants efforts to transition patients to xr while ir was still on the market as the soft switch,and we will adopt that term.
in early,defendants decided on a more direct approach.they were concerned that they would be unable to convert a significant percentage of alzheimer patients dependent upon memantine therapy from ir to xr prior to the entry of generic ir.defendants internal projections estimated that only of namenda ir users would voluntarily switch prior to july.on february,defendants publicly announced that they would discontinue namenda ir on august,notified the fda of their plans to discontinue namenda ir,and published letters on their websites urging caregivers and healthcare providers to discuss switching to namenda xr with their patients.defendants also sought to convert namenda ir largest customer base,medicare patients,to xr by sending a letter to the centers for medicare medicaid services requesting that the agency remove ir from the formulary list,so that medicare health plans would not cover it.their planned discontinuance was delayed by a disruption in xr production,and in june,defendants announced that namenda ir would be available until the fall of that year.
but before defendants withdrew ir entirely,intervening events again prompted them to modify their plans.in september,new york state filed a complaint alleging that defendants planned withdrawal of namenda ir violated the antitrust laws.defendants subsequently entered into an agreement with foundation care,a pharmacy,to provide for limited access to namenda ir if medically required.under the terms of the agreement,foundation care is authorized to dispense namenda ir tablets only after receiving a form from a doctor stating that it is medically necessary for the patient to take namenda ir.defendants estimated internally that less than of current namenda ir users would be able to obtain ir through foundation care.although the agreement with foundation care makes ir available to a limited number of patients,defendants actions effectively withdrew namenda ir from the market.the parties have referred to defendants efforts to withdraw namenda ir from the market as the hard switch or forced switch,terms we also adopt.the hard switch began on february,with the announcement of defendants intention to withdraw namenda ir and was suspended in september when defendants agreed to a standstill during the litigation proceedings described below.because a manufacturer does not simply withdraw a drug at once,absent pressing safety concerns,announcing the imminent discontinuation of a drug is tantamount to withdrawal.
iv.procedural history 
in september,new york state filed a complaint in the district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge alleging that defendants were violating the sherman antitrust act,and,as well as new york donnelly act,bus.law et,and seeking a permanent injunction and damages.new york also sought a preliminary injunction barring defendants from restricting access to namenda ir during the course of the litigation.
new york theory of antitrust liability,in substance,is as follows.as namenda ir neared the end of its exclusivity period,defendants introduced namenda xr and,before generic ir was available,withdrew namenda ir in order to force patients to switch from ir to xr for which generic ir will not be substitutable under most states laws.in doing so,defendants intended to thwart generic entry into and competition in the market in order to maintain their monopoly in that market.
the district court held a hearing on the motion,during which it received testimony from witnesses and reviewed over exhibits.after considering that evidence,the district court made several key findings.withdrawing namenda ir from the market prior to generic entry forces alzheimer patients dependent on memantine therapy to switch to namenda xr because it is the only available alternative the generic versions of ir poised to enter the market in july and october of will not be to xr because they have different strengths and dosages pharmacists will not be permitted to substitute generic ir for namenda xr under new york and many other states substitution laws because generic ir is not therapeutically equivalent to namenda xr if defendants forced alzheimer patients to switch to namenda xr prior to generic entry,those patients would be very unlikely to switch back to ir therapy even after generic ir becomes available,due to the high transaction costs associated with alzheimer patients first switching from one formulation of a drug to a new formulation and then back to the original formulation reverse commuting preventing generic ir from competing under state drug substitution laws would likely thwart generic entry into and competition in the market and in withdrawing namenda ir from the market,defendants explicit purpose was to impede generic competition and to avoid the patent cliff which occurs at the end of a drug exclusivity period when generics gain market share through state substitution laws.
based on those findings,the district court granted new york request for a preliminary injunction.the district court concluded that new york raised serious questions regarding the merits of its claims under sections and of the sherman act and the donnelly act,demonstrated the potential for irreparable harm,and concluded that the balance of the equities favored an injunction.the injunction states 
during the injunction term the defendants shall continue to make namenda ir tablets available on the same terms and conditions applicable since july,
defendants shall inform healthcare providers,pharmacists,patients,caregivers,and health plans of this injunction and the continued availability of namenda ir 
the defendants shall not impose a medical necessity requirement or form for the filling of prescriptions of namenda ir during the injunction term.
the injunction is effective from the date of issuance,december,until thirty days after july,the date when generic memantine will first be available the injunction term.defendants timely appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction,and we granted expedited review.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.faiveley transp.malmo ab wabtec,cir.a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or if its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we review legal conclusions,such as the appropriate standard for relief,de novo.see somoza dep t of,cir.
on appeal,defendants argue that the district court applied the wrong legal standard for a preliminary injunction product hopping is not anticompetitive or exclusionary under of the sherman act defendants patent rights foreclose antitrust liability the agreement with foundation care does not violate of the sherman act new york failed to show irreparable harm and the injunction is vague and overbroad.
i.the applicable preliminary injunction standard 
defendants argue that the district court erred by applying the ordinary standard for a preliminary injunction,rather than a heightened standard,because the injunction provides new york with substantially all the relief sought.defendants brief.at.we agree that a heightened standard applies.
section of the clayton act entitles a party to obtain injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.california am.stores,quoting.a party seeking a preliminary injunction must ordinarily establish irreparable harm either a a likelihood of success on the merits,or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims to make them fair ground for litigation,plus a balance of the hardships tipping decidedly in favor of the moving party and that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.oneida nation of new york cuomo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we have held the movant to a heightened standard where i an injunction is mandatory,or ii the injunction will provide the movant with substantially all the relief sought and that relief can not be undone even if the defendant prevails at a trial on the merits.tom doherty,saban entm t,cir.when either condition is met,the movant must show a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits,beal stern,cir,and make a strong showing of irreparable harm,doe n,cir,in addition to showing that the preliminary injunction is in the public interest.
the injunction issued by the district court in this case remains in place until days after generics enter the market,and therefore grant s plaintiffs substantially all the relief they ultimately sought,in effect,as if the injunction had been permanent.eng smith,cir.the district court found that defendants plan is contingent on switching patients to namenda xr before generic ir enters the market.the injunction,however,bars defendants from withdrawing ir,and thus forcing a switch,until thirty days after july,the date when generic memantine will first be available.because the injunction prevents defendants hard switch from succeeding,the injunction render s a trial on the merits largely or partly meaningless.tom doherty,at accordingly,the heightened standard applies.
that conclusion,however,is of little import in this case because new york has satisfied the heightened standard.the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction because new york has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under of the sherman act,see beal,at,and has made a strong showing that defendants conduct would cause irreparable harm to competition in the market and to consumers,doe,at.the district court factual findings,which were based,for the most part,on defendants own internal documents,can not be said to be clearly erroneous,and its injunction prohibiting defendants from withdrawing namenda ir prior to generic entry was not an abuse of discretion as being outside the range of permissible decisions.
ii.monopolization and attempted monopolization under of the sherman act 
section of the sherman act makes it an offense to monopolize,or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states.see also geneva pharm.tech.barr labs,cir.to establish monopolization in violation of,a plaintiff must prove not only that the defendant possessed monopoly power in the relevant market,but that it willfully acquired or maintained that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.verizon commc ns law offices of curtis trinko,llp,quoting united states grinnell.to safeguard the incentive to innovate,the possession of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive conduct.id.in order to show attempted monopolization,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,mcquillan.attempted monopolization,unlike monopolization,requires a finding of specific intent.see,delaware hudson ry.consol.rail,cir.
defendants patents on namenda ir indisputably grant them a legal monopoly in the market until july,the parties do not dispute the district court factual findings that the relevant market is the market in the united states and that namenda ir and xr represent of that market.consequently,the parties do not dispute that defendants possess monopoly power.see geneva,at monopoly power can be proven directly through evidence of control over prices or the exclusion of competition,or inferred from a firm large percentage share of the relevant market.
given that defendants monopoly power has been established,this case turns on whether defendants willfully sought to maintain or attempted to maintain that monopoly in violation of.in united states microsoft,en banc,the circuit,sitting en banc,established a helpful framework for determining when a product change violates based on the test articulated by the supreme court in standard oil united states,and generally applied to antitrust claims.see also paycom billing,mastercard int l,cir explaining that courts analyze most antitrust claims under the rule of reason under the microsoft framework,once a plaintiff establishes that a monopolist conduct is anticompetitive or exclusionary,the monopolist may proffer nonpretextual procompetitive justifications for its conduct.at.the plaintiff may then either rebut those justifications or demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm outweighs the procompetitive benefit.id.
anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct 
as a general rule,courts are properly very skeptical about claims that competition has been harmed by a dominant firm product design changes.microsoft,at see also foremost pro color,eastman kodak,cir.product innovation generally benefits consumers and inflicts harm on competitors,so courts look for evidence of exclusionary or anticompetitive effects in order to distinguish between conduct that defeats a competitor because of efficiency and consumer satisfaction and conduct that impedes competition through means other than competition on the merits.trans sport,starter sportswear,cir quoting football league football league,cir.
case law makes clear that product redesign is anticompetitive when it coerces consumers and impedes competition the leading case in our circuit for liability based on product redesign is berkey photo,eastman kodak,cir.in that case,kodak simultaneously introduced its new kodacolor ii film and new kodak camera,which was designed so that it could only be used with the kodacolor ii film the system.id.at.kodak,which possessed a lawful monopoly in film but not in cameras,heavily advertised kodacolor ii film as a remarkable new film,and for months,kodak made kodacolor ii film only for the camera.id.at.berkey photo,berkey,a smaller camera manufacturer,alleged that kodak unlawfully used its monopoly in film to increase camera sales and monopolize the camera market.id.we rejected that claim and held that the introduction of the system and advertising of the kodacolor ii film did not violate the sherman act because kodak success was not based on any form of coercion.id.at.but,of significance to the case before us,we cautioned that the situation might be completely different if,upon the introduction of the system,kodak had ceased producing film in the size,thereby compelling camera purchasers to buy a kodak camera.id.at 
in this case,defendants argue that withdrawing a product is not anticompetitive or exclusionary conduct,especially when the new product is superior to the old product certainly,neither product withdrawal nor product improvement alone is anticompetitive.but under berkey photo,when a monopolist combines product withdrawal with some other conduct,the overall effect of which is to coerce consumers rather than persuade them on the merits,id.at,and to impede competition,id.at,its actions are anticompetitive under the sherman act cont l ore union carbide carbon,noting that when an antitrust conspiracy involves multiple acts,t he character and effect of the conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts,but only by looking at it as a whole internal quotation marks omitted.here,defendants hard switch the combination of introducing namenda xr into the market and effectively withdrawing namenda ir forced alzheimer patients who depend on memantine therapy to switch to xr to which generic ir is not therapeutically equivalent and would likely impede generic competition by precluding generic substitution through state drug substitution laws.
consumer coercion 
defendants hard switch crosses the line from persuasion to coercion and is anticompetitive.as long as defendants sought to persuade patients and their doctors to switch from namenda ir to namenda xr while both were on the market the soft switch and with generic ir drugs on the horizon,patients and doctors could evaluate the products and their generics on the merits in furtherance of competitive objectives.
by effectively withdrawing namenda ir prior to generic entry,defendants forced patients to switch from namenda ir to xr the only other memantine drug on the market tr.stitt so the unique thing about the namenda ir hard switch i think is that there really no place for prescribers to,to go with a drug to treat that condition.in fact,the district court found that defendants devised the hard switch because they projected that only of patients would voluntarily switch to namenda xr prior to generic entry.defendants hard switch was expected to transition to of namenda ir patients to xr prior to generic entry,and thereby impede generic competition.
defendants argue that courts should not distinguish between hard and soft switches.but this argument ignores one of berkey photo basic tenets the market can determine whether one product is superior to another only so long as the free choice of consumers is preserved.at.had defendants allowed namenda ir to remain available until generic entry,doctors and alzheimer patients could have decided whether the benefits of switching to namenda xr would outweigh the benefits of adhering to therapy using generic ir or perhaps namenda ir.by removing namenda ir from the market prior to generic ir entry,defendants sought to deprive consumers of that choice.in this way,defendants could avoid competing against generics based on the merits of their redesigned drug by forcing alzheimer patients to take xr with the knowledge that transaction costs would make the reverse commute by patients from xr to generic ir highly unlikely.
ii.impedes competition 
as the district court concluded,defendants hard switch would likely have anticompetitive and exclusionary effects on competition in the memantine market,creating a dangerous probability that defendants would maintain their monopoly power after generics enter the market.spectrum sports,at.based on careful consideration of the unique characteristics of the pharmaceutical market,the district court found that p rice competition at the pharmacy,facilitated by state substitution laws,is the principal means by which generics are able to compete in the united states.
we agree with the district court analysis.forcing patients to switch to xr would prevent generic substitution because generic versions of ir are not to namenda xr.and if,as defendants own internal predictions estimate,the hard switch successfully converted to of ir patients to xr prior to generic entry,there would be few to no prescriptions left for which generics would be eligible to compete.because defendants forced switch through something other than competition on the merits has the effect of significantly reducing usage of rivals products and hence protecting its own monopoly,it is anticompetitive.microsoft,at.
defendants and their amici argue that generics can successfully compete by persuading payors and managers to promote generic ir through the use of formularies,structures,step programs,and requirements but,as the district court determined,competition through state drug substitution laws is the only means of competing available to generic manufacturers.for there to be an antitrust violation,generics need not be barred from all means of distribution if they are bar red from the ones.microsoft,at see also united states dentsply int l,cir the test is not total foreclosure,but whether the challenged practices bar a substantial number of rivals or severely restrict the market ambit.moreover,as the district court found,additional expenditures by generics on marketing would be impractical and ineffective because a generic manufacturer promoting a product would have no way to ensure that a pharmacist would substitute its product,rather than one made by one of its generic competitors.
although in theory,alzheimer patients would be free to switch back to ir therapy after generic entry,the district court found that,in practice,such a reverse commute would be a highly unlikely occurrence.as one of defendants own executives explained during a january,earnings call if we do the hard switch and we convert patients and caregivers to therapy versus twice a day,it very difficult for the generics then to back.this is because there are high transaction costs associated with reverse commuting.any patient who wants to switch back to ir therapy must first obtain a new prescription from a doctor.but,as the district court found,the nature of alzheimer disease makes alzheimer patients especially vulnerable to changes in routine,and makes doctors and caregivers very reluctant to change a patient medication if the current treatment is effective.as a result,if defendants forced patients to switch from namenda ir to xr,those patients would be very unlikely to switch back to generic ir even if generic ir is more moreover,payors are reluctant to require patients to switch from a drug they are currently taking to a new drug,so health plans would be unlikely to require patients to switch to generic ir.
defendants and their amici argue that the district court focus on is misplaced because up to states do not impose an requirement and thus may let pharmacists unilaterally substitute generic ir for namenda xr.defs.br.at emphasis added.defendants argument,however,exaggerates the variance in state substitution laws.many states that do not explicitly require generic drugs to have the same effectively require the same degree of therapeutic equivalence.for example,defendants cite iowa code as an example of a state law that do es not rely on the orange book.defs.br.at.section permits pharmacists to substitute a generic drug if it has the same demonstrated bioavailability as the brand drug,iowa code ann,but section clarifies that a generic is only considered to have the same demonstrated bioavailability if it has the same rate and extent of absorption of a drug or drug ingredient from a specified dosage form,iowa code ann.because the dosage and absorption rates of generic ir differ from that of xr,the drugs are not bioequivalent under iowa law.moreover,because generic ir is manufactured in tablet form and namenda xr is marketed in capsule form,they do not have the same dosage form as a result,as in new york and the other states that require an,iowa pharmacists will not be permitted to substitute generic ir for xr 
defendants argue that their conduct was not anticompetitive because preventing free riding is a legitimate business purpose.but what defendants call free riding generic substitution by pharmacists following the end of namenda ir exclusivity period is authorized by law is the explicit goal of state substitution laws and furthers the goals of the hatch waxman act by promoting drug competition,actavis.at,and by preventing the practical extension of brand drug manufacturers monopoly beyond the expiration of the ir patent s,pt,at.
defendants also argue that antitrust law is not a vehicle for enforcing the spirit of drug laws.defs.br.at.but the supreme court has made clear that a ntitrust analysis must always be attuned to the particular structure and circumstances of the industry at issue.trinko,at.leading antitrust authorities have encouraged courts to acknowledge market defects,such as a price disconnect and the exclusivity of patents,in their antitrust analysis and in other hatch waxman contexts,this court has recognized that efforts to manipulate aspects of the hatch waxman incentive structure to exclude competition could state an antitrust claim.see,arkansas carpenters health welfare fund bayer ag,cir a plaintiff can have antitrust claims where a pharmaceutical manufacturer manipulate s the hatch waxman conferred day exclusivity period in a manner that bars subsequent challenges to the patent or precludes the generic manufacturer from marketing products unrelated to the patent,abrogated on other grounds by actavis.at.therefore,we conclude that the district court appropriately considered the unique market characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry in concluding that antitrust law requires defendants to allow generic competitors a fair opportunity to compete using state substitution laws.
procompetitive justifications 
all of defendants procompetitive justifications for withdrawing ir are pretextual.the record is replete with evidence showing that defendants were,in the words of defendants own ceo,trying to put up barriers or obstacles to generic competition.see also we need to transition volume to xr to protect our namenda revenue from generic penetration in when we lose ir patent exclusivity.w hat we trying to do is make a cliff disappear and rather have a long a prolonged decline.and we believe that by potentially doing a forced switch,we will hold on to a large share of our base users.our mission is to convert to namenda xr and lift the franchise we need to convert as much ir business to namenda xr as quickly as possible.based largely on defendants own documents,new york has rebutted defendants procompetitive justifications.
procompetitive benefits anticompetitive harms 
because we have determined that defendants procompetitive justifications are pretextual,we need not weigh them against the anticompetitive harms.but in any event,new york has shown that whatever procompetitive benefits exist are outweighed by the anticompetitive harms.defendants argue that their conduct is procompetitive because l aunching a new product advances competition by adding a better product to the market and by paving the way for further innovation.defs.br.at.while introducing namenda xr may be procompetitive,that argument provides no procompetitive justification for withdrawing namenda ir.
defendants argue that withdrawing ir was procompetitive because it would maximize their return on their investment in xr.but in deciding to take ir off the market,defendants were willing to give up profits they would have made selling ir forest drug.this willingness to forsake profits to achieve an anticompetitive end is indicative of anticompetitive behavior.in re adderall,at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,defendants fail to explain why the potential redacted in additional xr sales that they stood to earn which is less than the approximately billion in annual sales they have made from namenda ir in recent years makes economic sense in the absence of the benefit derived from eliminating generic competition.see id.at stating that anticompetitive effects could be shown where defendants conduct makes sense only because it eliminates competition.as a result,we agree with the district court that 
defendants loss of redacted in ir sales,translating to redacted in income,is most rationally construed as an investment in moving the memantine market in their favor through impeding generic competition,yielding d efendants redacted redacted in income over the course of the next redacted years.
finally,defendants have presented no evidence to support their argument that antitrust scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry will meaningfully deter innovation.to the contrary,as the american antitrust institute amici argue,immunizing product hopping from antitrust scrutiny may deter significant innovation by encouraging manufacturers to focus on switching the market to trivial or minor product reformulations rather than investing in the research and development necessary to develop riskier,but medically significant innovations.
in sum,we conclude that the combination of withdrawing a successful drug from the market and introducing a reformulated version of that drug,which has the dual effect of forcing patients to switch to the new version and impeding generic competition,without a legitimate business justification,violates of the sherman act.
iii.patent rights as a defense to liability 
defendants argue that their patent rights under namenda ir and namenda xr shield them from antitrust liability.to be sure,there is tension between the antitrust laws objective of enhancing competition by preventing unlawful monopolies and patent laws objective of incentivizing innovation by granting legal patent monopolies.see in re adderall,at see also scm xerox,cir.
but in its recent landmark antitrust case,actavis,the supreme court made clear that patent and antitrust policies are both relevant in determining the scope of the patent monopoly and consequently antitrust law immunity that is conferred by a patent.at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states gypsum,indicating that courts must balance the privileges of the patent holder and its licensees under the patent grants with the prohibitions of the sherman act against combinations and attempts to monopolize.
the court decision in actavis reaffirmed the conclusions of circuit courts that a patent does not confer upon the patent holder an absolute and unfettered right to use its intellectual property as it wishes,microsoft,at,and i ntellectual property rights do not confer a privilege to violate the antitrust laws,in re indep.serv.orgs.antitrust.see also allied orthopedic appliances tyco health care grp.lp,cir c hanges in product design are not immune from antitrust scrutiny and in certain cases may constitute an unlawful means of maintaining a monopoly under section.
defendants argue that their conduct does not violate antitrust law because they have merely exercised rights afforded by the patent act.defs.br.at.but patent law gives defendants a temporary monopoly on individual drugs not a right to use their patents as part of a scheme to interfere with competition beyond the limits of the patent monopoly.united states line material.defendants have essentially tried to use their patent rights on namenda xr to extend the exclusivity period for all of their drugs.as explained above,it is the combination of defendants withdrawal of ir and introduction of xr in the context of generic substitution laws that places their conduct beyond the scope of their patent rights for ir or xr individually.
iv.the sherman act and the donnelly act 
in light of new york substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims,we need not address the merits of its sherman act or donnelly act claims,which are based on the agreement between defendants and foundation care.we do note,however,that an agreement related to a party violation of does not trigger liability under unless the agreement itself unreasonably restrains trade,geneva,at,and there is mutual anticompetitive intent,see id.at l ack of intent by one party precludes a conspiracy to monopolize.conduct that satisfies the unreasonable restraint prong under does not necessarily violate absent evidence that the agreement furthers the anticompetitive conduct.id.at.
irreparable harm 
new york has made a strong showing that competition and consumers will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction.doe,at.irreparable harm is injury that is neither remote nor speculative,but actual and imminent and that can not be remedied by an award of monetary damages.forest city daly,town of hempstead,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to obtain injunctive relief under of the clayton act,that injury must be an injury of the type the antitrust laws were designed to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.consol.gold fields plc minorco,internal quotation marks omitted,amended by cir.
as the district court concluded,p ermanent damage to competition in the memantine market can result from defendants planned hard switch strategy.if generics can not compete with defendants drugs via state substitution laws,they can not compete effectively for sales of a branded drug in the same class,such as namenda xr,even if the price of the generics is much lower than the brand.see also ip and antitrust br.at explaining that absent substitution at the pharmacy,the market for generics will collapse.moreover,generics can not simply move into the market for generic xr.to become substitutable for namenda xr,generic manufacturers must develop new namenda tablets,begin the process all over again,and await the end of xr patent exclusivity period in.because defendants conduct does not simply harm a competitor or two,but threatens to reduce competition in the market,it is precisely the type that the antitrust laws were designed to protect against.consol.gold,at.
the district court also found that,in addition to harming consumer choice,defendants hard switch would cause economic harm to consumers.based on defendants own data,the district court found that consumers would pay almost million more and payors would pay almost billion more for memantine therapy if defendants were permitted to switch patients to namenda xr before generic ir entry.and hhs reports that defendants withdrawal of namenda ir prior to generic entry would cost medicare and its beneficiaries a minimum of billion over the next ten years threaten ed economic harm to consumers is plainly sufficient to authorize injunctive relief.am.stores,at 
defendants argue that the district court erred in finding irreparable harm because any increase in costs to consumers and payors is compensable and readily quantifiable.defs.br.at.but compensating the approximately alzheimer patients who take namenda ir tablets,and an unknown number of public and private payors,for an ongoing harm would impose the task of disentangling overlapping damages claims which is not lightly to be imposed upon potential antitrust litigants,or upon the judicial system.blue shield of mccready,see also salinger colting,cir harm might be irremediable,or irreparable,for many reasons,including that a loss is difficult to replace in addition,many of the victims of defendants hard switch,such as patients and health plans,may be prevented from direct recovery for their antitrust losses because of the indirect purchaser rule,which bars those who do not directly purchase a product from recovering antitrust damages,thus further supporting new york claim of irreparable injury.see illinois brick illinois.
additionally,we agree with the district court,and the parties do not dispute,that the preliminary injunction serves the public interest in a competitive market for memantine drugs.see united states siemens,cir finding that the government represents the public interest in a competitive marketplace in seeking to enjoin a merger under of the clayton act see also,verio,cir g overnment action taken in furtherance of a regulatory or statutory scheme is presumed to be in the public interest.
vi.the preliminary injunction 
defendants argue that the injunction provision requiring them to make namenda ir tablets available on the same terms and conditions applicable since july,is vague because the terms and conditions have shifted over the past months.we disagree.the injunction plainly prohibits defendants from charging more for namenda ir than it did during the specified timeframe and from restricting access to ir.if defendants need additional clarification,they can seek it in the district court.
defendants also argue that the injunction is overbroad because there is no antitrust violation in the states in which drug substitution laws might allow pharmacists to substitute generic ir for namenda xr.defendants did not raise this argument before the district court,and therefore have forfeited it.see,zalaski city of hartford,cir p laintiffs failed to raise the argument in the district court,thereby forfeiting it on appeal.in any event,that argument is not persuasive because,as explained above,it exaggerates the extent to which state substitution laws differ.defendants have not brought to our attention a single state in which drug substitution laws will definitively allow pharmacists to submit generic ir for namenda xr,and have thus failed to identify any state for which there is no antitrust violation.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we affirm the district court order granting new york motion for a preliminary injunction.
