background 
section a provides,in relevant part 
the equipments,or any part thereof,including boats,purchased for,or the repair parts or materials to be used,or the expenses of repairs made in a foreign country upon a vessel documented under the laws of the united states to engage in the foreign or coasting trade,or a vessel intended to be employed in such trade,shall,on the first arrival of such vessel in any port of the united states,be liable to entry and the payment of an ad valorem duty of per centum on the cost thereof in such foreign country for the purposes of this section,compensation paid to members of the regular crew of such vessel in connection with the installation of any such equipments or any part thereof,or the making of repairs,in a foreign country,shall not be included in the cost of such equipment or part thereof,or of such repairs.
under the statute,a fifty percent duty is imposed on the value of expenses of repairs made in a foreign country upon united vessels.texaco,at.section a provides that if the expenses incurred in a foreign port are not the expenses of repairs described in the statute,then the expenses are not subject to the fifty percent duty.id.at.
in texaco,we were asked to review a court of international trade decision affirming customs determination that certain cleaning and equipment protective covering expenses incurred by a united states vessel in a foreign port were expenses of repairs under a and thus dutiable.id.at.the specific expenses at issue were expenses associated with following boiler room,cargo tank,and after peak tank repairs and expenses associated with protective coverings used during cargo tank repairs.id.at.in reviewing the court of international trade decision,we first interpreted expenses of repairs under a to mean those repair expenses that would not have been incurred but for the repair work.id.at.in coming to this conclusion,we rejected earlier,more restrictive definitions of expenses of repairs by the court of international trade and the united states customs court.id.at.we then applied the but for approach under a to the expenses at issue and found that both the expenses,id.at,and the expenses associated with the protective coverings,id.at,were expenses that would not have been incurred but for the vessel repairs.therefore,we agreed with the court of international trade that customs properly determined that those vessel repair expenses were dutiable under a.
we issued our texaco decision on december.shortly thereafter,on january,the assistant commissioner for customs office of regulations and rulings assistant commissioner issued headquarters hq memorandum to customs new orleans regional director.the hq memorandum was later published in the customs bulletin.hq memorandum stated that the but for test for dutiable expenses of repair under a described in texaco had ramifications with respect to customs liquidation of vessel repair entries.in the memorandum,it was noted that certain expenses that customs currently did not consider expenses of repairs under a,such as travel or transportation,would,under certain circumstances,undoubtedly constitute dutiable expenses of repairs under the but for test set forth in texaco.the hq memorandum stated that all costs not finally liquidated as of the date of texaco should be liquidated as dutiable as expenses of repairs provided they pass the but for test discussed above.
declared and entered vessel repair expenses with customs from january through march.the expenses involved work performed on several united vessels by foreign labor.the expenses listed in the entries included expenses associated with transportation,travel,equipment rental,meals,administrative insurance,and tax costs.
representatives of met with customs officials on february,to discuss the ramifications of the texaco decision,hq memorandum,and their belief that customs needed to comply with the notice and comment requirements of c with respect to any rulings concerning the repair expenses.on march,the assistant commissioner issued hq memorandum,which was subsequently published,modifying hq memorandum the new hq memorandum provided that,instead of applying the but for test described in texaco to all vessel repair expenses unliquidated at the time of the texaco decision,customs would only apply the test prospectively to entries filed after the date of the decision.the only exception to this rule was that the but for test would apply to unliquidated vessel repair expenses of the kind that were specifically at issue in texaco,cleaning and protective covering expenses.
customs then proceeded to examine each of vessel repair expense entries,finding that some,but not all,of the entered expenses satisfied the but for test and were thus dutiable under a.paid the liquidated duties on the applicable vessel repair entries and then filed administrative protests with customs concerning the liquidations.after customs denial of the protests and further requests for review,appealed to the court of international trade seeking to recover the duties assessed by customs under a.
before the court of international trade,the parties stipulated to the pertinent facts.first,they agreed that,prior to texaco,customs had issued certain hq rulings regarding the assessment of duties under a that had not been revoked,rescinded,or amended,d at.the parties also agreed that these earlier hq rulings involved duties on one or more of the expenses that were the subject of protests.id.in addition,the parties agreed that none of the duties under protest involved cleaning or protective covering expenses similar to those disputed in texaco.id.finally,and the government stipulated that some of the protests relate to duty assessed to certain items on a pro rata basis apportioned by customs to reflect what customs alleges are dutiable and nondutiable foreign costs of an entry.id.
with the above stipulation forming a backdrop,the parties for summary judgment.in that setting,made three basic arguments.first,it argued that customs had not actually applied the but for analysis to each of the expenses at issue.id.at.the court of international trade rejected this argument,concluding that customs had conducted a but for analysis for each expense at issue.id.the court cited hq memorandum instruction to evaluate each vessel repair entry under the but for standard as support for its conclusion.id.
also argued that texaco required that customs determine whether assessing duties on a particular vessel repair expense runs counter to an established and uniform practic
