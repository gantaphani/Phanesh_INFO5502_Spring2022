the federal communications commission fcc or the commission has thrice implement the unbundling provisions of the telecommunications act of,stat.the act or the act.this case involves a series of petitions for review of the fcc fourth attempt.because we conclude the commission fourth try is a charm,we deny all of the petitions for review.
the act sought to foster a competitive market in telecommunications.to minimize the characteristics of natural monopoly in the market the act gave the fcc broad powers to require incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to make unbundled network elements unes available to competitive local exchange carriers clecs,c,d see also id.defining a network element as a facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service.thus,the commission may require the ilecs to offer pieces of their networks as unbundled building blocks,which the clecs can lease,repackage,and use to compete against the ilecs in telecommunications markets across the country.
congress left to the commission the choice of elements to be unbundled,specifying that it must consider,at a minimum,whether the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.id.d emphases added.relying upon the implicit breadth of its at a minimum authority and its discretion to interpret the meaning of impair ment,the fcc in this case amended its unbundling determinations for three types of unes switches devices that direct calls to their destinations in the same way switchboard operators once did,transport trunks wires that carry calls between switches,and local loops wires that run from switches over the last mile to consumers telephones.the propriety vel non of those determinations is the crux of this case.
the basics of unbundling are relatively simple.suppose a clec such as covad wants to serve customers in washington.one way of doing so is for covad to purchase its own switches,trunks,and loops,which it can then use to offer service to its new customers.however,given that the local ilec,verizon has already deployed switches,trunks,and loops to serve the market,it might be economically impossible for covad to duplicate competitively verizon infrastructure.through regulatory unbundling,however,covad might be able to lease verizon switches,trunks,and loops as unes.covad could then use combinations of unes to cobble together a network and compete against verizon in washington.
under the act,covad must pay verizon for every facility and every piece of equipment the former requests from the latter on an unbundled basis.see id.id.d.after a litigation battle,the commission concluded that une prices must be based on each element total element incremental cost telric.see b verizon commc ns,fcc,d upholding the fcc telric pricing methodology for unes as a reasonable policy choice.telric rates are akin to wholesale prices because clecs are supposed to be economically able to rent unes and then use them to sell telecom services to their retail customers.
the ilecs unsurprisingly dislike seeing their own networks wielded as competitive weapons by when the clecs enjoy access to unes at telric rates.the ilecs therefore champion the use of substitute products that allow clecs to compete without demanding access to the ilecs individual network elements.for our purposes,the only relevant substitute product is the tariffed special access service tsas.basically,covad can purchase tsass from verizon at prices above the telric rates associated with unes,and the tsass allow covad to complete calls over dedicated lines.see,in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions of the telecommunications act of,third report and order and fourth further notice of proposed rulemaking,une remand order.thus,instead of purchasing or renting a loop,switch,space in a central office,and a transport trunk to complete a call,a clec might simply pay the higher tsas rate for a dedicated line which does not require separate switching or transport.
given the lower cost of unes,the clecs favor widespread unbundling,while ilecs favor fewer unes and the greater availability of tsass.this clecs advocating more unbundling and ilecs advocating been the nub of an ongoing,dispute between incumbents and their competitors.to explain today unbundling battle,we begin with the skirmishes that preceded it.
the ilecs and clecs power struggle over unes began shortly after the passage of the act.in its first attempt to interpret the act impairment standard,the commission concluded that a clec was entitled to a given une if the quality of the service the entrant can offer,absent access to the requested element,declines the cost of providing the service rises.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,first report and order.
the supreme court found this interpretation of impair unreasonable in two respects.first,the commission had erroneously refused to consider whether a clec could or acquire the requested element from a third party.at t iowa utils,d.second,the commission had considered any increase in cost or decrease in quality,no matter how small,sufficient to establish result the court concluded could not be squared with the ordinary and fair meaning of the word impair.id.at.the court admonished the fcc that in assessing which cost differentials would impair a new entrant competition within the meaning of the statute,it must apply some limiting standard,rationally related to the goals of the act.id.at.emphasis omitted.
on remand from iowa utilities,the commission ruled that a entrant is impaired if,taking into consideration the availability of alternative elements outside the incumbent network,including by a requesting carrier or acquiring an alternative from a supplier,lack of access to that element materially diminishes a requesting carrier ability to provide the services it seeks to offer.une remand order,at.we held the commission impairment standard was unlawful because it did not differentiate between those cost disparities that a new entrant in any market would be likely to face and those that arise from market characteristics linked in some degree to natural monopoly that would make genuinely competitive provision of an element function wasteful.telecom ass fcc,usta i,cert.denied sub nom.worldcom,telecom ass n,d.usta i concluded that the commission broad concept of impairment failed to balance the costs and benefits of unbundling.see id.at.
usta i also instructed the commission to make nuanced impairment determinations.id.at.though the act does not necessarily require the commission to determine on a localized or basis which unbundled elements are to be made available,id.at,it does require a more nuanced concept of impairment than is reflected in findings detached from any specific markets or market categories,id.at.thus,the commission is obligated to establish unbundling criteria that are at least aimed at tracking relevant market characteristics and capturing significant variation.
on remand from usta i,the commission determined that a clec would 
be impaired when lack of access to an incumbent lec network element poses a barrier or barriers to entry,including operational and economic barriers,that are likely to make entry into a market uneconomic.that is,we ask whether all potential revenues from entering a market exceed the costs of entry,taking into consideration any countervailing advantages that a new entrant may have.
in the matter of review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers,report and order and order on remand and further notice of proposed rulemaking,triennial review order.in response to usta i demand for a more nuanced impairment standard,the commission made an absolute national impairment finding,subject to specific exclusions,findings of by state public utility commissions.id.at.
we invalidated much of the triennial review order in united states telecom association fcc.usta ii,cert.denied sub,ass of regulatory utility comm rs united states telecom ass n,d.we concluded that the commission touchstone of impairment uneconomic excessively vague.see id.at uneconomic by whom by any clec,no matter how inefficient by an average or representative clec by the most efficient existing clec by a hypothetical clec that used the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,usta ii held the fcc could not lawfully implement a more nuanced or granular impairment standard by adopting a blanket finding of impairment and then delegating power to state regulatory commissions to make exceptions to the fcc nationwide rule.id.at.instead,the fcc must establish unbundling criteria that take into account relevant market characteristics,which capture significant variation,id.at,sensibly define the relevant markets,id.at,connect those markets to the fcc impairment findings,id.at,and consider whether the element in question is significantly deployed on a competitive basis,id.at.the fact that clecs can viably compete without example,by utilizing the ilecs tsass precludes a finding that the clecs are impaired by lack of access to the element under c.id.at see also id.at.
on remand from usta ii,the commission issued an interim order and notice of proposed rulemaking.see nprm.the nprm noted that our decision called into question certain aspects of the commission unbundling framework,including the of the commission touchstone of entry id.at.accordingly,the fcc sought comment on how to respond to the circuit usta ii decision in establishing sustainable new unbundling rules under sections c and d of the act.id.
after receiving and considering comments,the fcc issued a order,which is the subject of this case.see in the matter of unbundled access to network elements,order on remand,order.we discuss each part of the order in turn.
first,the commission altered its unbundling framework.the fcc clarified that it would find impairment where it would be uneconomic for a reasonably efficient clec to compete without unes.see id.at.the commission explained 
in analyzing entry from the perspective of the reasonably efficient competitor,we do not attach weight to the individualized circumstances of the actual requesting carrier.thus,we do not presume that a hypothetical entrant possesses any particular assets,legal entitlements or opportunities,even if a specific competitive carrier in fact enjoys such advantages as a result of its unique circumstances.similarly,under our approach,impairment does not arise due to any errors of business judgment made by an actual requesting carrier.
id.at footnotes omitted.
while the fcc presumes that a reasonably efficient competitor will use reasonably efficient technologies and take advantage of existing alternative facilities deployment,id.at,it need not utilize tsass in the local exchange markets.see id.at ruling it would be inappropriate to limit clecs access to unes whenever a requesting carrier is able to compete using an ilec special access services.usta ii held that the fcc must consider competition in its impairment inquiry for mobile wireless and unes,at,because competition in those markets is robust,id.at.in contrast,t he local services market does not share the competitive conditions,observed in the mobile wireless services market and long distance services market,that would support a parallel finding that the costs of unbundling outweigh the benefits.order,at.because the commission concluded that unes are vital to the continued development of competition in the local exchange market,it retained its unbundling requirements,regardless of whether clecs are currently using tsass to provide local service.
second,the commission amended its impairment findings for dedicated interoffice transport.dedicated transport facilities refer to facilities that are dedicated to a particular carrier used for transmission between or among ilec wire centers.id.at.for purposes of this opinion,transport comes in two varieties which can carry voice calls simultaneously and which has times the capacity of facilities and can therefore carry voice calls simultaneously.
clecs often use transport as part of an circuit,called an enhanced extended link eel,which can be used to serve a single customer typically a small or business.see usta ii,at.eels are often composed of a loop combined with a transport link.after noting that it will measure impairment with regard to dedicated transport on a basis,order,at,the commission identified two proxies for determining whether entry into a particular market would be economic without unbundled or facilities i the extent of collocation and ii business line density 
the fcc found that clecs are not impaired without transport links when both ends of the transport route terminate in tier wire centers,those with four or more collocators or or more business lines.similarly,clecs are not impaired without access to transport where both ends of the route terminate in tier wire centers,those with at least three collocators or at least business lines.id.at.the higher impairment threshold for transport reflects the fact that facilities have less capacity and generate less revenue thus making them less likely to be deployed by clecs.
if a clec that a transport trunk meets the applicable test,the ilec is obligated to offer immediate access to the trunk on an unbundled basis.id.at.if the ilec seeks to challenge the propriety of unbundling the trunk,it must first provide the une and then raise a challenge through the dispute resolution procedures prescribed by the applicable interconnection agreements,contracts between ilecs and clecs.
third,the commission amended its impairment findings for and loops the commission noted it is often not economical for a clec to deploy its own loops,given their capacity limitations.id.at.however,the fcc explained that to offer or service,clecs install cables including loops and optical carrier level n,or ocn,facilities and then use electronics to light the fiber at specific capacity levels,often channelizing these offerings into multiple streams.id.thus,the fcc concluded,clecs are not impaired without unes in markets where clecs have could economically facilities that can be channelized to provide service at lower levels.id.at.
after noting that the relevant market for measuring impairment in and loops is the area served by a wire center,id.at,the commission again relied upon collocators and density as proxies for predicting impairment in loop markets,id.at.specifically,the commission found that clecs are not impaired without loops within the service area of a wire center that has at least four collocators and at least business lines.similarly,clecs are not impaired without access to loops within the service area of a wire center containing at least four collocators and at least business lines.id.at.the higher impairment threshold for loops reflects the fact that facilities have less capacity and generate less revenue thus making them less prone to deployment by clecs.id.at.loops are governed by the same implementation procedures that the commission employed for dedicated transport.see id.at if clecs that a loop meets the impairment thresholds,ilecs must offer immediate unbundled access and then litigate the issue before the state commissions.
fourth and finally,the commission concluded that ilecs no longer need to provide clecs with unbundled access to mass market local circuit switching mmls.see id.at.the fcc adopted transitional rules to wean clecs off the local circuit switching unes that are currently in use.specifically,the commission afforded clecs months to eliminate their reliance on unbundled mmls,id.at,and it increased the rates at which ilecs are compensated for unbundled local switching during the transitional period id.at.
numerous parties filed petitions for review.our review is governed by the classic framework from chevron usa natural resources defense council,d if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we must give effect to its unambiguously expressed intent on the other hand,if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we must defer to the commission interpretation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.ultimately,if the commission reading of the statute is reasonable,chevron requires us to accept the agency construction of the statute,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.
both the supreme court and our court have held that the act use of the term impair,d b,is ambiguous and should be reviewed under chevron second step.see at t iowa utils,d usta i,at.similarly,the commission reasonable interpretations of c are entitled to deference.usta ii,at.under the administrative procedure act,we will uphold the commission policy choices unless they are arbitrary and capricious.see a.to survive review under this standard,the fcc must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
in part ii below,we address and reject the ilecs two challenges to the order.in part iii,we address and reject the clecs three challenges to the order in part iv,we address and reject one miscellaneous argument raised by the new jersey division of the ratepayer advocate.
the ilecs raise two challenges to the order.first,the ilecs argue that the fcc unlawfully failed to consider the relevance of tsass in its unbundling analysis.second,the ilecs argue that the commission imposed impossibly high thresholds for assessing the state of competition in the market for loops and transport.we reject both claims.
the ilecs first argue that the commission unjustifiably concluded that it would be inappropriate to eliminate unes where clecs are able to compete using an incumbent lec tsass.order,at.the ilecs argue that to the extent tsass allow viable competition,the act impairment requirement is not met,d,and unbundling is not required.in the ilecs view,the commission conclusion to the contrary violates this court mandate from usta ii.pet.br.at.
we disagree.in usta ii,we reversed the fcc decision to make unes available to providers of wireless services where clecs use of tsass had allowed competition not only to survive but to flourish.usta ii,at.noting that the use of special access had spawned similarly robust competition in the market,we declared that the presence of robust competition by users of special access precludes a finding that clecs are impaired without unes in the wireless and markets.id.at.we therefore held 
that the commission impairment analysis must consider the availability of tariffed ilec special access services when determining whether entrants are impaired this of course still leaves the commission free to take into account such factors as administrability,risk of ilec abuse,and the like.what the commission may not do is compare unbundling only to or provisioning,arbitrarily excluding alternatives offered by the ilecs.
notwithstanding the ilecs arguments to the contrary,the holding does not apply with equal force to the local exchange markets.unlike the robust competition that special access services have spawned in the wireless and markets,the fcc found that competition in the local exchange markets is much more limited.order,at.nothing in usta ii specified how the commission should analyze the impact of special access services in markets where competition is less than robust.instead,we entrusted that task to the agency discretion and emphasized that the fcc was free to take into account such factors as administrability,risk of ilec abuse,and the like.usta ii,at.
on remand,the commission considered the viability of competition and concluded that even in cases where clecs currently compete using special access,a impairment inquiry would raise insurmountable hurdles regarding administrability order,at.the fcc found that such an inquiry would require the commission to examine all revenues a clec might hope to capture using the une or special access service at issue in a given market and to compare those potential revenues against every relevant state and federal tariff and every ilec retail and wholesale service offered in every market at issue for every element or service,taking into account all available term and volume discounts.id.at.adding to the complexity of this endeavor,the prices and terms governing special access vary greatly from market to market.id.at.given the nature of comparing tsass nationwide,the commission decided that evaluating the effect of special access on impairment in individual local markets would be excessively complicated and utterly impracticable,requiring resources far beyond those available to this commission.id.at.
moreover,the fcc found that a rule denying access to unes whenever tariffed alternatives are available would create an unacceptable risk of significant abuse by ilecs.id.at see also usta ii,at suggesting that on an appropriate record the commission might find impairment where the elimination of unes would pose a risk of ilec abuse in the tsas market.the commission found record evidence that the availability of unes serves to discipline special access rates by exercising a constraining influence on the ilecs ability to increase their tsas rates.order,at.indeed,in an unrelated proceeding,the ilecs acknowledged this was the case.see merger of sbc communications and at t,description of the transaction,public interest showing and related demonstrations,at.the commission therefore found that the elimination of unes would significantly risk increased special access pricing,undermining or destroying the ability to compete using tariffed alternatives.id.at see also pub.citizen.nhtsa,predictions regarding the actions of regulated entities are precisely the types of policy judgments that courts routinely and quite correctly leave to administrative agencies.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the commission analysis is reasonable.in contrast to the wireless and markets,carriers generally make only limited use of special access offerings to provide service in the local exchange services market.order,at.moreover,in accordance with our instructions from usta ii,the fcc tempered its consideration of competition by tak ing into account such factors as administrability,risk of ilec abuse,and the like.usta ii,at.thus,the commission consider ed the import of tsass in its impairment inquiry,and it provided a reasoned explanation for its decision not to eliminate unbundling solely on the basis of limited competition.chevron second step requires nothing more see,time warner entm t fcc,holding that when the commission is obligated to consider certain factors,t hat means only that the fcc must reach an express and considered conclusion about the bearing of a factor,but is not required to give any specific weight to it.citation omitted.
the ilecs second argument is that competition is viable and hence unbundling is both unnecessary and unlawful in wire centers that have far fewer business lines and collocators than required by the commission unbundling thresholds.see order,at id.at.the ilecs argue that usta i and usta ii require the fcc to deny unbundling not only in markets that are already extremely competitive,but also in markets where the evidence shows that clecs can compete without unes.pet.br.at emphasis in original see also usta ii,at noting the fcc must determine whether competition is possible without unbundling.however,in the ilecs view,the commission denied unbundling only in those markets that are experiencing extraordinary levels of competition,without considering the class of markets in which competition is possible without unes pet.br.at emphasis in original.
again,we disagree.notwithstanding the ilecs arguments to the contrary,the commission repeatedly justifies its unbundling determinations on the basis of both actual and potential competition.see,order,at the commission evaluate s impairment through a focus on wire centers,the of routes,in a manner that accounts for both actual and potential competition.id.the tests we adopt today are designed to capture both actual and potential competition,based on indicia of significant revenue opportunities at wire centers.id.at our approach here,though,is also consistent with usta ii instruction to make inferences about potential economic deployment on similarly situated routes for example,even if a particular tier wire center exhibits few or no competitive fiber facilities,the fact that other wire centers displaying similar economic characteristics tend to be the site of more significant competitive facilities deployment will serve as the basis for a reasonable inference that the wire center in question could potentially support such deployment.id.at we have weighed carefully a variety of actual competitive indicia for determining impairment and determine that the best and most readily administered indicator of the potential for competitive deployment is the presence of collocators in a wire center.id.w e conclude that applying the transport thresholds will better capture actual and potential deployment than any single measure.id.at collocation and business line density measure the potential revenues available from a wire center.wire centers that are rich in potential revenues will be counted similarly,capturing areas in which intermodal and intramodal competitors alike have incentives to deploy transmission facilities.id.at w e reject mci proposal for measuring impairment because we find that it fails to account for areas of potential deployment,or to make any significant inferences of potential competition.id.at o ur test will capture relatively smaller wire centers that,through collocation,display signs of significant potential revenues.id.at defining tier,tier,and tier wire centers based on indicia of the potential revenues and suitability for competitive transport deployment id.at tier wire centers are those characterized by very significant competitive facilities presence or potential,as measured by collocation and business lines.id.at the commission eliminates unbundling requirements in tier and tier wire centers for transport because,due to the potential revenues available at the level,we find that scale economies sometimes are sufficient to recover the fixed and sunk costs of deploying transport facilities id.at our choice of the wire center service area as the appropriate level of geographic granularity at which to assess requesting carriers impairment without access to loops is grounded on usta ii mandate that the commission consider not only actual competition within a given market,but also potential competition within that market.emphases in original id.at the commission rejects a impairment inquiry because that approach is flawed by its failure to draw reasonable inferences from actual deployment regarding potential deployment.emphasis in original id.at h igh business line counts and the presence of collocators,when evaluated in conjunction with one another,are likely to correspond with actual of clecs loops or to indicate where deployment would be economic and potential deployment likely.id.at while the evidence does not and could not reveal a precise,immutable relationship between actual and potential deployment of loops on the one hand,and the numbers of business lines and collocators on the other hand,we adopt these proxies because they best minimize and balance any and.
notwithstanding the foregoing mountain of references,the ilecs argue that the fcc paid mere lip service to the potential for competition in the markets for both transport and loops.we reject both claims.
the ilecs complain that the commission granted exceedingly narrow transport relief.pet.br.at.ironically,however,the commission eliminated unbundling for transport in more wire centers than the ilecs proposed.specifically,the ilecs the fcc proposal to eliminate transport unbundling between wire centers that contain one or more collocators.see order,at.the commission concluded that the ilecs proposal would underestimate the potential for competitive deployment and that unbundling was warranted for transport between wire centers that contained zero collocators.see id.eliminating unbundling in wire centers with zero collocators if those wire centers have a significant number of business lines,which indicate the presence of significant potential revenues.
to be sure,the commission chosen thresholds for and for are higher than the ilecs would have liked.however,as the commission explained,the alternative thresholds proffered by the ilecs were too an empirical support consistent competitive deployment.see id.at.given the fact that the commission has wide discretion to determine where to draw administrative lines,at t fcc,and given the inevitability of some in the commission unbundling rules,usta ii,at emphasis in original,we have been generally unwilling to review performed by the commission unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines drawn are patently unreasonable,having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.cassell fcc,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,the commission applied its transport thresholds in a disjunctive tandem that is,there is no impairment if the wire centers meet either the business line or the collocation metrics.order,at.because complementary tests will capture markets with significant potential revenues and thus,the potential for further competitive,the commission concluded that a disjunctive test will better capture actual and potential deployment than any single measure.id.this analysis clearly bears some relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.as a result,we deny the ilecs petition for review of the commission transport thresholds.
the ilecs challenge to the commission unbundling of loops is equally unavailing.again,the fcc chose to assess loop impairment at the level because wire centers provide the best evidence of not only actual competition within a given market,but also potential competition within that market.id.at emphases in original.again,the ilecs complain that the fcc removed loop unbundling obligations only in a tiny subset of wire centers where there is evidence of extreme competition.pet.br.at.and again,we disagree.
after surveying the economic realities surrounding loop deployment,the commission decided to apply its loop thresholds in conjunction with one another that is,there is no impairment if a wire center meets both the business line and the collocation metrics.order,at.the fcc concluded that a conjunctive application of the thresholds would best minimize and balance any and in its unbundling inquiry.id.at.similarly,after surveying the economic differences between and loops,the fcc unbundled fewer of the latter than the former because economic conditions surrounding competitive deployment of loops permit more optimistic inferences regarding potential deployment in the context of loops that would not be appropriate in the context of loops.id.moreover,because it is generally economic to a loop when demand nears two of capacity to a particular location,the fcc imposed a limit on.id.at.
by contrast,the commission ordered wider unbundling of loops because t he record before us indicates that clecs typically do not provision loops id.at.in light of evidence that clecs generally provide service by channelizing a bigger loop,the commission denie d unbundled access to loops only in the areas served by wire centers where clecs actually have deployed,or will deploy,competitive facilities at the capacity level or higher,creating the potential for clecs to channelize those facilities to offer service at the capacity level.id.at.because it is generally more efficient for a clec to a and channelize it,if necessary rather than use ten or more,the commission imposed a limit on.id.at.
instead of attacking the fcc thresholds or loop caps,the ilecs simply lament that the commission eliminated unbundling only in those markets that are experiencing extraordinary levels of competition.pet.br.at.of course,the levels of competition in areas where competition is thriving at extraordinary levels are irrelevant for purposes of the ilecs petition for review.the real question is whether the commission ignored evidence of competition either actual or potential in impaired areas.after conducting a thorough analysis of the economic realities surrounding loop deployment,the fcc concluded that some of the wire centers identified by the ilecs alternative unbundling thresholds exhibit indicia of impairment because they do not generally exhibit extensive competitive fiber deployment,and do not offer sufficient revenue opportunities to incent such deployment.order,at.tellingly,the ilecs never claim much less show that competition exists below the commission loop thresholds.pet.br.at claiming competition exists below the commission transport thresholds.
congress gave the the petitioners or this in regulatory.the mere fact that the commission exercise of its discretion resulted in a line that the ilecs would have drawn differently is not sufficient to make it unlawful.the fcc with the loop that the commission confront ed the issue of the costs and benefits of unbundling and ma d e reasonable between allowing unbundling where it is necessary and eliminating unbundling where it is not.usta i,at.we have never required anything more.nor do we today.
while the ilecs want less unbundling of loops and transport trunks,the clecs want more.to that end,the clecs raise three arguments.first,the clecs argue that they are universally impaired without unbundled access to loops,loops,and transport.second,the clecs argue that they are universally impaired without unbundled access to mass market local switching.third,the clecs argue that the commission transitional rules for implementing the order are arbitrary and capricious.we reject all three claims.
the clecs first argue that it is economically impossible and wasteful for to supply loops and transport trunks where the ilecs have already deployed them.because these fundamental economic facts do not vary across markets,the clecs argue that the commission unbundling thresholds are unlawfully high.pet.br.at.the clecs mount separate challenges to the commission analysis for loops,loops,and transport.we address each in turn.
in the clecs view,the commission erred by restricting the unbundling of loops.given the fcc finding that clecs can not deploy loops on an economic basis,order,at,the clecs conclude that they must be impaired in and thus entitled to unbundling of loops nationwide.
we disagree.usta i and usta ii require a nuanced application of a granular impairment standard,which incorporates competitive variations within and across markets.the clecs appear to recognize this fact.see,pet.br.at.nonetheless,the clecs advocate the most and impairment finding,a nationwide unbundling the fact that we vacated the clecs proffered alternative in usta ii.see at see also iowa,at.holding the commission can not order blanket unbundling because the act requires the fcc to apply some limiting standard,rationally related to the goals of the act emphasis in original usta i,at criticizing the fcc decision to adopt a uniform national rule,mandating an element unbundling in every geographic market.
in the order before us,the fcc rejected a nationwide unbundling reasonably so.instead of a blanket impairment finding,the fcc adopted a nuanced standard,which assesses impairment vel non at the wire center level and imposes caps on unbundling in markets in which the prevalence of unes suggests that competition is viable the commission standard uses market data to predict when and where the clecs will be economically able to deploy their own facilities,thus obviating the need for unes.we think this balancing act is reasonable.
as a fallback position,the clecs argue that impairment should be assessed on a as opposed to a wire center basis.however,after chronicling extensive record evidence,the commission concluded that a approach would be an administrative nightmare,a font of endless litigation,and an ineffective metric of impairment.see order,at.
even if the clecs approach were not riddled with empirical flaws and administrability problems,the fact that there are other solutions to a problem is irrelevant provided that the option selected by the fcc is not irrational.ass of commc ns l,fcc,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the fcc need not demonstrate that it has made the only acceptable decision,but rather that it has based its decision on a reasoned analysis supported by the evidence before the commission.id.at emphasis in original.i f the commission has offered a reasoned explanation for its choice between competing approaches supported by the record,the court is not free to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.id.
here,the commission has offered a reasoned explanation.the fcc explained that it chose to focus on wire centers,collocation,and business line density because those variables are objective,easily verifiable,and highly correlated with both extant and potential levels of competition.see order,at.this explanation easily qualifies as rational,reasonable,and.
even if the fcc explained its standard,the clecs argue,that standard is nonetheless divorced from economic reality.in the clecs view,t here is absolutely no evidence to substantiate the purported correlation between competition and the level of fiber collocation and business line density within a wire center.pet.br.at.moreover,the clecs argue that even if collocation can reasonably predict competition in enterprise markets,it is still insufficiently granular to predict competition for consumers.id.at.
again,the clecs argument is wide of the mark.as we have previously held,collocation can reasonably serve as a measure of competition in a given market,particularly where it is superior to the various alternatives proposed by petitioners.worldcom,fcc.here,the clecs offer no alternative save a painstaking analysis of market conditions.id.emphasis added.for example,the clecs argue that the fcc impairment analysis should incorporate operational or structural impediments,pet.br.at,which are specific to the customer location within a building,order,at emphasis added.such a suggestion takes the concept of granularity to an unrealistic extreme it defies common usta ii require the commission to conduct individualized inquiries into the economic particularities of each floor within each building served by the millions of loops nationwide.see usta ii,at holding the fcc is free to take into account such factors as administrability in its impairment inquiry.under these circumstances,the commission is justified in its reliance upon what is an admittedly imperfect measure of competition.worldcom,at.
finally,even if the order properly accounts for economic reality,the clecs claim that the commission arbitrarily turn ed around and ignore d its own reasonably efficient competitor standard in its refusal to unbundle loops.in the clecs view,the order relies on a clec holding a fiber transmission network,pet.br.at,notwithstanding the fact that the commission reasonably efficient competitor standard do es not presume that a hypothetical entrant possesses any particular assets.order,at.
the clecs either misunderstand or misconstrue the fcc ruling.the order does not presume that a particular clec possesses a fiber transmission network.rather,the fcc presumes that under certain economic conditions,it would be financially possible and attractive for a reasonably efficient clec to deploy facilities.and where a reasonably efficient clec can economically deploy its own facilities,the fcc concludes,all clecs are not impaired.
at first blush,it might seem a little harsh to eliminate unbundling for all clecs where one or more has demonstrated the economic feasibility of competing without unes.however,as the commission explained,clecs can use tsass and other wholesale facilities as a to enter or expand into new markets.id.at.and the clecs assertion that the wholesale supply of loops is extremely limited,pet.br.at,is belied by the clecs own evidence confirming that they are able to purchase wholesale capacity to serve a customer.order,at.the ilecs corroborated the clecs concessions with respect to the availability of loops at wholesale prices.see ex parte letter from evan leo to marlene dortch,tbl,joint appendix declaration of claire beth nogay on behalf of verizon,exh.in the face of evidence that clecs services without unes,there is nothing unlawful about the fcc refusal to order unbundling.
the clecs next argue that the commission erred by restricting the unbundling of loops.in a single footnote,the clecs attempt to incorporate by reference all of their arguments to apply equally to single loops.pet.br.at.this reference is insufficient to raise the issue.see sugar cane growers.of florida veneman,on appeal,appellants failed to raise their footnote at the end of their opening brief does not suffice.hutchins dist.of columbia,en banc we need not consider cursory arguments made only in a footnote.
the clecs only viable challenge is their argument that the fcc proxies are an insufficient indicator of competitive deployment.pet.br.at.however,the clecs base their attack entirely on the alleged paucity of extant competition.see id.at t he record plainly shows that the number of buildings where clecs have deployed facilities is minuscule.because we have held that unbundling may be appropriate only after the commission considers the potential for future competition,see usta ii,at,the clecs complaints that current deployment is minuscule are wide of the mark.we therefore deny the petition for review with respect to loops.
the clecs next argue that the commission erred by restricting the unbundling of transport.in light of the same record evidence that informed the commission impairment analysis for loops,the fcc found that clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to transport on routes between tier wire centers.see order,at id.at.the clecs challenge to this conclusion is feeble they do not dispute that wire centers provide a perfectly reasonable metric to gauge transport impairment,pet.br.at,nor do they dispute that competitive transport is or can be between tier wire centers,order,at.nor do the clecs dispute that those competitive transport facilities can be channelized to provide transport at the level.see id.at.instead,the clecs argue that the commission impairment inquiry was based solely on the unfounded prediction that a wholesale market for transport might develop.pet.br.at.
the clecs characterization of the commission inquiry is inaccurate.after finding empirical proof that more than of wire centers above the threshold can attract four or more collocators,see order,at nn,the commission inferred that it was possible that competitors can deploy transport facilities to the remainder of the wire centers above this business line threshold,id.at emphasis added.thus,the commission did not focus solely on the availability of wholesale fact,the fcc impairment inquiry centered on the potential for clecs to transport.we therefore deny the petition for review with respect to transport.
the clecs second challenge pertains to the commission decision not to require unbundled access to local switching.see order,at.local switching is the equivalent of a switchboard operator computerized switches route a signal from a caller to a receiver.mass market switching refers to phone calls made by or to residential consumers as opposed to enterprise switching,which refers to calls made by or to business customers.in the order,the commission declined to order unbundling in mmls.the by national association of state utility consumer advocates nasuca and the new jersey division of the ratepayer advocate njdra petition for review.we discuss and reject each petitioner claims separately.
first,we reject the clecs challenge to the commission ruling on mmls.the clec petitioners argue that a nationwide finding must be vacated because it is insufficiently granular.however,the mere fact that the commission eliminated unbundling across the board does not make it unlawful the granularity criterion does not require the fcc to manufacture regulatory variation where the record does not support it.see usta ii,at holding the commission need only adopt a granular rule if there is evidence that markets vary decisively by reference to the fcc impairment criteria.
on the record before it,the commission reasonably concluded that clecs are not impaired without unbundled access to mmls.in light of the fact that clecs have deployed their own switches in of the ilecs wire centers across the country,and in light of the fact that clecs are deploying switches that have higher capacity and wider geographic reach than the old switches employed by the ilecs,order,at,the record suggests that it is neither uneconomic nor wasteful for clecs to deploy their own switches,usta ii,at.while other parts of the ilecs networks might remain bottleneck facilities,the clecs widespread deployment of switching technology suggests competition is possible without unbundled switches.id.at see also order,at noting that clecs are currently combining their own switching and the ilecs unbundled loops to serve mass market customers in of the nation largest metropolitan statistical areas.moreover,the commission prior impairment finding was based solely on the technical difficulties associated with connecting clecs switches with the ilecs networks a process termed hot cutting.see triennial review order,at.here,however,the commission found and the clecs do not dispute that the ilecs have made vast improvements in their hot cut procedures,thus making it easier and more financially attractive than ever for clecs to deploy their own switches.order,at.
confronted with this record of competitive switch deployment,the clecs failed to offer any explanations or contrary evidence.the clecs insist that the commission unduly focused on improvements in hot cuts while ignoring other impairments faced by clecs attempting to serve the mass market with their own switches.pet.br.at.however,the clecs do not offer an explanation for what these other impairments might be.the clecs also failed to offer evidence that it is uneconomic to serve mass market customers with switches that were originally deployed to serve enterprise customers.see order,at.moreover,the clecs did not rebut the evidence of commenters showing that clecs in many markets have recognized that carriers could not compete with,and therefore have made their business strategy.id.at.given that is a completely synthetic form of competition,usta i,at,the commission reasonably eliminated switch unbundling.see usta ii,at,noting that the fcc may reasonably use its at a minimum authority under d to encourage clecs to invest compete own facilities.therefore,we deny the clecs petition for review.
second,we reject nasuca challenge to the commission ruling on mmls.the association argues that the ilecs have conceded impairment in some mmls markets by submitting evidence of in others.pet.br.at.that is,nasuca argues that the ilecs should suffer a negative inference for each of the markets for which the incumbents did not submit data.
nasuca argument is without support in the relevant caselaw.usta i and usta ii make clear that the burden of persuasion rests on the shoulders of the party that urges the commission to find impairment.see usta i,at usta ii,at.and the rationale for our conclusion is simple the plain text of d permits unbundling only where the commission receives evidence that unes are necessary to prevent impair ment of the clecs competitive aspirations.thus,the act does not obligate the ilecs to prove forces the clecs to prove impairment.
in this case,there was no evidence of impairment in mmls markets.the only evidence before the fcc provided by the ilecs suggested switches are significantly deployed on a competitive basis.usta i,at see order,at.nasuca offers nothing to suggest otherwise.nor does it dispute that the sole basis for the fcc prior impairment finding namely,the costliness of hot cuts is no longer an issue.given the lopsided record,the commission reasonably declined to find impairment.therefore,we deny nasuca petition for review.
finally,we reject njdra challenge to the commission ruling on mmls.the ratepayer advocate argues that the commission analytical construct for assessing mass market impairment namely,the reasonably efficient competitor not a logi
