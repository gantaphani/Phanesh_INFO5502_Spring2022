guangdong yihua timber industry,yihua,appeals a final judgment of the court of international trade that sustained the latest results following three previous remands reached by the united states department of commerce in a review of antidumping duties imposed on wooden bedroom furniture imported from the people republic of china.the american furniture manufacturers committee for legal trade and vaughanbassett furniture company,together,afmc,crossappeal.for the reasons set out below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
in,commerce issued an order imposing antidumping duties on wooden bedroom furniture from the people republic of china.wooden bedroom furniture from the people republic of china.dep t commerce.on march,acting under a,commerce initiated its third administrative review of the duties.wooden bedroom furniture from the people republic of china.dep t commerce,notice of administrative review.the review covered imports during.commerce published its preliminary results on february.wooden bedroom furniture from the people republic of china.dep t commerce,preliminary results.
as authorized by the statute in the case of china,commerce,in calculating dumping margins,sought to estimate production costs of the merchandise at issue by using surrogate values from a comparable market economy.a a i in review of antidumping duty,commerce must determine normal value of the merchandise at issue c for a nonmarket economy country,commerce may determine normal value based on factors of production in a comparable market economy country.in its preliminary results,commerce determined the value for wood inputs into the furniture,including lumber,by using data from the philippines national statistics office nso,which listed imports of wood into the philippines by volume in cubic decimeters and value,resulting in figures for various kinds of wood.preliminary results.at.commerce relied on financial statements from five philippine companies,including diretso design furniture,to determine values for overhead,for selling,general,and administrative expenses,and for profit.id.at.
yihua,a chinese company that manufactures wooden furniture imported into the united states,filed comments on the preliminary results,challenging commerce reliance on the nso data and on diretso design financial statements.with respect to the nso data for wood inputs,yihua contended that certain anomalies rendered the data unreliable,and it proposed that commerce use data on imports into the philippines available from the world trade atlas wta,which gave figures.with respect to diretso design,yihua contended that there were multiple diretso entities and that the diretso company whose financial statements commerce used was not the same company as the diretso company that commerce found to be comparable to yihua.
in its final results,commerce agreed with yihua regarding the issue but not the diretso issue.wooden bedroom furniture from the people republic of china.dep t commerce,final results,amended by.commerce agreed with yihua that the nso figures were unreliable,and it adopted the wta figures in their place.final results.at wooden bedroom furniture from the people republic of china,issue and decision memorandum for the final results of the antidumping duty administrative and new shipper reviews,dep t commerce.as to diretso,commerce relied on the financial statements of the same five companies it had used for the preliminary results including diretso design,but also included the financial statements of three additional companies.final results.at.
interested parties brought six separate challenges in the trade court,which consolidated them for convenience.lifestyle,united states,case.int l trade,ecf consolidation order.upon plaintiffs and defendants motions for judgment on the agency record,the trade court remanded the case for commerce to explain why it used the wta data,rather than the nso data,citing patent complications with using gross weight data with wood inputs.lifestyle,united states,d.int l trade lifestyle i.the trade court also directed commerce to redetermine on remand whether the financial statements of diretso design were from the correct company.id.at.
on remand,in its first redetermination results,commerce continued use of the wta data,as in the final results,but discontinued use of diretso design financial statements.final results of redetermination pursuant to remand,dep t commerce,ecf.commerce explained that it found the nso import data to be unreliable because importers into the philippines were required to report weight and value,but not necessarily volume,and when an importer did not report volume,the philippine nso filled in a volume figure using a standard conversion factor a number stated with three decimal places based on an assumed wood density of kilograms per cubic meter.id.at.commerce found that the record demonstrate d that a significant portion of the data were based on standard conversions from gross weight data regardless of the fact that they cover different types of wood.id.commerce observed that the same conversion was used in more than percent of the relevant transactions and found it highly unlikely that actual conversions would be the same to three decimal points for different types of wood imported from different countries.id.commerce also found that the assumed density of kilograms per cubic meter significantly exceeded the densities of the wood that yihua timber used.id.at.
although commerce acknowledged that the weightbased figures were also imperfect for valuing the lumber inputs,commerce found the data to be more reliable for the veneer and plywood inputs,and it found some value in using a consistent data source for all the wood inputs veneer,plywood,and lumber.accordingly,commerce decided to maintain its reliance on the weightbased wta data for valuing all the wood inputs,including lumber.commerce also decided to reverse its original decision regarding the use of diretso design financial statements it excluded those statements from the surrogate financial ratio calculations.
on review,the trade court found that the record clearly demonstrates that the use of data understates the wood input surrogate value because the,wood yihua uses would command a higher price per kilogram and yield more cubic meters of wood per kilogram than green wood.lifestyle,united states,d.int l trade lifestyle ii.because it could be presumed that the import data for lumber included imports of green wood,the trade court concluded,use of data to value the lumber imports places an artificially low value on the wood used by yihua timber because the inclusion of content wood and wood that lacks the value added from the process depresses the surrogate value.id.at the trade court remanded for commerce either to use the data in the record or to expand the record.id.at.the trade court affirmed commerce decision to exclude diretso design financial last determination on that issue.id.at.
in its second redetermination results,commerce,under protest,used the nso data,rather than reopen the record.see lifestyle,united states,d.int l trade lifestyle iii.commerce rejected yihua contention that,if the import data could not be used,commerce should either the record or rely on other data in the record either information from the department of agriculture about prices of wood exports to the philippines or information about prices at which certain hardwood lumber was sold in the philippines.final results of redetermination pursuant to second remand,dep t commerce june,ecf see lifestyle iii,d at.on review,the trade court rejected yihua argument and affirmed commerce second redetermination results with respect to the valuation of the wood inputs.id.at 
the trade court entered the identical judgment not only on the docket of the consolidated case,in the trade court,but also on the docket of each of the consolidated cases,including,the case that yihua initiated.yihua appeals the judgment insofar as it affirms the final valuation of the wood inputs using the nso data,while afmc the judgment insofar as it affirms commerce decision not to rely on diretso design financial s
