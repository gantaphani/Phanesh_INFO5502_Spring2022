this appeal concerns the proper classification of a textile product imported by value vinyls.the question is whether the court of international trade correctly concluded that the imported product,whose textile component is made entirely of fibers,is a product with textile components in which fibers predominate by weight over any other single textile fiber and hence is classified under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus,or whether,as the government argues,this category does not include product made entirely of fibers.we conclude that the court of international trade correctly classified the subject goods.

the htsus is organized by chapters,which encompass broad subject matter categories headings,which set forth particular classes of merchandise and subheadings,which further separate goods within each class.see orlando food united states.following the general rules of interpretation gri of the htsus,the classification of merchandise is determined according to the terms of the headings and subheadings and any relevant section or chapter notes.see id.at.

all agree that value vinyls product satisfies the overall weight criterion of heading,and the seventy percent plastics threshold of.the question is whether the textile definition fibers predominate by weight over any other single textile fiber includes textiles made entirely of fibers.
the government argues that the word predominate requires two or more components,and thus can not apply to a situation where only one fiber is present.thus the government argues that value vinyls goods can not be included in,and must instead be placed in the other of subheading.the government cites several dictionary definitions of the word predominate in support of this argument,but its chief support comes from an earlier decision of the court of international trade,which interpreted the word predominate in the way the government proposes,albeit for different goods in a different subheading of a different chapter of the htsus.in semperit industrial products,united states.int l trade,the court held that the plaintiff industrial conveyor belt products made with vulcanized rubber combined with textiles made entirely of fibers are properly classified under htsus subheading.the government argues that the court adopted the plain meaning of predominate in semperit,and that this settled meaning must apply throughout the htsus,rendering it not only unnecessary but improper for the court to redefine the term for the htsus subheading that applies to value vinyls goods.
the court of international trade explained that it had found the language of ambiguous,and resorted to the legislative history including the conversion history to resolve that ambiguity,and to ensure that it reached the correct result.the court also recognized that the semperit definition did not control the different htsus categories here at issue,and in all events is not binding precedent.see d l supply united states.int l trade,t he court notes that it is not bound by a decision of another judge of the same court,although such a decision may be persuasive precedent.the court recognized that its ultimate obligation was to find the correct result,by whatever procedure is best suited to the case at hand.jarvis clark united states.the court then independently analyzed the tariff provisions relevant to the value vinyls goods.
the court of international trade found the history of conversion from the corresponding class in the prior tariff schedule of the united states tsus to be particularly enlightening as to whether congress intended to exclude textiles made wholly of fibers from the scope of htsus subheading.the court observed that goods with textiles made wholly of fibers had previously been included in the predecessor to.after assessing the relevant history and other indicia of statutory intent,the court concluded that the imported goods,with textile components made wholly of fibers,are within subheading,and that the other of subheading includes textiles with a less than predominant amount of fibers.
we conclude that the court of international trade correctly determined the meaning of predominate in the context of subheading.see generally helvering stockholms enskilda bank.the intention of the lawmaker is to be ascertained,not by taking the word or clause in question from its setting and viewing it apart,but by considering it in connection with the context,the general purposes of the statute in which it is found,the occasion and circumstances of its use,and other appropriate tests for the ascertainment of the legislative will.the history of conversion from the tsus to the htsus makes especially clear that there was no substantive change intended in the scope of the tsus subheading when converted to the htsus subheading now at issue.whatever generality of meaning is borne by the word predominate,the history of the relevant provisions shows that the fibers predominate by weight provision includes textiles made wholly of fibers.
the conversion report issued by the international trade commission,the cognizant agency,states that htsus subheading corresponds to the former tsus subheading,which covered fabrics whose textile component was made of fibers.the government agrees that tsus subheading encompassed value vinyls goods.in contrast,the conversion report states that htsus subheading corresponds to tsus subheading and some other provisions not relevant here.the structure of these corresponding tsus subheadings was as follows,with emphasis added
