it has been said that bad credit is like a scarlet letter.as americans reliance on credit has increased,credit repair clinics have emerged,preying on individuals desperate to improve their credit records.these organizations typically promise they can have any negative information removed permanently from any credit report for a fee.on september,congress enacted the credit repair organizations act cro act,to ensure that the clinics provide potential customers with the information needed to decide whether to employ the services of such an organization and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.b.

relevant statutes 
fair credit reporting act 
for over thirty years,congress has sought to balance the need of creditors for accurate credit information with consumers interests in accuracy and fair use of such data.in,congress passed the fair credit reporting act with the express purpose of requiring consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit,personnel,insurance,and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy,relevancy,and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.b consumer reporting agencies cras like trans union,experian,and equifax must exercise care in accurately and completely reporting credit information.the fcra limits the length of time that a cra is permitted to report an adverse item of information.generally,bankruptcies may be reported for ten years all other negative information can remain on a report for up to seven years.a.older items are referred to as obsolete.
the fcra sets forth a procedure for disputing the completeness or accuracy of an item and obtaining a reinvestigation.when a consumer notifies a cra of a disputed item,that agency has days to reinvestigate free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information,or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph,before the end of the period.a a upon the creditor certification that the questioned information is accurate,the cra can reinsert the information in the consumer file.a a.although the fcra does not mandate reinsertion,the cra duty to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates effectively compels this result.
throughout the,congress attempted to address problems resulting from the continued growth of the credit reporting industry.in senate report,concerning the consumer reporting reform act of,the committee on banking,housing and urban affairs noted that the industry maintains million credit files on individual consumers and processes almost billion pieces of data per month,at,wl.as the industry grew,so did the inaccuracies.from to,the federal trade commission received more complaints regarding consumer reporting agencies than any other industry.id.at.meanwhile,cras had ventured into new areas,creat ing and sell ing lists of consumers for general direct marketing solicitations not initiated by the consumer and,through a process known as prescreening,sell ing more refined lists of credit worthy borrowers for creditors who use the information to extend offers of credit to such borrowers.id.
b.the credit repair organizations act 
enter the credit repair clinic.congress had recognized the abuses by many of the newly emerging credit repair clinics well before it finally enacted the cro act in.in,representative frank annunzio described these businesses as kin to get rich quick schemes.they promise fast results and newfound wealth in the form of available credit.cong.rec.daily ed.august,statement of annunzio,wl.the house report on the consumer reporting reform act of,the immediate predecessor to the act passed in,explained further 
t hese credit repair businesses,through advertisements and oral representations,lead consumers to believe that adverse information in their consumer reports can be deleted or modified regardless of its accuracy however,accurate,adverse information may be reported for years,or in the case of bankruptcy,years.therefore,such representations by credit repair clinics are often misleading 
where credit repair clinics do succeed,however,they often do so through abuse of the reinvestigation procedures consumer reporting agencies must generally delete information that can not be verified within days of receiving notice of the dispute.credit repair clinics take advantage of this provision by inundating consumer reporting agencies with so many challenges to consumer reports that the reinvestigation system breaks down,and the adverse,but accurate,information is deleted.
wl.thus,the cro act express purposes are twofold to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services and to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.b.
the cro act became effective on april.of the prohibited practices listed in the cro act,three are involved in the instant appeal sections a,a,and b.section a prohibits any person from 
mak ing any statement,or counsel ing or advis ing any consumer to make any statement,which is untrue or misleading or which,upon the exercise of reasonable care,should be known by the credit repair organization,officer,employee,agent,or other person to be untrue or misleading with respect to any consumer credit worthiness sic,credit standing,or credit capacity to a any consumer reporting agency 
a.section a prohibits any person from mak ing or us ing any untrue or misleading representation of the services of the credit repair organization.finally,section b provides that n o credit repair organization may charge or receive any money or other valuable consideration for the performance of any service which the credit repair organization has agreed to perform for any consumer before such service is fully performed.b emphasis added.
a violation of the cro act is to be treated as a violation of the ftc act.b.
c.the federal trade commission act 
section of the ftc act,a,has long prohibited u nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce,and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.section a empowers the ftc to prevent such acts or practices.a.an act or practice is deceptive if first,there is a representation,omission,or practice that,second,is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,and third,the representation,omission,or practice is material.ftc pantron i,cir quoting and adopting standard in cliffdale.
factual and procedural background 
defendant keith gill is licensed to practice law in california and works as a sole practitioner as the law offices of keith gill.in addition to a general legal practice,beginning in,gill has offered credit repair services to consumers,ostensibly through his law office,but in reality through defendant richard murkey.defendants have used telephones,the mail,and radio to advertise their credit repair services to consumers.under the cro act,the law offices of keith gill qualifies as a credit repair organization.
most consumers signed contracts with gill law office,and both gill and murkey testified that they considered every consumer who signs a retainer agreement with the gill law office to be gill client.gill testified that his relationship with murkey is governed by a written contract between the two.
from at least to,defendant richard murkey operated a credit repair business under the auspices and out of the offices of defendant gill law offices in woodland hills,california murkey never registered his credit repair business with the state of california or posted a bond,as required by california civil code b,ostensibly because he operated out of gill offices attorneys are exempt from the registration requirement.
to reach potential credit repair clients,defendants used radio broadcasts,newspaper ads,telephone conversations,and personal meetings throughout the united states.during and,murkey appeared regularly on a radio talk program broadcast throughout most of southern california,discussing credit restoration.the format resembled a talk show,and when murkey was not available,stations replayed the tapes,rather like a radio infomercial.he told consumers that any sort of negative information,including accurate and not obsolete information,could legally be removed from a consumer credit report,notably,through the use of defendants services.murkey repeated the telephone and facsimile numbers and encouraged consumers to call for a free credit evaluation or further information.examples of claims made during the broadcasts include 
there literally is nothing a consumer can possibly have on a credit report that we can not remove and we can remove it legally.
there are many legal ways under the federal fair credit reporting act to fix credit,no matter what type of negative it is,including foreclosure and or bankruptcy,judgments,tax liens even if those items are not paid off.
because of the federal laws and the consumers rights under the federal laws,we still have legal rights as consumers and we can,in fact,knowing the right proper techniques and strategies and procedures that we have perfected in our offices over the years,we can legally remove those negatives from someone credit report.
it does make a difference what type of negative information you have we have files in our offices verifying that we can legally remove bankruptcies,foreclosures,what they call short pays in the real estate community,judgments,tax liens,surrenders,repossessions,defaulted student loans,settlements,collections and even late accounts for child support it does not make a difference if that item was legally put on there or not and to us it does make a difference if you still owe money.
no matter what kind of negative you can possibly have,there are legal ways to take those items off your credit report and that can be done even without you paying off that account.even tax liens or judgments can be removed from your report legally without you having to pay that charge.it does get you off the liability,however,but it does,in fact,legally remove it from your credit report.
most likely,in our offices,we can clean your credit in six weeks to two months.
beginning in february,murkey program was broadcast over cable radio network,which could be heard in,among other places,rhode island,florida,kentucky,new york,new jersey,arizona,nevada,and possibly texas.
murkey and those working for him made similar representations to consumers via telephone.for example,murkey told an ftc employee we can legally remove those bankruptcies and any other accounts that you have and i have files in my offices to verify it.murkey told another ftc employee under the federal laws,there are a lot of legal ways to take negative items off someone credit report.and since it under federal law,we can help anyone in the united states.murkey added and we can take off bankruptcies from your credit report.we got credit reports all over the place showing anything that you possibly can have.one consumer reported that murkey said that any negative item could be removed from my credit report.murkey told another consumer that murkey could get every negative off the report,including late pays,bankruptcy,the divorce,all of it.yet another consumer was told he would receive an improved credit report.when nothing happened,and he called defendants offices to complain,the consumer was told again that all the negatives on his reports would be removed.
murkey representations were no different.consumers were told that for a nominal fee,based on the number and type of negative items,the negative information would be removed from their credit report in a matter of weeks or a few months defendants deliberately did not ask,however,whether a negative item on a consumer credit report was accurate or complete.
murkey generally handled the initial consultation with prospective clients and made the payment arrangements.he explained the manner in which he could assist them in having negative information removed from a credit report,offered to show them results he had obtained for others,and explained the costs for his services.although no services were performed during the initial free consultation,defendants sought advanced payment of between and of the estimated costs of the services.defendants generally gave consumers a written estimate based on a fee schedule,with each negative item listed separately.at that point,murkey would negotiate the real fee.after consumers made the down payment,defendants billed them on a regular basis,regardless of whether the services had been completed.
in fact,defendants legal process for removing negative information from their clients credit reports was premised on the obligation of credit reporting agencies cras to respond to all consumer disputes within days.as set forth above,cras must remove any legitimately challenged item that they can not verify within the day period.a a.if the cra does verify the item,even after days have passed,it can and generally will restore the item to the credit report.
defendants credit repair services consisted almost exclusively of inundating the credit reporting agencies with dispute letters,sent in the consumer name,which falsely alleged that various items on the credit report were incorrect or that a particular account did not belong to the consumer.consumers did not review or approve any of these letters and have stated that they did not authorize defendants to provide false information to the cras.defendants letters did generate large volumes of correspondence from cras to the clients,however,which created the impression that defendants were performing as promised.many of the clients did not discover right away that defendants efforts failed to produce the promised results,however,in part because defendants had instructed their clients to forward these communications directly to defendants.when the clients learned that their credit report problems had not been resolved,they tried contacting murkey,who rarely responded.murkey nevertheless continued to bill the consumers.
although he was not the one interacting with the clients,gill had full access to anything in murkey office and reviewed correspondence with consumers that murkey sent out.gill also had the ability to communicate with credit reporting agencies and the right to review any matter related to the credit repair business.in written discovery responses,moreover,gill stated that both defendants provided credit repair services to clients.after agreeing upon the fee,he responded,the client retained defendant gill to perform credit repair services.in response to the interrogatory requesting the manner in which gill supervise s defendant murkey and all persons working with defendant murkey with respect to the performance of credit repair services,gill stated 
together,gill and murkey consult with each other as to any credit repair service issues that may arise.under gill supervision,murkey ordinarily handles the credit repair issues.emphasis added.
gill also listed just murkey and himself as the persons who answered or responded to letters from customers,law enforcement entities,or others complaining to defendant murkey or gill about the credit repair services rendered by gill or defendant murkey.although they had no procedure whereby murkey gets a complaint and he has to tell gill about one of your clients is complaining sic,gill testified that they talked several times a week,so gill was pretty much aware.
the ftc filed this action against gill and murkey on march,in the district court for the central district of california,seeking a permanent injunction and consumer redress.the commission asserted three claims violation of the cro act by charging clients for services that were not fully performed violation of the cro act by making untrue or misleading statements to induce consumers to purchase their services and violation of the ftc act by making untrue or misleading statements to induce consumers to purchase services.
on april,the defendants each stipulated to preliminary injunctions barring them from representing that anyone can substantially improve most consumer credit report or profile by permanently removing bankruptcies,tax liens,late payments,collection accounts,or other evidence of delinquencies from the consumer credit report where that information is accurate and not obsolete.ftc gill,d.in addition,they were enjoined from violating the cro act by charging or receiving money for credit repair services before the services were fully performed,making statements to credit reporting agencies that they either knew or had reason to believe were untrue or misleading,or making or using any untrue or misleading representation of their services.defendants were further enjoined from creating,operating,or exercising any control over any form of business entity that provides credit repair services without properly notifying the commission in writing.
even after stipulating to the preliminary injunctions,defendants continued to collect money from clients who had retained them before the complaint was filed.they also created a nonprofit organization called credit restoration corporation of america crca,with murkey as president and gill as a director.through crca,defendants continued,at least into late,to operate their credit repair business.id.at.
the ftc moved for summary judgment on august,the hearing was set for september.on september,murkey filed an ex parte application to continue the hearing.the district court granted the application in part,rescheduling the hearing for october and extending defendants response date until september.defendant murkey applied ex parte for an additional extension,which the district court denied.
murkey filed his opposition with approximately pages of unauthenticated exhibits on september,two days late.he filed a declaration on september,purporting to authenticate the exhibits.the declarant was pauline christie,who had worked for murkey as the office manager for months.she stated 
i am familiar with the manner in which richard murkey maintains his books and records.
i have examined the documents which have been attached as exhibits in to sic the opposition filed by richard murkey to plaintiff motion for summary judgment.
sic i can state of my own knowledge that the documents marked as exhibits through,through and through are true and correct copies of his business records,and that said documents were maintained in the normal course of business.
the commission objected to defendant murkey exhibits as lacking authentication and as hearsay.the district court agreed and further stated that defendants failed to offer testimony 
as to what these documents represent or how these documents could possibly show that they achieved any removal of negative information,that any information removed was accurate,that any such information was not obsolete,that any information,if actually deleted,was not later reinserted,or that the permanent removal of that information was achieved in a lawful manner.

after hearing argument on october,the district court granted the ftc motion in its entirety on november.the court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from participating in any aspect of the credit repair business,making certain representations to consumers regarding defendants credit repair services,reporting false or misleading information to a credit reporting agency,and otherwise violating the cro act.id.at.the court ordered defendants to return payments received for any credit repair services performed pursuant to contracts entered before march,notably,for any consumer who did not sign a new retainer agreement following entry of the preliminary injunction.the district court ordered defendants jointly and severally to pay the sum of to the ftc as equitable monetary relief,including without limitation consumer redress,restitution disgorgement.id.at.

discussion 
genuine issues of triable fact murkey and gill 
defendants both maintain that disputes exist regarding their purported false representation and acceptance of payment before rendering services.as the district court found,no such disputes exist.
false representations 
as a preliminary matter,violation of the cro act prohibition against making or using any untrue or misleading representation of the services of the credit repair organization is not only a violation of the cro act,a,but also an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce in violation of section a of the ftc act,a.b as the district court correctly observed,liability attaches even if the representation made by the credit repair organization is not made for the purpose of induc ing consumers to purchase a particular service or good.ftc gill,d at.all the ftc must show to establish violations of both acts,then,is an untrue or misleading statement regarding the services of the cro.
murkey admits making the statements on his radio broadcast s.he even concedes that it may have been possible to interpret either defendants radio broadcast or other representations to mean all negatives can always be removed from all consumers credit reports that was not ever the defendants intent.although murkey disputes the district court conclusions,he offers no evidence to demonstrate that a genuine issue of triable fact exists for trial.he denies certain declarants statements that they told murkey that various adverse items on their credit reports were correct.he purports to rely on his own declaration,b
