california business and professions code section f h forbids manufacturers and wholesalers of alcoholic beverages from giving anything of value to retailers for advertising their alcoholic products.thus,for example,a liquor store owner in california can hang a captain morgan rum sign in his store window,but the captain ca pay him,directly or through an agent,for doing so.years ago,in actmedia,stroh,cir,we found this law to be consistent with the first amendment.today we consider whether actmedia remains binding in light of intervening supreme court decisions,which plaintiff appellant retail digital network,llc rdn contends have strengthened the protection we must give commercial speech under the first amendment.
we conclude that actmedia is clearly irreconcilable with sorrell ims health,d.sorrell requires heightened judicial scrutiny of restrictions on commercial speech regarding lawful products,rather than the intermediate scrutiny applied to section in actmedia.we therefore reverse the district court summary judgment in favor of defendant appellee jacob appelsmith,director of the california department of alcoholic beverage control the state,and remand on an open record for the district court to apply heightened judicial scrutiny in the first instance.
california business professions code section 
section is part of a scheme of statutes passed by the california legislature in the wake of prohibition.
the name derives from a perceived evil that the scheme was designed to defeat the return of saloons and other retail alcoholic beverage outlets controlled by alcoholic beverage manufacturers and wholesalers that had been prevalent during the early.see actmedia,at cal.beer wholesalers ass alcoholic beverage control appeals,cal d.manufacturers and wholesalers tied retailers to them by providing them with loans,reduced rents,and free equipment,employing their staff,and other means.see actmedia,at see also pickerill schott,so d.lawmakers in congress,california,and other states blamed the industry structure that arrangements created for producing monopolies and exclusive dealing arrangements,for causing a vast growth in the number of saloons and bars,for fostering commercial bribery,and for generating other serious social and political evils,including political corruption,irresponsible ownership of retail outlets,and intemperance.actmedia,at n quoting,sess,see also distrib.treasury dep t.
to prevent vertical and horizontal integration of the alcoholic beverage industry and to promote temperance,the california legislature prohibited manufacturers and wholesalers from owning retailers or making gifts,paying rebates,or otherwise buying the favor of retailers and their employees.see,cal.bus,a e.section f h,the provision challenged on first amendment grounds here,was designed to prevent manufacturers and wholesalers from circumventing these other restrictions by claiming that the illegal payments they made to retailers were for advertising.actmedia,at.in relevant part,section f h forbids manufacturers and wholesalers of alcoholic beverages,including their agents,from providing retail establishments with anything of value for the privilege of advertising their alcoholic products 
california was not alone in passing laws.congress and the vast majority of states enacted similar alcohol beverage control laws following the repeal of the eighteenth amendment.actmedia,at quoting cal.beer wholesalers ass n,cal d at.california concern that advertising payments could be used to conceal illegal payoffs to retailers also appears to have been widely held at the time of section h enactment.id.at.congress,for example,passed a similar law barring manufacturers and distributors of alcoholic beverages from paying or crediting the retailer for any advertising,display,or distribution service.b.
actmedia,stroh 
our court addressed section h constitutionality under the first amendment in actmedia,cir.actmedia,a corporation whose business consisted of leasing advertising space on supermarket shopping carts,challenged section h as an impermissible restriction on commercial speech.following trial,the district entered judgment for the state and dismissed actmedia claims.
on appeal,we applied the test for laws that burden commercial speech set forth in central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d.under that test,courts examine four questions whether the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading whether the asserted governmental interest justifying the regulation is substantial whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and whether the regulation is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.id.at.
we found little dispute concerning the first two factors of the central hudson analysis.actmedia,at.first,the ads concern ed lawful activity and were not misleading.thus,they constitute d protected commercial speech under the first amendment.id.quotation marks omitted.second,the state ha d a substantial interest in exercising its amendment powers and regulating the structure of the alcoholic beverage industry in california the activities of manufacturers,wholesalers,and retailers in the state the methods by which alcoholic beverages are marketed and influences that affect the consumption levels of alcoholic beverages by california residents.id.at.
addressing the third central hudson factor,we concluded that section h furthers california purposes both of limiting the ability of large manufacturers and wholesalers to achieve vertical and horizontal integration by acquiring influences over the state retail outlets,and of promoting temperance.id.at.we explained that the provision eliminated a loophole potentially left open by california other laws,through which manufacturers and wholesalers might use advertisement payments to buy the favor of retailers and their employees.id.at.because prohibiting manufacturers and wholesalers from paying retailers to advertise in their stores will eliminate any danger that such payments will be used to conceal illegal payoffs and violations of the laws,we conclude d that section h furthers the same interests that led california to enact the laws.id.we also reasoned that in reducing the quantity of advertising that is seen in retail establishments selling alcoholic beverages,the provision also directly furthers california interest in promoting temperance.id.
addressing the fourth central hudson factor,we concluded that section h blanket prohibition of paid advertising in retail establishments appears to be as narrowly drawn as possible to effectuate the provision first purpose,that being to prevent illegal payments from being channelled by manufacturers and wholesalers to retailers.id.we also found that section h is not more extensive than necessary to achieve the provision second purpose,to promote temperance,both indirectly,by limiting vertical integration of the industry and its side effects,and directly,by reducing the amount of advertising.id.we reasoned that to the extent that the california legislature has determined that advertising is a direct cause of excessive alcohol consumption,limiting that advertising is obviously the most direct and perhaps the only effective approach available.id.quoting metromedia,city of san diego,d.we thus held that section h survived intermediate scrutiny.
like the plaintiff in actmedia,rdn is a middleman involved in the advertising industry.rdn installs liquid crystal displays,or lcds,in retail stores for advertisements and then enters into contracts with other parties who want to advertise their products on the displays.in exchange for placing a display in a retail store,rdn pays the store a percentage of the advertising fees generated by the display.rdn states that it has attempted to enter into contracts with manufacturers to advertise their alcoholic beverages on rdn displays in california.according to rdn,the manufacturers have refused due to concerns that the advertising would violate section f h.
rdn filed this action on november,seeking declaratory relief that section f h is unconstitutional under the first amendment,and an injunction against the state enforcement of the law.the state moved for summary judgment and,at a hearing on that motion,rdn agreed that the ninth circuit decision in actmedia leaves no room for this litigation except to the extent that a trio of subsequent supreme court decisions is clearly irreconcilable with its conclusions.rdn appelsmith,d.specifically,rdn argued that rubin coors brewing,d,liquormart,rhode island,d plurality opinion,and,most definitively,sorrell ims health,d,overrule actmedia.according to rdn,these cases require heightened judicial scrutiny of laws burdening commercial speech regarding legal products,which section can not survive.
the district court first found that rdn had standing to challenge section based on injury to its economic interest in the advertising of alcoholic beverages that section burdens.rdn,d at.on the merits,the district court found that section is a restriction on commercial speech,but held that the law is constitutional under actmedia.id.at.
the district court acknowledged that,after actmedia,the supreme court stated that heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.id.at quoting sorrell.at.but the district court found that sorrell was consistent with actmedia analytical framework for four reasons.first,sorrell cited to a previous supreme court decision applying central hudson.rdn,d at.second,sorrell applied the central hudson test rather than heightened judicial scrutiny after noting that,a s in previous cases,the outcome is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied.rdn,d at quoting sorrell.at.third,the majority in sorrell did not define heightened scrutiny.rdn,d at.and fourth,the dissenting opinion by justice breyer and joined by justices ginsburg and kagan,notes that the majority opinion suggests but does not hold that a standard stricter than the traditional central hudson test might be applied to restrictions.id.citing sorrell.at breyer,dissenting.the district court also reasoned that,e ven assuming arguendo that sorrell established a heightened level of scrutiny for complete speech bans founded on paternalistic motivations,actmedia is not clearly irreconcilable because section does not completely ban any speech.id.at.
accordingly,the district court did not examine section under sorrell heightened judicial scrutiny or reexamine the law under intermediate scrutiny.rather,it found that actmedia remained controlling and thus granted summary judgement in favor of the state.id.at.
like the district court,we begin by determining whether rdn has standing.the state silence about this issue on appeal does not excuse us from satisfying ourselves of our jurisdiction.see,organized vill.of kake dep t of,cir en banc.to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff bears the burden of showing injury in fact,causation,and redressability.see bennett spear,d.we agree with the district court that rdn asserted loss of advertising revenue resulting from section meets this burden.
our analysis does not end here.several prudential principles that underscore the limitations embodied in article iii may bar standing even where,as here,the requirements of article iii have been met.one of these prudential limits on standing is that a litigant must normally assert his own legal interests rather than those of third parties.phillips petroleum shutts,d.this general rule that a third party does not hav e standing to bring a claim asserting a violation of someone else rights adheres even where those rights are constitutional in stature.martin cal.dep t of veterans affairs,cir see also wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir a party ordinarily has no standing to assert the first amendment rights of third parties.
in the context,the supreme court has held that the individual parties to the transaction that is proposed in the commercial advertisement the advertiser and the consuming public have protected first amendment interests in the speech proposing the transaction.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d.the court has distinguished between the proposal of a commercial transaction,which is what defines commercial speech,and the provision of services for profit,which is not commercial speech.bd.of trs.of state of fox,d.
while an advertisement about an alcoholic beverage clearly constitutes commercial speech,see liquormart,at opinion of stevens,id.at,concurring,rdn is not a manufacturer or retailer seeking to hawk its wares,or a consumer looking to buy.rather,rdn is interested in profiting from facilitating the publication of alcoholic beverage advertisements.in the circumstances presented,however,where rdn could face criminal penalties for placing advertisements of particular content on its retail displays paid for by alcoholic beverage manufacturers,we find that rdn may bring a first amendment challenge to the law proscribing its conduct.see cal.bus.prohibiting an agent of a manufacturer,wholesaler,or other listed entity from providing anything of value to retailers for the privilege of advertising id.listing penalties dep t of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals,th,d,as modified may,holding that section h prohibits indirect payments by suppliers to retailers through promoters.
our conclusion finds support in the principle that when a threatened enforcement effort implicates first amendment rights,the standing inquiry tilts dramatically toward a finding of standing.lso,stroh,cir.indeed,the supreme court has found that a plaintiff threatened with criminal prosecution for violating a law imposing a burden on commercial speech may challenge that law under the first amendment,even though the speech of third parties is more directly at stake.bigelow virginia,d holding that a newspaper publisher who had been convicted of violating a state statute outlawing advertising regarding abortion services had standing to challenge the law on first amendment grounds.
the court also has held that a publisher whose business conduct was directly regulated by a law imposing a burden on commercial speech could challenge that law under the first amendment.in simon schuster,members of the state crime victims board,d,the court held that a publisher,simon schuster,had standing to challenge a law that imposed a financial disincentive on one of its authors to write a book about a career criminal named henry hill.under a contract with simon schuster,hill was entitled to compensation,but new york son of sam law required that these funds be held in escrow for five years for use in satisfying any civil judgments obtained by the victims of hill crimes.pursuant to this law,the new york state crime victims board ordered simon schuster to turn over all money payable to hill.id.at.the court found that simon schuster had standing to challenge the son of sam law under the first amendment.the court reasoned that w hether the first amendment speaker is considered to be henry hill,whose income the statute places in escrow because of the story he has told,or simon schuster,which can publish books about crime with the assistance of only those criminals willing to forgo remuneration for at least five years,the statute plainly imposes a financial disincentive only on speech of a particular content.see also pitt news pappert,cir alito,holding that a newspaper had standing to challenge a law that prohibited the newspaper from receiving payments for running alcoholic beverage ads.
similarly,section imposes a financial burden on a speaker based on the content of the speaker expression.the law may be enforced against rdn as an agent facilitating that expression.consequently,whether the commercial speaker is considered to be rdn as a publisher or alcoholic beverage manufacturers,distributors,and retailers whose speech rdn would display,rdn may challenge section on first amendment grounds.
first amendment protection of commercial speech after sorrell 
turning to the merits,we first summarize how the protection given to commercial speech has evolved since,when we last addressed section constitutionality under the first amendment.
as noted,the supreme court defines commercial speech as that which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.state bd.of pharmacy,at quoting pittsburgh press pittsburgh comm on human relations,d.such speech has long been given less protection under the first amendment than other types of speech.united states united foods,d valle del sol whiting,cir.specifically,restrictions on commercial speech have been subject to intermediate scrutiny under the test set forth in central hudson,at.the burden is on the government to show that the elements of the test are satisfied.liquormart,at opinion of stevens.consistent with central hudson,we have previously applied intermediate scrutiny to and regulations of commercial speech alike.see,coyote publ g,miller,cir w hether or not the regulation is,the central hudson test still applies because of the reduced protection given to commercial speech.
in sorrell,however,the supreme court held that restrictions on commercial speech regarding lawful goods or services must survive heightened judicial scrutiny.at.the court invalidated a vermont law that restricted the sale,disclosure,and use of pharmacy records for marketing purposes.id.at.on its face,the law was content and.in fact,it had been enacted with the avowed purpose of diminish ing the effectiveness of marketing by manufacturers of drugs.id.at.while the court found that heightened judicial scrutiny of the law was required,the court did not actually apply heightened scrutiny,as it found that the law could not withstand intermediate scrutiny under central hudson.id.at.
consistent with sorrell plain language,we rule that sorrell modified the central hudson test for laws burdening commercial speech.under sorrell,courts must first determine whether a challenged law burdening commercial speech about legal goods or services is content or.if so,heightened judicial scrutiny is required.see sorrell.at.
heightened judicial scrutiny may be applied using the familiar framework of the central hudson test 
with respect to the third central hudson factor,the government bears the burden of showing that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.coors brewing,at.with respect to the fourth central hudson factor,the government bears a heavier burden of showing that the challenged law is drawn to achieve the government substantial interest.sorrell.at.this inquiry first permits a district court to test the consistency between a the specific interests asserted by the government during litigation in addressing central hudson second prong and b the legislative purposes that the court finds actually animated a challenged law,as made explicit in the statute text or evidenced by its history or design.see friendly house whiting,d,aff sub nom.valle del sol whiting,cir.post hoc rationalizations for a restriction on commercial speech may not be used to sustain its constitutionality.
second,after identifying the governmental interests that animate the challenged restriction,intermediate scrutiny and,a fortiori,heightened scrutiny demands a fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.sorrell.at quoting fox,at.this requirement is demanding under heightened scrutiny,but it is something short of a standard that the government must meet under strict judicial scrutiny.see fox,at.what is required is a fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.id.at.
as in other contexts,these standards ensure that the government interests are proportional to the resulting burdens placed on speech,sorrell.at,thus preventing the government from too readily sacrific ing speech for efficiency.mccullen coakley,d alternation in original.these standards also check raw paternalism,ensuring that the law does not seek to suppress a disfavored message or keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good.sorrell.at.indeed,at least when the audience of commercial speech consists of adult consumers in possession of their faculties,the fact t hat the state finds expression too persuasive does not permit it to quiet the speech or to burden its messengers.id.at.
our conclusion that sorrell modified the central hudson test is consistent with the decisions of other circuit courts applying sorrell.our sister circuits have agreed that sorrell requires stricter judicial scrutiny of restrictions on commercial speech,though they may not have settled on the contours of this more demanding level of scrutiny.
the eighth circuit,for example,held that sorrell devised a new test for assessing restrictions on commercial speech.pain referral,llc otto,cir.the first question to ask is whether the challenged speech restriction is content or,or both if a commercial speech restriction is content or,then it is subject to heightened scrutiny.id.at.the second step is to apply the appropriate level of scrutiny.according to the eight circuit,because sorrell did not define what heightened scrutiny means,t he upshot is that when a court determines commercial speech restrictions are content or,it should then assess their constitutionality under central hudson.id.at.
the second circuit also has interpreted sorrell to require heightened scrutiny of content or restrictions on commercial speech,which may be applied using the framework of the central hudson test.united states caronia,cir.the seventh circuit similarly observed that sorrell requires the government to establish that the challenged statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.am.civil liberties union of alvarez,cir quoting sorrell.at.
the third circuit has suggested that sorrell may require strict scrutiny of burdens on commercial speech.king governor of the state of,cir,cert.denied sub nom.king christie,d.citing sorrell,the court noted that o rdinarily,regulations are highly disfavored and subjected to strict scrutiny.id.however,the court did not apply strict scrutiny to the challenged content and restriction on professional speech because it found that the law did not discriminat e on the basis of content or speaker in an impermissible manner.id.at.
moreover,our holding is consistent with our decisions referenced by the parties.these decisions indicated that sorrell requires a more demanding form of scrutiny of content or regulations on commercial speech than we have previously applied.see minority television project,fcc,cir,vacated,cir order jerry beeman pharmacy,anthem prescription,llc,cir,vacated,cir order 
actmedia is no longer binding.
we next consider whether actmedia remains binding after subsequent supreme court commercial speech decisions,including coors brewing,liquormart,and sorrell.
as a panel,we are bound by actmedia unless it is clearly irreconcilable with intervening higher authority.miller gammie,cir en banc.this is a high standard.lair bullock,cir.it is not enough for there to be some tension between the intervening higher authority and prior circuit precedent.id.at.rather,the relevant court of last resort must have undercut the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.miller,at see also in re flores,cir.
we do not find that coors brewing,d striking down a law prohibiting beer labels from displaying alcohol content,or liquormart,d striking down a ban on all advertising of alcoholic beverage prices except for price tags,meets this high standard.coors brewing and liquormart do not clearly undermine actmedia reasoning they also applied intermediate scrutiny under the central hudson test.similarly,we held in lair bullock that our circuit precedent could not be eschewed where a subsequent supreme court decision had only clarified and reinforced the principles on which our prior decision relied.at.while coors bre
