luigi bormioli bormioli appeals the judgment of the united states court of international trade granting summary judgment to the united states that the appraised transaction value of certain entries of bormioli imported glassware includes a charge of percent of its invoice price.see luigi bormioli united states,d.the court held that bormioli did not demonstrate that the percent charge was a bona fide interest charge excludable from the transaction value of the merchandise pursuant to treatment of interest charges in the customs value of imported merchandise,cust,fed.reg.july,td.because we agree with the court of international trade that the united states customs service customs correctly determined that bormioli did not demonstrate that the percent charge should be excluded from transaction value,we affirm.
factual background 
this case arises from certain favorable payment terms extended to bormioli by its italian parent company,luigi bormioli bormioli italy.bormioli imports into the united states glassware it purchases from bormioli italy.typically,bormioli italy requires payment from its customers within days of the date of its invoice for the subject merchandise.however,in a january,letter,bormioli italy granted bormioli an extension of the payment deadline from to days.
under the terms of the agreement,if bormioli elected to delay payment to bormioli italy beyond the normal deadline,bormioli would be required to pay interest on the balance to bormioli italy at the italian prime rate.bormioli was required to make any such interest payments to bormioli italy at the end of each quarter.of course,bormioli still was required to pay the principal balance on the merchandise to bormioli italy within days of the invoice.
over time,bormioli italy reduced the term of the payment extensions.in a december,letter,bormioli italy shortened the payment deadline to days effective january,and in a june,letter,it further shortened the payment deadline to days effective august.the remainder of the terms of the original letter were unchanged.bormioli states that these decreases in the length of the payment extensions reflected its increasing financial viability.
the glassware merchandise entries at issue in this case were imported in,when the payment deadline was in effect.using a corporate charge invoice,bormioli italy billed bormioli a percent annual interest charge percent per month for delayed payment of one month,the difference between and days for the imported merchandise.bormioli recorded the charges in its books as corporate charges,denominated special payment terms interest charges.bormioli italy invoices to bormioli for the glassware itself did not include an interest listing for the subject charges.
in practice,bormioli payment of these interest charges deviated from the terms of its letter agreement with bormioli italy in several ways.first,bormioli made payments on six to twelve months worth of accrued charges,rather than quarterly.second,bormioli made the payments on the basis of a percent interest rate percent per month,rather than the roughly percent prime rate in effect in italy in.finally,it frequently paid the outstanding invoices after the deadline up to days later.
in,customs appraised the bormioli imported merchandise on the basis of transaction value pursuant to b.it determined that the value of the goods was the invoice price,plus an additional percent of the invoice price based on the payments bormioli made to bormioli italy.customs made this determination based on its policy set forth in td,which provides in relevant part 
i nterest payments,whether or not included in the price actually paid or payable for merchandise,should not be considered part of dutiable value provided the following criteria are satisfied 
i.the interest charges are identified separately from the price actually paid or payable for the goods 
ii.the financing arrangement in question was made in writing 
iii.where required by customs,the buyer can demonstrate that 
the goods undergoing appraisement are actually sold at the price declared as the price paid or payable,and 
the claimed rate of interest does not exceed the level for such transaction prevailing in the country where,and at the time,when the financing was provided.
td.the criteria in paragraph c are considered satisfied if the claimed charges for interest and principal are consistent with those usually reflected in sales of identical or similar merchandise.id.
bormioli filed suit in the court of international trade to challenge the inclusion of the percent charge.bormioli argued that td did not apply to its interest payments,or,alternatively,that its payments satisfied td test for excludable interest.on for summary judgment,bormioli submitted evidence that the invoice price of the goods sold in the was the same,or within five cents,of the price of similar goods it sold in canada.it further presented evidence that in june,the internal revenue service referred to the subject charges as interest charges paid to a foreign corporation,and required bormioli to withhold united states tax on the payments.
the court of international trade granted summary judgment to the united states.citing christensen harris county,d,the court refused to grant chevron deference,or any deference,to td,and instead performed a de novo review.the court nonetheless found that td was consistent with the statutory scheme,as well as with the decision on the treatment of interest reached by the committee on customs valuation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt.therefore,the court applied the three td factors to bormioli.it held that bormioli met only the first because bormioli departed from the terms of the written agreement the canadian transactions are irrelevant because only transactions may be used as a comparison and the interest rate was not comparable to that prevailing in italy.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment by the court of international trade de novo.int l light metals united states.statutory interpretation is a matter of law that we review without deference to the interpretation reached by the court of international trade.skf usa united states.
we need not reach the issue of the level of deference owed to customs treatment of interest as set forth in td.the government argues that td should receive deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,while bormioli argues that no deference is due.in united states mead,d,a decision issued after briefing in this case,the supreme court held that an agency statutory interpretations are due chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.id.at.the court further made clear that even where an agency interpretation is not entitled to chevron deference,it may be entitled to some deference based on its power to persuade in accordance with the principles of skidmore swift.mead,at.noting the merit of its writer thoroughness,logic and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.we need not determine whether chevron,skidmore,or any deference is applicable to td,because,as more fully discussed below,we agree with the court of international trade that the meaning of td reflects a proper interpretation of based on our de novo consideration of the issue.see thai pineapple canning indus.united states,declining to decide whether chevron or skidmore deference applied to policy where the distinction is of no moment to the case see also springfield,buckles,wl at declining to resolve level of deference.
we begin by a review of the statutory framework.in,the parties to the gatt agreed to a comprehensive customs valuation code.the code established that the preferred method of calculating the appraised value of imported merchandise would be transaction value,based on the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise.see general agreement on tariffs and trade,opened for signature,art.i,vii,viii,stat.pts,see also agreement on implementation of article vii of the general agreement on tariffs and trade,hereinafter gatt valuation code michael,comment,nissho iwai american united states customs appraisement and middleman pricing under section of the tariff act of,fordham int l.
the united states adopted the transaction valuation method of appraisal in b codifying section b of the trade agreements act of,amended by the trade agreements act of.paragraph b of that section provides the transaction value of imported merchandise is the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise when sold for exportation to the united states,plus certain additional amounts b emphasis added these additional amounts set forth in a e of the statute are to be added to the price actually paid or payable only if they are not otherwise included in that price,and if they are based on sufficient information.id.congress also expressly excluded certain charges from transaction value such as certain taxes and costs section b specifies that these enumerated excluded costs are not included in transaction value if they are identified separately from the price actually paid or payable and from any cost or other item referred to in section b.b.
interest is not one of the specifically statutorily mandated inclusions or one of the exclusions.nonetheless,congress provided a flexible definition for the price actually paid or payable 
the term price actually paid or payable means the total payment whether direct or indirect,and exclusive of any costs,charges,or expenses incurred for transportation,insurance,and related services incident to the international shipment of the merchandise from the country of exportation to the place of importation in the united states made,or to be made,for imported merchandise by the buyer to,or for the benefit of,the seller.
b a emphases added.we have interpreted the term total payment in the price actually paid or payable definition to be.generra sportswear united states.therefore,we have held that the price actually paid or payable includes payments made by the buyer to the seller in exchange for merchandise even if the payment represents something other than the per se value of the goods.id.at holding that quota payments were properly included in the price actually paid or payable.this interpretation is consistent with the broad definition of price actually paid or payable adopted by the gatt 
within this framework,customs issued a series of interpretive rulings expressly addressing the question of when it would consider interest payments to be part of the price actually paid or payable for merchandise,and hence part of the transaction value.see taa,mk january,hereinafter taa taa,tll june,hereinafter taa and taa,hq,cust.december,hereinafter taa.in these rulings,customs stated that only those interest payments which were part of an overall financing arrangement taa,or those which were paid by a buyer to a third party unrelated to a seller and which did not accrue to the seller benefit taa were not dutiable.see td taa taa.for example,in taa,customs considered a financing arrangement that allowed an importer to delay paying its supplier for merchandise on the condition that it paid its supplier interest for the period of the delay.customs found that because the proposed financial relationship bore no relationship to the particular sale,the supplier had the right to renegotiate the interest rate if the going rate changed sufficiently,and the financing arrangement was fully documented as being separate from the import transaction,customs would not consider the interest payments to be part of the price actually paid or payable for the imported merchandise.taa.however,a ll other interest payments associated with imported goods,including those paid to a seller and relating to the purchase of specific goods taa and were considered dutiable.td see also taa holding that interest charges separately identified from the price payable were to be included in transaction value see also taa.
in,customs promulgated td in order to implement an april,decision on the treatment of interest charges made by the committee on customs valuation of the gatt.td closely mirrors the operative language of the gatt committee decision of the treatment of interest charges in the customs value of imported goods.
charges for interest under a financing arrangement entered into by the buyer and relating to the purchase of imported goods shall not be regarded as part of the customs value provided that 
a the charges are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable for the goods 
b the financing arrangement was made in writing 
c where required,the buyer can demonstrate that 
such goods are actually sold at the price declared as the price actually paid or payable,and 
the claimed rate of interest does not exceed the level for such transactions prevailing in the country where,and at the time when the finance was provided.
decision of the treatment of interest charges in the customs value of imported goods,gatt committee on customs valuation,april,reprinted in td,annex agreement on tariffs and trade hereinafter gatt committee decision.
in the text accompanying the operative td factors,customs stated that the gatt committee decision had prompted it to reassess the position it had taken in its prior letter rulings.see,background.noting that it was impossible in many instances to distinguish interest payments relating to the purchase of specific goods from interest payments made as a part of an overall financing arrangement,customs adopted the more specific criteria of td.id.
we must first consider whether td is consistent with the statute.although all the detailed criteria of td can not be found in the explicit language of the statute,we think that the statute must be interpreted to be consistent with gatt obligations,absent contrary indications in the statutory language or its legislative history.see united states,a bsent express congressional language to the contrary,statutes should not be interpreted to conflict with international obligations.here there are no such contrary indications.the gatt approach is quite consistent with the statute.like b a,the gatt broadly defines price actually paid or payable.see gatt interpretive note.gatt is also consistent with the policy of the statute.the gatt parameters not only provide a uniform method to evaluate when interest charges are included in transaction value,but they also serve to prevent importers from manipulating the amount of duties assessed on particular merchandise by simply designating part of the payment made for that merchandise as interest.without a policy that requires both sufficient documentation of the transaction,and evidence of comparable prevailing rates and sales,an importer could easily reduce the price actually paid or payable of the goods by denominating charges that actually represented a portion of the price of the goods as interest.thus,we construe the statute to make it consistent with gatt.
under that construction,td is consistent with the statute because it is the same as gatt.like the gatt committee decision on the treatment of interest charges,td does not only apply to unitary prices.see gatt committee decision.rather,it serves as a tool to evaluate all c harges for interest under a financing arrangement entered into by the buyer and relating to the purchase of imported goods.id.td,like the gatt committee decision,includes a criterion that the charges be separately documented from the price actually paid or payable for the goods.id.stating the criterion that t he charges are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable for goods.td and the gatt committee decision are otherwise identical.both include the requirements that the financing arrangement be made in writing the buyer can demonstrate that the goods are actually sold at the price declared as the price paid or payable and the buyer can demonstrate that the claimed rate of interest does not exceed the rate for such transactions prevailing in the country where and at the time when the financing was provided.td.thus,in all relevant respects,td and the gatt committee decision s
