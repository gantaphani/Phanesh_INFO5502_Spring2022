this litigation arises out of a dispute between the parties to a pair of substantially identical finance leases.following a bench trial,the district court found in favor of the lessee,awarded substantial damages,and dismissed a counterclaim.resolving the lessor appeal requires us to visit precincts bounded by the uniform commercial code hereinafter variously ucc or code and to explore the intersection between the code and the common law of fraudulent misrepresentation.although our analysis differs in some respects from the trial court,we nonetheless reach the same ultimate conclusion and affirm the judgment.
the facts are largely uncontradicted.eureka broadband corporation is a delaware corporation that maintains its principal place of business in new york eureka installs fiber optic systems in large office buildings and generates revenues by charging access fees to commercial carriers desirous of providing telecommunication services to tenants.in june of,eureka decided that it needed certain equipment in order to pursue its business interests.wentworth leasing corporation,a massachusetts firm headquartered in that state,offered to facilitate acquisition of the equipment through a finance lease.stan is wentworth sole shareholder and only conducted the negotiations.
the parties structured the transaction as a conventional finance lease.eureka identified the equipment it needed and wentworth agreed to purchase that equipment for from coppercom,a vendor.eureka would then lease the equipment from wentworth for months at a monthly rent of.at the end of the month term,eureka would have an option to buy the equipment.
as a condition precedent to the actual execution of the lease documents,wentworth required eureka to demonstrate creditworthiness and to pay a commitment fee equal to one month rent.eureka sent the commitment fee to wentworth early on and forwarded the necessary financial information in august of.wentworth agreed to the lease on september,but added the further condition that eureka post a security deposit equal to the first and last months rent.on the same day that it acquiesced in this further condition,eureka accepted delivery of the equipment from coppercom and executed a delivery and acceptance agreement in which it authorized wentworth to release payment to coppercom.
on december,the same parties entered into a second lease for additional equipment,some of which came from coppercom and some from marconi communications.the terms of the second lease were substantially identical to those of the first,except that the monthly rent was.on december,eureka mailed wentworth a check for to cover the security deposit and the first month rent.at about the same time,eureka accepted delivery of the additional equipment.
on december,coppercom sent an invoice to wentworth for the agreed purchase price of the equipment covered by the first lease.it sent another invoice on december for the equipment covered by the second lease.for reasons that are not entirely clear from the record,marconi did not submit an invoice to wentworth,but,rather,billed eureka directly.
eureka made monthly lease payments to wentworth through january.there was a rub,however wentworth never paid a dime to either coppercom or marconi.both vendors soon began dunning eureka,which repeatedly requested that wentworth remunerate the vendors.wentworth turned a deaf ear to these importunings.eventually,eureka patience wore thin.on february,it advised wentworth that it would withhold future rent payments until it received confirmation that wentworth had paid coppercom and marconi.despite this warning,wentworth remained delinquent.
matters came to a head in march,when marconi brought suit against eureka for the purchase price of its equipment.to settle the suit,eureka returned marconi wares and paid it.eureka separately settled with coppercom before any litigation was commenced to consummate that settlement,it returned coppercom equipment and tendered a small payment the record is tenebrous as to the precise dollar amount.
on april,eureka wrote to wentworth demanding return of all rent previously paid totaling.when wentworth demurred,eureka brought a diversity suit in the federal district court.see a.its complaint contained counts sounding in breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and fraud.wentworth answered the complaint and counterclaimed for breach of the lease indentures.
following a bench trial,the district court reserved decision.it subsequently handed down a rescript containing detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.eureka broadband wentworth leasing,wl.
the court first dismissed eureka claim for unjust enrichment on the ground that an adequate remedy at law existed.id.at.next,it addressed the breach of contract count.with respect to the marconi equipment,the court held that no sale between marconi and wentworth had occurred because marconi had never invoiced wentworth.id.at.inasmuch as there had been no sale,wentworth had no right to charge rent for the marconi equipment and eureka was entitled to a full refund.id.wentworth has not challenged this ruling on appeal.
as to the coppercom equipment,the court found that wentworth was obligated by the lease terms to purchase the equipment from coppercom,but it never paid nor,for that matter,had any intention of paying coppercom for the equipment.id.at.that failure constituted a breach of contract and entitled eureka to cancel the leases.id.at.
the court then proceeded to the fraudulent misrepresentation count.in the court view,wentworth was liable to eureka on this claim because it had fraudulently induced eureka to enter into the leases in reliance on its false promise to purchase and pay for the equipment.id.at.
to wrap up the liability phase,the court ruled in favor of eureka on wentworth counterclaim.id.it then turned to damages and determined that eureka was entitled to recover the same damages on both the breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation counts id.these damages equaled the total amount of the rental payments eureka had made to wentworth.id.
the court also made two other awards,neither of which is directly challenged in this appeal.first,it awarded consequential damages of for reasonable expenses that eureka had incurred in responding to the marconi suit.see id.at.second,it awarded eureka attorneys fees for the prosecution of the action on the ground that wentworth had acted vexatiously id.at.
this timely appeal ensued.in it,wentworth raises only four issues.first,it argues that the district court erred in finding that it breached the lease agreements with respect to the coppercom equipment.second,it asserts that the fraudulent misrepresentation count should have been dismissed as a matter of law.third,it questions the measure of damages with specific reference to the rent refund.finally,it asseverates that the district court erred in rejecting its counterclaim,which it now characterizes as sounding in conversion.in mulling these assignments of error,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.sierra fria donald evans,cir.the lease indentures contain provisions commemorating the parties agreement that massachusetts law should govern any disputes,and we honor that agreement.see,mccarthy azure,cir observing that a reasonable provision in a contract generally should be respected.
while we ultimately approve the district court conclusion that wentworth is liable to eureka with respect to the coppercom equipment,we are skeptical about its rationale.the district court held that wentworth breached its obligation to purchase the equipment by not paying the vendor.but purchase is not a synonym for pay,and it is at least arguable that,here,there was a sale albeit a sale on credit,which was complete upon delivery of the equipment without regard to payment.see.laws ch,a,d.moreover,the parties dispute whether wentworth had an obligation to eureka to pay the vendors.see midwest precision servs.ptm indus,cir noting that in a finance lease the contracts between the lessor and the lessee and the lessor and the vendor are separate and independent.
