background 
in century and meraj entered into two agreements that permitted meraj real estate sales offices office and office to use century trademarks in exchange for monthly royalty payments and advertising fees.in both agreements were renewed for a term ending in november.as part of the renewals,attached to each agreement was an addendum granting meraj a credit.the credit agreement provided that each month meraj could pay half the royalties due and deduct the other half from its credit.
meraj began paying only one half of the monthly royalties in march.in july of the same year,century conducted an audit of meraj two franchises for the period october through march.the audit revealed a deficiency of for office,and for office.century notified armond azharian,meraj principal,that it would deduct the entire deficiency,from meraj service fee credit.aplt app.at.the next month,august,meraj made its last half payment and began paying in full.
during december and january,century conducted a second audit.it indicated that office owed and office owed.the audit report did not mention the service fee credit.in august century sent azharian notice of its intent to terminate office.the letter stated that the franchise owed to century.the amount reflected both the audit deficiency and additional fees that had since been assessed.one month later century sent a letter,asserting a final deficiency of and terminating the franchise effective september.the franchise for office was apparently terminated at the same time.
azharian then wrote a series of letters to century in which he offered to pay delinquent amounts but requested a third audit as a condition of payment.in those letters azharian complained that certain payments had not been correctly credited to his account.he said that he was uncertain whether his franchise had actually been terminated,that he was relying on century representations that the problem could be resolved,and that because he was operating under the assumption that the agreement had not in fact been terminated,he would continue to pay franchise fees.
in the months following the termination letter,meraj office used the century trademarks in its advertising,on its external and internal signage,and on its yard signs.also,it continued to answer the phone using the century name.meraj paid royalty fees to century through july.in october meraj sold the business.
century filed suit on november,claiming meraj had breached the franchise agreement for office when it failed to make all payments due under the agreement,and had infringed century trademark when it continued to use century marks after its franchise had been terminated.the complaint also sought relief from azharian on his personal guarantee of the monetary obligations under the franchise agreement.the complaint did not address the activities of,or payments due with respect to,office.meraj counterclaimed for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and violation of the colorado consumer protection act ccpa.both meraj and azharian counterclaimed for commercial defamation.
at trial the district court entered judgment in favor of meraj on the trademark claims at the close of century case.after the close of all evidence,meraj and azharian withdrew their defamation claims and the court granted judgment in favor of century on meraj ccpa claim and its claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the jury rejected century claim and the claim against azharian on his guarantee.it returned a verdict for on meraj claim against century.
ii.the franchise fee credit 
the parties dispute the amount of the royalty fee credit provided by the addenda to the franchise renewals.on appeal century challenges the district court grant of partial summary judgment adopting meraj interpretation of the addenda.
when the two franchise agreements were renewed in,the following addendum was attached to each agreement 
franchisor and franchisee hereby agree that franchisee will be afforded a credit against royalty fees payable to franchisor under paragraph of the agreement in the aggregate amount of twenty thousand dollars.this credit will be applied to royalties which accrue after the commencement date on a monthly basis at the rate of fifty percent until the full credit amount is applied.accordingly,franchisee shall be required to pay to franchisor only of the first forty thousand dollars of royalties accrued under the agreement after the commencement date.thereafter all royalty payments will return to the full amount provided for under the agreement.
aplt app.at.
central to this case is whether the two addenda together granted meraj only one credit,to be shared by the two franchises,or whether each franchise was to receive its own credit.if office itself was entitled to a full credit,then meraj may not have defaulted in paying royalty fees to century and termination of the franchise was likely improper.if,on the other hand,a single credit was allocated for the use of both franchises,then office was in default.
the meaning of the addendum first came before the district court when century filed a motion in limine six days before trial.the motion asked the court to exclude azharian proposed testimony on the parties intentions with respect to the franchise fee credit.century argued that the contract language was unambiguous and that an integration clause in the franchise agreement precluded extrinsic evidence of the contract meaning.the only supporting evidence provided by century was a copy of the integration clause and a copy of the addendum.
three days later,the friday before the monday trial date,meraj filed a pleading that both responded to century motion and sought a partial summary judgment that each addendum created a separate credit.thus,meraj argued,it was entitled to two credits,one for each franchise.in support of that argument,meraj produced evidence that century maintained each franchise agreement in a separate file and that century representative had signed each addendum separately.it also produced excerpts from the deposition testimony of eric schmaltzbach,a vice president of cendant corporation,century parent corporation.century had designated schmaltzbach under federal rule of civil procedure b as the person who would testify about the credit.in his deposition schmaltzbach indicated that the phrase the agreement,as used in the addenda granting a credit against royalty fees payable to franchisor under paragraph of the agreement,referred only to the franchise agreement to which the individual addendum was attached.
on the morning of trial the district court ruled that each addendum applied to each franchise agreement.century challenges the district court ruling on both procedural and substantive grounds.it contends that the court improperly granted meraj summary judgment motion without giving century ten days to respond,and it argues that the court misconstrued the addendum.
a.the rule 
federal rule of civil procedure c states that a motion for summary judgment shall be served at least days before the time fixed for the hearing.century claims that the district court violated this provision by ruling on meraj motion for partial summary judgment three days after it was filed.it argues that if it had been provided the time to which it was entitled,it could have produced evidence establishing the correctness of its interpretation of the franchise agreement addenda.
we assume,without deciding,that the district court ruling on the meaning of the addendum was in fact a partial summary judgment.even if rule applies,however,century waived the rule notice requirement.
the entire colloquy before the court on the motion for partial summary judgment was as follows 
the court all right.well,you filed a blizzard of papers last week in this case.there some things that need ruling before we proceed with the selection of the jury.first of all,it was until i reviewed these papers for trial,i think,that i was aware that there are two franchises and two different offices.now,is it the fact that only one of the franchise agreements is in dispute here 
meraj yes,your honor.century has brought its claims with regard to office.we have brought our counterclaims only as to office.
century your honor,i agree with that with one clarification and that is our argument in the case is that the defendant was only entitled to a single credit and that that credit was drawn down by both franchises.
the court well,there are two agreements.
century yes.
the court the other office is still going.is that right 
century no,actually,both offices have been terminated.
the court well,i do understand this case,then.i was informed in this case by the pleadings that office was the office that we in dispute about.
century that correct,your honor,but the defendants have asserted a defense that the plaintiff did 
the court well,what happened to the other office 
century both offices have been terminated and are no longer operating.
the court the second office was terminated and there no dispute 
century that correct.
the court all right.that my question and you answered it.this matter of whether there or,it seems clear to me that each addendum applied to each franchise agreement.so i do see what that dispute is all about.
century well,your honor,if the court is going to rule that way,then office would not be an issue in this trial.
the court yes.well,that the way i rule.i can read the papers.
century okay.
aples.at.at no time during trial did counsel for century ask for additional time to respond or in any way complain about the timing of the court ruling.
a litigant preserves its right to the protection of rule notice requirement if it timely objects to proceeding in violation of the mandate.osbakken venable,cir.but if a litigant fails to object at the hearing on the motion,the notice requirement is waived.see summers state farm mut.auto.ins,cir,overruled on other grounds by mckennon nashville banner pub,d jarvis food serv,cir.the general requirement of timely objections is essential to prevent unnecessary retrials and to protect against sandbagging.century here waived its right to ten days notice because it failed to object to the court interpreting the addenda when the court raised the matter or even after the court gave its ruling.
relying on precedent from other circuits,green white,cir thacker whitehead,cir and hoopes equifax,cir,century contends that waiver occurs only when the nonmoving party actually briefs or argues the issues raised in the motion and is not prejudiced by the lack of notice.we do not read these opinions to so hold.in any event,to the extent that they hold that the notice requirement can be waived only by a party not prejudiced by insufficient notice,the opinions are contrary to the law of our circuit.in this circuit,when,as here,the nonmovant has waived the notice requirement,we need not consider whether it has suffered prejudice.
contract interpretation 
century next contends that even if the district court could properly rule on the meaning of the addenda when it did,its interpretation of the addenda was erroneous.we disagree.on the record before the court at the time of its ruling,the court interpretation was the only reasonable interpretation.
the parties briefs discuss whether the language of the addenda is unambiguous,and must therefore be interpreted by the court as a matter of law,without resort to any evidence outside the four corners of the document,or whether it is ambiguous and must be construed by the factfinder in light of extrinsic evidence.the question whether a contract is unambiguous can be a difficult one.it is not that rare for language to seem clear and definite until some extrinsic evidence demonstrates that the contracting parties used that language to mean something rather different.see generally margaret kniffin,corbin on contracts ed.
in this case,however,we are spared that difficulty.as we explain below,at the time of the district court ruling the only extrinsic evidence before it simply confirmed the natural reading of the language of the addenda.therefore,either the language is unambiguous and bears the meaning given it by the district court or the language is not so unambiguous as to foreclose the use of extrinsic evidence to aid in its construction,but the extrinsic evidence before the district court resolved any ambiguity in favor of the court interpretation.either way,we affirm the district court interpretation.see grant pharmacia upjohn,cir.
we begin with the natural reading.to repeat the language,each addendum states 
franchisor and franchisee hereby agree that franchisee will be afforded a credit against royalty fees payable to franchisor under paragraph of the agreement in the aggregate amount of twenty thousand dollars.this credit will be applied to royalties which accrue after the commencement date on a monthly basis at the rate of fifty percent until the full credit amount is applied.accordingly,franchisee shall be required to pay to franchisor only of the first forty thousand dollars of royalties accrued under the agreement after the commencement date.thereafter all royalty payments will return to the full amount provided for under the agreement.
aplt app.at.the addendum grants a credit against royalty fees.the royalty fees to which the credit applies are those payable under paragraph of the agreement.because each agreement concerns only one office or office credit certainly would seem to apply only to that franchise.when the addendum speaks of a credit in the aggregate amount of,it is aggregating the monthly credits,not the credits under multiple distinct franchise agreements.indeed,neither agreement makes any reference to the other franchise.
we are not persuaded by century contention that the addendum is ambiguous because it could have explicitly stated that the credit was exclusively applicable to office.the task of contract interpretation is not a game in which a party succeeds only by drafting a perfect contract.it is almost always possible to write a contract provision with greater precision,although often the possibility is not apparent until a dispute has arisen.contract interpretation is an altogether human endeavor to determine what is communicated by a given set of words.what is communicated here is rather clear.as the district court stated,i do see what that dispute is all about.
in some cases extrinsic evidence can demonstrate that the natural reading is not the reading intended by the parties to the contract.but that was not the situation here.the only extrinsic evidence presented to the district court when it ruled was that the addendum attached to each agreement was signed separately by the century representative one addendum was not just a photocopy of the other century maintained the agreements in separate files and schmaltzbach admitted that each credit addendum referred only to the agreement to which it was attached.this evidence did not undermine the natural reading of the addenda confirmed the reading that each addendum provided an independent credit.
thus,the district court ruled properly on the interpretation of the addendum.later in the trial additional evidence might have led the court to reconsider its interpretation.but if such evidence was admitted at trial,it was century responsibility to ask the court to reconside
