eternity global master fund limited eternity or the fund purchased credit default swaps cdss or the cds contracts from morgan guaranty trust company of new york and jpmorgan chase bank collectively,morgan in october.eternity appeals from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york mckenna,dismissing with prejudice its complaint alleging breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation by morgan in connection with the cdss.the cds contracts were written on the sovereign bonds of argentina and would be triggered upon the occurrence of a credit event,such that if argentina restructured or defaulted on that debt,eternity would have the right to put to morgan a stipulated amount of the bonds for purchase at par value.
in late november,the government of the republic of argentina,in the grip of economic crisis,initiated a voluntary debt exchange in which bondholders had the option of turning in their bonds for secured loans on terms less favorable except that the loans were secured by certain argentine federal tax revenues.eternity informed morgan that the voluntary debt exchange was a credit event that triggered morgan obligations under the cds contracts.morgan disagreed.
in february,eternity filed suit alleging breach of contract and fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation.morgan moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule b.in an unreported decision,the district court preserved eternity contract claim but dismissed the misrepresentation claims for want of the particularity required by rule b.eternity global master fund morgan guar.trust,civ,wl,at,eternity i.eternity amended its complaint in an effort to redress the deficiencies noted by the district court and morgan again moved to dismiss.the district court again held that eternity misrepresentation claims were insufficiently pled and went on to reconsider its ruling on the breach of contract claim.upon reconsideration,the court held that the claim failed as a matter of law.eternity global master fund morgan guar.trust,civ,wl,at june,eternity ii.
on appeal,eternity challenges the dismissal of its claims.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the dismissal of the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims but reverse the dismissal of the contract claim and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on behalf of its investors,eternity trades in global bonds,equities and currencies,including debt.during the relevant period,eternity investment portfolio included argentine sovereign and corporate bonds.in emerging markets such as argentina,a significant credit risk is country risk,the risk that economic,social,and political conditions and events in a foreign country will adversely affect an institution financial interests,including the possibility of nationalization or expropriation of assets,government repudiation of external indebtedness,and currency depreciation or devaluation.credit risk can be managed,however banks,investment funds and other institutions increasingly use financial contracts known as credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk in october,in light of argentina rapidly deteriorating political and economic prospects,eternity purchased cdss to hedge the credit risk on its investments.
by way of introduction,we briefly review the terminology,documentation,and structure of eternity credit default swaps.
terminology 
a credit default swap is the most common form of credit derivative,a contract which transfers credit risk from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller.protection buyers here,eternity can use credit derivatives to manage particular market exposures and and protection sellers here,morgan generally use credit derivatives to earn income and diversify their own investment portfolios simply put,a credit default swap is a bilateral financial contract in which a protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller,in return for a contingent payment if a predefined credit event occurs in the reference credit,the obligation on which the contract is written 
often,the reference asset that the protection buyer delivers to the protection seller following a credit event is the instrument that is being hedged but in emerging markets,an investor may calculate that a particular credit risk is reasonably correlated with the performance of the sovereign itself,so that as here the investor may seek to isolate and hedge country risk with credit default swaps written on some portion of the sovereign outstanding debt 
in many contexts a default is a simple failure to pay in a credit default swap,it references a stipulated bundle of credit events such as bankruptcy,debt moratoria and debt restructurings that will trigger the protection seller obligation to settle the contract via the swap mechanism agreed to between the parties the entire bundle is typically made subject to a materiality threshold the occurrence of a credit event triggers the swap,the protection seller obligation to pay on the contract according to the settlement mechanism.the contingent payment can be based on cash settlement or physical delivery of the reference asset,in exchange for a cash payment equal to the initial notional,face amount of the cds contract.a cds buyer holding a sufficient amount of the reference credit can simply tender it to the cds seller for payment but ownership of the reference credit prior to default is unnecessary.if a credit event occurs with respect to the obligation s named in a cds,and notice thereof has been given and the cds buyer has otherwise performed,the cds seller must settle.liquidity in a secondary market increases the usefulness of a cds as a hedging tool,though the limited depth of that market can make it difficult to offset positions prior to contract maturity.
documentation 
the principal issue dividing the parties is whether the cds contracts at issue are ambiguous in any material respect.an ambiguity exists where the terms of a contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.alexander alexander,v.these certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir quoting lightfoot union carbide,cir.
in this case,we assess ambiguity in the disputed cds contracts by looking to i the terms of the three credit default swaps ii the terms of the international swaps and derivatives association isda or the association master swap agreement,on which those swaps are predicated,iii isda credit derivatives are incorporated into the disputed contracts and iv the background customs,practices,and usages of the credit derivatives trade,id.because customs and usages matter,and because documentation promulgated by the isda was used by the parties to this dispute,we briefly review some relevant background.
the term derivatives references a vast array of privately negotiated counter and exchange traded transactions,including swaps,currency swaps,commodity price swaps and credit include credit default swaps a derivative is a bilateral contract that is typically negotiated by phone and followed by an exchange of confirmatory faxes that constitute the contract but do not specify such terms as events of default,representations and warranties,covenants,liquidated damages,and choice of law these and other terms are typically found in a master swap agreement,which,prior to standardization efforts that began in the,took the form of separate agreements for each transaction.
documentation of derivatives transactions has become streamlined,chiefly through industry adherence to master agreements promulgated by the isda.in,eternity and morgan entered the isda border master agreement,which governs,inter alia,the cds transactions disputed on appeal.each disputed cds also incorporates the isda credit derivatives definitions,the association first attempt at a comprehensive lexicon governing credit derivatives transactions last year,due to the rapid evolution of isda documentation for credit default swaps,the association began market implementation of the credit derivatives definitions which evidently constitutes a work in progress.see note,infra.
eternity credit default swaps 
eternity global master fund is managed by hfw capital,including its chief investment officer,alberto franco.in,franco engaged morgan to facilitate eternity participation in the argentine corporate debt market.fearing that a government debt crisis would impair the value of eternity argentine investments,franco sought to hedge using credit default swaps written on argentine sovereign bonds.in october,the fund entered into three such contracts.each cds incorporated i the isda master swap agreement,and ii the isda definitions.the total value of the contracts was million,as follows 
except as to value and duration,the terms were virtually identical,as follows 
i eternity would pay morgan a fixed periodic fee tied to the notional value of each respective credit default swap.
ii the swaps would be triggered upon occurrence of any one of four credit defined by the isda credit derivative respect to the argentine sovereign bonds failure to pay,obligation acceleration,and restructuring.
iii each cds called for physical settlement following a credit event,specifically 
a upon notification by either party to the other of a credit event,and confirmation via two publicly available sources of information,the wall street journal,and 
b delivery to morgan of the requisite amount of argentine sovereign bonds,
c morgan would pay eternity par value for the obligations tendered.
it is alleged and we therefore assume that eternity entered the swaps in reliance on morgan representations that it would provide access to a liquid secondary market that would enable the fund to divest the contracts prior to termination.
the parties dispute whether any of certain actions taken by argentina with respect to its debt obligations in november and december constituted a credit event.the district court thought not,and dismissed eternity contract claim at the pleading stage.eternity ii,wl,at.with the background and structure of the disputed cds contracts in mind,we turn to eternity principal allegations.
because we assume plaintiff factual allegations to be true on review of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,demuria hawkes,cir,the facts relating to argentina financial collapse are taken from eternity second amended complaint and any documents upon which it relies,see rothman gregor,cir citations omitted.
the contracts at issue were signed in october.by then,international financial markets had been speculating for months that argentina might default on its billion in government and other public debt.at an august meeting of bondholders in new york,morgan acknowledged the possibility of a default and advised that it was working with the argentine government on restructuring scenarios.on october,the effective date of the swap contracts at issue on this sent eternity a research report noting that there was a high implied probability of a restructuring in which bondholders would likely receive replacement securities with a rate of return.one day later,argentine president fernando de la rua asked holders to accept lower interest rates and longer maturities on approximately billion of government debt.
on november,the argentine government announced that a voluntary debt exchange would be offered to holders.according to various public decrees,willing bondholders could exchange their obligations for secured loans that would pay a lower rate of return over a longer term,but that would be secured by certain federal tax revenues.so long as the government made timely payments on the loans,the original obligations would be held in trust for the benefit of argentina if the government defaulted,however,bondholders would have recourse to the original obligations,which were to remain effective for the duration of their.from late november through early december,billions of dollars in sovereign bonds were exchanged for the loans.
the complaint alleges that the debt exchange amounted to a default because local creditors had no choice but to participate,and that the financial press adopted that characterization.on november,eternity served the first of three notices on morgan asserting that the planned debt exchange was a restructuring credit event as to all three cds contracts but morgan demurred.
on december,interim president adolfo rodriguez by the argentine congress on december to replace president de la a moratorium.on december,morgan notified eternity that the moratorium constituted a credit event and subsequently settled the outstanding million and million credit default swaps otherwise set to terminate on october,and march,respectively.according to morgan,the third swap valued at million had expired without being triggered,on december.
it is undisputed that the december moratorium was a trigger of eternity outstanding swaps in eternity view,however,the voluntary debt exchange had triggered morgan settlement obligations as early as november,as the fund had been insisting throughout november and december of that year.in that same period,eternity asked morgan to liquidate the swaps on a secondary market.notwithstanding morgan representations in february regarding the existence of a secondary market for the cdss,it refused to quote eternity any pricing,though it did offer to unwind the contracts by returning the premiums eternity had paid from october through november.
on february,eternity commenced this action alleging breach of contract and fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation.an amended complaint was filed three months later.morgan moved against the amended complaint pursuant to rules b and b.in support of the motion,morgan made voluminous submissions,including the relevant cds contracts,the isda credit derivatives definitions,and english translations of portions of relevant argentine public decrees.in an unreported decision,judge mckenna ruled that eternity had stated a claim for breach of contract,but that the misrepresentation claims had not been pleaded with the requisite particularity and dismissed those claims with leave to replead.eternity i,wl,at.
on november,eternity filed a second amended complaint,primarily to supplement facts bearing on its misrepresentation claims.morgan again moved to dismiss.in june,the district court ruled i that eternity again failed to plead fraud and negligent misrepresentation with the necessary particularity and ii upon reconsideration of its prior contrary decision,that eternity also failed to state a claim for breach of contract.eternity ii,wl,at.
judge mckenna dismissed the contract claim on the ground that argentina voluntary debt exchange was not a restructuring credit event,as a matter of law.id.at.the misrepresentation claims failed for want of particularity,eternity having failed to allege facts to show that,as of the time eternity entered the cds contracts,morgan knew or should have known that no secondary market would be available if eternity decided as it did to liquidate its position.see id.at.this appeal followed.
for the reasons set out below,we i reverse the district court dismissal of eternity contract claim and remand for further proceedings and ii affirm the dismissal of the claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation.
discussion 
we review de novo a grant of dismissal pursuant to rule b,citibank,cir,accepting as true the complaint factual allegations and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff favor,demuria,at.
this court has held that the office of a motion to dismiss is merely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint,not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.geisler petrocelli,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.id.discussing conley gibson,d.the indulgent standard evident in these precedents is codified in rule,which requires no more than a short and plain statement of a claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.with the exception of claims for fraud and under rule b must be pled with sufficiency of a complaint is judged by the liberal system of notice pleading set up by the federal rules.leatherman tarrant county narcotics intel.and coord.unit,d.at the pleading stage,then,t he issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.york ass of the bar,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
to make out a viable claim for breach of contract a complaint need only allege the existence of an agreement,adequate performance of the contract by the plaintiff,breach of contract by the defendant,and damages.harsco segui,cir.eternity alleges that the cds contracts are valid agreements that the fund satisfied its contractual obligations to morgan,
a paid its premiums 
b supplied the requisite notification and public information following the announcement of the voluntary debt exchange and 
c signaled its willingness to tender the necessary sovereign bonds 
that morgan refusal to settle the swaps was a breach of contract and that the fund was damaged as a result of morgan the loss of the million owed under the cds that expired prior to the moratorium announced december,and by consequential damages arising from morgan refusal to settle the other swaps in november.
the district court concluded that these pleadings were insufficient on the ground that the plain meaning of the cds contracts conveyed the parties unambiguous intention to exclude the voluntary debt exchange from the bundle of government actions that could qualify as a restructuring credit event.eternity ii,wl,at.we disagree.
the question is whether at this stage it can be decided as a matter of law that the voluntary debt exchange was not a restructuring credit event covered by the fund cds contracts with morgan.resolution of that issue turns on what the cds contracts say.under new york law t he fundamental,neutral precept of contract interpretation is that agreements are construed in accord with the parties intent.greenfield philles records.typically,the best evidence of intent is the contract itself if an agreement is complete,clear and unambiguous on its face,it must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.id.if the contract is ambiguous,extrinsic evidence may be considered to ascertain the correct and intended meaning of a term or terms.alexander alexander,at.a mbiguity exists where a contract term could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.world trade ctr,hartford fire ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.whether or not a writing is ambiguous is a question of law to be resolved by the courts,giancontieri.unless for some reason an ambiguity must be construed against the plaintiff,a claim predicated on a materially ambiguous contract term is not dismissible on the pleadings.
ambiguity in a contract is the inadequacy of the wording to classify or characterize something that has potential significance.a contract may be ambiguous when applied to one set of facts but not another,world trade ctr,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted if a contract is ambiguous as applied to a particular set of facts,a court has insufficient data to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim.with respect to the cds contracts at issue,certain intentions are unambiguous eternity and morgan intended that a restructuring of argentine sovereign debt would be a credit event triggering morgan obligations to settle the cds contracts,and that the definitions would govern whether a particular step taken by argentina was a restructuring credit event.but resolution of the dispositive the parties intended that an event such as the voluntary debt exchange would qualify as a restructuring credit not possible at this early stage of the litigation.
in support of its motion to dismiss,morgan submitted,inter alia,the isda credit derivatives definitions and english translations of portions of certain argentine decrees purporting to explain the mechanics of the government debt exchange program.
a.the isda definition of restructuring and the terms of argentina voluntary debt exchange 
by their terms,eternity credit default swaps could be triggered by any of four credit events failure to pay,obligation acceleration,and restructuring.to flesh out these terms,eternity and morgan incorporated by reference the isda credit derivatives definitions.eternity concedes that argentina voluntary debt exchange is a credit event only if it qualifies as a restructuring under of the definitions 
restructuring means that,with respect to one or more obligations,including as a result of an obligation exchange,any one or more of the following events occurs,is agreed between the reference entity or a governmental authority and the holder or holders of such obligation or is announced or otherwise decreed by a reference entity or a governmental authority in a form that is binding upon a reference entity,and such event is not provided for under the terms of such obligation in effect as of the later of the trade date and the date as of which such obligation is issued or incurred 
i a reduction in the rate or amount of interest payable or the amount of scheduled interest accruals 
ii a reduction in the amount of principal or premium payable at maturity or at scheduled redemption dates 
iii a postponement or other deferral of a date or dates for either a the payment or accrual of interest or b the payment of principal or premium 
iv a change in the ranking in priority of payment of any obligation,causing the subordination of such obligation or 
v any change in the currency or composition of any payment of interest or principal.
isda,credit derivatives definitions a emphasis added definitions.the obligations relevant to eternity credit default swaps are argentine sovereign bonds.
the basic terms of the voluntary debt exchange are undisputed.presidential decree,released november,declares at title ii reduction of the cost of argentine government debt,article 
t he ministry of economy is instructed to offer on voluntary terms the possibility of exchanging argentine government debt for secured loans or secured argentine government bonds,provided that the collateral offered or the change in debtor allows the argentine government to obtain lower interest rates for the argentine or provincial government sector.
emphasis added.the class of government debt referred to in article includes the sovereign bonds on which the disputed cds contracts are written.thus holders of those bonds were eligible to participate in the government exchange program.
under article of decree,any exchange would be carried out 
at par value at a ratio of one to one in the same currency as the exchanged,originally held obligation was denominated,provided that the interest rate on the secured loan for which each government debt transaction is exchanged is at least thirty percent less than that established in the instrument submitted for exchange,per the terms of issue.
emphasis added.under article,the ministry of the economy was authorized to appropriate funds belonging to the nation,certain federal tax revenues,for up to the sum required to honor the loans or other secured instruments for which any original obligations would be exchanged.
on november,the ministry of economy issued resolution government debt,which delineated the exchange mechanism contemplated in decree.under resolution,holders would have until on november,to submit offers of exchange to certain designated financial institutions.between that date and december,the government would decide which offers it would accept,after which the bondholders so selected would have until december to tender eligible securities.the exchanges would be settled on december,when former bondholders would receive the secured loans.
on december,the government approved i a secured loan agreement to govern the new obligations,and ii a trust agreement governing the disposition of the original bonds.the trust agreement provides that any bonds exchanged for secured loans would be placed in trust for the benefit of the republic of argentina.the complaint alleges that as of december,holders of approximately billion in argentine sovereign debt had tendered their bonds.
b.the voluntary debt exchange as a restructuring credit event 
eternity contends that argentina voluntary debt exchange qualifies as a restructuring credit event in four ways i as an obligation exchange under of the definitions that constituted a restructuring under and even if not an obligation exchange,as an ii extension,iii deferral,iv subordination of the original obligations such that those obligations were restructured within the meaning of.morgan counters,and the district court agreed,that the voluntary debt exchange was not a restructuring within the meaning of the cds contracts because it was not an obligation exchange,nor did it affect the payment,value,or priority of the original obligations.eternity ii,wl,at.
i the voluntary debt exchange as an obligation exchange 
under the definitions,an obligation exchange is the mandatory transfer of any securities,obligations or assets to holders of obligations in exchange for such obligations.when so transferred,such securities,obligations or assets will be deemed to be obligations.definitions,supra,emphasis added.section states that an obligation exchange can qualify as a restructuring,id.a,and further provides 
if an obligation exchange has occurred,the determination as to whether one of the events described under section a i to v has occurred will be based on a comparison of the terms of the obligation immediately before such obligation exchange and the terms of the resulting obligation immediately following such obligation exchange.
id.c emphases added.thus if the voluntary debt exchange is an obligation exchange,then it is a restructuring if the terms of the secured compared with the terms of the exchanged sovereign that one of the events that constitutes a restructuring under has occurred.id.morgan concedes that such a comparison would show that the voluntary debt exchange was a restructuring credit event the secured loans undeniably provide a lower return over a longer maturity than the original bonds,two features that qualify as restructuring occurrences under.see id.a i,iii.
morgan argues,however,that because of the definitions states that an obligation exchange is a mandatory transfer of one set of obligations for another,and because participation in the government debt exchange program was voluntary,a comparison of the two instruments is irrelevant.
the term mandatory transfer as it appears in of the isda definitions is not,and is therefore ambiguous if it could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively,in the context of each cds agreement and the customs,practices,and usages as generally understood in the credit derivatives trade.world trade ctr,at.morgan makes the intuitively appealing argument that a mandatory transfer can not be an exchange offered on voluntary terms.the district court was persuaded by this argument,citing black law dictionary 
argentina voluntary debt exchange program can not qualify as mandatory.eternity made a choice.along with a substantial portion of holders of those argentine obligations,eternity chose to exchange the obligations for secured loans.second am.compl.despite eternity attempt to argue that mandatory should be read to encompass situations that are economically coercive,the plain meaning of the term mandatory does not permit such a finding.the term mandatory is defined by black law dictionary ed as o f,relating to,or constituting a command or required.the choice made by eternity may have been unpalatable,but that does not make it mandatory.
eternity ii,wl,at.a dictionary definition,however,does not take into account what mandatory transfer means in the context of a particular industry.
eternity makes the less obvious but plausible argument that to protection buyers such as itself,a mandatory transfer includes any obligation exchange achieved by economic coercion,regardless of its classification as voluntary or mandatory by the initiating party.according to black,economic coercion is c onduct that constitutes improper use of economic power to compel another to submit to the wishes of one who wields it.black law dictionary ed.assuming that the government debt exchange was economically coercive,voluntary participation by the coerced bondholders appears to resemble mandatory action.at the same time,from argentina perspective,the exchange may have been voluntary in fact,the government may have had the intention to honor its debt obligations to nonparticipants without delay or reduction.but argentina is not control,particularly when one considers eternity allegation that morgan was an architect of the debt exchange.a proper interpretation of the cds contracts must be drawn from the contract language and,where necessary,from other indicia of the parties intent.section is silent as to whose perspective dictates whether an obligation exchange has occurred,the issuer or the holder,or the investment press or community,and the parties competing interpretations are plausible.we can not resolve that ambiguity at this stage,as the district court took no submissions on the customs and usages of the credit derivatives industry,and the parties point us to no definitive source that resolves the difficulty.
although the cds contracts are silent on the precise meaning of mandatory transfer,the isda has not ignored the issue.in its complaint,eternity refers to a draft user guide to the definitions,publication of which appears to have been tabled indefinitely the draft guide explained that the reference to mandatory transfer in the definition of obligation exchange should be read as clarifying rather than restricting the restructuring definition and should not be read to mean that the optional exchange of obligations for other assets can not constitute a restructuring.the user guide to the definitions was never formally promulgated,but it does indicate that,at least as of the time eternity purchased the credit default swaps,the meaning of mandatory transfer was perhaps more than morgan contends.
finally,in drawing its conclusion that the voluntary debt exchange was not an obligation exchange,the district court appears to have relied on its observation that eternity made a choice to participate in the voluntary debt exchange.eternity ii,wl,at emphasis added.any such reliance was misplaced.whether eternity actually owned argentina sovereign bonds and whether it chose to participate in the government debt swap if it did is irrelevant to whether the exchange was a restructuring credit event under the disputed cds contracts.the swaps were triggered if the government defaulted on its own debt obligations,upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to those obligations as a class.the cds contracts did not require or contemplate that the credit protection buyer here,eternity would hold the reference bonds except as may become necessary to exercise the put.thus,if the argentine government voluntary debt exchange was a restructuring within the meaning of the definitions,the cds contracts were triggered any election eternity might have made with respect to its own bond holdings does not matter.
we go on to consider eternity arguments that the government debt exchange was a restructuring even if it was not an obligation exchange.
ii the effect of the voluntary debt exchange on argentina original debt obligations 
under the definitions,a restructuring credit event occurs when any one of five enumerated events occurs,is agreed to or is announced with respect to an obligation upon which a credit default swap is written.definitions,supra,a.these include 
i a reduction in the rate of payable interest or principal on the obligation,id.a i ii 
ii a postponement of payment on interest or principal,id.a iii and 
iii a subordination of the obligation that did not exist prior to the occurrence of the restructuring credit event,id.a iv.
eternity contends that each of these three events occurred with respect to certain classes of argentine sovereign bonds as a consequence of the government voluntary debt exchange.
the district court held that under the terms of the voluntary debt exchange,the obligations submitted into the trust themselves remained unchanged.eternity ii,wl,at.that observation may be sound as far as it goes.but provides that a restructuring results if any event defined in the section occurs with respect to one or more obligations.thus,the proper inquiry is whether the debt exchange caused a restructuring to occur with respect to any of the argentine sovereign bonds for the purpose of this analysis,it is useful to consider separately the impact of the debt exchange on obligations that were exchanged pursuant to the government voluntary offer participating obligations,and on those retained by holders who elected to forgo the government program nonparticipating obligations.to negative the possibility that there was a restructuring credit event,it must be clear that none of the events described in a i v occurred with respect either to the participating obligations or to the nonparticipating obligations.
a participating obligations 
participating obligations were ultimately deposited with the central bank of the republic of argentina pursuant to article of presidential decree,issued november.six weeks later,presidential decree approved both a secured loan agreement to govern the terms of the loans that would replace the bonds tendered in the exchange,and a trust agreement that governed the status of obligations so tendered.eternity contends that a restructuring credit event occurred with respect to tendered obligations because their terms were extended payment was suspended for the duration of their.
maturity extension.on november,the ministry of economy promulgated resolution which,inter alia,defined the sovereign bonds eligible to participate in the voluntary exchange and,at annex ii,delineated the exchange mechanism for those securities,including the provision that e ligible securities whose total or partial original maturity is prior to december,shall receive secured loans that will extend the average life of the eligible security by years.emphasis added.morgan does not directly respond to eternity contention that this wording extends the maturity of certain debt obligations within the class referenced in the disputed cds contracts.this provision creates a question of fact as to whether the extension constitutes a restructuring credit event under iii of the definitions.
suspension of payment.under the terms of the voluntary debt exchange primarily laid down in decree,participating obligations were placed in trust.the trust agreement named caja de valores as trustee and provided that the government of argentina would acquire participation certificates in the trust,the underlying assets of which are the argentine government debt securities that participated in the exchange.by virtue of its participation,the republic of argentina was the original beneficiary of the trust.decree further provided that for purposes of determining the outstanding amount of argentine government debt or of determining the national debt ceiling,tendered obligations shall not be included in such calculations for so long as the argentine federal government is the beneficiary of any payments made in this regard.this provision implements decree,promulgated november,which amended decree to provide that any obligations placed in trust pursuant to the voluntary debt exchange would be excluded from the calculation of argentina national debt.according to decree 
such an arrangement was called for because,even when securities subject to exchange are held in the manner contemplated it is the argentine federal government that is the beneficiary of the economic rights thereby granted,with the liabilities thus becoming confused with the credits and offsetting same,inasmuch as the creditors of the argentine republic can under no circumstances make simultaneous claims to credit rights that are granted by government securities in addition to those granted by secured loans substituting same.
emphasis added.
eternity contends that these provisions suspended argentina liability on the bonds held in trust because i former bondholders could not enforce the original instruments while they were held in trust and ii argentina role as both beneficiary and obligor on the trust assets suspended,at least temporarily,any enforceable legal obligation created by those debt instruments.we think that there is a question,at least on the present record,as to whether this trust mechanism constituted postponement or other deferral of a date or dates for payment of those obligations,within the meaning of a iii.
morgan identifies three provisions of the trust agreement as support for its contention that the voluntary debt exchange did not affect argentina obligations in any of the ways contemplated in.two of the three provisions refer directly or indirectly to a secured loan agreement,a copy of which has been furnished to us,apparently from a website but morgan otherwise voluminous submissions do not include a translation into english.that omission frustrates a complete analysis because we are left to guess whether,given the trust agreement repeated references to particular provisions of the loan agreement,the latter has any bearing on the debt obligations placed in trust.
moreover,the language cited to establish the continued effectiveness of argentine bonds placed in trust is indefinite.under section c of the trust agreement whereas clause 
in accordance with the provisions of article ten of the loan agreement,an essential condition of same is that the securities remain effective,with respect to both the economic and political rights of same,in such a manner that,under certain circumstances,their owners can recover fee simple thereof,all until such time as the secured loans have been settled 
emphases added.the economic and political rights of tendered obligations remain effective in such a manner that,under certain circumstances they can be recovered in fee simple.but it is wholly unclear what such a manner might mean on this record,or in what circumstances recovery would be allowed,or what it means for the bonds to remain effective when under decree they can not be enforced by the former bondholders.in any case,it appears that tendered obligations remain effective only insofar as may be necessary to fulfill the contingency that former bondholders may one day have a right to reclaim their original obligations.whether this qualified and contingent effectiveness constitutes a restructuring credit event is a question that can not be resolved on the pleadings.
morgan also invokes section of the trust agreement,which provided that the transfer of sovereign bonds to the trust shall include assignment of all present and future economic rights of those obligations.this seemingly unqualified transfer may bear on the effectiveness of the obligations once they are part of the trust corpus,but that conclusion can not be drawn from the text.indeed,the whereas clause relied on by morgan explicitly contemplates that the effectiveness of the assets in trust will be less than their effectiveness in the hands of the original of the mechanics of the transfer itself.
finally,morgan points to section of the trust agreement,which directs the trustee to 
collect principal and interest payments due with respect to the trust assets and pari passu shall pay with such amounts payments due under the participation certificates held by the republic of argentina,until such time as the participation certificates are fully amortized,except upon the occurrence of a default as defined in the secured loan agreement.
emphases added.the force of morgan argument is blunted by the absence of the secured loan agreement nonetheless,the quoted language begs the question if,as eternity contends,the government legal obligation to make bond payments was suspended or postponed when argentina became the trust beneficiary of assets on which it was obligated to pay,were any interest payments actually due on the original obligations 
b nonparticipating obligations 
eternity alleges that at some point during the voluntary debt exchange process,argentina economy minister announced that the restructured loans held domestically will have the highest priority for payment.according to eternity,this announcement effectively subordinated the original obligations to the secured loans,and was thus a credit event under,which includes a change in the ranking in priority of payment of any obligation,causing the subordination of such obligation.definitions a iv.morgan disagrees,primarily on the ground that there is no language in the domestic exchange that changes the rank in priority of payment on the existing obligations.appellees br.at.
at the pleading stage,eternity was required to furnish a short and plain statement of its claim for breach of contract.a.the allegations concerning subordination,which recite the isda definition as well as the official statement referenced above,are both short and plain.section a iv of the definitions,which says that subordination is a reduction in the ranking in priority of payment of any obligation,does not in terms exclude policy declarations such as the one allegedly announced by argentina economy minister.true,subordination may denote more limited circumstances,such as a formal,contractual subordination of a particular debt.but that reading is not compelled by the wording of a iv.
the isda promulgated a restructuring supplement to the definitions in april which included b pari passu ranking section a iv,a provision that speaks directly to the definition of subordination under a iv
