this case presents an issue of first impression in california antitrust law whether the defense is available to defendants accused of.we hold that it is.
retail pharmacies plaintiffs sued pharmaceutical companies defendants alleging,asserting claims for violation of the cartwright act bus,et and for restitution and injunctive relief under the california unfair competition law ucl,et.defendants asserted as an affirmative defense that plaintiffs all of the claimed overcharges to their customers.discovery demonstrated that they did pass on the charges,and plaintiffs further admitted that they sought no other damages,such as lost or delayed sales,aside from the claimed overcharges.
plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication on the defense,contending that it is not recognized in california,relying primarily on hanover shoe united shoe mach,d hanover shoe,which rejected the defense,and the legislative history of the cartwright act.defendants filed their own motion,contending that california never adopted the hanover shoe holding and that the language of the cartwright act makes clear that plaintiffs in an antitrust action can not recover for an overcharge passed on to a subsequent purchaser.
the trial court decided the in favor of defendants,concluding that the defense is available in california,and that plaintiffs did not suffer any compensable injury within the meaning of section and thus could not recover on the cartwright act claim.the court also concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a ucl claim because they had not lost money or property and,alternatively,were not eligible for restitution.the trial court thus granted summary judgment.we affirm.
background 
the parties and the pleadings 
plaintiffs are retail pharmacies located in california defendants are,with two exceptions,companies that manufacture,market,distribute pharmaceutical products throughout the united states defendants also manufacture,market,distribute similar pharmaceutical products in canada where,unlike in the united states,the products are subject to pricing limitations.
plaintiffs action sought treble damages,restitution,and injunctive relief,alleging that defendants fixed the prices of their pharmaceuticals in violation of the cartwright act and the ucl.the case came at issue on the third amended complaint,which alleged that plaintiffs were injured by defendants purported because they have paid more than they otherwise would have or should have paid in the absence of the d efendants violations specifically,plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to eliminate price competition and fix prices in the market by,among other things,using canadian prices as a floor or minimum price for defendants products.
each defendant filed a separate answer,denying plaintiffs allegations and asserting as an affirmative defense that plaintiffs claims were barred on the ground plaintiffs passed on any alleged overcharge to third parties and therefore did not suffer a compensable injury.
the case was designated as complex and assigned to the honorable ronald sabraw.
over plaintiffs objection,and without deciding whether the defense was available in california,judge sabraw permitted defendants to conduct discovery that is relevant to the pass on defense.the resulting discovery included requests for production of documents,requests for admissions,form interrogatories,special interrogatories,and depositions.multiple discovery disputes ensued,resulting in detailed discovery orders providing the parties with guidance as to the discovery to be produced and setting schedules for the production of written discovery and the taking of depositions.in one such order,entered on may,judge sabraw concluded that defendants request that plaintiffs compile information and produce reports regarding their purchases and sale of certain specified drugs was neither overly burdensome nor oppressive,explaining no p laintiff has submitted a declaration describing how the information is maintained,how it must be retrieved,and the burden of retrieval and organization.the deposition testimony of the witnesses for five plaintiffs suggests that the information sought is kept by each of the p laintiffs in readily retrievable electronic form and that it can be accessed and organized by p laintiffs without undue burden.judge sabraw then ordered plaintiffs to produce,among other things,all responsive purchasing,pricing and documents and information,including in electronic form where appropriate,within days,with any disputes over the production of the data to be resolved with the assistance of information technology consultants retained by both sides.judge sabraw also ordered each plaintiff to provide a narrative describing that p laintiff pricing and practices.
the resulting narratives,as well as deposition testimony of the persons most knowledgeable and plaintiffs responses to written discovery,revealed the following salient facts,which are essentially undisputed.
defendants sell their drugs to wholesalers at a price referred to as the wholesale acquisition cost wac.the wholesalers resell the drugs to plaintiffs at prices using a formula mathematically tied to the wac,called the average wholesale price awp,which apparently represents a benchmark price published in lists by companies unrelated to defendants.as a result,when defendants prices increase,the cost of drugs to plaintiffs increases by the same percentage amount.so,plaintiffs pay the full amount of the alleged overcharge,defined in plaintiffs brief as the difference between what plaintiffs actually paid and what they would have paid in the absence of the conspiracy.
plaintiffs sell the drugs to two groups of customers,also on the basis of the awp those with insurance or a drug benefit plan offered by either a private entity or the government,which in turn pay customers claims on their behalf and uninsured or customers.the vast majority of customers are covered by payers,which reimburse plaintiffs at a contractually or statutorily fixed amount,predetermined as a percentage of the awp plus a dispensing fee,which provides plaintiffs a percentage profit above their acquisition cost.as to the sales to customers,plaintiffs charge a set percentage of the awp,and sometimes a dispensing fee,which could result in plaintiffs receiving a price above their acquisition cost.the result of this is that each time defendants increase their prices for a product,plaintiffs increase the price they charge their customers by at least the same amount.and the higher defendants prices,the higher plaintiffs the higher their gross profits.
in sum,discovery demonstrated two undisputed facts plaintiffs passed on to their customers all claimed overcharges,and plaintiffs waived any claims for damages not based on the alleged overcharge,claiming no lost or delayed sales,or any other diminution in business stated conversely,the only damages plaintiffs sought to recover were the claimed overcharges.
the motions 
on august,plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication on the defense,seeking an order striking it on the ground it was unavailable as a matter of law.plaintiffs argued that the defense could not be asserted against their cartwright act claims based on the united states supreme court opinion in hanover shoe,supra,d,the legislative history of the cartwright act,and public policy.plaintiffs also argued that the defense was inapplicable to the calculation of restitution under their ucl claim 
on september,defendants filed a joint opposition to plaintiffs motion.they also filed a joint for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication regarding issues.defendants argued that the plain language of the cartwright act demonstrates plaintiffs can not recover damages they did not sustain and that hanover shoe has not been adopted in california.alternatively,defendants argued that even if a defense is not generally available under california law,such a defense should be permitted here where it is easy to prove that plaintiffs have not been damaged.defendants also argued that the theory defeated plaintiffs ucl claim.
on december,judge sabraw issued a tentative ruling granting defendants and denying plaintiffs motion as moot.on december and,in response to statements contained in the tentative ruling,plaintiffs filed two separate requests for judicial notice of the legislative history of the antitrust improvements acts of act and california amendment to the cartwright act,and the amicus curiae brief filed on behalf of the state of california in illinois brick illinois,d illinois brick.judge sabraw granted both requests 
the motions came on for hearing on december.judge sabraw heard lengthy argument,following which he took the motions under submission.
on december,judge sabraw issued a order containing a comprehensive analysis of the issues presented,concluding that defendants could assert the defense to defeat plaintiffs antitrust claims i n defending a claim under the cartwright act,a defendant can present evidence that it has no liability or that its damages are lessened because the plaintiff has passed on the alleged price overcharge and therefore has either suffered no injury or has limited its damages.this ruling was based primarily on the language of the statute,which limits recovery to recovery three times the damages sustained.judge sabraw read the phrase damages sustained as referring to the actual loss incurred by the p laintiffs,and concluded that because the undisputed facts demonstrate that if d efendants ever overcharged p laintiffs as a result of the alleged conspiracy,the p laintiffs sustained no damages because they increased their prices to their customers by at least the same dollar amount.if p laintiffs have not sustained actual damages,then they can not prevail on their claim.judge sabraw thus granted summary adjudication for defendants on the cartwright act claims.
as to the ucl claim,judge sabraw concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue this claim because they had not lost money or property as required for standing under section.alternatively,he concluded that plaintiffs could not be awarded monetary relief under section because they did not have an ownership interest in whatever funds they paid as a result of any overcharge and thus were ineligible for restitution.judge sabraw thus granted summary adjudication for defendants on the ucl claim.having disposed of all of plaintiffs claims,judge sabraw granted summary judgment for defendants.
judgment pursuant to the december,order was entered on january,from which plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.

hanover shoe 
hanover shoe,supra,d,the focal point of the motions below,was an action by plaintiff hanover shoe,hanover shoe,a shoe manufacturer,against united shoe machinery united shoe,a manufacturer of equipment used in the process.the action alleged that united shoe had monopolized the shoe industry in violation of the sherman act,by its practice of only leasing,and refusing to sell,its machinery.at.hanover shoe sought damages,trebled under section of the clayton act,for the overcharges,amounting to the difference between what it had paid united shoe in shoe machine rentals and what it would have paid had united shoe been willing to sell those machines.ibid.
united shoe countered that hanover shoe suffered no legally cognizable injury because any illegal overcharge was reflected in the price it charged its customers for its shoes,arguing that if hanover shoe had purchased the machines at a lower price,it would have charged less for the shoes sold to its short,that hanover shoe suffered no loss from the antitrust violation.hanover shoe,supra,at.
the district court awarded hanover shoe damages of.the court of appeals affirmed the finding of liability,but disagreed with the district court on certain questions relating to the damage award.hanover shoe,united shoe machinery cir.
in an opinion written by justice white,the supreme court reversed the court of appeals on questions relating to the damage award.and as apt to the issue before us,the court held that hanover shoe proved injury and the amount of its damages within the meaning of section of the clayton act when it proved that united shoe had overcharged it and showed the amount of the overcharge,and the possibility that it might have recouped the overcharge by passing it on to its customers was not relevant in the assessment of its damages we hold that the buyer is equally entitled to damages if he raises the price for his own product.as long as the seller continues to charge the illegal price,he takes from the buyer more than the law allows.at whatever price the buyer sells,the price he pays the seller remains illegally high,and his profits would be greater were his costs lower.hanover shoe,supra,at.
justice white gave two reasons for the holding.first,establishing the amount of the overcharge passed on to the consumer would present insurmountable evidentiary problems.as he put it,a wide range of factors influence a company pricing policies.normally the impact of a single change in the relevant conditions can not be measured after the fact indeed a businessman may be unable to state whether,had one fact been different a single supply less expensive,general economic conditions more buoyant,or the labor market tighter,for example,he would have chosen a different price.equally difficult to determine,in the real economic world rather than an economist hypothetical model,is what effect a change in a company price will have on its total sales.finally,costs per unit for a different volume of total sales are hard to estimate.even if it could be shown that the buyer raised his price in response to,and in the amount of,the overcharge and that his margin of profit and total sales had not thereafter declined,there would remain the nearly insuperable difficulty of demonstrating that the particular plaintiff could not or would not have raised his prices absent the overcharge or maintained the higher price had the overcharge been discontinued.hanover shoe,supra,at.
secondary to the nearly insuperable difficulty of establishing the amount of overcharge passed on,justice white also expressed concern that if a direct purchaser such as hanover shoe were not allowed to sue for overcharges passed on to indirect purchasers,antitrust violators would retain the fruits of their illegality because indirect purchasers would have only a tiny stake in the lawsuit and would thus lack the incentive to bring an antitrust action.hanover shoe,supra,at.
though they will be discussed in detail post,three things about hanover shoe deserve mention here.the first is that the opinion holds as it does without analysis of the language of the clayton act.the second is that the court did not create an absolute bar to the defense in all situations.it recognize d that there might be instance,when an overcharged buyer has a contract,thus making it easy to prove that he has not been the considerations requiring that the defense not be permitted in this case would not be present.we also recognize that where no differential can be proved between the price unlawfully charged and some price that the seller was required by law to charge,establishing damages might require a showing of loss of profits to the buyers.hanover shoe,supra,at.third,and as our colleagues in division five would later observe,hanover shoe presented a particularly complicated problem with respect to the issue.custom kitchen,d.custom kitchen.
though hanover shoe focused on antitrust defendants and the proper limits of defensive arguments,it nevertheless suggested something about the nature of antitrust injury and the category of purchasers who might be viewed as having experienced it.nine years later,the supreme court addressed the issue directly in illinois brick,supra.
illinois brick and its aftereffects 
illinois brick was the of hanover shoe,addressing whether the theory could be used offensively by an indirect purchaser plaintiff against an alleged violator.illinois brick,supra,at.illinois brick and its manufactured and distributed concrete block,selling primarily to masonry contractors who then submitted bids to general contractors in charge of construction projects for public entities,such as counties,municipalities,housing authorities,and school districts.plaintiff state of illinois brought an action on behalf of itself and local government entities seeking treble damages under section of the clayton act,alleging that defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to fix the prices of the concrete block,the inflated prices of which were ultimately absorbed by the end purchasers of the product.id.at.
defendants sought partial summary judgment against all plaintiffs that were indirect purchasers of concrete block,contending that as a matter of law only direct purchasers could sue for the alleged overcharge.illinois brick,supra,at.the district court granted summary judgment,but the court of appeals reversed,holding that indirect purchasers can recover treble damages for an illegal overcharge if they can prove that the overcharge was passed on to them through intervening links in the distribution chain.id.at.
the supreme court disagreed.in another opinion by justice white,this time six to three,the court agreed with defendants,holding that plaintiffs as indirect purchasers of the concrete block were not the parties injured in their business or property within the meaning of section and therefore lacked standing to sue in federal antitrust cases.only the direct purchaser was the injured party.illinois brick,supra,at.the court reached this result in two steps.id.at.
the court first reasoned that the rule prohibiting use of the theory must apply equally to plaintiffs and defendants because allowing offensive but not defensive use of would create a serious risk of multiple liability for defendants.illinois brick,supra,at.moreover,the court was concerned that p ermitting the use of theories under section essentially would transform actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers.id.at.finally,the court expressed concern that granting standing to indirect purchasers would result in of the antitrust laws.id.at.
in the wake of the supreme court holding that indirect purchasers lacked standing,numerous states enacted illinois brick repealer amendments.one such state was california,where the amendment took the form of assembly bill,which added the following language to section this action may be brought by any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter,regardless of whether such injured person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant.the statute enacting the amendment declared that it does not constitute a change in,but is declaratory of,the existing law.stats,ch.so,while indirect purchasers lack standing to bring an action for treble damages under the federal antitrust law pursuant to illinois brick,such purchasers can pursue a claim in california.as discussed in detail below,this amendment to the cartwright act,as well as other amendments,are heavily relied on by plaintiffs 
california cases 
few california authorities have even mentioned the issue or hanover shoe in the almost years since its publication.and the only three court of appeal cases with any meaningful mention of the issue have explicitly recognized that whether or not the defense is available in california is an open question 
the first case was custom kitchen,supra,d,which involved a class of indirect purchasers of glass containers who alleged that the corporate manufacturers of glass containers had engaged in a conspiracy to set noncompetitive prices for the containers in violation of the cartwright act and the ucl.id.at.the trial court denied class certification.our colleagues in division five reversed.
arguing against class certification,which largely hinged on whether the class would be able to prove that defendants overcharges were to them,defendants contended that the considerations which persuaded the court in hanover shoe,supra.to reject a defense should convince this court that the class proposed herein can not demonstrate on a generalized basis that illegal overcharges were passed on to its members.custom kitchen,supra,d at.the court first responded that,it is important to point out that the facts of hanover shoe presented a particularly complicated problem with respect to the issue.the product involved,shoe manufacturing machinery,was not itself resold by plaintiff.in effect,the court was being asked to determine whether plaintiff pricing decision for shoes reflected the illegal overcharge for the machinery which was used in their manufacture.where the product in question is ultimately sold to the consumer,and is largely unchanged in form from the manufacturer to the indirect purchaser,assessing whether the manufacturer overcharges were passed on is less difficult the insurmountable difficulties found to exist in hanover shoe in proving injury are not apparent in the record before us.id.at.
then,after concluding that the issue of injury can be proven on a basis,the court said that it should also be pointed out that both plaintiff and defendants have invoked the theory in this case.as we have seen,in order to demonstrate that plaintiff and the proposed class were injured by the alleged conspiracy,plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants illegal overcharges were passed on to them in the form of higher prices for glass containers.defendants have also invoked the theory,but have used it defensively instead of offensively.defendants argue that the indirect purchasers in this case sustained no injury because they passed on any overcharges to their customers further down the chain of distribution.the trial court was apparently of the view that because california has rejected illinois brick illinois,supra,and has allowed indirect purchasers to maintain a cause of action under the cartwright act,the defendant should be able to assert this defense.whether defendants can bar class certification or negate injury by showing plaintiff and the class passed on the overcharge is a question that has not been addressed by any california court,and it would be premature to resolve it at this juncture because we do not have an adequate factual record.however,even if a plaintiff has passed on the entire overcharge,he or she is not per se precluded from otherwise proving injury.id.at.
sixteen years later came two companion cases also involving the issue of class certification in cartwright act cases,both of which stated that this issue of the availability of a defense in antitrust law still remains an open question in california morgan.superior court th,fn,d and global minerals metals superior court th,fn,d 
we now answer that open question.
the cartwright act requires that plaintiffs suffer a compensable injury 
as quoted above,section,subdivision a provides that a ny person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter,may sue therefor and recover three times the damages sustained by him or her recovery for the antitrust plaintiff is three times the damages sustained.what does that phrase mean 
as we explained in macisaac waste management collection recycling,th,d macisaac,the rules governing statutory construction in california are.o ur primary task is to determine the lawmakers intent,which we are to do using a process.id.at,d.we first look to the words of the statute themselves the legislature chosen language is the most reliable indicator of its intent because it is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.citation.we give the words of the statute a plain and commonsense meaning unless the statute specifically defines the words to give them a special meaning.citations.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,our task is at an end id.at,d.
when the plain meaning of the statute text does not resolve the interpretive question,we must proceed to the second step of the inquiry.macisaac,supra,th at,d.in this step,we may turn to rules or maxims of construction,and w e may also look to a number of extrinsic aids,including the statute legislative history,to assist us in our interpretation,footnote omitted.
we then described the third step if ambiguity remains after resort to secondary rules of construction and to the statute legislative history,then we must cautiously take the third and final step of the interpretive process.citation.in this phase of the process,we apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.citation.where an uncertainty exists,we must consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.thus,i n determining what the legislature intended we are bound to consider not only the words used,but also other matters,such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy and contemporaneous construction.citation.macisaac,supra,th at,d.accord,day city of fontana cal th,d,pacific gas electric,supra,cal th,d.
consistent with these guidelines,we must first examine the language of section to ascertain whether it evidences an intent to allow plaintiffs to maintain a cartwright act case even though they themselves have sustained no injury.we conclude that the answer is no.put conversely,we hold that the defense is available to defendants and,as applied here,defeats plaintiffs who have passed on all the claimed overcharges.in the language of the cartwright act,plaintiffs have no damages sustained.
the term damages sustained is not defined in the cartwright act.however,it is in other places and cases and,as will be seen,those authorities hold that the phrase refers to actual financial loss suffered.but two early california cases addressing the issue of damages in the context of the cartwright act also bear on the question,and we begin with discussion of those cases.
the first case is krigbaum sbarbaro,krigbaum.krigbaum,a real estate broker,filed an antitrust action against the stockholders of a bank,claiming that defendants colluded to prevent him from acquiring certain property suitable for,doing so,he alleged,so they could purchase the property themselves and secure a monopoly on the wine industry.id.at.defendants demurred for failure to state a claim,which the trial court sustained.id.at.the court of appeal affirmed,holding that the complaint did not state a cause of action under the cartwright act.id.at.
the court reasoned that plaintiff did not allege he suffered an injury as a result of a restraint in trade.at most,he alleged that he suffered an injury as a result of the wrongful acts of the defendants,which does not constitute a cause of action under the cartwright act.rather,the court explained,to be injured in business or property,within the contemplation of the cartwright act is where the injury has directly resulted from the fact of the existence of the is to say,where the business or property has directly sustained injury solely by reason of the restrictions in trade or commerce which are fostered by such trust or combination.in other words,while one whose business or property has been injured solely because of the restrictions in trade carried out by a trust organized and maintained for that purpose may maintain an action under the provisions of the law for double the damages he has actually suffered from the injury so inflicted,yet he could not maintain an action based upon said law if the injury,although directly the result of the wrongful acts of the trust or the constituent members thereof,did not arise by reason of the restrictions in trade or commerce carried out by such trust or combination.krigbaum,supra.at.importantly for our purposes,the court recognized that recovery was only available for the damages the plaintiff actually suffered as a result of the antitrust violation.
the other case is overland union,overland.the claim there was by a publishing company which alleged that a cartel of publishing companies known as the printers board of trade had violated the cartwright act by engaging in and in the publishing market,thereby eliminating competition among the cartel members.id.at.again,the trial court sustained a demurrer on the ground that plaintiff did not allege it had been damaged within the meaning of the cartwright act.id.at.we affirmed,holding that if plaintiff could secure union labor and continue to operate its business,the activities of the printers board of trade in restricting competition among its own members would not injure plaintiff in the least.it is alleged that these practices have continued for three years.apparently they have not injured plaintiff,but have probably meant to it a business opportunity plaintiff can not maintain an action against the printers board of trade because of these alleged practices without pleading and proving special damage to his business or property by reason thereof.there are no facts alleged in the complaint showing damage to plaintiff because of said defendant methods of doing business.id.at.
overland holds that an antitrust plaintiff must have special damage.it also teaches that a plaintiff who benefits from the alleged collusion lacks a cartwright act cause of action.this is the situation here,where the result of the passing on of the claimed overcharges is that plaintiffs gross profits are higher.in sum,the only two cartwright act cases remotely addressing the issue demonstrate the plaintiffs action has no merit.
caci,the judicial council of california civil jury instruction on damages under the cartwright act,is instructive.it provides if you decide that name of plaintiff has proved claim against name of defendant,you also must decide how much money will reasonably compensate name of plaintiff for the harm.this compensation is called damages.the amount of damages must include an award for all harm that was caused by name of defendant,even if the particular harm could not have been anticipated.name of plaintiff must prove the amount of damages the following are the specific items of damages claimed by name of plaintiff.loss of reasonably anticipated sales and profits.an increase in name of plaintiff expenses.insert other applicable item of damage.this instruction clearly contemplates that the damages recoverable under the cartwright act are intended to compensate the injured plaintiff for actual monetary loss suffered.
our conclusion finds further support in the cases applying the term damages sustained in contexts other than the cartwright act.thus,for example,carter agricultural ins.d,where,construing damages sustained in suits brought under former code of civil procedure section,the court interpreted the term to mean those damages suffered by the plaintiff,his actual damages,to compensate him for the losses he has endured.likewise scally garratt,where,construing damages sustained in a jury instruction,the court stated that a plaintiff could,manifestly,sustain such damages only as amounted to an actual loss to him.two old supreme court cases are to the same effect utter chapman cal,wl absent fraud,it is always the aim of the court to give damages,and such damages only as will compensate the plaintiff for his loss and de costa massachusetts mining company cal,wl plaintiff could not recover beyond the injury sustained.while these cases do not involve antitrust claims or the cartwright act,nothing there,or elsewhere,suggests that the legislature intended the phrase damages sustained to mean something different in the antitrust context.
numerous other statutes employ the phrase damages sustained.see,subd.e,subd.a,subd.c,subd.a,subd.a.we are unaware of any plaintiffs have not identified any of those statutes in a manner that allowed for the recovery of monetary compensation beyond the actual financial loss suffered by a plaintiff.and we can discern nothing suggesting that the term means something different in the antitrust context.as judge sabraw put it if the legislature had intended to depart in section from the usual meaning of damages sustained,then it probably would have used different words.the legislature did not,for example,state that a plaintiff can recover three times any excess price paid 
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the above authorities on a variety of grounds.they argue krigbaum,supra,and overland,supra,are unpersuasive because neither case interpreted the phrase damages sustained.they object to reliance on act cases,complaining that as contract or tort actions they do not take into account the act policy objective.they take exception to consideration of the phrase damages sustained in other statutes,claiming that it violates principles of statutory construction.and they criticize any reliance on cases that the enactment of the cartwright act,deeming it implausible that such cases influenced the drafters of the cartwright act.none of these arguments is convincing.
it is true that krigbaum,supra,and overland,supra,did not expressly construe damages sustained.but neither did hanover shoe.as to the policy objective argument,the primary purpose of private antitrust actions is compensation.bruno superior court,supra,d at.plaintiffs who have passed on all overcharges and suffered no financial loss themselves have nothing that merits compensation.and as to the consideration of the phrase in other settings,the language in torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d,is particularly apt w hen words used in a statute have acquired a settled meaning through judicial interpretation,the words should be given the same meaning when used in another statute dealing with an analogous subject matter accord,mercer department of motor vehicles cal d.
plaintiffs raise one final argument to attempt to dissuade us from holding that the language of section means what it says.relying on hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,for the proposition that a statute is regarded as ambiguous if it is capable of two constructions,both of which are reasonable,plaintiffs argue that the united states supreme court in hanover shoe and judge sabraw here construed virtually identical language yet arrived at contradictory conclusions.as plaintiffs frame it the former read the language as excluding the defense whereas the latter interpreted the statute as permitting it.for the language to be considered ambiguous,both readings must be reasonable.the united states supreme court reading must be considered at least reasonable,given it has affirmed the reasoning on three separate occasions over the past four decades.plaintiffs argument is unsound for several reasons.
first,the supreme court did not decide hanover shoe based on the language of section of the clayton act.nowhere does justice white analyze the phrase damages sustained.nowhere does he even note,much less determine,that the language was intended to include any amount plaintiff was overcharged even if the full amount was passed on to a subsequent purchaser.instead,the supreme court based its holding on concerns over nearly insuperable problems of proof as well as concerns that indirect purchasers would lack incentive to sue if the defense were recognized.hanover shoe,supra,at.in re western liquid asphalt cases cir,liquid asphalt,a case cited numerous times by plaintiffs,confirms this point,observing as follows we do not believe that the supreme court in hanover shoe,supra.intended a per se rule with respect to passing on the court was applying policy to a specific case.
the proof problems present in hanover shoe are not apparent in the record here.to the contrary,while plaintiffs resisted discovery on various grounds,judge sabraw specifically found that plaintiffs had not shown it was unduly burdensome or oppressive for them to produce data regarding purchases and sales of drugs,since the information was maintained electronically and could apparently be extracted and compiled with relative ease.indeed,as early as,commentators were noting the significance and utility of the computer in antitrust litigation.see,for example,board of editors of the federal judicial center,manual for complex litigation.and the technological developments in the ensuing years can hardly be exaggerated.
language in kansas utilicorp.united,d utilicorp,another case heavily relied on by plaintiffs,albeit only in reply,also bears on this not favorably to plaintiffs.in utilicorp.the court of appeals considered the following certified question in a private antitrust action under involving claims of price fixing against the producers of natural gas,is a state a proper plaintiff as parens patriae for its citizens who paid inflated prices for natural gas,when the lawsuit already includes as plaintiffs those public utilities who paid the inflated prices upon direct purchase from the producers and who subsequently passed on most or all of the price increase to the citizens of the state id.at.in other words,could the state bring a parens patriae action on behalf of indirect purchasers the court of appeals answered this question in the negative.the supreme court affirmed.id.at.
one of the arguments asserted by plaintiffs was that the court should apply an exception for actions based upon contracts,supra,at.while the court ultimately declined to do so under the particular facts before it,it did acknowledge that illinois brick and hanover shoe allowed for a departure from the rule forbidding the assertion of the theory in certain circumstances.as the court hypothesized,it might allow indirect purchasers to sue only when the direct purchaser will bear no portion of the overcharge and otherwise suffer no injury.id.at.
but most significant,and most worthy of comment here,are three comments in the dissent of justice white,the author of hanover shoe and the illinois brick majority opinion.urging that the indirect purchaser states should be allowed to sue,justice white noted as follows 
a lthough the utility could sue to recover lost profits resulting from lost sales due to the illegally high price,its injury is not measured by the amount of the illegal overcharge that it has passed on,and hence the utility would have no incentive to seek such a recovery at.
given a passthrough,the customer,not the utility,suffers the antitrust injury,and it is the customer or the state on his behalf that is entitled to recover treble damages.at.
again however,where there is a perfect and provable pass through,there is no danger that both the utilities and the indirect purchasers will recover damages for the same anticompetitive conduct because the utilities have not suffered any overcharge damage the petitioners will sue for the amount of the overcharge,while the utilities will sue for damages resulting from their lost sales.at.
we read these comments to suggest that justice white himself would rule against plaintiffs.it was the indirect purchaser which suffers the antitrust injury.by contrast,the utility could only sue for damages resulting from their lost sales its injury is not measured by the amount of the illegal overcharge that it has passed on,supra,at.substitute pharmacies for utilities and the author of hanover shoe devastates plaintiffs here their injury is not measured by the amount of the illegal overcharge they have passed on.
second,the united states supreme court has confirmed that hanover shoe and illinois brick were interpreting federal,not state,law.in california arc america,d arc america,another opinion by justice white,the court explained as we made clear in illinois brick,the issue before the court in both that case and in hanover shoe was strictly a question of statutory was the proper construction of of the clayton act it is one thing to consider the congressional policies identified in illinois brick and hanover shoe in defining what sort of recovery federal antitrust law authorizes it is something altogether different,and in our view inappropriate,to consider them as defining what federal law allows states to do under their own antitrust law.
also enlightening on this point are the briefs submitted on behalf of the state of california in arc america,where attorney general van de kamp expressed the view that the defense is recognized in california.for example,in appellants opening brief,he is quoted as stating,r ecovery under states laws is determined by actual injury.brief of appellant states,arc america,wl,at.briefs lexis,at.and in reply,that a state plaintiff is not authorized to recover for the injuries sustained by another reply brief of appellant states,arc america,wl,at.briefs lexis,at.so,too,is the conclusion of the author of the law review article cited by our supreme court in union carbide,supra,cal d,that the defense is available in california.see smith,comment,the california legislature steers the antitrust cart right off the illinois brick road pac.
finally,hanover shoe relied on cases applying a privity rule that precluded indirect purchasers suits.see at,citing southern pac.in enacting the illinois brick repealer statute,the california legislature confirmed in no uncertain terms that indirect purchaser suits are permissible in california.
we conclude this discussion with the observation that to allow plaintiffs to recover here would violate a fundamental precept of california damage plaintiffs not receive a windfall.as one court of appeal put it long ago,the fundamental principle of the law of damages is that a plaintiff can not hold a defendant liable for more than the actual loss which he has inflicted by his wrong.avery fredericksen and westbrook d,see generally privette superior court cal th,d,allowing employee plaintiffs to recover from multiple sources for the same injury would result in unwarranted windfall.
in sum,the language of the cartwright act,all relevant case law,and all relevant statutes lead us to conclude that three times the damages sustained as used in section refers to actual monetary loss suffered by plaintiffs.plaintiffs suffered no such loss,as the claimed overcharges were passed on,a that defeats plaintiffs here.in the language of the issue as framed by the parties,the defense is available in california.
in light of the result we reach,we perhaps need not engage in any further level of statutory interpretation.macisaac,supra,th at,d.but because the parties devote substantial portions of their briefs to the subject,we choose to address it and conclude that neither plaintiffs extensive citation to legislative history nor their reliance on public policy supports any different conclusion.
neither legislative history nor public policy demonstrates that hanover shoe is the law in california 
legislative history 
plaintiff primary argument,to which they devote some pages in their opening brief and in their reply,is that judge sabraw erred by failing to interpret the intent of the legislature.their hanover shoe is the law in on the fundamental premise that the legislative history demonstrates a recognition by the legislature of the risk of multiple liability.in plaintiffs words,this risk necessarily presumes the recognition of hanover shoe.if hanover shoe were not the law,the danger of multiple liability would simply not exist.
in arguing that the legislative history supports their construction of section,plaintiffs focus primarily on three distinct aspects of such history the act and the california equivalent,the illinois brick repealer amendment,and the california attorney general amicus brief in illinois brick.
in,congress passed the act,an amendment to the federal antitrust statutes which authorized parens suits by state attorneys general on behalf of citizens injured by anticompetitive conduct.a provision of the amendment read,the court shall exclude from the amount of monetary relief awarded in such action any amount of monetary relief a which duplicates amounts which have been awarded for the same injury,or b which is properly allocable to i natural persons who have excluded their claims pursuant to subsection b of this section,and ii any business entity.a i.
the act included a provision to protect defendants from multiple liability in antitrust overcharge cases.as summarized in the senate committee on judiciary report,the amendment contains a proviso to assure that defendants are not subjected to duplicative liability,particularly in a situation where it is claimed that middlemen absorbed all or part of the illegal overcharge.the committee intention is to codify the holding of the circuit in liquid asphalt cir.
representative rodino,the bill sponsor in the house of representatives,expressed a similar intent t he courts that have required privity between the plaintiff and the defendant as a prerequisite to standing,the donson view,have generally done so,because they have misread the supreme court hanover shoe opinion.fearing that the first purchaser can,under hanover shoe,recover the entire overcharge,whether or not he absorbs all or merely part of it,these courts have clearly been motivated by the specter of double liability raised by successful actions by subsequent purchasers.however,the compromise the house forbids duplicative recovery.
from these legislative comments,plaintiffs conclude that congress passage of the act included the intent to preserve the hanover shoe rule,the intent to codify liquid asphalt solution to the multiple recovery problem,and the intent to allow standing to indirect purchasers.
the following year,the california legislature passed assembly bill ab which,according to the bill digest,was modeled directly on federal law.the bill codified the act as california law,incorporating a parens patriae provision into the cartwright act.the provision included language that was substantively identical to the act prohibition against duplicate recovery,subd.a and a i.the assembly bill analysis confirmed that ab would enact into law basically the same provisions enacted into federal law last year by the c ongress.plaintiffs also identify various writings suggesting ab was intended to parallel the act,including letters from the los angeles and san diego county district attorneys.
according to plaintiffs,the foregoing establishes that the legislature intended ab to bring california law into line with the federal statute,the federal statute was enacted to address the possibility of multiple liability,and multiple liability can only occur if the defense is not permitted.ergo,plaintiffs conclude,in passing ab the california legislature implicitly recognized hanover shoe as the law in california.we are not persuaded.
first,and as judge sabraw observed,if the legislature was in fact concerned with the threat of multiple liability,logically it would have included a safeguard against double recovery in section as well as in the parens patriae provision.since it did not,one can reasonably conclude that it did not consider multiple liability in private actions a problem because the defense is available to defendants.
moreover,the safeguard against multiple liability in the parens patriae provision undermines plaintiffs claim that the provision necessarily assumes the of the defense.as defendants put it,the multiple liability provision applies more logically where the attorney general purports to bring suit on behalf of as to whom a defense would never be available,or other natural persons,who have already recovered for their injuries through different litigation or,for example,through a consumer class action.when the attorney general subsequently sues under the parens patriae statute on behalf of all natural persons in california,the attorney general can not recover a second time those portions of an overcharge that were already awarded as damages.
we can not conclude that the legislative history of ab clearly demonstrates the legislature intent to reject the defense in california.nor does the legislative history of assembly bill ab,the illinois brick repealer amendment.
according to plaintiffs,in passing the illinois brick repealer amendment,thereby clarifying that indirect purchasers have standing in california,the legislature intended to repeal the illinois brick majority opinion and to adopt the illinois brick dissent in its entirety.this argument derives in part from the bill synopsis prepared by the senate committee on the judiciary,which states,the purpose of the bill is to prevent a federal case interpretation of the sherman act from being applied to actions under the cartwright act and in part from the bill digest prepared by the assembly committee on the judiciary.plaintiffs argue that this suggests the legislature intent to incorporate the illinois brick dissent in its entirety,which includes recognition of hanover shoe.to bolster such assertion,plaintiffs point to the majority opinion in illinois brick,at,fn,which describes the dissenting view as the same view advocated by the state of california in its amicus brief in illinois brick.and from this plaintiffs reason that i f justice brennan dissent accurately reflects california position,then it must be concluded that california does not recognize the defense since the justice expressly stated that hanover shoe can and should be limited to cases of defensive assertion of the defense to antitrust liability,where direct and indirect purchasers are not parties to the same action.illinois brick,supra,at.
defendants respond with their own numerous excerpts from the legislative history,including from the senate judiciary committee analysis from the bill digest of the senate committee on the judiciary from the history of ab in the senate committee on the judiciary from a memorandum of the senate democratic caucus and from a bill analysis for the governor office.from that,defendants urge that the sole purpose of the amendment was to ensure that the california courts did not apply the holding of illinois brick that indirect purchasers could not sue under the federal antitrust the cartwright act.
we agree with defendants,and conclude that these passages show that passage of ab was intended simply to codify standing for indirect purchasers under the cartwright act,rather than as an adoption of the illinois brick dissent in its entirety.indeed,and as defendants point out,if hanover shoe automatically and tacitly became california law in then illinois brick rule against indirect purchaser suits likewise became the law as soon as the supreme court issued its decision in that case.but if that were so,the amendment could not have been declaratory of existing law as the legislature stated,and instead would have altered existing law by overruling illinois brick in california.
we end our discussion of legislative history with the observation that,however vigorous plaintiffs presentation,it necessarily concedes that any adoption of hanover shoe was by implication.as plaintiffs candidly put it at one point,the legislative history manifests a tacit approval of the rule of hanover shoe.such concession is appropriate,as one thing is clear not once in the numerous pages of legislative history on which plaintiffs rely is hanover shoe even mentioned.such fact militates strongly against plaintiffs,as we recently observed in state building construction trades council of california duncan th,d at the federal level,the united states supreme court has observed that congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.whitman american trucking assns,d see fda brown williamson tobacco,d w e are confident that congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance in so cryptic a fashion.gonzales oregon,d.california courts have adopted a similar skepticism.garcia mccutchen cal th,d,in re christian cal th,d,ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,d pleasant hill bayshore disposal,recycling,th,fn,d.
finally,plaintiffs rely on union carbide,supra,cal d,to support their position that the amendment reflected the legislature claimed adoption of the illinois brick dissenting opinion in its entirety,including recognition of hanover shoe.such reliance is misplaced.
plaintiffs in union carbide were indirect purchasers of industrial gas and alleged that defendants,producers of industrial gas,conspired to fix prices of the gas,causing plaintiffs to pay more for it than they would have paid in the absence of the conspiracy.as pertinent here,defendants demurred to the complaint,claiming a defect of parties code civ,subd.d see,subd.a,and moved to dismiss under section for absence of indispensable parties.union carbide,supra,cal d at,footnote omitted.the trial court overruled the demurrer and denied the motion.
defendants petitioned for a writ of mandate ordering plaintiffs to join all persons in the chain of distribution between plaintiffs and defendants,arguing that the absence of such parties subjected them to multiple liability.union carbide,supra,cal d at.this argument was driven by the existence of a federal action in illinois brought by residents of states other than california,who alleged that they purchased gas directly from defendants and were injured by the same misconduct at issue in the california case.id.at.defendants also expressed concern that other indirect purchasers in california not involved in the suit would create a substantial risk of multiple liability because the intermediate purchasers might independently sue petitioners under the cartwright act,contending that they absorbed,rather than passing on to the present plaintiffs,all or part of the overcharges for which plaintiffs now seek damages.id.at.
the supreme court denied the writ,noting that it was raised at the pleading stage,where the operative papers included only plaintiffs complaint,the complaint in the illinois federal case,and proceedings regarding class certification in the federal case.union carbide,supra,cal d at.these papers,according to the supreme court,did not demonstrate a substantial risk of multiple liability sufficient to require that additional parties be joined in the complaint or named therein with sufficient reasons for nonjoinder as a prerequisite to defendants being required to answer the complaint in order to avoid default.id.at.the court continued,however we do not foreclose the possibility that through discovery or other means petitioners may be able later to make a showing of substantial risk of multiple liability that would entitle them to a joinder order.id.at.
citing one paragraph in union paragraph of dictum,no argue that the union carbide court adopted the view of the dissent in illinois brick that the risk of multiple liability was remote and that it could in any event be addressed through existing procedural mechanisms and the fact that the supreme court recognized that a danger of multiple liability could exist in any situation at all albeit remote and procedurally ameliorated necessarily presumes the recognition of hanover shoe.hardly.
to begin with,the issue in union carbide was one of joinder,not the defense.moreover,the opinion begins by describing precisely which part of the illinois brick dissenting opinion the legislature had approved in the amendment to the cartwright act,that indirect purchasers are persons injured by illegal overcharges passed on to them in the chain of distribution.cal d at.nothing in union carbide supports the contention that the amendment included codification of hanover,not incidentally,is not even mentioned in the majority opinion.
in sum,the legislative history does not establish the legislature intent to adopt hanover shoe rejection of the defense.nor does the public policy argued by plaintiffs.
public policy 
plaintiffs vigorously argue that public policy concerns mandate adherence to hanover shoe,asserting first that california policy requires that offensive and defensive be treated differently.this is so,plaintiffs argue,because a llowing indirect purchaser plaintiffs to use offensive adds an additional group of plaintiffs to an existing lawsuit,or it allows an antitrust violation to be redressed.both of these situations are consistent with california strong stated policy in favor of enforcing the antitrust laws.on the other hand,allowing defendants to assert an affirmative defense runs contrary to that policy,giving rise to the danger that no plaintiff will be able to sue a defendant,even where it has confessed to wrongdoing.
plaintiff argument ignores the principle which calls for the equal treatment of claims and defenses,a principle fundamental to the holding in illinois brick,supra,at.w hatever rule is to be adopted regarding in antitrust damages actions,it must apply equally to plaintiffs and defendants.this rule,called the golden rule by judge sabraw,finds support in california law,illustrated,for example,by civil code section,which provides that in an action based on a contract containing a provision that affords attorney fees and costs to one party to the action,the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees whether or not he or she is specified in the contract.
plaintiffs second public policy argument is that where the choice is between a windfall to plaintiffs and letting guilty defendants go free,liability must be imposed.as plaintiffs describe it,they were involuntarily subjected to an illegal agreement that forced them to pay more than they should have defendants masterminded this unlawful scheme and now seek to escape liability with their illegal profits intact.this result,plaintiffs submit,is expressly forbid den by california policy.
citing nothing in support of the adjective expressly,plaintiffs go on to discuss the deterrent and disgorgement purposes of actions under the cartwright act as recognized in bruno,supra,d at.and while deterrence and disgorgement are no doubt significant considerations,plaintiffs argument ignores the fact that compensation is the primary rationale for the allowance of private antitrust lawsuits bruno,supra,d at.in essence,plaintiffs reading of bruno stands the case on its head,placing the goal of deterrence above that of compensation,despite bruno express language to the contrary.
furthermore,overlooked by plaintiffs is the fact that they themselves have already been paid for the claimed overcharges,so any recovery of the overcharges from to mention treble be a windfall to plaintiffs.in other words,whether a windfall is to be tolerated apparently turns on who receives it.finally,we can not help but note that the only thing that would keep plaintiffs from having damages sustained is that they have passed on all the claimed overcharges.a plaintiff who passed on only some of these charges would maintain damages for which it could state a cartwright act claim.
plaintiffs also argue that recognizing the defense will deprive plaintiffs of incentive to sue for an antitrust violation,claiming that the availability of the defense would virtually all but overcharge cases.maybe it will deprive plaintiffs of incentive,at least in the circumstances here,but those with damages have incentive indeed.the cartwright act itself provides ample incentive,in the form of treble damages,prejudgment interest,attorney fees,and costs.there is,in addition,the parens patriae provision,which authorizes the government to bring enforcement actions on behalf of private individuals who may lack incentive to bring a lawsuit to obtain compensation for their individual injuries.
to the extent that plaintiffs argument intimates that recognition of the defense may discourage lawsuits by indirect purchasers because of the amount of damages,such is belied empirically.we saw this firsthand in the consolidated class action cases in in re vitamin cases th,d class of indirect purchasers of vitamins total settlement of million.other courts have seen it,too,as in in re microsoft cases th,d two classes of indirect acquirers of licenses settlement agreement and in re natural gas cases th,d seven coordinated class action lawsuits settlement of billion.
for each and all of the above reasons,we conclude that hanover shoe is not the law in california.
the ucl claim has no merit 
in addition to their cartwright act claim,plaintiffs also alleged that defendants committed illegal business practices in violation of the unfair competition law ucl,sections,et,which defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.
defendants moved for summary adjudication on this claim on two different grounds.first,they argued plaintiffs were not eligible for restitution,the sole monetary remedy available to private plaintiffs under the ucl,because they did not have an ownership interest in any monies defendants wrongfully obtained from the overcharges.defendants also argued plaintiffs lacked standing under section because they did not lose money or property as required by that section.
granting summary adjudication,judge sabraw first addressed the standing argument,concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not lost money or property.alternatively,he concluded that the court could not award monetary relief under section because p laintiffs do not have an ownership interest in whatever funds they paid as a result of any overcharge and were therefore not eligible for restitution.we agree on both counts,but address the issues in reverse order,as briefed by the parties.
section provides any person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.the court may make such orders or judgments,including the appointment of a receiver,as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,as defined in this chapter,or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.
the exclusive monetary remedy available to private plaintiffs under the ucl is restitution.korea supply lockh
