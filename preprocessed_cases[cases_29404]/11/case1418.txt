this appeal presents two issues of first impression in our circuit whether a shipper timely compliance with the minimum claim filing requirements in b,a regulation promulgated by the interstate commerce commission icc,is a prerequisite to filing suit against a carrier under the carmack amendment,and if so,what standard should be applied to determine whether a shipper has adhered to the regulation requirement that a claim contain a specified or determinable amount of damages,b.we hold that a shipper must file with the carrier a notice of a claim that satisfies b before filing suit under the carmack amendment.we also conclude,however,that b should be interpreted liberally in light of its purpose,which is to provide the carrier adequate notice of the claim so that it can conduct an independent investigation of the damage,not to relieve the carrier of liability.
applying this standard here,we conclude that the notice of claim for damage caused to an electrical transformer shipped by rail,submitted by siemens power transmission and distribution,siemens,to norfolk southern railroad nsr,satisfies the minimum claim requirements of b as a matter of law.we thus reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in the spring of,siemens entered into an agreement with florida power and light company for the sale of an electrical transformer.as part of the agreement,siemens agreed to arrange and pay for the transportation and delivery of the transformer to facility in florida.
in order to carry out this obligation,siemens retained a transportation consultant,tranco,tranco,to arrange for shipment of the transformer from norfolk,virginia,to florida.edward henry,tranco president,acted as siemens agent for purposes of communicating with rail carriers.in march,henry approached nsr about possibly shipping the transformer to florida by rail.additionally,siemens installed an electronic impact recorder to record any excessive shocks that might occur during transportation and cause damage to the transformer.
shipped from germany by ocean vessel,the transformer arrived in norfolk,virginia,on january.on january,henry issued nsr a straight bill of lading the bill of lading.the bill of lading incorporated by reference the terms of the uniform straight bill of lading usbl pursuant to the bill of lading,nsr undertook the carriage of the transformer to facility in florida.the transformer arrived at facility on january 
after the transformer arrived,the electronic impact recorder that had been installed in the transformer was retrieved and read.the recorder indicated that the transformer had been exposed to forces in excess of siemens established thresholds for safe carriage of the device.additional tests revealed that the transformer was not operating properly and needed repair.according to siemens,all of the forces that caused damage to the transformer had occurred while nsr had custody and control over the device 
on march,henry sent nsr a letter indicating siemens intent to claim the costs of the repair of the transformer 
please accept this letter as our intent to file a claim for damage to an electrical transformer moving from the port of norfolk,va to titusville,fl on.
the computerized impact recorder showed longitudinal impacts on at,and g.time approximately.the load was in a train moving from crew,va to linwood,nc.
upon an interior inspection damage was noted and siemens technical engineers are evaluating the damage.
at this time we can not state a cost for repairs but will send you a report when available.siemens estimated repairs at.
ex.on march,henry sent a fax to nsr regarding its possible claim and invited nsr to send a representative to an inspection of the transformer conducted by a siemens team,ex.according to siemens,nsr neither responded to either communication nor sent a representative to the inspection.
after inspecting the transformer in florida,siemens decided to ship the transformer back to germany for repairs.by letter dated april,henry informed nsr that a t this time,siemens is estimating a total cost of and that is the amount of our claim.this covers transportation back to germany,repairs,and return to at cape canaveral,fl,ex.henry also stated that costa,siemens insurance company representative,will be inspecting the unit at cape canaveral on monday,april.we feel nsr should have their representative at this inspection to protect your interests.id.according to siemens,nsr sent a transformer consultant to conduct an investigation of the transformer.
on april,henry wrote nsr and stated that it planned to ship the transformer to germany u nless it hear d differently from nsr within hours,ex.l.after the transformer arrived in germany,henry told nsr that the transformer would be opened for inspection on june so if nsr wanted its inspector at this inspection he could make plans to attend,ex.
in september,siemens initiated an action against nsr in the united states district court for the middle district of florida and sought for damages to the transformer,at.siemens alleged that it had timely filed a proper claim for damages with nsr prior to bringing suit.at the close of discovery,nsr moved for summary judgment on the ground that siemens had not satisfied the condition precedent for bringing suit because it had not filed a valid claim with nsr within nine months of the damage to the transformer.
concluding that siemens suit was barred,the district court granted nsr motion.the district court stated that the icc claims provide the applicable minimum standards for a written notice of a freight claim.noting that,in farmland industries,seaboard coast line railroad,cir per curiam,we had agreed that a main function of the notice requirement is to allow the carrier to exactly compute its losses,the district court concluded that the eleventh circuit would interpret the icc regulations strictly.the district court then determined that siemens letters did not satisfy the icc regulations when strictly interpreted because they failed to make a claim for a specified or determinable amount of damages.additionally,the district court ruled that siemens claim did not fall within either of the two exceptions that courts have recognized as excusing compliance with the icc regulations.siemens filed a timely notice of appeal.
on appeal,siemens urges that the district court committed error in concluding that its letters to nsr did not constitute a valid claim such that it may bring suit in district court.siemens advances two primary arguments.first,siemens contends that the district court relied incorrectly upon in barring its suit for cargo damage.siemens argues that it should not be bound by the icc standard because it was not explicitly included in the bill of lading,the usbl,the carmack amendment,or nsr conditions of carriage,and because the regulation applies only to claims that are voluntarily resolved by the carrier,as opposed to claims that are litigated.siemens avers that we should instead assess the sufficiency of its claim under the case law in existence prior to the issuance of.in response,nsr contends that should apply here because it was intended to supercede the case law on which siemens urges we rely.
second,siemens argues that if the regulations do apply,the district court erred in adopting the strict compliance standard for assessing whether a claim satisfies the minimum requirements set forth in b.siemens contends that the strict compliance cases decided by other circuits and cited by the district court are relevant only where the claim at issue fails to include an amount of damages in any form.siemens argues that we must construe the regulation liberally in favor of the shipper because doing so will serve the purpose of the regulation,which is to afford the carrier sufficient notice so that it can decide whether to investigate the claim and taking the opposite approach would derogate siemens common law rights by preventing it from recovering damages.citing farmland industries,at,nsr responds that the purpose of a written claim is to allow a carrier to compute its losses exactly.nsr argues that this purpose can not be achieved unless we require actual compliance with by mandating that claims state a precise damage amount.nsr also argues that our adoption of any standard less rigorous than actual compliance will allow shippers to bypass the mandated uniform claims process and immediately seek a resolution in district court 
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.wilson aerospace,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.with this standard in mind,we review each of siemens arguments.
application of the icc regulations 
the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act imposes liability on common carriers for the actual loss of or damage to shipments in interstate commerce.a.section e of the carmack amendment provides that a carrier may not provide by rule,contract,or otherwise,a period of less than months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than years for bringing a civil action against it under this section.e.consistent with this section,the usbl requires that the shipper must provide the carrier with a notice of claim for damages within nine months of delivery of the cargo a s a condition precedent to recovery,ex.o b.
the standard for evaluating claims submitted pursuant to the carmack amendment initially was set forth by the supreme court in georgia,florida and alabama railway blish milling.in that case,the court stated that the purpose of a requirement in a bill of lading that claims for damages be presented in writing within a certain time after delivery was not to allow the carrier to avoid liability,but to secure reasonable notice for the carrier.id.at.at.accordingly,the court held that such requirements d id not require documents in a particular form,so long as their purpose was served.id.the court also stated that the requirements were addressed to a practical exigency and were to be construed in a practical way.id.one year later,in louis,iron mountain,southern railway starbird,the court again discussed the purpose of such requirements.the court noted that they served to put in permanent form the evidence of an intention to claim damages,call the attention of the carrier to the condition of the freight,and enable it to make such investigation as the facts of the case require.courts applying the blish milling standard assessed liberally written claims by shippers and generally held that the claims were sufficient so long as they gave the carrier reasonable notice of the claim.see,wisconsin packing,indiana refrigerator lines,cir thompson james mccarrick,cir there is no requirement that a written instrument be submitted in detail or that the cause and exact amount of damage be stated thereon in order to constitute a valid claim.
in,the icc responded to complaints of various abuses rampant in the settlement of claims by shippers and carriers and promulgated regulations entitled principles and practices for the investigation and voluntary disposition of loss and damage claims and processing salvage.see ex.parte rules,regulations,and practices of regulated carriers with respect to the processing of loss and damage claims,hereinafter ex parte.in creating the regulations,the icc sought to combat carriers attempts to discriminate among shippers in their payment of claims,to encourage prompt investigation and voluntary settlement,and to facilitate more harmonious relationships between carriers and claimants.id.at.
among other things,the icc regulations provide m inimum filing requirements for a written notice of claim.id.b.according to the regulations,a written or electronic communication complies sufficiently with the provisions for filing claims embraced in the bill of lading or other contract of carriage if it contains facts sufficient to identify the baggage or shipment or shipments of property,an assertion of liability for alleged loss,damage,injury,or delay,and a claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.id.additionally,the regulations dictate that when a claim is filed for an uncertain amount,such as more or less,the carrier shall determine the condition of the baggage or shipment involved at the time of delivery by it,if it was delivered,and shall ascertain as nearly as possible the extent,if any,of the loss or damage for which it may be responsible.id.d.the carrier,however,shall not voluntarily pay a claim under such circumstances unless and until the shipper submits a claim containing a specified or determinable amount of money.id.
we have not yet expressly held that the icc minimum claim requirements apply to litigated claims,as opposed to claims that are resolved voluntarily,but implicitly,we seem to have assumed as much.in konst florida east coast railway,we held that a claimant could invoke the presumption that a railroad carrier had received a properly mailed claim so that the claim could be considered filed within the meaning of,cir.in so holding,we did not explicitly address whether applies to contested as well as uncontested claims,but we applied the regulation without discussion and described as the federal regulations governing the minimum requirements for making a damages claim against a common carrier.id.at.
our assumption in konst is supported by all but one circuit to have addressed the issue.the first,second,and ninth circuits have held that the regulations apply to all claims,whether contested or voluntarily settled.see nedlloyd lines,harris transport,cir pathway bellows,blanchette,cir insurance of am.trucking,cir.the fifth and sixth circuits applied the icc regulations to litigated claims without explicitly ruling on the issue.see salzstein bekins van lines,cir trepel roadway express,cir.the seventh circuit,in contrast,has concluded that the icc regulations apply only to uncontested claims.wisconsin packing,at.reasoning that d prohibits carriers from voluntarily paying claims for uncertain amounts,that the legislative proposals accompanying the icc regulations differentiate throughout between disputed claims and claims determinations,id.at,and that the purpose of the regulation was to make claim settlement more expeditious by providing procedures for the voluntary disposition of claims by carriers,the seventh circuit held that the sufficiency of a shipper claim should be assessed by the old blish milling reasonable notice standard,id.
after reviewing this precedent from other circuits and the contentions of the parties,we agree with the first,second,fifth,sixth,and ninth circuits that at least the minimum claim requirements contained in section b apply to contested as well as voluntarily resolved claims as stated by the first circuit,the regulations section discussing the a pplicability of the regulations,does not distinguish between contested and uncontested claims.see nedlloyd lines,at.instead,it states that the regulations shall govern the processing of claims for loss,damage,injury,or delay to property transported in interstate or foreign commerce.similarly,in the extensive rulemaking accompanying the regulations,the icc clearly indicated that its regulations should be applied broadly 
we are persuaded by the record in this proceeding that our regulations should embrace the full range of matters relating to the filing of claims,including a prescription of minimum filing requirements and a consideration of documents that do not constitute claims,and claims for uncertain amounts 
thus,the rules set fort in section and first establish their overall applicability and then set out the manner and form in which loss and damage claims must be filed by claimants in order to accomplish the improvements shown to be required in the public interest in this area.
ex parte,at.finally,as noted in konst,the regulations require carriers to fulfill certain obligations once a claim is received.see konst,at.applying the regulations to all claims give
