defendant appellant john fanning petitions this court for review of the federal trade commission the commission summary decision finding him personally liable for misrepresentations contained on the website in violation of the federal trade commission act ftc act.we agree with the commission findings that materially misrepresented the source of its content and its membership benefits.nonetheless,we agree with fanning that portions of the commission remedial order are overbroad.we affirm the finding of liability and the remedial order recordkeeping provisions and order acknowledgment requirement.because we conclude the remedial order compliance monitoring provisions as to fanning are overbroad,we vacate that portion of the commission order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in,fanning founded jerk llc jerk and from to,jerk operated 
was a reputation management website.its homepage greeted users by asking them if they were l ooking for the latest scoop on a world filled with jerks and stated that millions of people use d jerk for important updates,business,dating,and more.the homepage listed several benefits offered,including tracking one own and other people reputations,enter ing comments and reviews for other people,h elp ing others avoid the wrong people,and prais ing those who help you.
main feature was its profile pages.each page corresponded with a particular individual and displayed that person name.the profiles allowed users to vote on whether someone was a jerk or not a jerk and displayed the total number of jerk and not a jerk votes received.users could also post anonymous reviews about a person,which were visible on that person profile page.by,contained million profiles pages.very few of these profile pages had reviews posted and those reviews that were posted were largely derogatory.
also had a remove me page,which stated that individuals could manage their reputation and resolve disputes regarding content on their profile pages through a paid subscription.the remove me page contained a link to a separate subscription page where users could enter their billing and credit card information to purchase a membership.the subscription page reiterated that only paid members could create a dispute about the content of a profile.
despite its large number of profile pages,had relatively few users.had a post a jerk page that allowed users to create a profile for themselves or others by entering a person first and last name,address,university affiliation,and location.but jerk created the vast majority of profiles by using a computer program that populated profile pages with names,photos,and other content obtained from searching facebook a fact did not disclose on any of its pages.
in april,the federal trade commission enforcement arm ftc filed a administrative complaint charging jerk and fanning with engaging in deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section a of the ftc act.a.the first count alleged that misrepresented the source of its content by claiming that it was entirely user generated.the second count alleged that misrepresented the benefits of purchasing a membership.
the ftc moved for summary decision the administrative equivalent of summary judgment on both counts in september.the commission granted the motion on both counts and found fanning personally for jerk misrepresentations.the commission also issued an order enjoining jerk and fanning from making certain misrepresentations and imposing monitoring and recordkeeping requirements.fanning but not jerk filed this timely petition.
ii.liability 
the ftc rules of practice and procedure allow the commission to grant summary decision,which is reviewed under the same standard as summary judgment before a district court.see a aqueduct sewer auth.epa,cir.under the summary judgment standard,we draw all reasonable inference in favor of the party,but disregard conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.m√©ndez aponte bonilla,cir quoting del toro pacheco pereira,cir.this court then asks whether a reasonable decision maker could conclude there was no genuine issue of material fact that may affect the outcome of the case.aqueduct,at.nonetheless,judicial review of ftc findings is deferential.see kraft,ftc,cir.although the words deceptive practices set forth a legal standard and must get their final meaning from judicial construction,the commission is often in a better position than are courts to determine when a practice is deceptive and the commission judgment is to be given great weight by reviewing courts.ftc colgate palmolive,d.
in determining whether a defendant has engaged in deceptive acts or practices,the commission uses a test considering what claims are conveyed whether those claims are false,misleading,or unsubstantiated and whether the claims are material to prospective consumers.pom wonderful,llc ftc,see also kraft,at novartis.as explained below,contained false and material statements about the source of its content and the benefits of a paid membership such that the commission grant of summary decision was proper.
under count i,the ftc alleged that contained material misrepresentations that its content was user generated.we agree.
the misrepresentation 
fanning does not dispute that if claimed all of its profile pages were user generated,that claim would be false.rather,he argues that made no such claim.in determining whether a claim has been made,the commission looks at the overall net impression,pom wonderful,at quoting kraft,at,left with consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,id.quoting thompson med.
claims can either be express or implied.novartis,at.i mplied claims fall on a continuum,ranging from the obvious to the barely discernable.kraft,at see also novartis,at thompson med,at.although the commission may look at extrinsic evidence of consumer perceptions to guide its interpretation,this is not required.kraft,at.when confronted with claims that are implied,yet conspicuous,common sense and administrative experience provide the commission with adequate tools to make its findings.id.at.
moreover,the commission need not find that all,or even a majority,of consumers found a claim implied.the commission has previously stated that if a claim conveys more than one meaning,only one of which is misleading,a seller is liable for the misleading interpretation even if nonmisleading interpretations are possible.telebrands,aff,cir.liability may be imposed if at least a significant minority of reasonable consumers would be likely to take away the misleading claim.id.
starting with content,the commission viewed references to its millions of users its disclaimers that it could not be held liable for content because its content reflected the views of its users and the post a jerk page inviting users to create profile pages as creating a net impression that implied contained wholly user generated content based on its logical interpretation of content,we see no basis for setting aside the commission conclusion that at least a significant minority of users could reasonably view as claiming its content was wholly user generated.
fanning main argument is that the statements on about us page that the commission relied upon were part of standard terms and conditions of use such that n o reasonable consumer could possibly have been misled to believe that all content on was created by individual users.about us page was divided into twelve sections,three of which stated that users were responsible for the content they posted subsection of that page,online conduct,restricted what users could post on profiles pages and stated that users agreed to be solely responsible for the content or information they publish ed or display ed.subsection,online content,stated o pinions,advice,statements,offers or other information or content on were those of their respective authors and not of jerk llc.subsection,removal of information,told users they were solely responsible for the content of their postings on.
fanning is correct that the disclaimers on the about us page would be insufficient to support an implied misrepresentation claim standing on their own.but the commission did not view these statements in isolation rather,it looked at statements made throughout and noted that the statements on the about us page contributed to an overall net impression that all content was user generated.even if the about us page generally consisted of legal disclaimers,the commission focused its analysis on homepage and post a jerk pages.the commission viewed homepage,referencing its millions of existing users,as introduc ing the website as a vibrant source of user participation and social interaction.the commission also noted that the benefits advertised on its homepage e nter ing comments and reviews for people you interact with,h elp ing others avoid the wrong people,and p rais ing those who help you all convey ed the essential message that is based on content generated by its users.this message,the commission continued,was further underscored by the post a jerk feature which invited consumers to post profiles of other individuals to the site.only after noting these features did the commission cite the statements on about us page as also enforcing the impression content was user generated.
as the commission concluded,these pages all sp oke in terms of content.moreover,even if never expressly represented that its profile pages were created exclusively by users,it never expressly stated how the pages were created.the only information regarding the origin of the profile pages was the post a jerk page allowing users to create profiles for other people given emphasis on content and the lack of information to the contrary,reasonable consumers could conclude other users created their profile pages.
the commission interpretation is further bolstered by extrinsic evidence consumers complained to the ftc about and in many of these complaints,consumers stated concern that someone they knew created their profile page.the commission need only rely on its own reasoned analysis in determining whether a claim has been made,kraft at,but this additional evidence is further proof that reasonable consumers believed claimed its content was user generated.in light of this record,we see no genuine issue of material fact as to whether contained an implied misrepresentation about the source of its content.
materiality 
the ftc act imposes liability for misrepresentations only if they are material.see pom wonderful,at.a claim is considered material if it involves information that is important to consumers and,hence,likely to affect their choice of,or conduct regarding a product.kraft,at quoting cliffdale.the commission presumes materiality with at least four types of claims express claims intended implied claims claims involving health or safety and claims pertaining to a central characteristic of the product about which reasonable consumers would be concerned.see cliffdale,noting that information pertaining to the central characteristic of the product or service will be presumed material.
fanning argues that the commission relied upon advertising cases in which consumers made product purchasing decisions in reliance upon purported implied representations within the advertisements at issue,and that nothing on could be construed as an advertisement.there is no requirement that a misrepresentation be contained in an advertisement.the ftc act prohibits deceptive acts or practices,a emphasis added,and we have upheld the commission when it imposed liability based on misstatements not contained in advertisements,see,sunshine art studios,ftc,cir finding ftc act violation based on company practice of sending customers excess merchandise and using a fictitious collection agency to coerce payment.we see no reason why it would not be a deceptive act or practice to place misrepresentations on websites if those misrepresentations affect ed consumers choice of,or conduct regarding the website.kraft,at.
on this point,fanning does not provide us with any arguments as to why the commission concluded incorrectly that consumers altered their behavior based on misrepresentation that its content was user generated.the commission concluded that a presumption of materiality applied because misrepresented one of its central characteristics.we see no logical gap in the commission view that the source of profile pages goes to a central characteristic of a social networking website.a consumer belief that had many users or that an acquaintance made his or her profile page would influence that consumer decision to use or purchase a membership.the commission also cited evidence that some consumers,in fact,purchased memberships from based on concerns that someone they knew created their profile pages and it would be seen by others.we thus conclude summary decision was proper on count 
we also agree with the commission that contained material and false statements about the benefits of its paid membership.remove me and billing information pages stated that a paid membership would allow users to manage their reputation and create a dispute about the content of a profile page.as the commission found,expressly represented that a membership would allow users to contest and potentially remove negative reviews on their profile pages.
fanning has failed to create a genuine dispute about the falsity of this claim.two ftc investigators paid the membership fee and never received any communication from jerk.the ftc received numerous complaints stating the same.fanning adduces no evidence showing provided services to or even communicated with users who paid the membership fee.he argues only that there was a factual dispute about whether jerk or fanning engaged in a pattern or practice to take money from consumers without providing benefits as promised.fanning,however,fails to cite any evidence to the contrary the record is bereft of any evidence that provided even one paid member the opportunity to contest information on a profile page.there is no evidence suggesting the people who paid but received no benefits were an aberration or mistake.c onclusory allegations are insufficient to defeat summary judgment and fanning has failed to provide more than that.margarian hawkins,cir quotation mark omitted.
we also conclude misrepresentation was material.as the commission found,this misstatement triggers two separate presumptions of materiality it was both express and about a central characteristic of the membership.see kraft,at.the commission also found ample evidence that the misrepresentation affected consumer behavior,as reflected in the numerous complaints from consumers stating they paid the membership fee so that they could have their profiles or reviews contained therein removed.we find summary decision proper on count ii as well.
iii.the ftc order 
even if the commission properly held him liable,fanning argues that the commission injunctive order against him is overbroad on both statutory and first amendment grounds.in part i of its order,the commission enjoins jerk and fanning from misrepresenting the source of any content on a website and the benefits of joining any service.fanning argues that this provision abridges his first amendment right to free speech.in addition,the commission subjects fanning to several monitoring and reporting provisions,which fanning challenges as overbroad.
the commission may enter a cease and desist order if it finds that a method of competition or practice violates other parts of the ftc act.b.the supreme court has interpreted the ftc act as giving the commission wide discretion in determining the type of order that is necessary to cope with the unfair practices found.colgate palmolive,at.thus,the commission may frame its order broadly enough to prevent respondents from engaging in similarly illegal practices in the future.id.at.the court has similarly held that the commission is not limited to prohibiting the illegal practice in the precise form in which it is found to have existed in the past.if the commission is to attain the objectives congress envisioned it must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal.ftc ruberoid.
injunction on misleading speech 
we find no merit to fanning objections to the commission order enjoining him from making any misrepresentations about the source of any content on a website and the benefits of joining any service.fanning only objection to this provision is on first amendment grounds.the first amendment,however,does not protect misleading commercial speech.cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,d see also wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir a dvertising that is actually misleading may be prohibited entirely.quoting in re,d.
fanning counters that the commission erred by categorizing the content of as commercial speech because it did not solely involve economic interests.even if did not contain only commercial speech,the commission order explicitly states fanning may not engage in two types of misrepresentations in connection with the marketing,promoting,or offering for sale of any good or service.this language unambiguously limits the order reach to commercial speech.
in the alternative,fanning argues that commercial speech is still subject to first amendment protection.although that statement is true,as we previously noted,the first amendment does not protect misleading commercial speech.contrary to fanning assertions,the commission order reaches only misrepresentations.we recognize that the first amendment requires the commission order to have a reasonable fit between the restriction and the government interest it serves,but that requirement has been satisfied.id.at quoting bd.of trs.fox,d.the commission limited its injunction to misrepresenting a website source of content and the benefits of joining a service,the two violations related to its findings regarding.we therefore uphold part i of the commission order.
monitoring provisions 
more problematic,however,are the order monitoring provisions.we may interfere with a commission order if the remedy selected bears no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist,removatron int l ftc,cir quoting ftc lead,d,or the order prohibitions are not sufficiently clear and precise in order that they may be understood by those against whom they are directed,id.quoting colgate palmolive,at.on this former reasonableness prong,we have found seven factors as instructive in guiding our analysis 
the deliberateness of the violation the violator past record the adaptability or transferability of the unfair practice to other products the seriousness of potential violations,including health hazards the length of time the deceptive ad or practice has been used the difficulty for the average consumer to evaluate such claims through personal experience and whether the pervasive nature of government regulation of the product at issue is likely to create a climate in which questionable claims have all the more power to mislead.
id.quotations marks and citations omitted.we evaluate these factors using a sliding scale approach.telebrands,at.n o single factor is determinative and the more egregious the facts with respect to a particular element,the less important it is that another negative factor be present.removatron,at second alteration in original quoting sterling drug,ftc,cir.
parts iii,iv,and vi of the commission order contained various monitoring provisions and fanning challenges them all.we address their validity in turn.
recordkeeping provisions 
part iii of the ftc order contains two monitoring provisions for which fanning now seeks review.first,fanning challenges the provision requiring him to maintain and make available advertisements and promotional materials containing any representation covered by the order for a period of five years.fanning argues that compliance with this provision is unmanageable and nonsensical because did not contain any advertisements or promotional material.second,fanning argues that the commission requirement that he notify it of any c omplaints or inquiries relating to any website or other online service for a period of five years are overly punitive in light of the commission finding of an implied misrepresentation.
we conclude these recordkeeping provisions are reasonably related to fanning ftc act violations.they ensure the commission will know about fanning other business ventures,how fanning portrays them to the public,and how the public perceives them.these requirements are also tied to the subject matter of fanning violation misrepresenting the source of content and the benefit of its membership subscription.under the commission order,fanning need only maintain advertisements and promotional material containing representations about the content on a website or the benefits of joining a service.these monitoring provisions seem particularly reasonable based on the adaptability or transferability of the unfair practice to other products.removatron,at.as the commission noted,appeared under different domain names.fanning also started a similar website called reper while running.the ease with which practices could be transferred to other websites weighs in favor of requiring fanning to comply with some reporting requirements.
moreover,we reject fanning contention that the complaint monitoring provision must be invalidated because it is disproportionate to an implied misrepresentation claim.although contained only an implied misrepresentation of the source of its content,it expressly misrepresented the benefits of paying for a membership subscription.the deliberateness of express representation that it provided membership services also favors allowing the commission to engage in tailored monitoring.
order acknowledgment compliance monitoring 
finding the commission recordkeeping provisions reasonable,we turn our attention to the broader reporting requirements.part iv of the order requires fanning to give a copy of the commission order to all current and future principals,officers,directors,and managers,and to all current and future employees,agents,and representative having responsibilities with respect to the subject matter of the order,and shall secure from each such person a signed and dated statement acknowledged receipt for a period of twenty years.fanning argues this provision is and does not serve a legitimate government interest.part vi of the order,compliance monitoring,requires fanning to notify the commission of his affiliation with any new business or employment,and submit information including the new business address and telephone number and a description of the nature of the business for a period of ten years.fanning argues that requiring him to report all affiliation s with any business venture is both overly vague and onerous.he also argues that this reporting lacks a reasonable relation to his violation.
although we uphold the order acknowledgment provisions,we conclude the compliance monitoring provisions are not reasonably related to fanning violation.in response to fanning argument that the order acknowledgment provisions are overly broad,the commission notes that fanning need only notify individuals who have responsibilities related to the subject matter of its order.as with the recordkeeping provisions,we view the transferability of deceptive practices and the deliberateness of fanning violations as key.distribution of the order to individuals with related responsibilities puts them on notice of the prohibited conduct and thus makes it more difficult for fanning to receive assistance in replicating deceptive practices.rather than serving no legitimate government interest,as fanning claims,the order acknowledgment provisions are permissible provisions that help close all roads to the prohibited goal.ruberoid,at.
in contrast,fanning compliance monitoring provisions do not contain a similar restriction.fanning must notify the commission of all business affiliations and employment regardless of whether or not the affiliate or employer has responsibilities relating to the order.notably,the compliance monitoring provisions applicable to jerk require it to report only those changes in its structure that may affect compliance obligations arising under this order.both the order acknowledgment and jerk compliance monitoring provisions are tied to ftc act violations.fanning
