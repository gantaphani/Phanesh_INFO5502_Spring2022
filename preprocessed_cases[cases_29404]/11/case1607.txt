this patent case involves technology for routing telephone calls to an appropriate service location,the service provider closest to the customer who placed the call.plaintiff adept,adept and defendant targus information corporation targus sell competing services that are used to route calls made to numbers,and both companies own patents covering systems and methods for call routing.their customers include owners of numbers,such as enterprise and pizza hut,as well as providers of telecommunications platforms that route calls for such businesses.
in,adept sued targus,its affiliated companies murex securities,and murex licensing corporation,and its customer west corporation in the united states district court for the middle district of florida,alleging that services sold by targus infringed two patents owned by adept adept further alleged that targus had tortiously interfered with adept business relationships by asserting targus patents against adept customers.targus filed counterclaims alleging that adept call routing services infringed various claims in several targus patents 
after a jury trial,the jury verdict essentially found for plaintiff adept on all issues.the jury found that targus willfully infringed the asserted claims of adept patents and that adept did not infringe the asserted claims of targus patents.the jury found that all the asserted claims of targus patents were invalid and further found that the unasserted claims of targus patent and patent were invalid as well.the jury also found targus liable under state law for tortious interference with adept business relationships.the jury awarded adept million for patent infringement and million on the tortious interference claim.
the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict,issued a permanent injunction,and awarded enhanced damages of million on the patent infringement claim,bringing the total damages award to million.the trial court also determined that the case was exceptional and therefore adept was entitled to attorney fees under.
after thorough consideration of all the issues in the case,we conclude that the trial court erred regarding a critical claim construction issue in the adept patents,one that permitted the jury to make incorrect findings.under the correct claim construction,no reasonable jury could find that targus infringes the asserted claims of adept patents accordingly,we reverse the trial court judgment of infringement.for the reasons we shall explain,we also reverse the trial court judgment for adept on its tortious interference claim.in light of these determinations,we vacate the trial court damages award,the permanent injunction,and the judgment with respect to willfulness,enhanced damages,and attorney fees.
regarding the targus patents,with two exceptions we affirm the trial court judgment upholding the jury verdict that the asserted claims of targus patents are invalid for the reasons we explain,we vacate the invalidity judgment on two of the asserted claims of targus patents and remand for a new trial on these claims.because the validity of the unasserted claims of targus patents was not at issue during the trial,we vacate the trial court invalidity judgment with respect to all of those claims.
background 
the patents at issue in this case relate to technology for routing telephone calls made to numbers.typically when a caller dials an number,the long distance carrier ldc handling the call must identify the telephone number,known as a plain old telephone system pots number,to which to route the call.a pots number has the form,where npa is the area code and nxx is the exchange.if all calls to a particular number are to be routed to a single location,the process is relatively simple.some businesses,however,advertise a single number but have multiple service locations.when a caller dials the number of one of these businesses,the ldc must have some way to determine the pots number of an appropriate service location.for example,if the number is for a chain of pizza restaurants,the correct service location could be the closest restaurant or one that delivers within the geographic area in which the caller is located.
plaintiff adept owns the patent and its divisional,the patent,both of which claim priority to an application filed on july.the two patents,referred to as the neville patents,are entitled geographically mapped telephone routing method and system,and have virtually identical written descriptions the neville patents disclose a method for directly routing an call to the appropriate service location based on the caller telephone number,sometimes referred to as the automatic number identification ani.the invention involves the construction of a database that assigns a service location pots number to every potential caller according to geographic criteria provided by the owner of the number.this database can be provided to the ldc,which then routes calls made to the number according to the routing instructions in the database.the process is summarized in the patent abstract 
a method and system for direct routing of telephone calls made by a caller originating from within specific calling areas to one of a plurality of locations of a second party according to certain criteria established by the second party.this routing is accomplished based on the assignment of latitude and longitude coordinates to a potential caller location.once these coordinates are assigned to each of the potential callers,the second party criteria is applied to assign the potential caller to a second party.such criteria could be existence within a geographic area,a custom defined geographic area,or through calculations such as the shortest distance between coordinate points.once all such assignments have been made,a database is assembled to be used by a long distance carrier for direct routing of telephone calls from callers to an assigned second party.

the patent has five independent claims,and the patent has one independent claim,all of which were asserted by adept against targus.claim and claim of the patent are system claims claim and claim of the patent are method claims and claim of the patent and claim of the patent are directed to a method of constructing a database.claim,a method claim,is illustrative of the adept patent claims 
a method for direct routing a telephone call from a first party who has an originating telephone number at a physical location and who dials a telephone number including digits uniquely characteristic to a second party having a plurality of service locations,said method comprising the steps of

b defining the boundaries of one or more geographical areas which can be of any size and shape according to predetermined criteria,each point along said boundaries being defined by latitude and longitude coordinates 
c assigning to the physical location of said potential first parties a telephone number of a service location of a second party that will receive calls originating from within the boundary of a geographic area in which the latitude and longitude coordinates of the physical location of each of said potential first parties lie

e directly routing said telephone call to a service location of the second party assigned to said originating telephone number of the first party by said step of assigning.
patent,emphases and paragraph lettering added.
defendant targus owns two families of patents referred to as the patents,which,like the neville patents,disclose various systems and methods for routing calls to an appropriate service location based on the caller telephone number.the first family includes seven patents the patent its,the patent its,the patent and its four continuations,the patent,the patent,the patent,and the patent.the second family includes the patent and its continuation,the patent.
the earliest patent is the patent,which claims priority to an application filed on february.the patent,which issued in,was also the subject of a reexamination request filed by adept in.the united states patent and trademark office pto granted the request and in issued a reexamination certificate,confirming the patentability of all claims.
the patent discloses a database containing two master table and a client by a spatial key.each record in the master table contains a caller telephone number and a corresponding spatial key,such as a postal code referred to as zip.patent,to.each record in the client table contains a spatial key and the telephone number of a corresponding client service location.id.at.the master table is indexed by caller telephone numbers,and the client table is indexed by the spatial key,so that when a call is placed the system retrieves from the master table the spatial key corresponding to the caller telephone number and then retrieves from the client table the telephone number of the client service location corresponding to that spatial key.id.at.the patent describes two methods for constructing the client table,one involving service areas and one involving service areas for each service location.id.at to.the patent,a continuation of the patent,is similar to the patent but additionally includes a third table containing specific service location information,such as store hours,that may be recited to the caller by a voice response unit.patent.
with the patent,a of the patent,moore and shaffer introduced several new embodiments.one of these was a system,in which spatial calculations are performed during the call to determine the appropriate service location for a caller.patent to.as in the patent,the service area for each client service location can be defined as an area with a radius of any size or a polygon of any size and shape.id.at.unlike the system first described in the patent,however,the system does not simply retrieve records from tables to obtain a service location for a caller.instead,after a call is placed,the system creates a window key,a rectangular area defined by longitude and latitude coordinates that is associated with the caller location.id.at.based on this window key,the system builds a list of potential service locations and then performs more detailed spatial calculations to generate a final list of service locations whose service areas encompass the caller location,in ascending order of distance between the caller location and the service location.id.at to.the claims of the patent are directed to various aspects of the system and process.
the four continuations of the patent,patent,patent,and the same written description as the patent.while some claims of these patents are directed to the system,many are directed to other embodiments,including,for example,a database,referred to as a telephone number to telephone number tnttn table,which is essentially a merger of the master and client tables first disclosed in the patent.
the second family of patents includes the patent and patent.they disclose spatial,databases for providing information to callers or service locations.the processes described in the and patents for applications that require connecting a caller to a service location are similar to the process described in the patent.
targus sells services that operate in conjunction with telecommunications platforms to route calls.one service,intellirouting express,uses the process described in targus patent to identify the location of a caller and determine an appropriate service location after the call is placed and while the caller remains on the line.the service provides the telephone number of the correct service location to the platform,which then processes the call.another targus service,location express,merely identifies the location of the caller and provides it to the platform,which then uses that information while the caller is on the line to perform whatever calculations are necessary to determine an appropriate service location.
plaintiff adept alleged that targus intellirouting express and location express services literally infringe all six independent claims of the neville patents and several dependent claims.two key claim construction issues before the trial court concerned the directly routing paragraph e in illustrative claim,above and assigning paragraph c limitations in the neville patents.the case was initially assigned to district judge antoon,who construed the term directly routing in the neville patents to mean routing a telephone call to another party without a human or computer or otherwise placing a second call.adept,murex,slip op.at.may.
subsequently,the case was transferred to chief judge fawsett three months before trial.on targus motion,she construed the claim language in the assigning limitation,language that is present in all of the asserted claims of the neville patents.first,she construed the term potential first parties as individuals who can place a telephone call but have not yet done so.adept,murex,wl.she then construed assigning as referring to a designation made prior to the telephone call of the first parties emphasis added.however,she declined to find that there was a disclaimer of calculations made after the call is placed.id.at.she further held that the claims are not limited to a database containing a single table.id.at.
during trial,a critical issue in adept infringement case against targus was whether targus process,which performs spatial calculations during the call to determine an appropriate service location,satisfies the assigning limitation in the claims of the neville patents.adept counsel argued that the court construction of the term assigning should be modified so the jury would understand it to cover a stored procedure and algorithm in the database that constitutes a,quote,assignment,closed quote,but nevertheless makes that calculation while the caller is.trial tr.on the nineteenth day of trial,in response to adept argument,and over the objection of targus counsel,chief judge fawsett added a sentence to the claim construction.the final jury instruction regarding this limitation read 
the term assigning as used in the third element of the claims of the and patents refers to a designation made prior to the telephone call of the first parties.however,the and patents do not exclude calculations made during the telephone call.
as we explain more fully below,the addition of the however sentence to the assigning limitation changed the dynamic of the trial.
the jury ruled in adept favor on all of its patent infringement allegations against targus,finding that targus infringed all six independent claims and the asserted dependent claims of the neville patents and that those claims were not invalid or unenforceable.the jury also found that targus infringement was willful in addition,the jury found that targus tortiously interfered with the business relationships between adept and its customers and further found that targus acted in bad faith.the jury awarded adept million in patent infringement damages and million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages on the tortious interference claim.
adept also prevailed at trial on all issues related to targus patents.the jury found that adept did not infringe any of the asserted claims of targus patents.regarding the validity of targus patents,the jury determined that all claims of the patent and the patent were invalid,even though targus asserted only claim of the patent and claims and of the patent.the jury also found that the asserted claims of the other patents were invalid 
targus filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and an alternative motion for a new trial,both of which the trial court denied without discussion.the trial court awarded adept an additional million in enhanced patent infringement damages in accordance with,bringing the total damages award to million.the court then entered final judgment and a permanent injunction.the trial court also determined that the case was exceptional under and that adept was entitled to attorney fees,but the court denied the motion for attorney fees without prejudice to reassertion after completion of the appellate process.
targus appeals the judgment with respect to infringement of adept patents,the invalidity of targus patents,tortious interference,and willfulness.targus also appeals the jury damages award,the trial court award of enhanced damages,and the trial court determination that targus was entitled to attorney fees.finally,targus challenges the permanent injunction as vague or overbroad.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
adept patents 
targus contends that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment as a matter of law that the accused targus services do not infringe the asserted claims of the neville patents.targus focuses on the two claim limitations previously noted assigning and directly routing.regarding the assigning limitation,targus argues that the trial court erred in modifying its claim construction in a way that allowed adept to argue at trial that the assignment could be done during the call.under the proper construction of assigning,targus maintains,its services do not infringe the claims of the neville patents.because we agree with targus that under the correct claim construction no reasonable jury could find that targus services perform the assigning step,we need not address targus arguments with respect to the directly routing limitation.
claim assigning limitation 
targus argues that the claims in the neville patents require assignment of a service location telephone number to the telephone number of each potential caller before any call is placed.adept does not dispute that the assignment must occur before a call is placed,but argues that the assigning limitation can be satisfied by placing in or with a database an algorithm or criteria for determining the correct service location,even though the calculations necessary to implement the algorithm or apply the criteria are performed during the telephone call.targus responds that any calculations needed to complete the assignment of service location numbers to potential callers must occur before the call.the ultimate question,then,is not when the assigning step must occur,which the parties agree must be prior to any telephone call,but rather what constitutes an assignment.to that end,targus argues that the trial court erred when it added to its original claim construction the however statement that the patents do not exclude calculations made during the telephone call because that allowed the jury to apply adept flawed interpretation.
though in claim construction matters we give due weight to a trial court claim construction,ultimately claim construction is a matter of law the final responsibility for which lies with us.cybor fas,en banc.as usual,we start with the language of the claims themselves.phillips awh,en banc.the relevant language see,claim of the patent,above is assigning to the physical location of said potential first parties a telephone number of a service location of a second party that will receive calls patent.use of the word potential to describe the callers and use of the future tense will receive calls for the recipient points directly to the conclusion that the assigning step must occur before a call is placed.the plain language of the claims makes clear that the assigning step requires that a telephone number of a service location be assigned to each potential caller.nothing in the claims suggests that storing an algorithm that will be used to determine the telephone number of the correct service location during a telephone call constitutes an assignment of a service location telephone number to a potential caller before a telephone call is placed.
the patents written description confirms this.see phillips,at.the neville patents disclose a method for routing calls using routing instructions contained in a database.according to the written description,the database is constructed by assigning the telephone number of an appropriate service location to each potential caller.patent.the assignments are made by applying criteria,such as existence within a geographic area,a custom defined geographic area,or through calculations such as the shortest distance between coordinate points.id.abstract.as summarized in the abstract,the patents make clear that assignment of service location telephone numbers to potential callers must be completed before a telephone call is ever placed once all such assignments have been made,a database is assembled to be used by a long distance carrier for direct routing of telephone calls.id.emphasis added.
the assigning step in the neville patents results in direct routing instructions that are submitted to an ldc to be used for routing calls.adept argues that these routing instructions could include stored procedures such as the distance calculations mentioned in the abstract.the written description,however,does not support adept position.the routing instructions are always described as a database containing potential caller telephone numbers and corresponding service location telephone numbers.id.to the extent that procedures like distance calculations are implemented or geographic criteria are applied,it is only to construct a database containing assignments of service locations telephone numbers to potential callers,a step that is completed prior to any call.nowhere do the patents characterize the routing instructions given to an ldc as a stored procedure,algorithm,or criteria to be used later during a call to determine an appropriate service location telephone number.
statements made by the applicant during prosecution reinforce the conclusion that any calculations necessary for assigning service location telephone numbers to callers must be performed before any calls are placed.see phillips,at t he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention.during prosecution of the original application that led to the neville patents,the examiner rejected most of the claims as anticipated by a prior art patent to finucane,et finucane.in response,the applicant distinguished finucane on several grounds,one of which was that finucane requires a computer to perform point of origin to point of termination calculations while a caller is on the line.the applicant contrasted this feature with his system,which performs all such calculations prior to the call even being made and,in fact,prior to delivery of the data base to the long distance carrier ldc.id.
the examiner maintained his rejection during prosecution of a continuation application.in remarks accompanying an amendment in which he canceled all independent claims and added new claims,the applicant once again distinguished his invention from finucane 
the major difference between the present invention and finucane is that with the present invention all point of origin to point of termination calculations have already been performed by determining in which response zone polygon the call originated,and to which corresponding terminating number the call should be routed.the results of these calculations are stored in a database at the service provider location.thus,the present invention eliminates the need to perform to determine the appropriate terminating number.
emphasis added.thus adept and neville repeatedly characterized the invention as one in which all calculations necessary for assigning service location telephone numbers to callers are performed before any telephone calls are made.
adept argues that it is improper to rely on these statements from the prosecution history because they are too ambiguous to serve as a clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim scope.see omega eng g,raytek.adept points out that the issued claims are quite different from those pending at the time the statements were made.because there is no link between the applicant arguments and the specific claim language at issue,adept asserts,there can be no disclaimer.
the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer to which adept refers is typically invoked to limit the meaning of a claim term that would otherwise be read broadly.see id.at w here the patentee has unequivocally disavowed a certain meaning to obtain his patent,the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer attaches and narrows the ordinary meaning of the claim congruent with the scope of the surrender.emphasis added see also rheox,entact,construing the broad term calcium orthophosphate to exclude monocalcium orthophosphate based on prosecution disclaimer although excluded compound was within the ordinary and accustomed meaning of the claim term southwall,cardinal ig,holding that dielectric could not be formed by a process because patentee argued during prosecution that it was formed by a process.in this case,however,we do not consult the prosecution history for that purpose.we simply use it as support for the construction already discerned from the claim language and confirmed by the written description,that all calculations necessary to assign a service location telephone number to a potential caller are completed before any call is placed.although the claims pending at the time of the quoted statements did not include the assigning limitation,the applicant was quite clear throughout prosecution that his invention performed calculations for assigning service location telephone numbers to callers prior to any call being placed.as is true of the written description,nothing in the prosecution history supports adept position that a stored algorithm constitutes an assignment of a service location to a caller.
adept asserts that a claim construction requiring all calculations to be performed prior to any telephone calls can not be correct because even its preferred embodiment performs some calculations during the telephone call.specifically,adept claims that when a call arrives,the neville system must perform lookup calculations to retrieve from the database the service location assigned to the caller.adept fails to recognize,however,that these lookup calculations are not part of the assigning step in the neville location telephone numbers are assigned to callers when the database is created,before any calls take place.under the correct claim construction,only calculations that are necessary to complete the assignment must be performed before any calls are made.as long as that requirement is met,the claims do not preclude any additional calculations during the telephone call.
according to adept,three dependent claims not asserted in the case should compel a different claim construction.in these,and of the originating telephone number is that of a telephone,such as a mobile,cellular or transportable telephone.adept contends that these mobile telephone claims require some sort of spatial calculation at the time of the call to determine the correct service location based on the caller physical location and therefore would be impossible to practice under a claim construction such as the one we adopt.
we are not persuaded.as discussed,the plain language of the independent claims requires each potential caller to be assigned a service location telephone number before any call is placed.since the mobile telephone claims depend from the independent claims,all potential mobile telephone callers must also be assigned a service location before a call is placed.nothing in the language of the claims indicates otherwise.while the claims and the written description appear to contemplate that the assignment will be based on the caller physical location at the time of the call,the written description does not teach a method for doing so.significantly,the patents do not disclose the use of stored algorithms that could be used to assign service location telephone numbers during a call from either a mobile telephone or a fixed landline,and thus the written description does not support adept proposed construction.
furthermore,it is not clear that the mobile telephone claims would be impossible to practice under the correct claim construction.prior to any calls,a service location could be assigned to a mobile telephone based on,for example,a physical location associated with its.be that as it may,we need not resolve this question.even if the mobile telephone claims are rendered inoperative by a proper claim construction,preserving the validity of unasserted claims is an insufficient reason to ignore the meaning of the claims actually asserted in the case.see intamin magnetar techs.
in sum,based on consideration of the claims,the written description,and the remainder of the intrinsic evidence,we conclude that the trial court was correct in the first instance when it construed the assigning language to refer to a designation made prior to the telephone call of the first parties.we must also recognize,however,what the assignment telephone number of a service location is assigned to the physical location or telephone number of each potential caller.as noted,this assignment must be made before any calls are placed.thus,to the extent any calculations are needed to complete the assignment of service location telephone numbers to potential callers,they must be performed prior to any calls.
the trial judge modified the original claim construction by adding that the neville patents do not exclude calculations made during the telephone call.that statement is imprecise in the context in which it was presented,as part of the construction of the term assigning,and allowed adept to argue before the jury that calculations for completing the assigning step could be performed while a caller is,an argument that is not consistent with the patented invention.under the correct claim construction,assignment of service location telephone numbers to potential callers must occur prior to any calls,and thus any calculations necessary for completing that assignment must be performed before any telephone calls are placed.
infringement 
with the trial court modified claim construction before them,the jury found that defendant targus infringed the neville patents,and the trial court subsequently denied a motion by targus to grant,contrary to the jury verdict,judgment as a matter of law in targus favor.the question before us is whether the trial judge erred in denying the motion.we review the trial court denial of targus motion for judgment as a matter of law under the law of the regional circuit,microsoft.under eleventh circuit law,we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law without deference,reapplying the same standard applied by the trial court.christopher florida,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmoving party.id.when a patent infringement verdict is based on an incorrect claim construction,we reverse the trial court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law if no reasonable jury could have found infringement under the proper claim construction.finisar directv group.
in the targus system,the telephone numbers and locations of potential callers are maintained in a database.the system also includes a database for each system customer containing the telephone numbers of the customer service locations along with their corresponding service areas.those service areas are configured by the customer before any calls are placed and may be a circle around the service location or defined by polygonal regions around each service location.while the targus system contains information relating to both potential callers and customer service locations,it does not match a customer service location to a particular caller prior to any calls taking place.instead,as described in the intellirouting express user guide,callers are assigned to a service location on the fly with each telephone call.
when a call comes into the platform,the targus system determines the caller approximate latitude and longitude based on the caller ani.the system then computes a rectangular area,referred to as a window key,around that.next the system identifies a list of candidate service locations whose service areas overlap the window key.for each candidate,the system performs a detailed spatial calculation,either a distance computation or calculation,to determine whether the caller location is within the service area.this results in a list of one or more service locations to which the call may be routed.
thus the accused targus services do not assign service location telephone numbers to potential callers before calls are placed.because all calculations necessary to complete the assignment are performed in while the caller is on the line,the targus services do not satisfy the assigning limitations in the neville claims.under the correct claim construction,no reasonable jury could find that targus infringes the asserted claims of adept patents.accordingly,we reverse the trial court denial of targus motion for judgment of as a matter of law.in light of that result,we vacate the infringement damages award and the permanent injunction we also vacate the trial court judgment with respect to willfulness and attorney fees.
ii.targus patents 
unasserted claims 
the jury found that all claims of the patent and patent were invalid,and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.targus argues that the trial court erred because only claim of the patent and claims and of the patent were asserted and at issue.adept responds that all claims of the two patents were placed in issue by the declaratory judgment count in its complaint.if the evidence at trial proved that all the claims were invalid,adept maintains,the trial judge properly entered judgment on the jury verdict.
we agree with targus that the unasserted claims were not at issue,and thus the trial court erred.first,the scope of adept complaint is less than clear.adept requested a declaratory judgment with respect to the invalidity of targus asserted claims,an apparent reference to targus assertions of infringement against adept and its customers prior to the filing of the lawsuit.first am.compl.the complaint does not specify which claims fall into that category.in any event,a reference in the complaint is not sufficient to support a judgment that particular claims are invalid the specific validity of those claims must have been at issue during the trial and actually litigated by the parties.datascope smec.
second,the parties joint final pretrial statement demonstrates that only claim of the patent and claims and of the patent were at issue during the trial.in that document,the parties stipulated that the asserted claims of the patent and patent were claim and claims and,respectively.joint final pretrial statement.then,under the heading concise statement of issues of fact and issues of law which remain for determination by the trial court,the parties included the following two questions are the asserted claims of the patents valid and are the asserted patents infringed,literally or under the doctrine of equivalents id.at.there were no references whatsoever to the unasserted claims of the patent and patent.
third,at trial,neither party presented evidence with respect to the unasserted claims.adept expert,brody,expressly limited his validity analysis and opinions to claim of the patent and claims and of the patent.trial tr.this is true with respect to both adept anticipation and obviousness contentions and its argument that the claims of the patent were invalid due to an bar.adept argument that it was unnecessary for its validity expert to put forth a analysis of the unasserted claims is simply incorrect.under the patent statute,the validity of each claim must be considered separately.see each claim of a patent whether in independent,dependent,or multiple dependent form shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims schumer lab.computer,sandt,resco metal plastics.
in this case,it is clear from the parties pretrial statement and from the trial proceedings that the unasserted claims were neither litigated nor placed in issue during the trial.we therefore reverse the trial court judgment of invalidity with respect to the unasserted claims,all the claims of the patent except claim and all the claims of the patent except claims and 
asserted claims 
the jury also found all twelve of the asserted claims in the patents invalid.targus chose not to appeal the trial court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law that the asserted claims are not invalid,and thus does not challenge on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the jury verdict.instead,targus appeals only the trial court denial of its motion for a new trial on the validity of these claims.applying eleventh circuit law,we review the trial court denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.hicks talbott recovery,cir.when a jury verdict is judged to be against the great weight of the evidence,the trial judge has authority to grant a motion for a new trial.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.
targus argues on appeal that the jury invalidity findings were tainted by the erroneous characterization of the neville patents by adept expert,brody.in particular,targus complains that brody repeatedly asserted that the neville patents teach spatial calculations of the sort used by targus and claimed in some of the patents.because brody testified that the asserted claims were either anticipated by the neville patents or rendered obvious by the combination of the neville patents and other prior art,targus believes it is entitled to a new trial on the validity of the asserted claims.
we agree with targus,but only in part.targus requests on appeal a new trial on whether the asserted claims of the patents that concern on line calculations are invalid.appellant reply br.in its brief,targus identifies only two asserted claims that involve or of the patent and claim of the patent.appellant br.our review of the record confirms that those are the only asserted claims directed to targus system.our review further confirms that brody testimony with regard to the alleged aspect of the neville patents was directed to the validity of only those two claims and not to the other asserted claims.
as explained above in the discussion on the adept patents,brody characterization of the scope of the neville patent disclosure was mistaken.furthermore,the primary if not the entire evidence on which the jury could have relied in finding claim of the patent and claim of the patent invalid was brody erroneous testimony.under these circumstances,the trial judge should have granted the motion for a new trial with regard to these two claims because the great weight of the evidence in the record was against the jury verdict.this does not preclude the possibility that other evidence produced at a retrial would be sufficient to establish invalidity.
the failure to have granted targus motion was an abuse of discretion accordingly,we vacate the trial court judgment that claim of the patent and claim of the patent are invalid,and remand for a new trial on their validity.we affirm the trial court judgment that the remaining asserted claims of the patents are invalid.
iii.tortious interference 
in its suit against targus,adept claimed that,because targus had asserted certain of its patent claims against some of adept customers,targus had tortiously interfered with adept business relationships with those customers.this,according to adept,entitled adept to the remedy available for such an unfair trade practice.targus responded that the remedy is preempted by the federal patent laws.the preemption issue can be stated thus if a patentee attempts to enforce its patents against a competitor customers,under what circumstances,if any,is the patentee protected from the usual standards regarding unfair trade practices,imposed by various state unfair competition laws,on the theory that the rights accorded a patentee to enforce the patent supersede the usual rules see zenith elecs.exzec.
the answer to the question is now.state tort claims against a patent holder,including tortious interference claims,based on enforcing a patent in the marketplace,are preempted by federal patent laws,unless the claimant can show that the patent holder acted in bad faith in the publication or enforcement of its patent.id.at hunter douglas,harmonic design.as the supreme court said long ago,patents would be of little value if infringers of them could not be notified of the consequences of i
