in,a small california research company called cetus began to develop methods for quantifying levels of human immunodeficiency virus hiv,the virus that causes aids.a nobel prize winning technique developed at cetus known as pcr was an integral part of these efforts.
in,cetus began to collaborate with scientists at stanford university department of infectious diseases to test the efficacy of new aids drugs.holodniy joined stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time.when he did so,he signed an agreement stating that he agree d to assign to stanford his right,title and interest in inventions resulting from his employment there.holodniy supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at cetus to learn about pcr.as a condition of gaining access to cetus,holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he will assign and do es hereby assign to cetus his right,title and interest in the ideas,inventions,and improvements made as a consequence of his access to cetus.working with cetus employees,holodniy devised a procedure for measuring the amount of hiv in a patient blood.upon returning to stanford,he and other stanford employees tested the procedure.stanford secured three patents to the measurement process.
roche molecular systems acquired cetus assets.after conducting clinical trials on the hiv quantification method developed at cetus,roche commercialized the procedure.today,its hiv test kits are used worldwide.
the university and small business patent procedures act of act or act allocates rights in federally funded subject invention s between the federal government and federal contractors.e,c,a.the act defines subject invention as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,e,and provides that contractors may elect to retain title to any subject invention,a.because some of stanford research on the hiv measurement technique was funded by the national institutes of health nih,the act applied.in accordance with the act requirements,stanford notified nih that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on the government a license to use the patented procedure.
petitioner,the board of trustees of stanford university,filed suit against respondents roche,claiming that their hiv test kits infringed stanford patents.roche responded that holodniy agreement with cetus gave it of the procedure,and thus stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement.stanford countered that holodniy had no rights to assign because the university had superior rights under the act.the district court agreed with stanford and held that under the act,holodniy had no rights to assign to cetus.the court of appeals for the federal circuit disagreed,concluding that holodniy agreement with cetus assigned his rights to cetus,and thus to roche.it also found that the act did not automatically void an inventor rights in federally funded inventions.thus,the act did not extinguish roche ownership interest in the invention,and stanford was deprived of standing.
held the act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions.
a since,patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.see,gayler wilder,how.in most cases,a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor,or because an inventor interest in his invention is assignable in law by an instrument in writing an inventor assignee.see united states dubilier condenser.absent an agreement to the contrary,an employer does not have rights in an invention which is the original conception of the employee alone,at an inventor must expressly grant those rights to his employer,see,at.
b stanford and amicus united states contend that,when an invention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal funds,the act vests title to those inventions in the inventor employer the federal contractor.congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified federal contracts become the government property.such unambiguous language is notably absent from the act.instead,the act provides that contractors may elect to retain title to any subject invention,a,defining a subject invention as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,e.
stanford contends that invention of the contractor means all inventions that a contractor employees make with the aid of federal funds.that reading assumes that congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.this court has rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee invention in the employer.stanford reading also renders the phrase of the contractor superfluous since the definition already covers inventions made under a funding agreement.construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement inventions of the contractor,that is,those owned by or belonging to the contractor makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.and invention owned by the contractor or invention belonging to the contractor are natural readings of the phrase invention of the contractor.
section a,which states that contractors may elect to retain title,confirms that the act does not vest title.stanford reaches the opposite conclusion,but only because it reads retain to mean acquire and receive.that is certainly not the common meaning of retain,which is to hold or continue to hold in possession or use.you can not retain something unless you already have it.and a which provides that the act take s precedence over any other act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions that is inconsistent with the act does not displace the basic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention.only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the act come into play.the act disposition of rights does nothing more than clarify the order of priority of rights between the federal government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor.
the act isolated provisions dealing with inventors rights in subject inventions are consistent with the court construction of the act.see d.that construction is also bolstered by the act limited procedural protections,which expressly give contractors the right to challenge a impediment to retaining title to a subject invention,b,but do not provide similar protection for inventor and rights.
stanford contrary construction would permit title to an employee inventions to vest in the university even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became an employee,so long as the invention reduction to practice was supported by federal funding.it also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar of federal funding applied toward an invention conception or reduction to practice.it would be noteworthy enough for congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions.to do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising.had congress intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearly not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of subject invention and an idiosyncratic use of the word retain.
the court construction of the act is also reflected in the common practice of contractors,who generally obtain assignments from their employees,and of agencies that fund federal contractors,who typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments.with effective assignments,federally funded inventions become subject inventions and the act as a practical matter works pretty much the way stanford says it should.the only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own their inventions.

chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
since,the patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.the question here is whether the university and small business patent procedures act of commonly referred to as the act displaces that norm and automatically vests title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors.we hold that it does not.
in,a small california research company called cetus began to develop methods for quantifying levels of human immunodeficiency virus hiv,the virus that causes aids.a nobel prize winning technique developed at cetus polymerase chain reaction,or pcr was an integral part of these efforts.pcr allows billions of copies of dna sequences to be made from a small initial blood sample.
in,cetus began to collaborate with scientists at stanford university department of infectious diseases to test the efficacy of new aids drugs.mark holodniy joined stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time.when he did so,he signed a copyright and patent agreement cpa stating that he agree d to assign to stanford his right,title and interest in inventions resulting from his employment at the university.app.to pet.for cert.
at stanford holodniy undertook to develop an improved method for quantifying hiv levels in patient blood samples,using pcr.because holodniy was largely unfamiliar with pcr,his supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at cetus.as a condition of gaining access to cetus,holodniy signed a visitor confidentiality agreement vca.that agreement stated that holodniy will assign and do es hereby assign to cetus his right,title and interest in each of the ideas,inventions and improvements made as a consequence of his access to cetus,at.
for the next nine months,holodniy conducted research at cetus.working with cetus employees,holodniy devised a procedure for calculating the amount of hiv in a patient blood.that technique allowed doctors to determine whether a patient was benefiting from hiv therapy.
holodniy then returned to stanford where he and other university employees tested the hiv measurement technique.over the next few years,stanford obtained written assignments of rights from the stanford employees involved in refinement of the technique,including holodniy,and filed several patent applications related to the procedure.stanford secured three patents to the hiv measurement process.
in,roche molecular systems,a company that specializes in diagnostic blood screening,acquired cetus assets,including all rights cetus had obtained through agreements like the vca signed by holodniy.after conducting clinical trials on the hiv quantification method developed at cetus,roche commercialized the procedure.today,roche hiv test kits are used in hospitals and aids clinics worldwide.brief for respondents.
in,congress passed the act to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research,promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations,and ensure that the government obtains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions.to achieve these aims,the act allocates rights in federally funded subject invention s between the federal government and federal contractors any person,small business firm,or nonprofit organization that is a party to a funding agreement e,c,a.the act defines subject invention as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.e.
the act provides that contractors may elect to retain title to any subject invention.a.to be able to retain title,a contractor must fulfill a number of obligations imposed by the statute.the contractor must disclose each subject invention to the relevant federal agency within a reasonable time it must make a written election within two years after disclosure stating that the contractor opts to retain title to the invention and the contractor must file a patent application prior to any statutory bar date.c.the federal government may receive title to a subject invention if a contractor fails to comply with any of these obligations.ibid.
the government has several rights in federally funded subject inventions under the act.the agency that granted the federal funds receives from the contractor a nonexclusive,nontransferrable,irrevocable,license to practice the subject invention.c.the agency also possesses m rights,which permit the agency to grant a license to a responsible third party under certain circumstances,such as when the fails to take effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention.the act further provides that when the contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention,the government may consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor.d.
some of stanford research related to the hiv measurement technique was funded by the national institutes of health nih,thereby subjecting the invention to the act.accordingly,stanford disclosed the,conferred on the government a nonexclusive,nontransferable,license to use the patented,and formally notified nih that it elected to retain title to the invention.
in,the board of trustees of stanford university filed suit against roche molecular systems,roche diagnostics corporation,and roche diagnostics operations,collectively roche,contending that roche hiv test kits infringed stanford patents.as relevant here,roche responded by asserting that it was a of the hiv quantification procedure,based on holodniy assignment of his rights in the visitor confidentiality agreement.as a result,roche argued,stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement.supp,nd cal.stanford claimed that holodniy had no rights to assign because the university hiv research was federally funded,giving the school superior rights in the invention under the act.ibid 
the district court held that the vca effectively assigned any rights that holodniy had in the patented invention to cetus,and thus to roche,at.but because of the operation of the act,holodniy had no interest to assign.at.the court concluded that the act provides that the individual inventor may obtain title to a federally funded invention only after the government and the contracting party have declined to do so.at.
the court of appeals for the federal circuit disagreed.first,the court concluded that holodniy initial agreement with stanford in the copyright and patent agreement constituted a mere promise to assign rights in the future,unlike holodniy agreement with cetus in the visitor confidentiality agreement,which itself assigned holodniy rights in the invention to cetus.see.therefore,as a matter of contract law,cetus obtained holodniy rights in the hiv quantification technique through the vca next,the court explained that the act does not automatically void ab initio the inventors rights in inventions and that the statutory scheme did not automatically void the patent rights that cetus received from holodniy.at.the court held that roche possesse d an ownership interest in the that was not extinguished by the act,depriv ing stanford of standing.at.the court of appeals then remanded the case with instructions to dismiss stanford infringement claim,at.
we granted certiorari.
congress has the authority t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.const.art.i,cl.the first congress put that power to use by enacting the patent act of.that act provided t hat upon the petition of any person or persons setting forth,that he,she,or they,hath or have invented or discovered an invention,a patent could be granted to such petitioner or petitioners or their heirs,administrators or assigns.act of,stat.under that law,the first patent was granted in to samuel hopkins,who had devised an improved method for making potash,america first industrial chemical.patent issued july,
although much in intellectual property law has changed in the years since the first patent act,the basic idea that inventors have the right to patent their inventions has not.under the law in its current form,w hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter may obtain a patent therefor.the inventor must attest that he believes himself to be the original and first inventor of the invention for which he solicits a patent.in most cases,a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor,or because an inventor interest in his invention is assignable in law by an instrument in writing an inventor assignee.
our precedents confirm the general rule that rights in an invention belong to the inventor.see,gayler wilder,how,the discoverer of a new and useful improvement is vested by law with an inchoate right to its exclusive use,which he may perfect and make absolute by proceeding in the manner which the law requires solomons united states,whatever invention an inventor may thus conceive and perfect is his individual property united states dubilier condenser,an inventor owns the product of his original thought the treatises are to the same effect.see,chisum on patents,the presumptive owner of the property right in a patentable invention is the single human inventor 
it is equally well established that an inventor can assign his rights in an invention to a third party.see dubilier condenser,supra,at a patent is property and title to it can pass only by assignment chisum on patents,supra,at the inventor may transfer ownership interests by written assignment to anyone thus,although others may acquire an interest in an invention,any such interest as a general rule must trace back to the inventor.
in accordance with these principles,we have recognized that unless there is an agreement to the contrary,an employer does not have rights in an invention which is the original conception of the employee alone.dubilier condenser,at.such an invention remains the property of him who conceived it.ibid.in most circumstances,an inventor must expressly grant his rights in an invention to his employer if the employer is to obtain those rights.see,at the respective rights and obligations of employer and employee,touching an invention conceived by the latter,spring from the contract of employment 
stanford and the united states as amicus curiae contend that the act reorders the normal priority of rights in an invention when the invention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal funds.in their view,the act moves inventors from the front of the line to the back by vesting title to federally funded inventions in the inventor employer the federal contractor.see brief for petitioner brief for united states as amicus curiae.
congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts become the property of the united states.for example,with respect to certain contracts dealing with nuclear material and atomic energy,congress provided that title to such inventions shall be vested in,and be the property of,the atomic energy commission.congress has also enacted laws requiring that title to certain inventions made pursuant to contracts with the national aeronautics and space administration shall be the exclusive property of the united states,pub,stat,b,and that title to certain inventions under contracts with the department of energy shall vest in the united states.
such language is notably absent from the act.nowhere in the act is title expressly vested in contractors or anyone else nowhere in the act are inventors expressly deprived of their interest in federally funded inventions.instead,the act provides that contractors may elect to retain title to any subject invention.a.a subject invention is defined as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.e.
stanford asserts that the phrase invention of the contractor in this provision is naturally read to include all inventions made by the contractor employees with the aid of federal funding.brief for petitioner footnote omitted.that reading assumes that congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.it also renders the phrase of the contractor superfluous.if the phrase of the contractor were deleted from the definition of subject invention,the definition would cover any invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.reading of the contractor to mean all inventions made by the contractor employees with the aid of federal funding,as stanford would,adds nothing that is not already in the definition,since the definition already covers inventions made under the funding agreement.that is contrary to our general reluctan ce to treat statutory terms as surplusage.duncan walker,internal quotation marks omitted.
construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement inventions of the contractor,that is,those owned by or belonging to the contractor makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.and invention owned by the contractor or invention belonging to the contractor are natural readings of the phrase invention of the contractor.as we have explained,t he use of the word of denotes ownership.poe seaborn,see floresfigueroa united states,slip,at,treating the phrase identification papers of another person as meaning such items belonging to another person internal quotation marks omitted ellis united states,interpreting the phrase works of the united states to mean works belonging to the united states internal quotation marks omitted.
that reading follows from a common definition of the word of.see webster third new international dictionary of can be used as a function word indicating a possessive relationship new oxford american dictionary ed.defining of as indicating an association between two entities,typically one of belonging webster new twentieth century dictionary ed.defining of as belonging to 
stanford reading of the phrase invention of the contractor to mean all inventions made by the contractor employees is plausible enough in the abstract it is often the case that whatever an employee produces in the course of his employment belongs to his employer.no one would claim that an autoworker who builds a car while working in a factory owns that car.but,as noted,patent law has always been different we have rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee invention in the employer.against this background,a contractor invention an invention of the contractor does not automatically include inventions made by the contractor employees 
the act provision stating that contractors may elect to retain title confirms that the act does not vest title.a emphasis added.stanford reaches the opposite conclusion,but only because it reads retain to mean acquire and receive.brief for petitioner internal quotation marks omitted.that is certainly not the common meaning of retain.r etain means to hold or continue to hold in possession or use.webster third,supra,at see webster new collegiate dictionary to keep in possession or use american heritage dictionary t o keep or hold in one possession you can not retain something unless you already have it.see alaska united states,interpreting the phrase the united states shall retain title to all property to mean that t he united states retained title to its property located within alaska borders emphasis added.the act does not confer title to federally funded inventions on contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to those inventions it simply assures contractors that they may keep title to whatever it is they already have.such a provision makes sense in a statute specifying the respective rights and responsibilities of federal contractors and the government.
the act states that it take s precedence over any other act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions that is inconsistent with the act.a.the united states as amicus curiae argues that this provision operates to displace the basic principle,codified in the patent act,that an inventor owns the rights to his invention.see brief for united states.but because the act,including a,applies only to subject inventions inventions of the contractor it does not displace an inventor antecedent title to his invention.only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the act come into play.the act disposition of rights like much of the rest of the act serves to clarify the order of priority of rights between the federal government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor.nothing more 
the isolated provisions of the act dealing with inventors rights in subject inventions are consistent with our construction of the act.under the act,a federal agency may grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor i f a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention.d.if an employee inventor never had title to his invention because title vested in the contractor by operation of law as stanford submits it would be odd to allow the government to grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor.by using the word retention,d assumes that the inventor had rights in the subject invention at some point,undermining the notion that the act automatically vests title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors 
the limited scope of the act procedural protections also bolsters our conclusion.the act expressly confers on contractors the right to challenge a impediment to retaining title to a subject invention.b.as roche correctly notes,however,the act contains not a single procedural protection for third parties that have neither sought nor received federal funds,such as cooperating private research institutions.brief for respondents.nor does the act allow inventors employed by federal contractors to contest their employer claim to a subject invention.the act,for example,does not expressly permit an interested third party or an inventor to challenge a claim that a particular invention was supported by federal funding.in a world in which there is frequent collaboration between private entities,inventors,and federal contractors,see brief for pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america as amicus curiae,that absence would be deeply troubling.but the lack of procedures protecting inventor and rights makes perfect sense if the act applies only when a federal contractor has already acquired title to an inventor interest.in that case,there is no need to protect inventor or rights,because the only rights at issue are those of the contractor and the government.
the act applies to subject inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work funded in whole or in part by the federal government.e,b emphasis added.under stanford construction of the act,title to one of its employee inventions could vest in the university even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became a university employee,so long as the invention reduction to practice was supported by federal funding.what is more,stanford reading suggests that the school would obtain title to one of its employee inventions even if only one dollar of federal funding was applied toward the invention conception or reduction to practice.
it would be noteworthy enough for congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions.to do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising.we are confident that if congress had intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearly not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of subject invention and an idiosyncratic use of the word retain.whitman american trucking,congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions 
though unnecessary to our conclusion,it is worth noting that our construction of the act is reflected in the common practice among parties operating under the act.contractors generally institute policies to obtain assignments from their employees.see brief for respondents brief for pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america as amicus curiae.agencies that grant funds to federal contractors typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments.so it is with nih,the agency that granted the federal funds at issue in this case.in guidance documents made available to contractors,nih has made clear that b y law,an inventor has initial ownership of an invention and that contractors should therefore have in place employee agreements requiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an invention to the organization upon acceptance of federal funds.nih policies,procedures,and forms,a view of invention reporting to the national institutes of health.such guidance would be unnecessary if stanford reading of the statute were correct.
stanford contends that reading the act as not vesting title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors fundamentally undermin es the act and severely threatens its continued successful application.brief for petitioner.we do not agree.as just noted,universities typically enter into agreements with their employees requiring the assignment to the university of rights in inventions.with an effective assignment,those inventions if federally funded become subject inventions under the act,and the statute as a practical matter works pretty much the way stanford says it should.the only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic principle of patent law that inventors own their inventions.

justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg joins,dissenting.
the question presented in this case is 
whether a federal contractor university statutory right under the act,in inventions arising from federally funded research can be terminated unilaterally by an individual through a separate agreement purporting to the inventor rights to a third party.brief for petitioner 
in my view,the answer to this question is likely no.but because that answer turns on matters that have not been fully briefed and are not resolved by the opinion of the court,i would return this case to the federal circuit for further argument.
the act creates a system for patent rights ownership applicable to federally funded research conducted by nonprofit organizations,such as universities,and small businesses.it sets forth conditions that mean the funded firm failing that,the united states government and failing that,the employee who made the invention,will likely obtain or retain any resulting patent rights normally in that order.the statute applies to subject s defined as any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.e emphasis added.since the contractor a university or small business is unlikely to conceiv e of an idea or reduc e it to practice other than through its employees,the term invention of the contractor must refer to the work and ideas of those employees.we all agree that the term covers those employee inventions that the employee properly assigns to the contractor,his or her employer.but does the term subject invention also include inventions that the employee fails to assign properly 
congress enacted this statute against a background norm that often,but not always,denies individual inventors patent rights growing out of research for which the public has already paid.this legal norm reflects the fact that patents themselves have both benefits and costs.patents,for example,help to elicit useful inventions and research and to assure public disclosure of technological advances.see,mazer stein,bilski kappos,slip,at,at slip,at stevens,concurring in judgment.but patents sometimes mean unnecessarily high prices or restricted dissemination and they sometimes discourage further innovation and competition by costly searches for earlier,related patents or by tying up ideas,which,were they free,would more effectively spur research and development.see,laboratory of america holdings metabolite laboratories,breyer,dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted heller eisenberg,can patents deter innovation the anticommons in biomedical research,science.
thus,thomas jefferson wrote of the difficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent,and those which are not.letter to isaac mcpherson,in writings of thomas jefferson washington ed.and james madison favored the patent monopoly because it amounted to compensation for a community benefit.monopolies.perpetuities.corporations.ecclesiastical,in madison,writings rakove ed.
the importance of assuring this community benefit is reflected in legal rules that may deny or limit the award of patent rights where the public has already paid to produce an invention,lest the public bear the potential costs of patent protection where there is no offsetting need for such protection to elicit that invention.why should the public have to pay twice for the same invention 
legal rules of this kind include an executive order that ordinarily gives to the government the entire right,title and interest to inventions made by government employees who conduct or perform research,development work,or both.cfr codifying,as amended,exec.order,cfr comp.see also heinemann united states,ca fed.holding executive order constitutional and finding no taking because the invention was not the property of heinemann they also include statutes,which,in specific research areas,give the government title to inventions made pursuant to government contracts.see atomic energy act of,stat.codified as amended at national aeronautics and space act of,stat.codified at,repealed by,stat.federal nonnuclear energy research and development act of,stat.codified as amended at a.and they have included government regulations,established prior to the act enactment,that work in roughly similar ways.see,cfr b national science foundation regulations providing that foundation would determine the disposition of the invention made under the grant and title to and rights under any patent application a,d department of health,education,and welfare regulations providing that inventions made under department grants shall be subject to determination by the agency and that the department may require that all domestic rights in the invention shall be assigned to the united states 
these legal rules provide the basic background against which congress passed the act.and the act provisions reflect a related effort to assure that rights to inventions arising out of research for which the public has paid are distributed and used in ways that further specific important public interests.i agree with the majority that the act does not simply take the individual inventors rights and grant them to the government.rather,it assumes that the federal funds recipient,say a university or small business,will possess those rights.the act leaves those rights in the hands of that recipient,not because it seeks to make the public pay twice for the same invention,but for a special public policy reason.in doing so,it seeks to encourage those institutions to commercialize inventions that otherwise might not realize their potentially beneficial public use.the act helps assure that commercialization while promot ing free competition and protect ing the public,ibid.by imposing a set of conditions upon the federal funds recipient,by providing that sometimes the government will take direct control of the patent rights,and by adding that on occasion the government will permit the individual inventor to retain those rights.
given this basic statutory objective,i can not so easily accept the majority conclusion that the individual can lawfully assign an invention produced by public funds to a third party,thereby taking that invention out from under the act restrictions,conditions,and allocation rules.that conclusion,in my view,is inconsistent with the act basic purposes.it may significantly undercut the act ability to achieve its objectives.it allows individual inventors,for whose invention the public has paid,to avoid the act corresponding restrictions and conditions.and it makes the commercialization and marketing of such an invention more difficult a potential purchaser of rights from the contractor,say a university,will not know if the university itself possesses the patent right in question or whether,as here,the individual,inadvertently or deliberately,has previously assigned the title to a third party.
moreover,i do not agree that the language to which the majority points the words invention of the contractor and retain requires its result.as the majority concedes,stanford alternative reading of the phrase of the contractor is plausible enough in the abstract.ante,at.nor do i agree that the act lack of an explicit provision for an interested third party to claim that an invention was not the result of federal funding bolsters the majority interpretation.ante,at.in any event,universities and businesses have worked out ways to protect the various participants to research.see brief for association of american universities et as amici curiae hereinafter aau brief app.materials transfer agreement between cetus and stanford university.
ultimately,the majority rejects stanford reading and the government reading of the act because it believes that it is inconsistent with certain background norms of patent law,norms that ordinarily provide an individual inventor with full patent rights.ante,at.but in my view,the competing norms governing rights in inventions for which the public has already paid,along with the act objectives,suggest a different result.
there are two different legal routes to what i consider an interpretation more consistent with the statute objectives.first,we could set aside the federal circuit interpretation of the licensing agreements and its related licensing doctrine.that doctrine governs interpretation of licensing agreements made before an invention is conceived or reduced to practice.here,there are two such agreements.in the earlier agreement that between holodniy and stanford university holodniy said,i agree to assign to stanford that right,title and interest in and to such inventions as required by contracts and grants.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added.in the later agreement that between holodniy and the private research firm cetus holodniy said,i will assign and do hereby assign to cetus,my right,title,and interest in here relevant ideas and inventions.at emphasis added capitalization omitted.
the federal circuit held t
