appellants jon chaffee,amy chaffee,and ramalda bou appeal from the district court decision granting summary judgment and damages to appellee coxcom,after finding that appellants violated the cable communications policy act of,a section,and the digital millennium copyright act dmca.appellants argue that coxcom lacked standing to bring the lawsuit,and that summary judgment was improvidently granted.appellants further contend that,summary judgment notwithstanding,they were entitled to a jury trial on damages,and they also dispute the imposition of a permanent injunction.we affirm.
background facts 
coxcom offers cable television services to subscribers in rhode island,massachusetts,and connecticut.coxcom leases electronic decoding equipment commonly known as cable boxes to its subscribers to descramble incoming signals for viewing.the cable box also transmits certain information from subscribers back to coxcom,including billing information associated with the purchase of programming 
at issue here is a digital cable filter,a device that can affect those return transmissions.these filters block signals,typically those below.normally,after a subscriber purchases and views programming,the subscriber cable box sends a transmission to the cable company with data on the purchase.this transmission is emitted at a low frequency,mhz.with the filter installed,purchases of up to would not register on the cable company central computer.after accumulating of unbilled charges,the cable box would lock out additional purchases.the filters are not illegal,and they also have innocuous uses,such as allowing cable television subscribers to enhance viewing quality by filtering out interference from fm radio broadcast towers,shortwave radios,and home appliances.
appellants residents of rhode island at the relevant time,sold the filters at computer trade shows,including in rhode island and connecticut.appellants sold the filters with an instruction sheet stating that the filter was designed to test the performance of billing systems and further providing 
by having this filter connected to your digital cable box any and all programming that can be received by pressing the buy,order or purchase button on your remote will be viewed without the billing information reaching the cable company.we are not suggesting or implying that anyone who purchases this tool participate in any theft of cable programming and therefore,it is imperative that you notify your cable company of any programs that you view while using this filter so they will know to bill you accordingly.
a digital cable filter will block out pay per view and movie order charges from your cable company,giving you free pay per view.therefore,it is mandatory that you notify your cable company of the extra orders 
appellants made statements to their customers in the course of selling the filters that were recorded by coxcom investigators.amy chaffee stated that the filters actually worked,and that they worked specifically on coxcom equipment.she also warned a prospective customer that the cable box would only hold a certain amount of unbilled charges,which she estimated at.
appellants also provided their contact information to filter purchasers for customer support and service.jon chaffee made the following statements in email correspondence with filter purchasers it is only for pay per view,not hbo and showtime.here is sic the directions the filter only works for pay for views it does work for hbo,showtime and other premium channels.you must reset the box before removing or you will be charged here is sic the instructions for the cable filter.sorry it only works for pay per view.
coxcom undercover investigators purchased eighteen digital cable filters from appellants at computer trade shows in connecticut and rhode island and in a separate sale arranged over the telephone and consummated in a parking lot in rhode island.coxcom subsequently commenced this action in district court,alleging that the filter sales violated section and the dmca.
procedural history 
immediately after filing its complaint,coxcom moved ex parte for a temporary restraining order tro seeking to seize appellants business records and computers and to enjoin appellants from selling,transferring,storing or distributing digital cable filters pending the resolution of the matter.the court granted both requests,and the parties then entered into a preliminary injunction on consent,under the terms of the tro.
appellants answer requested a jury trial 
after the close of discovery,coxcom moved for summary judgment.appellants motion objected and for summary judgment.the magistrate judge recommended that coxcom motion be granted and that appellants be denied.after de novo review,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in full over several objections by appellants.
with appellants liability established,the district court referred the matter to the magistrate judge for a report and recommendation on damages and costs.present at the bench trial on damages were jon chaffee,appearing pro se,and counsel for amy chaffee and ramalda bou.neither jon chaffee nor counsel presented any evidence on damages,although each coxcom witnesses 
the magistrate judge recommended that coxcom be awarded statutory and enhanced damages under section in the amount of,and statutory and enhanced damages under the dmca in the amount of,jointly and severally against appellants jon and amy chaffee.further,the magistrate judge recommended that coxcom be awarded attorneys fees and costs of,also jointly and severally against appellants jon and amy chaffee.as ramalda bou was present for a limited number of filter sales and was an employee of the chaffees,she was found liable for under section,and for under the dmca.finally,the magistrate judge recommended that all appellants be permanently enjoined from future possession,sale,or distribution of digital cable filters.the district court accepted the report and recommendation in full,over objections submitted by appellants.
on appeal,appellants argue first that the district court had no jurisdiction over the matter because coxcom lacked standing to sue.they next argue that summary judgment was improperly granted to coxcom on the questions of liability under section and under the dmca.finally,appellants argue that they were entitled to a jury trial on damages,and that the permanent injunction was improperly granted 
article iii standing 
the requisite elements of article iii standing are well established a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.hein freedom from religion,d quoting allen wright,d.
to establish constitutional standing at the summary judgment stage,a plaintiff can not rest on mere allegations,but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.libertad welch,cir.
the supreme court in lujan defenders of wildlife,d,described an as an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.see also sullivan city of augusta,cir united states avx,cir.
a particularized injury is one that affect s the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.lujan,at.we have said that plaintiffs seeking to demonstrate need not establish a particularly damaging injury they need only show that they were directly affected by the conduct complained of,and therefore have a personal stake in the suit.libertad,at.in bennett spear,d,the supreme court held that the petitioners,recipients of irrigation water,demonstrated an sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss based on allegations that the aggregate amount of water would be reduced through government action.the court reached this conclusion over the government contention that less water in the aggregate did not necessarily amount to less water for the specific petitioners.
the actual or imminent requirement means not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in adams watson,cir,we found where plaintiffs,milk producers,alleged that a decision by the state agricultural board would set off a chain of economic events that will result in appellants loss of future income,profits,and business opportunities.id.at.while the injury would depend on the chain of events unfolding as plaintiffs alleged,we held that plaintiffs had pled particularized future economic injury which,though latent,nonetheless qualifies as imminent.id.at.
appellants argue that coxcom lacks constitutional standing because it was not injured they point to directv,treworgy,cir,where a defendant was sued under the wiretap act,b,for possessing an unauthorized device.there,the court expressed concern about whether the plaintiff had shown the requisite,because there were no allegations that the defendant actually used or intended to use the device to plaintiff detriment.here,however,coxcom presented evidence that appellants sold filters within coxcom service area that were capable of bypassing coxcom billing mechanism.appellants own statements and their correspondence with customers demonstrated that appellants had specific knowledge that buyers of those filters both intended to use and actually did use the filters to bypass the billing mechanism of the cable company to which the buyer subscribed.
from this evidence,we conclude that coxcom has met both the concrete and particularized and actual or imminent requirements for constitutional standing.coxcom can show a concrete injury in that it is personally affected by the sale of cable filters.like the allegations of water reduction in the aggregate plead by petitioners in bennett,coxcom has introduced sufficient evidence of harm to cable service providers like itself with a billing mechanism susceptible to interference from digital cable filters.we may conclude from this that coxcom itself has been or will be injured from the loss of remuneration attributable to subscribers viewing programming without paying for it.coxcom can also show imminent injury like the plaintiff in adams,as the evidence of appellants sale of filters represents particularized future economic injury,at.even though appellants are correct that there is no showing that any coxcom subscriber actually used one of the filters purchased from appellants to cause financial harm to coxcom,the chain of events that can result from the sale of filters in coxcom service area clearly encompasses a loss of remuneration to coxcom.
summary judgment ruling 
we review the district court summary judgment rulings de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to appellants.perry wolaver,cir summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
section of the cable communications policy act was enacted to reflect congress concern that theft of cable service poses a major threat to the economic viability of cable operators and cable programmers,and creates unfair burdens on cable subscribers who are forced to subsidize the benefits that other individuals are getting by receiving cable service without paying for it,at,reprinted in,see also charter commc ns entm t i,dst burdulis,cir.the relevant statutory language provides 
a unauthorized interception or receipt or assistance in intercepting or receiving service assist in intercepting or receiving defined 
no person shall intercept or receive or assist in intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a cable system,unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.
for the purpose of this section,the term assist in intercepting or receiving shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor as the case may be for unauthorized reception of any communications service offered over a cable system in violation of subparagraph.
a emphasis added.
section liability is thus not limited to situations where cable services have actually been intercepted liability exists where a plaintiff proves that a defendant intended to assist in the unauthorized reception of cable services.see united states beale,p roof of actual interception or reception is unnecessary,provided there has been proof of willful manufacture or distribution of equipment intended for unauthorized use in the interception or reception of a cable communications service.see also time warner entm worldwide,d,section only requires intent to assist in the unauthorized interception of communications offered over a cable system and proof of actual interception by purchasers is not required.
appellants specifically challenge two aspects of the district court determination that they violated section first,they contend that the filters were not designed and used for unauthorized reception of cable programming,and second,that they did not intend that the filters be used for that purpose.a.
appellants first argument focuses on the word reception,contending that because filters affect only the outgoing and not the incoming transmissions between a subscriber cable box and the cable company,filters therefore do not affect reception and their distribution or use is not prohibited by section a 
appellants transparent attempt at wordplay fails.a subscriber using a filter to view receives programming.that programming is unauthorized,because the subscriber has interfered with the cable company billing mechanism in contravention of the subscriber contract with the cable company.the filter itself may not act upon the reception of cable programming,but the record is clear that a filter is equipment that assists a subscriber in unauthorized reception of programming,in violation of section.
appellants next argument is that they did not intend the filters to be used in contravention of section.we reject this argument as well.
for section purposes,intent is understood as specific knowledge of the planned illegal use.intermedia partners se.qb distrib.llc.appellants specific knowledge of the planned illegal use is apparent from the summary judgment record for at least two reasons.first,the instructions for filter operation provided to buyers suggest that appellants knew of the planned illegal use.in storer comm.mogel,the provision of instructions for using particular equipment accompanying sale of that equipment,with the specific knowledge and intent that such equipment would be used,and in fact was used to intercept cable services without payment therefor,was held to be precisely the type of conduct that congress sought to proscribe when it enacted section.
second,the filters here actually did what appellants advertised they blocked billing data.see time warner,d at best evidence of defendants intent to assist in intercepting cable service is the nature of the devices sold.based on this evidence,we agree with the district court that appellants distributed equipment intended for unauthorized reception of cable services,in violation of section a 
appellants next argue that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to coxcom on the dmca claims.the dmca provides in relevant part 
no person shall manufacture,import,offer to the public,provide,or otherwise traffic in any technology,product,service,device,component,or part thereof,that 
a is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title 
b has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title or 
c is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.
a.appellants argue that they are not liable under the dmca because their filters did not circumvent technological measures.
we have a dearth of case law on this statute,so we turn outside of our circuit
