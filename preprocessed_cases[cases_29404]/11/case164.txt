this diversity case concerns a prolonged effort by appellee american honda motor,honda to franchise a new automobile dealership in westborough,massachusetts.this effort has been opposed under a massachusetts dealer protection statute by appellant richard lundgren,lundgren,which operates an existing local honda dealership in auburn,massachusetts,about eleven miles west of the proposed new dealership.the district court put an end to this drama,granting summary judgment to honda.we affirm.
massachusetts,like a number of states,protects franchised car dealers against the potentially oppressive power of their respective manufacturers.am.honda motor,bernardi,honda iv.under the statute,the dealer has a legal right to prevent an arbitrary decision by the manufacturer to create a competing dealership nearby.laws ch,l amended.but the dealer can invoke the statute protection only if the new dealership would be located within the relevant market area rma of the protesting dealer.honda iv,at.
relevant market area might sound like an antitrust concept.tober foreign motors,reiter oldsmobile.in fact it is defined rather mechanically by the applicable massachusetts statute in a frustrated effort by the legislature to avoid protracted litigation over this initial standing requirement.of course,the statute does not concern standing in the article iii sense rather,the legislature has simply enacted a threshold requirement albeit a somewhat complicated one based on the proposed dealer proximity before the arbitrariness test can be invoked.
the definition was more in the original version of the statute there,the rma was to be defined by the courts according to equitable principles.see generally honda iv,at discussing statutory history.but,in,the massachusetts legislature adopted a new bright line formula which governs this case.a further amendment in sought to repair the version in the wake of judicial interpretation.legis.serv.ch,to be codified at.laws ch.amendment but by virtue of a savings clause,the version does not apply to the present dispute,id.
the governing definition,trimmed of portions not here pertinent,reads as follows 
t he relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer is the geographical area immediately surrounding its existing dealer location within which it obtained,during a defined period at least of its retail service sales 
laws ch,l amended.
unfortunately,the statute left open a number of questions for example,whether a dealership location should be regarded as a point or an area whether the surrounding rma should be defined as a perfect circle or may be some other shape whether customer locations should be identified by air miles or some other variable,drive time and whether the figure should be based on transactions,customers or revenues.all of these issues,and others,were litigated in this case.
the present litigation began in april,when honda filed an action in the federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment.honda planned to franchise a new dealer in westborough,massachusetts,about eleven miles east of the existing lundgren dealership in auburn.anticipating a challenge lundgren had earlier contested a different proposal by honda,richard lundgren,am.honda motor,honda sought a ruling that lundgren had no standing under the definition to contest this new dealership as an arbitrary decision by honda.
lundgren,as this litigation shows,is anxious to mount such a contest.both sides engaged experts on the rma issue.at the end of this case first journey through the district court,lundgren stipulated that it could not prevail if the rma had to be a perfect circle.am.honda motor bernardi,d,honda i am.honda motor bernardi,d,honda ii.on that premise,the district court ruled in honda favor.honda i,d at honda ii,d at.
on appeal,this court certified the legal question to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.am.honda motor bernardi,cir honda iii.that court,over a dissent supporting the district court ruling,held that the rma had to be circular or like a circle but did not have to be a perfect circle.honda iv,at.this court then vacated the district court judgment and remanded for further proceedings.am.honda motor bernardi,cir honda v.
the case was then transferred to a different district judge.honda filed a new motion for summary judgment,and lundgren offered two alternative rma calculations purporting to establish standing under the statute.on february,the district court granted summary judgment,again in favor of honda.am.honda motor lundgren,d,honda vi.
two of the district court rulings,favorable to lundgren on the present facts,are not disputed by honda on this appeal.one is that the requirement could be measured by the dollar volume of sales or the number of transactions but not by the number of customers.honda vi,d at.the other is that the location of customers,critical to determining the boundary within which of those customers reside,can be determined by geocoding.id.at.geocoding,championed by lundgren expert,is a somewhat more precise way of locating individual customers than is the zip code distribution method urged by honda 
on these premises,lundgren expert proceeded as follows.first,customers each assigned the dollar value of his or her repairs in the relevant period were sequenced in order of increasing distance from the lundgren dealership.then the expert measured the air mile distance last order distance from the lundgren dealership to the last customer last order location necessary to encompass of the total repair dollars.thus,a circle drawn around the dealership with a radius equal to the last order distance would necessarily include of the repair service revenue.honda vi,d at.
the expert then compared the last order distance to the distance between the lundgren dealership and the site of the proposed new dealership in westborough distance.in determining the distance,the expert did not measure the distance between the respective centroids the geometric centers of the two dealerships but between the eastern border of the lundgren dealership and the western border of the proposed new dealership.because the last order distance and the distance were found to be equal,lundgren expert concluded that the proposed new dealership is within the circle representing lundgren rma.honda vi,d at.
lundgren expert also made a second,alternative calculation of the rma.this time he sequenced customers not by air mile distance from lundgren dealership,new york city is miles from boston,but by the time needed to drive the distance,new york city is four hours from boston.using this metric to derive the last order necessary to constitute of repair sales,the expert found the drive time from lundgren to the new dealer to be minutes and the drive time to the last order location to be minutes.according to lundgren,using such an rma based on drive time means that at least a small portion of the proposed new dealership would fall inside the rma.
in its decision,the district court rejected the main air mile distance calculation on several separate grounds that lundgren had earlier stipulated that it would lose if a perfect circle were used to construct the rma that the rma should be spanned from the centroid of the lundgren property and not from its boundaries that the expert had admittedly rounded off air mile distances to the nearest tenth of a mile and that even disregarding the first three problems the expert rma merely touched rather than overlapped with the property of the proposed new dealer.the court rejected the alternative drive time calculation on the further ground that the massachusetts statute did not allow it.honda vi,d at.summary judgment for honda was entered and lundgren now appeals.
on appeal from summary judgment,this court ordinarily reviews issues de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the party,here lundgren.euromotion,bmw of,cir.at this stage,we assume that the computations of lundgren expert are accurate whether they are foreclosed by the prior stipulation and,if not,whether they satisfy the requirements of the massachusetts statute are legal issues.
