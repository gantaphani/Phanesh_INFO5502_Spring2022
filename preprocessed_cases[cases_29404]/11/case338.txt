defendants motiva enterprises,llc,et collectively motiva,appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut following a bench trial before peter dorsey,judge,in favor of plaintiff gary ceraso,franchisee of a texaco service station,enjoining defendants under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,et,from terminating,failing to renew,or interfering with ceraso texaco franchise.the district court found that motiva had failed to show that ceraso operations gave it grounds under the pmpa for termination of the franchise.on appeal,motiva contends that the district court erred in failing to find that motiva properly terminated the franchise either a on the ground that ceraso violated image provisions of the franchise agreements,or b on the ground that ceraso violated local zoning regulations.for the reasons that follow,we find no basis for reversal,and we affirm the judgment.
background 
ceraso operates,inter alia,a texaco gasoline station and an auto repair shop at jennings road in fairfield,connecticut fairfield or the town,pursuant to a lease lease and a sales agreement sales agreement with motiva.there is no dispute that ceraso is a franchisee and motiva is a franchisor within the meaning of the pmpa.the facts pertinent to the present dispute,largely as found by the district court or as stipulated by the parties,included the following.
a.the franchise agreements and ceraso operations 
the lease authorizes ceraso,as lessee,to use the property solely for the retail sale of motor fuels,petroleum products and services,convenience items,and food and beverage items.lease a.section b of the lease states,in pertinent part,that the 
lessee shall not use nor allow the use of the leased properties for any unlawful,offensive,hazardous,unsightly or other objectionable purpose,and shall not violate or permit any of its employees or invitees to violate any applicable federal,state,or local law,regulation or ordinance.
lease b emphasis added.similarly,the sales agreement requires the franchisee to comply with various provisions of federal,state,and local law.see sales agreement.
the sales agreement,defining ceraso as purchaser,also states,inter alia,that purchaser operations shall be conducted at the retail facility in accordance with the standards set forth in the attached minimum standards.sales agreement b.the minimum standards section states,in pertinent part,that 
purchaser shall continuously maintain the retail facility,inside and out,including building,signs,restrooms,driveways,grass,planting areas,storage areas and any automotive equipment,in good,clean,neat,safe,secure,uncluttered,unobstructed,healthful,orderly,painted,operative and first class condition and in accordance with all applicable laws,rules and regulations.
sales agreement,minimum standards section emphases added.the sales agreement permits motiva to terminate that agreement or to fail to renew the franchise i f purchaser,its employees,agents or invitees,violate the covenants of or fail to comply with the provisions of the minimum standards section.sales agreement m.
ceraso business on the leased premises includes the sale of gasoline and related products,the operation of a modest convenience store,the repair of motor vehicles,and the operation of a towing service.from september through september,ceraso owned as many as towing or vehicles.from december through september,he provided towing services for a number of institutional entities.
for his operations,ceraso had received in february a special zoning exception permit pursuant to the zoning regulations of the town of fairfield,connecticut town zoning regulations.the permit requires compliance with of those regulations the regulation,which provides,in pertinent part that 
no more than five motor vehicles awaiting repair work or having been repaired are to be stored or parked on the lot,unless such motor vehicles are located in an area suitably screened from streets and adjoining property in such a manner as to conceal the area from view to a height of five feet with fences,walls or embankments in combination with other landscaping 
town zoning regulations.
criticisms of ceraso operations 
in december,the town zoning office,having received complaints about the condition of ceraso service station,issued to ceraso an order to comply with the fairfield regulation.that order stated,in part,that ceraso was in violation of the regulation for storing an inordinate number of vehicles on the premises,which creates many safety hazards,and that in order to establish compliance ceraso must reduce the number of unscreened vehicles to five or fewer.attachment to town zoning office order to comply,dated december,order to comply.
in march,robert ascher,who had just become motiva sales representative for the area that included ceraso station,visited ceraso station and observed vehicles parked on the premises.that total did not include cars that were screened or in a repair bay or that appeared to belong to transient customers.ascher testified at trial that he commented to ceraso that there were a lot of cars here but that he said nothing more as to the appearance of the premises.trial transcript november,vol.ii,at.ascher visited the station two or three more times before august on each occasion,he observed conditions similar to those of his first visit and suggested to ceraso that some of the cars be moved.
on august,ascher conducted an image evaluation of the station,making notes of his observations.he attempted to discuss the conditions with ceraso,asking why so many cars were present.at some point,ceraso apparently took umbrage and ordered ascher to leave the premises.ascher did not give ceraso a copy of the evaluation notes.
in the meantime,fairfield zoning enforcement officer peter marsala had observed ceraso premises on several occasions,and the town zoning office eventually sent ceraso a final warning letter dated september.the letter indicated that if ceraso failed to bring his operations into compliance with the regulation,a civil fine would be imposed and his special exception permit would be revoked.a copy of that letter was sent to motiva,as ceraso franchisor.
shortly thereafter,in light of the town september letter and ascher august image evaluation,motiva sent ceraso a letter,by certified mail,stating,in pertinent part,as follows 
it has come to our attention that the town of fairfield,ct has issued an order to comply order dated because you have had more than vehicles stored or parked on the lot.moreover,you ignored the order and continued to violate the town regulation which necessitated the town attorney to send you a letter on demanding immediate compliance or face civil penalties of up to,in addition to revocation of the special exception permit 
your continued failure to respect the order to comply for over months evinces blatant defiance of the local laws.as you are no doubt aware,your lease and agreement require you to abide by all applicable laws in the operation of your business.termination of the franchise and franchise relationship is permitted under the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa for your knowing failure to comply with federal,state or local laws or regulations relevant to the operation of the marketing premises.see article c of part ii of your agreement.
additionally,upon a recent inspection of your facility,the following image violations were identified 
weeds along the building and at the id sign 
unkempt,unswept and obstructed bays 
unregistered vehicles 
demand is hereby made that you immediately satisfy both the image violations and the town of fairfield demands to prevent closing of the station by the town and termination of your franchise at the subject location.your failure to comply with this demand will put your franchise relationship in jeopardy of termination.
letter from motiva to ceraso dated september,september letter,at.there is no dispute that ceraso received this letter.ascher subsequently visited the premises in september and november on each occasion,he observed that the number of cars had not changed.
on october,marsala applied to the town zoning board of appeals zba for revocation of ceraso special exception permit the revocation application.that application stated,inter alia,that in december,marsala had 
issued ceraso an order to comply with.specifically,ceraso was to reduce the number of unscreened vehicles on the property to five or fewer.he has failed to comply with my order 
attachment to revocation application at.on november,the zba held a public hearing on that application,attended by,inter alios,ascher,marsala,ceraso,and ceraso attorney.at the conclusion of the hearing,the zba,without making any specific findings,voted to revoke ceraso special exception permit.
ceraso appealed the decision to state court,see ceraso zoning board of appeals,docket.that appeal had not been resolved by the time the present action was tried in the district court.ceraso later asked the district court to take judicial notice that the matter had been settled and that his permit was not revoked.
motiva attempt to terminate the franchise 
by letter dated november,motiva sent ceraso a notice of termination of lease the termination letter.the letter stated,in pertinent part,that 
the lease and agreement and your franchise relationship with motiva will be terminated effective february,under the provisions of the petroleum marketing practices act,et the act.this action is being taken for the following separate and distinct reasons 
your knowing failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relevant to the operation of the marketing premises,namely your receipt of an order to comply dated issued by the town of fairfield,ct town because you had more than vehicles stored or parked on the lot following an order to show cause hearing before the town board of zoning appeals on november,at which you appeared with counsel,your special exception permit was revoked.
your failure to abide by the conditions of the town special exception permit by having too many vehicles parked on the marketing premises which is also in violation of section b of your lease and section of your sales agreement.the affected provisions of your agreements with motiva are both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship.
your failure to exert good faith efforts to carry out the provisions of the franchise,namely your continued practice of parking too many vehicles on the marketing premises after the town demands and following motiva september,letter to you also demanding that you comply therewith and correct other identified image violations at the station.
termination letter at.notwithstanding the third numbered paragraph reference to a letter from motiva to ceraso dated september,the parties agree that there was no such letter of that date.
d.the present action and the judgment of the district court 
ceraso commenced the present action in february,alleging that the notice of termination was not based on valid grounds under the pmpa and seeking,inter alia,preliminary and permanent injunctive relief barring motiva,without court approval,from terminating or failing to renew the franchise and from interfering with his occupation of the premises.motiva counterclaimed,seeking a declaratory judgment that the termination letter effected a lawful termination of ceraso franchise under the pmpa.ceraso moved for and was granted a preliminary injunction,and the matter was set for an expedited trial of the merits.
in preparation for trial,pursuant to.civ.d,the parties submitted a joint trial memorandum in which each side set forth its requests for specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.they also stipulated to the admissibility of certain documents and affidavits.
at the bench trial,ceraso did not testify.as discussed in part.below,motiva called marsala,ascher,and former ceraso employee michael seagren to testify,and introduced,inter alia,the affidavit of joseph gall,an elected town representative.the affidavit stated,inter alia,that gall had observed ceraso station several times a day in,and and that usually there were at least cars sitting on the lot.several times a week i saw the lot so packed with stored cars that you could not even pull in to get gas.affidavit of joseph gall,dated november.gall stated that he had received complaints from members of the public that the texaco station at jennings road was turning into a junkyard.id.marsala and ascher testified that a number of cars were on the premises at various times but neither of them could say with certainty which vehicles,if any,were awaiting repair or had been repaired.seagren,who testified that he had left ceraso employ after a falling out just before christmas of,said that during the last month of his employment with ceraso there were some cars a day on the premises for repairs.
following trial,the district court found in favor of ceraso and against motiva.as to the scope of the issues to be resolved,the court stated that 
t he only substantive ground for termination,as permitted by c,set forth in defendants compliance with the trial preparation order,and thus relied on in the termination of the lease and sale agreement,is a violation of laws or regulations.
memorandum of decision and order re pending motions,dated january,posttrial decision,at.the court also stated,in a footnote to its findings of fact,that 
t he termination letter is not regarded as validly invoking any basis for termination other than the alleged zoning violation.it invoked a letter dated september,which does not exist.it was claimed that the date was a typographical error.defendants can not invoke,to state grounds for termination,the intended letter of september,as the notice required by pmpa is limited to that which is clearly stated,see c,which would not include an unidentified letter.
posttrial decision at.
with respect to defendants contention that motiva was entitled to terminate ceraso franchise for violation of the town zoning regulations,the court found that defendants have not proven that plaintiff was in violation of at a specific time nor over any identified period of time and thus have not proven a basis for the claimed termination within the grounds permitted by pmpa.id.at.the court rejected motiva contention that ceraso violation of local law was established by the zba decision to revoke his special permit.the court noted the strict wording of the regulation,which prohibits storing or parking of more than five cars awaiting repair or repaired,id.at emphasis in original,and it found that the town application for revocation of ceraso special permit did not allege a violation of the regulation because its allegations focused on the total number of cars that were unscreened,not just on the number of unscreened cars that were repaired or awaiting repair 
the order to comply,to which the application refers,required plaintiff to reduce the number of unscreened vehicles to five or fewer.the regulation imposes no such obligation on plaintiff.defendants agree that the regulation does not cover all vehicles.see trial.the zba action can not be said to prove a violation of the strict wording of the regulation.
posttrial decision at.
the court also found that motiva trial evidence had not proven that in fact ceraso violated the regulation.at the start of trial,motiva had conceded in colloquy with the court that in order to warrant franchise termination there would have to be something more than just a very minor,isolated occasion of a literal violation of the regulation.trial transcript november,vol.i,at.after trial,the court found that motiva had not shown more than sporadic violations 
d efendants are left to prove violation of the regulation by showing that plaintiff kept or stored,for more than a nominal duration,five or more unscreened cars that had been repaired or were awaiting repairs.it can not be found that defendants have met that burden.the evidence offered as to the cars observed on the premises does not prove plaintiff violation as above defined.it was conceded that more than five unscreened cars were on the premises at various times.there was,however,no evidence as to how long any of the cars were observed to remain on the premises.clearly cars came and went.furthermore,there was no evidence as to the status or character of the cars from which it could be found that any cars so observed came within the prohibition of cars repaired or awaiting repair.there was evidence that the cars could be employees,could be unregistered vehicles awaiting disposal,could be tows awaiting claim by their owners,could be tows awaiting their owners or insurers determination of disposition and,if to be repaired,by whom,or could be cars of convenience store customers a limited likelihood,none of which count toward a violation of.
posttrial decision at.the court noted that there was some evidence as to how long certain towed cars had remained on the premises.however,the regulation applied to cars that were repaired or awaiting repair,and the documents offered by motiva to prove the duration of the presence of towed cars on the lot d id not delineate the time a car was actually being repaired,to which the regulation,by its terms,does not apply.id.at.although noting that 
there were a number of cars,probably more than five,on the premises in the months prior to the november,zba hearing,d efendants can not be said to have proven that for any substantial period of time in that period,nor at any precise time,that more than five cars which had been repaired or which were awaiting repairs were in the unscreened portion of the lot for any duration beyond a nominal time.
the court concluded that defendants burden of proof on their claimed entitlement to terminate the lease and sales agreement can not be found to have been met.id.at.judgment was entered enjoining defendants from terminating or failing to renew ceraso franchise and from affecting his occupation of the premises on the basis of the events in dispute in this case.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,motiva contends that the district court erred a in ruling that its termination letter was inadequate to terminate ceraso franchise for violation of the lease image provisions,and b in ruling that motiva failed to prove that termination was proper because ceraso violated the town zoning regulation.for the reasons that follow,we find no basis for reversal.
a.the purported termination on the ground of image violations 
in support of its contention that the district court erred in ruling that its termination letter was inadequate to terminate the franchise on the ground of image violations,motiva argues that that letter was adequate under the pmpa to give ceraso notice of why the franchise was being terminated and of his rights under that statute.we find motiva contentions unpersuasive,and we note as well a fundamental procedural reason given by the district court for refusing to rule the termination valid on the basis of image violations.
motiva failure to preserve the ground 
in its posttrial decision,prior to beginning the discussion section,the district court stated that t he only substantive ground for termination set forth in defendants compliance with the trial preparation order,and thus relied on in the termination of the lease and sale agreement,is a violation of laws or regulations.posttrial decision at emphasis added.this statement indicates that the court did not regard motiva as urging it to uphold the attempted termination of ceraso franchise on the ground of image violations.given the contents of the parties joint trial memorandum jtm,discussed below,we see no error in the view of the district court that it was not being asked to rule that termination was proper on the basis of image violations.
the jtm set forth in detail the parties respective proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.in that document,the parties stipulated to the contents of the september letter and of motiva termination letter.however,motiva only proposed finding relating to image stated that 
t he sales agreement between ceraso and motiva,in section b and exhibit a thereto,section,sets forth minimum standards for maintaining the premises in an unobstructed and uncluttered state and permits termination for a breach of those standards in section m.these provisions gave motiva grounds to terminate ceraso for cluttering the premises with numerous stored cars.
jtm at,emphasis added.while stating that the lease gave motiva grounds to terminate for image violations,this proposed finding stopped short of requesting a finding that motiva had in fact terminated ceraso franchise on that basis.ceraso response to this proposed finding was not only that he disagree d with motiva characterization of the lease terms,but also that in light of termination letter,the only relevant issue is ceraso compliance with the regulation.id.the jtm contained no other proposed finding suggesting that motiva in fact terminated the franchise on the basis of image violations.
motiva claims of law section provided no indication that motiva sought to have its attempted termination upheld on the basis of image violations.there were paragraphs in that section dealing with termination for failure to comply with applicable laws.for example,motiva asked the court to rule that the pmpa allows a franchisor to terminate for the knowing failure of the franchisee to comply with the federal,state,or local laws or regulations relevant to the operation of the marketing premises jtm at,internal quotation marks omitted,and that 
t he pmpa expressly provides that the franchisor is authorized to terminate a that such termination is conclusively presumed to be reasonable as a matter of the franchisee is provided notice in accordance with and the basis for the termination is the knowing failure of the franchisee to comply with the federal,state,or local laws or regulations relevant to the operation of the marketing premises 
jtm at.there was no similar proposition of law with regard to termination for image violations.
in addition,in responding to a number of ceraso jtm assertions,to which a motiva claim of termination on the ground of image violations would have been relevant if motiva relied on that ground,motiva responses made no mention of image violations.for example,in response to ceraso assertion that he was making efforts to settle the town charges of zoning violations,motiva stated that those attempts were irrelevant because a franchisee has no right to cure such a violation after it has received notice of termination.jtm at.motiva advanced no argument that ceraso attempts to cure zoning violations were irrelevant because his franchise had also been terminated for other reasons,to wit,violation of the image provisions.
similarly,motiva did not dispute ceraso assertion that t he principal factual issue in dispute wa s whether ceraso violated section jtm at,part.if motiva had sought to have the court uphold its termination on the basis of image violations,the claim of image violations plainly would have presented equally important factual issues.
in response to ceraso proposed conclusion of law that t he only allowable ground for termination which could be relevant on these facts is found at b c sic,a section that deals with violations of law,motiva disagree d,stating that further grounds are found for breach of the sales and lease agreements at b a.jtm at.however,as described in part above,those agreements required ceraso to,inter alia,comply with laws and regulations.motiva did not cite any specific section or sections of the agreements to which it referred,and there was no indication in this response that motiva referred to the agreements image violation provisions.if motiva sought a ruling that it had properly terminated ceraso franchise on the basis of image violations,it was incumbent on motiva to respond to such ceraso assertions with specific,informative references to the alleged image violations.there were no such references.
finally,as noted in part above,motiva termination letter,in referring to a prior demand that ceraso rectify identified image violations,cited only a nonexistent letter of september,and did not cite the letter dated september,which had listed image violations.as discussed in part.below,the pmpa requires that a franchisee be given clear notice of the ground asserted for termination of his franchise.in order to have the court rule that its termination letter properly terminated ceraso franchise on the basis of image violations,motiva would have needed a ruling that the termination letter reference to the nonexistent september,letter was a sufficiently clear reference to the letter dated september.in response to ceraso proposed findings that the termination letter referred to a september,letter that ceraso never received and that never existed,motiva stated only that the reference to september was a typographical error that was first discovered on october,making it unlikely that it caused ceraso any real confusion or that he relied on the typo in any way to his detriment jtm at.motiva did not include in its own proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law a request that the court find the reference to september to be a sufficiently clear reference to september to give valid notice to a pmpa franchisee.indeed,even motiva objection,quoted above,referred to the typographical error discovery in the passive voice and did not actually assert that ceraso had made or been informed of the discovery or that he so understood the termination letter.
in sum,one paragraph of motiva proposed findings of fact indicates that motiva could have terminated the franchise on account of image violations but nothing in the jtm either requested a finding that it did terminate on that ground,or requested a conclusion that such a termination was permissible under the pmpa,or responded to any of ceraso challenges to the basis for termination by invoking,as an alternative basis for termination,the alleged image violations.we can not conclude that the district court erred in finding that,in light of the contents of the jtm,the only ground for termination it was asked to adjudicate was ceraso alleged violation of laws or regulations.
the termination letter flawed reference to image 
further,to the extent that the district court may have intended to rule that there was an alternative basis for refusing to find that motiva had terminated ceraso franchise for image violations,see posttrial decision at t he termination letter is not regarded as validly invoking any basis for termination other than the alleged zoning violation emphasis added,we are unpersuaded that that ruling was erroneous.
under the pmpa,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,proper grounds for a franchisor termination of a franchise include a failure by the franchisee to comply with any provision of the franchise,which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship,b a,and a knowing failure of the franchisee to comply with federal,state,or local laws or regulations relevant to the operation of the marketing premises,id.c see id.b c i.see generally russo texaco,cir termination for any of the reasons enumerated in c is conclusively presumed to be reasonable as a matter of law.
in order to effect a valid termination,the franchisor must give the franchisee written notice of termination by personal delivery or certified mail,see c and,which must include a statement of intention to terminate the franchise or not to renew the franchise relationship,together with the reasons therefor,id.c a emphasis added.t here must be strict compliance with the notice provisions of the pmpa.escobar mobil oil,cir see,thompson refining,cir mobil oil clark,cir.the franchisor has the burden of showing that termination was justified and properly executed.see c.
in the present case,the court stated that the pmpa requirement that a notice state the reasons for termination were not satisfied by the motiva termination letter reference to a nonexistent letter in order to provide notice of a criticism that had been communicated to ceraso only in a letter to which the termination letter made no reference.we can not conclude that this assessment was erroneous in this case.ceraso did not testify at trial,and we have been pointed to no evidentiary basis for a finding that he knew that september meant september.
further,even had the termination letter cited the september letter,rather than the nonexistent september letter,the paragraph numbered only paragraph of the termination letter that mentioned ambiguous.that paragraph set out as a reason for termination 
y our failure to exert good faith efforts to carry out the provisions of the franchise,namely your continued practice of parking too many vehicles on the marketing premises after the town demands and following motiva september,letter to you also demanding that you comply therewith and correct other identified image violations at the station.
termination letter at,emphases added.the town demands,of course,related only to alleged zoning violations,and,as phrased,this paragraph could be interpreted as mentioning prior correspondence complaining of image violations only as pinpointing the time following which ceraso made no effort to reduce the number of vehicles on the marketing premises,rather than asserting image violations as a ground in itself for the termination.certainly we can not conclude as a matter of law that the third numbered paragraph as written was sufficient to inform ceraso that one reason for the termination notice was weeds,or unkempt,unswept,and obstructed bays,or unregistered vehicles.
in sum,the district court did not err in holding that,even if termination were an issue in the case notwithstanding motiva failure to articulate that issue in the jtm,motiva termination letter was inadequate to give ceraso notice of termination on that ground.
termination based on alleged zoning violations 
motiva contends that the district court erred in concluding that it did not meet its burden of showing that termination of ceraso franchise was proper on the basis of zoning violations.it argues,inter alia,that the court should have given substantial weight to the zba decision that ceraso violated the town regulation and that the court should have viewed motiva evidence more favorably.we find no basis for reversal in any of motiva contentions.
the action of the zba 
motiva contention that the district court should have deferred to the decision of the zba that ceraso violated the town regulation is meritless.the regulation states that no more than five motor vehicles awaiting repair work or having been repaired are to be stored or parked on the lot,without being screened.town zoning regulations emphasis added.the revocation application filed by marsala in october for revocation of ceraso special exception permit,although quoting the regulation,alleged as facts the following 
in december of,i issued ceraso an order to comply with.specifically,ceraso was to reduce the number of unscreened vehicles on the property to five or fewer.he has failed to comply with my order 
because ceraso has been in violation of of the regulations,the commission has the authority to revoke his special exception 
for the above reasons,in my capacity as zoning enforcement officer of the town of fairfield,i respectfully request that ceraso special exception certificate for approval to use the location at the above property be revoked by this board.
attachment to revocation application at.the application contained no allegations as to how many cars were on the premises awaiting repair or having been repaired.thus,the application did not allege a violation of the regulation as written.
the zba voted to grant marsala application without making any findings.given that the zba made no findings and gave no express instructions,its decision apparently contemplated that in order to avoid loss of his permit,ceraso must reduce to no more than five the total number of unscreened vehicles on the of whether they had been or were to be repaired.accordingly,the zba imposed on ceraso an obligation different from that on the face of the regulation.
generally,it is the function of a zoning board or commission to decide within prescribed limits and consistent with the exercise of its legal discretion,whether a particular section of the zoning regulations applies to a given situation and the manner in which it does apply.double i limited partnership plan zoni
