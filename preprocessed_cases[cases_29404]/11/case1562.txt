background 
bettcher patent 
bettcher asserted patent,entitled low friction rotary knife,is directed to a power operated knife used principally in the meat packing and other commercial food processing industries and containing a handle on which is supported an annular rotating blade assembly.the handle includes a motor and a gear train,and the rotating blade assembly contains an annular blade support housing attached to the handle and an annular blade rotatably carried by the housing.patent ll.
figures and of the patent generally depict the power operated rotary knife modified for clarity 
in use,an operator holds the handle and swipes the far end of the annular blade across a piece of meat,for example,to shave off an unwanted layer that moves up through the open center of the annulus and falls off.
the claims of the patent are directed to the knife blade itself.the claimed blade includes an annular bearing race recessed into a side wall of the blade and dimensioned to receive a protruding annular bearing structure of the blade support housing to maintain the blade in spinning contact with the knife.figure is a cross sectional depiction of the rotary knife blade mounted within the housing and shows the interaction between the recessed bearing race and the protruding bearing structure 
the patent explains 
the bearing race receives the bearing structure so that the blade body is secured to the blade support structure by the bearing race and bearing structure engagement along bearing locations that are spaced axially apart and firmly support the blade against axial and radial shifting during use.the bearing race extends into the wall and is spaced axially from the blade section in that the surface extends between the bearing structure and the blade section.
the bearing race comprises a sic first and second bearing surfaces,that converge proceeding toward each other.in the illustrated knife the race extends radially inwardly into the wall in the illustrated blade,the surfaces,are frustoconical.as shown,they are joined at their radially inner ends by a short axially extending annular surface that serves to minimize the race depth and does not engage the bearing structure.
claim of the patent reads 
a rotary knife blade comprising 
a rotatable annular body defining first and second axial ends,said body disposed about a central axis and,
an annular blade section rotatable with the annular body and projecting axially from the first axial end of said body 
said body comprised of a wall defining a radially outer surface disposed between said first and second axial ends,and an annular bearing race in said surface and extending radially into said wall,said bearing race spaced axially from said blade section and comprising a first surface that converges proceeding away from said second axial end,and a second surface that converges proceeding toward said first surface,said first and second surfaces defining first and second bearing faces spaced axially apart,wherein both of said bearing faces are frustoconical.

proceedings at the district court 
bunzl invalidity allegationsi.pre bettcher blades 
bunzl asserted at trial that the patent was invalid as anticipated by prior art bettcher blades that,while they contained a different bearing race configuration,included chamfered corners argued as inherently capable of being used as a bearing race.bettcher countered that the pre blades did not anticipate the claims of the patent because they lacked the frustoconical bearing faces or surfaces required by each claim of the patent.the following image provides a cross sectional view of the pre bettcher blade 
cross appellant br.as the image reveals,the blade includes two chamfers at the intersections of the bearing race walls and the outer surface of the blade body.according to bunzl,these chamfers inherently satisfy the frustoconical bearing face limitations because of their shape and their capability of being in rolling or sliding contact with a support member.appellant br.
bunzl position was prefaced by statements made during claim construction.in its claim construction brief,bunzl asserted that bearing surface should be construed to mean slideable support surface.cross appellant br.bunzl also asserted that bearing race should be construed to mean channel configured to slideably support a rotary knife blade.emphasis added.as to both bearing surface and bearing race,bunzl did not provide argument in its brief except to say that t his term is not commonly used by lay persons and jurors and that failing to construe each term at all would be improper.bettcher contended that these terms did not require separate construction.
at the markman hearing in june,the district court stated that the bearing face,bearing surface,and bearing race issues were inadequately presented in the briefs.later,in its claim construction order in september,the district court stated that d uring the markman hearing,the dispute between the parties was narrowed to one disputed definition namely,frustoconical and b oth sides agree that only disputed claim terms need to be construed by the court.markman order at,bettcher,bunzl usa,et,cv,ecf.in march,the court issued an amended case schedule which extended through trial,and made no mention of any claim construction proceedings.this new schedule was based on a request jointly submitted by the parties.
in june,a year after the markman hearing,bunzl requested a jury instruction that bearing surface and bearing face should be understood to mean surface capable of being in rolling or sliding contact with a support member.bunzl also requested a jury instruction that annular bearing race,annular bearing race opening,and groove all mean groove.id.bunzl requested constructions included no argument.rather than adopt bunzl proposals,the court told the jury to give the rest of the words in the claims their ordinary meaning in the context of the patent specification and prosecution history.trial tr.the court commented that t he only claim construction provided to the court at the markman hearing was frustoconical.there was no request for additional definitions,and i believe that request for additional definitions on the eve of or during trial is too late.id.
the district court also presented the jury with the following instruction 
to anticipate a claim of the patent,the blade must contain every limitation of that particular claim.anticipation requires that there is no difference between claims of the patent and the pre bettcher blade,as viewed by a person of ordinary skill in the art.
trial tr.bunzl objected to the second sentence of the instruction because the only prior art at issue with respect to the anticipation argument are prior art blades that were on sale by bettcher more than a year before the effective filing date of the patent,and because the statement was not consistent with in re schreiber.id.
at trial,bunzl expert,king,testified that he had created a mockup rig with a rotating blade configured like the pre blades and using only the chamfers as bearing surfaces.bettcher countered with evidence that a person of skill in the art would not consider the chamfers to be bearing faces or part of a bearing race,and contested the chamfers ability to function as such based on the testimony of its expert.
bunzl moved for judgment as a matter of law of invalidity after the close of evidence,arguing that each limitation was admittedly met and that the claims were inherently anticipated.that motion was denied.after the verdict,bunzl renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and brought its alternative motion for a new trial on invalidity.bunzl argued that bettcher contention that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have recognized that the chamfered surfaces of the pre blades could be used as bearing surfaces is legally irrelevant and that satisfaction of the bearing face limitation required only that the chamfered surfaces are frustoconically shaped.the district court denied bunzl motion,commenting that bunzl waived any argument as to other terms not addressed in this court markman order and that evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury verdict of patent validity.order at,bettcher,cv,ecf order.
ii.section estoppel 
after bettcher filed suit,and while proceedings were pending before the district court,bunzl requested interpartes reexamination of the patent in the united states patent and trademark office patent office.in due course,the reexamination was granted and the examiner ultimately declined to adopt the grounds of rejection proposed by bunzl and issued a right of appeal notice.bunzl appealed to the board of patent appeals and interferences board.at the time of the filing of the appeal to this court,the reexamination was pending before the board,which has since affirmed the examiner conclusions affirming the validity of all claims subject to reexamination.bunzl processor distrib.llc patent of bettcher,appeal july.
when the examiner issued the right of appeal notice,bettcher requested that the district court exclude certain of bunzl invalidity references under c on the ground that the examiner had already determined that they did not invalidate the claims of the patent and therefore,according to bettcher,bunzl was estopped from asserting these references in district court.according to bettcher,the estoppel took effect as soon as the examiner finished the reexamination and the right of appeal notice was sent to the patentee.the district court agreed that the examiner had issued a final determination in the proceedings,and granted bettcher request to exclude the references.bunzl included the exclusion of these references as a separate basis for its new trial motion.the district court denied bunzl motion,noting that this issue is one of first impression.order at.
bettcher infringement allegations 
bettcher accused bunzl of infringement based on bunzl manufacture and sale of rotary knife blades marketed as replacement blades for use in rotary knives manufactured and sold by bettcher.bunzl blades lack the frustoconical bearing faces described in the patent and recited in the patent claims and,instead,contain a completely rounded bearing race.according to bettcher,once bunzl blades are installed and put into use,their round bearing faces wear until they become frustoconical.therefore,bettcher accused bunzl of indirect infringement based on this wear theory.the following image depicts the accused bunzl blade,installed in a support housing 
cross appellant br.
at trial,bunzl called as its witness mark stallion stallion,a patent lawyer,from whom bunzl allegedly received an unwritten opinion in counseling that bettcher was unlikely to win an infringement suit based on its wear theory.bunzl offered stallion testimony to prove bunzl state of mind for inducement and willfulness.bettcher moved to exclude stallion testimony,but the district court allowed stallion to testify as to his opinion.at trial,stallion testified that he had informed bunzl that it appeared bettcher was asserting a theory of indirect infringement and had conceded that the bunzl blades did not infringe at the time of sale.stallion testified that he informed bunzl that bettcher theory of indirect infringement required either an absence of substantial use contributory infringement or intent to cause the infringing acts inducement and that,in his estimation,bunzl lacked both.stallion also testified that he informed bunzl that as a matter of fact it was unlikely that the bunzl bearing races actually wore to the claimed frustoconical shape when installed and used.counsel for bettcher did not object to the above quoted statements during stallion direct examination except to request a,after which the judge emphasized to the jury that y our role in this case is to determine whether stallion gave competent advice and whether bunzl could rely on it o nly the law as given to you by me should be considered by you in deciding the issues in this case.trial tr.
at closing argument,counsel for bunzl stated with regard to stallion testimony that we called stallion,who you heard is a patent lawyer.patent lawyers talk about what patent lawyers talk about the only patent lawyer that testified in this case is stallion,and that what he told you stallion put it in legal for you he said there no way these immediately can wear.id.counsel for bettcher did not object to counsel for bunzl closing remarks regarding stallion testimony.
after the close of evidence,the district court instructed the jury when considering whether bunzl knew or should have known that the induced actions would constitute infringement you may consider whether or not bunzl obtained the advice of a competent lawyer but t he applicable law is the law that i have given you,which may or may not be the law relied on by bunzl attorney.id.
the jury returned a verdict of.bettcher moved for a new trial,arguing prejudice based on stallion testimony and bunzl closing argument.in denying the motion,the court stated that t he testimony was limited and appropriate,and presented with a cautionary instruction and that bunzl closing argument,while perhaps stretching the reach of stallion testimony,does not warrant reversal,as the jury was further cautioned,several times,that comments by counsel were not evidence.order at.

anticipation based on bettcher prior art 
bunzl argues that the district court erred by refusing to enter judgment of invalidity as a matter of law,and,alternatively,by refusing to grant a new trial on the issue of anticipation by the pre bettcher blades.we disagree and address each argument in turn.
judgment as a matter of law 
bunzl argues that the chamfers are inherently capable of serving as bearing faces,that no evidence contradicts this basic capability,and that no other claim limitation is in dispute as to the pre bettcher blades.according to bunzl,it is irrelevant whether anyone ever actually used the chamfers as bearing faces of a bearing race,just as it is irrelevant whether a person of skill in the art ever would have appreciated this alleged capability.according to bunzl,the only thing the claim requires of the bearing face is that it be capable of bearing,without any restrictions on quality or duration,any actual useful functionality,or any structural properties that would have been recognizable to a person of ordinary skill in the art.bunzl asserts that its expert mockup left no factual issue for the jury to decide and,by definition,no evidence sufficient to support the jury verdict.
bettcher counters that the engineering drawings,which were the sole evidence of the actual pre bettcher blades,made it clear that the feature bunzl relies upon is a set of chamfers whose purpose was to provide clearance and avoid contact with a mating part the precise opposite of bunzl theory that the chamfers were inherently bearing surfaces.cross appellant br.according to bettcher,all witnesses agreed that the actual engineering specification established that the disputed features were chamfers.moreover,the witnesses disagreed about whether the chamfers would be able to serve as bearing faces.bettcher argues that inherent anticipation requires that the chamfers always necessarily function as bearing faces.
in each asserted claim of the patent,the bearing faces must be part of the bearing race or groove.whether or not the chamfers of the pre blades could be capable of serving as bearing faces in some hypothetical circumstances,the jury had more than sufficient evidence to support a finding that the chamfers found in the pre bettcher blade were not part of the bearing race within the meaning of that term in the patent.
while bunzl struggles to characterize this as a case of inherency,it is nothing of the sort.inherency can be established when prior art necessarily functions in accordance with,or includes,the claimed limitations.in re cruciferous sprout.inherency,however,may not be established by probabilities or possibilities.the mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient.in re oelrich,ccpa.here,bunzl attempts to characterize one structure chamfers as a completely different structure a bearing race based on a hypothetical configuration of surrounding structures disclosed nowhere in the prior art expressly or inherently and suggested by nothing in the record.a bearing face,and the bearing race of which it must be a part,may have both structural and functional limitations,but the functional limitation requires more than the ability to bear for a short period of time at an unusually slow speed.bunzl failed to demonstrate that the blades were capable of anything more,and the jury was therefore fully entitled to reject bunzl argument in light of the evidence at trial.bunzl reliance on schreiber to the contrary is misplaced.
ultimately,the prior art at issue in this case shows what it shows,and the jury was free to draw whatever conclusions manifested themselves from the evidence presented.the evidence showed that the chamfers were designed to remove the sharp corners and not to interact with each other to collectively perform any function,let alone the function of a bearing race.and the undisputed fact is that no one ever used the chamfers to bear anything prior to the critical date of the patent.the speculative notion that by happenstance the chamfers might,under hypothetical circumstances,be capable of operating as a bearing race is an insufficient basis to mandate overturning the jury verdict.for these reasons,bunzl was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
new trial on anticipation by the bettcher blades 
bunzl argues in the alternative that it is entitled to a new trial on the issue of invalidity because of the district court refusal to adopt its proposed construction of bearing face and bearing surface and because the district court instructed the jury that anticipation requires that there be no difference between the prior art and the claimed invention as viewed by one of ordinary skill in the art.again,we disagree,and address each argument in turn.
claim construction 
according to bunzl,it asked the district court to construe bearing face and bearing surface to mean surface capable of being in rolling or sliding contact with a support member.bunzl argues that if the jury had been so instructed,it might have understood that a surface constitutes a bearing surface if it has certain capabilities,regardless of whether the surface had ever been used or intended to be used to perform such capabilities.appellant br.emphasis added.bunzl argues that not construing these terms violated micro international beyond innovation technology.according to bunzl,i f the term had been properly construed then it would have been undisputed that the chamfered surfaces constitute bearing surfaces and bettcher pre blades are anticipatory prior art.appellant br.bettcher counters that bunzl abandoned this issue and that substantial evidence supported the verdict with or without the proposed constructions.
bunzl argument lacks merit.as described above,bunzl had ample opportunity to seek construction of the bearing face limitation.here,the parties agreed to a schedule of disclosures.the district court issued a markman order premised on the express belief that there were no other claim construction disputes.bunzl said nothing.and then,a year after the markman hearing,after submitting a new joint schedule that contained nothing about claim construction,bunzl asked for a new construction.under the circumstances of this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that bunzl could not add new claim construction theories on the eve of trial.moreover,because the jury would have been free to determine that the chamfers were simply not the parts of the bearing race that had the capability,as discussed above,bunzl proposed construction would have changed nothing.the court did not err in declining to construe these terms.
ii.jury instructions 
as stated above,the district court instructed the jury that 
to anticipate a claim of the patent,the blade must contain every limitation of that particular claim.anticipation requires that there is no difference between claims of the patent and the pre bettcher blade,as viewed by a person of ordinary skill in the art.
trial tr.in that instruction,bunzl objects to the phrases as viewed by a person of ordinary skill in the art and no difference.this court addresses each in turn.
as viewed by a person of ordinary skill in the art 
bunzl argues that the district court instruction to the jury that prior art must be understood as viewed by one of ordinary skill in the art is contrary to this court inherency precedent and potentially misled the jury by excluding the possibility of an unappreciated inherent feature.bunzl relies on in re cruciferous sprout litigation,at inherency is not necessarily coterminous with knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art who may not recognize the inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior art.quotation omitted,in re schreiber,and other cases,to support its view.according to bunzl,the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art is irrelevant to inherency.bunzl states that the jury instruction meant that the jury could not have found anticipation of the claims unless it was also persuaded that before the critical date a person of ordinary skill in the art had understood that the pre blades could have so functioned.appellant br.emphasis added.
bettcher counters by citing scripps clinic research foundation genentech,overruled in part on other grounds by abbott labs.sandoz,anticipation requires there to be no difference between the claimed invention and the reference disclosure as viewed by a person of ordinary skill in the art.emphasis added,and other cases,to support the jury instruction.bettcher also argues that bunzl own jury instruction included the same language,and that bunzl thus effectively admitted that the instruction was correct.
as this court has previously explained 
a jury verdict will be set aside,based on erroneous jury instructions,if the party seeking to set aside the verdict can establish that those instructions were legally erroneous,and that the errors had prejudicial effect.more specifically,a party seeking to alter a judgment based on erroneous jury instructions must establish that it made a proper and timely objection to the jury instructions,those instructions were legally erroneous,the errors had prejudicial effect,and it requested alternative instructions that would have remedied the error.prejudicial legal error exists when it appears to the court that the error is inconsistent with substantial justice.however,when the error in a jury instruction could not have changed the result,the erroneous instruction is harmless a reversal is not available to an appellant who merely establishes error in instructions where the procedural error was harmless,where the evidence in support of the verdict was so overwhelming that the same verdict would necessarily be reached absent the error,or the error was cured by an instruction,a new trial would be mere waste and affirmance of the judgment is required.
ntp,at quotations omitted.
bunzl has failed to establish that the jury instruction was wrong or that it suffered any prejudice.as noted above in connection with bunzl bid for judgment as a matter of law,the evidence in this case was such that a reasonable jury could have found that the chamfers in the bettcher blades were not bearing faces of a bearing race as viewed from any perspective,be that a lay person,an expert,or an ordinarily skilled artisan.bunzl only argument that the jury instruction was even remotely problematic,to say nothing of erroneous,rests entirely on the premise that this is a case of inherent anticipation.for the reasons already explained above,it is not.
bunzl has not shown that the language from scripps caused any confusion when applied by the jury to the facts of this case.therefore,bunzl has not satisfied the four part test elaborated in ntp,at,to disturb a judgment based on an erroneous jury instruction.moreover,bunzl has not mustered any evidence sufficient to overcome the substantial deference due a trial court in ruling on motions for new trial.i f the verdict is supported by some competent,credible evidence,a trial court will be deemed not to have abused its discretion in denying the motion.first credit union,at quotation omitted.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying bunzl motion on this ground.
no difference 
bunzl also argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that anticipation required that there be no difference between the prior art and the claimed invention.bunzl argues that the jury instruction may have mislead sic the jury into believing that the presence of additional features in the pre bettcher blade would preclude a finding of anticipation.appellant reply br.
bunzl concern with the no difference language is apparently based on the fear that the jury might have mistakenly thought that some extraneous feature of the prior art negated anticipation.no such extraneous feature appears to have been at issue in this case.so no showing of prejudice is possible.bunzl remaining arguments regarding the court jury instructions have been considered and are not persuasive.
we hold that bunzl is not entitled to a new trial regarding invalidity based on the pre bettcher blades.
estoppel under 
bunzl contends that the district court wrongly interpreted.in holding that its estoppel provision applied at the conclusion of examination when the examiner issued the right of appeal notice.bunzl seeks a new trial on obviousness on this basis.as discussed below,this court agrees with bunzl that the estoppel provision of is triggered not when examination is completed but only after all appeal rights have been exhausted.
reexamination proceedings are codified at.section,entitled appeal,provides 
a patent owner.the patent owner involved in an inter partes reexamination proceeding under this chapter 
may appeal under the provisions of section,to the board and may appeal under the provisions of sections through,to the federal circuit,with respect to any decision adverse to the patentability of any original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent and 
may be a party to any appeal taken by a requester under subsection b.
b requester.a requester 
may appeal under the provisions of section,and may appeal under the provisions of sections through,with respect to any final decision favorable to the patentability of any original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent and 
may,subject to subsection c,be a party to any appeal taken by the patent owner under the provisions of section or sections through.
c a requester whose request for an inter partes reexamination results in an order under section is estopped from asserting at a later time,in any civil action arising in whole or in part under section of title,the invalidity of any claim finally determined to be valid and patentable on any ground which the requester raised or could have raised during the inter partes reexamination proceedings.this subsection does not prevent the assertion of invalidity based on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the requester and the patent and trademark office at the time of the inter partes reexamination proceedings.
when the estoppel of c attaches is a question of first impression.
the parties arguments on appeal 
bunzl argues on appeal that district court decisions support bunzl interpretation of the statute the concept of finality means that the controversy must be at an end defines finality as the exhaustion of all appeal rights distinguishes final decisions from final determinations definition of a determination on substantial new questions of patentability as final and means that final determinations under must also be unappealable bunzl view is consistent with congress purpose in creating reexamination applying the estoppel as of the right of appeal notice would render the statute internally inconsistent and the legislative history supports bunzl.
bettcher counters that related regulations prove that right of appeal notices are final determinations the fact estoppel provision of the act creating inter partes reexaminations and its legislative history support bettcher demonstrates that congress did not intend to condition estoppel on exhaustion of appeals minimizing harassment,a purpose in the legislative history,is only served if estoppel attaches when the reexamination becomes appealable estoppel would be superfluous if it attached after appeals to this court because this court decisions bind district courts bunzl reliance on district court cases and law dictionaries is unavailing and bettcher interpretation does not render the statute internally inconsistent.
the parties arguments on appeal essentially require this court to decide the meaning of finally determined in c in view of the language of the statute,the legislative framework,the related regulations,and the legislative history.
our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.pennzoil quaker state united states,quoting robinson shell oil,d.s tatutory language can not be construed in a vacuum.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.davis.dep of treasury.section does not expressly define finally determined,but its content and context do.
the estoppel provision appears at the end of,which provides appeal rights both from examiner and board decisions.specifically,a provides that patent owners may appeal under the provisions of section to the board and may appeal under the provisions of sections through to the federal circuit,as well as participate in any appeal brought by a requester.and b likewise provides that requesters may appeal both to the board and to the federal circuit,and may participate in appeals brought by patent owners.the estoppel provision of subsection c thus falls immediately following the establishment of both parties rights of appeal,including appeal to this court.
the placement of the estoppel provision within the inter partes reexamination statute strongly suggests that the phrase finally determined refers to the stage of the proceedings when the events contemplated by subsections a and b have run their course.and because subsections a and b both state that the parties may appeal decisions both to the board and to this court,this implies that estoppel requires exhaustion of all appeal rights,including appeals to this court.
bunzl argues that because subsections a and b refer to final decisions,whereas subsection c refers to final determinations,therefore the appealable decisions of subsections a and b do not,in and of themselves,amount to final determinations.we agree.while the difference in terminology is not necessarily compelling,it is nonetheless supportive of this court interpretation of.
section,entitled certificate of patentability,unpatentability,and claim cancellation,provides in relevant part 
a in an inter partes reexamination proceeding under this chapter,when the time for appeal has expired or any appeal proceeding has terminated,the director shall issue and publish a certificate canceling any claim of the patent finally determined to be unpatentable,confirming any claim of the patent determined to be patentable,and incorporating in the patent any proposed amended or new claim determined to be patentable.
according to bunzl,defines finality as the exhaustion of all appeal rights.this court agrees with bunzl that defines a determination of patentability to occur only after all appeals have terminated.issuance of the reexamination certificate only happens when the time for appeal has expired or any appeal proceeding has terminated.this provision makes no distinction between appeals to the board and to this court.and reexamination certificates are not issued piecemeal,at intermediate stages of the reexamination proceeding.this is reflected in the manual of patent examining procedure emphases in original 
upon conclusion of the inter partes reexamination proceeding,the examiner must complete a notice of intent to issue inter partes reexamination certificate nirc 
the following are the only instances when issuance of nirc action would be proper in an inter partes reexamination proceeding 
a there is no timely response by the patent owner to an office action requiring a response 
b after a right of appeal notice ran where no party to the reexamination timely files a notice of appeal.
c after filing a notice of appeal,where all parties who filed a notice of appeal or notice of cross appeal fail to timely file an appellant brief or fail to timely complete the brief,where the appellant brief is noted by the examiner as being incomplete.
d after a final decision by the board of patent appeals and interferences board,where there is no further timely appeal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit nor is there a timely request for rehearing by the board.
e after the federal court appeal process has been completed and the case is returned to the examiner.
section,entitled i nter partes reexamination prohibited,limits subsequent reexaminations 
a order for reexamination.notwithstanding any provision of this chapter,once an order for inter partes reexamination of a patent has been issued under section,neither the requester nor its privies,may file a subsequent request for inter partes reexamination of the patent until an inter partes reexamination certificate is issued and published under section,unless authorized by the director.
b final decision.once a final decision has been entered against a party in a civil action arising in whole or in part under section of title,that the party has not sustained its burden of proving the invalidity of any patent claim in suit or if a final decision in an inter partes reexamination proceeding instituted by a requester is favorable to the patentability of any original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent,then neither that party nor its privies may thereafter request an inter partes reexamination of any such patent claim on the basis of issues which that party or its privies raised or could have raised in such civil action or inter partes reexamination proceeding,and any inter partes reexamination requested by that party or its privies on the basis of such issues may not thereafter be maintained by the office,notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.this subsection does not prevent the assertion of invalidity based on newly discovered prior art unavailable to the requester and the patent and trademark office at the time of the inter partes reexamination proceedings.
section includes two provisions.subsection a is a complete bar on new reexaminations until the reexamination certificate is issued in the pending reexamination.subsection b attaches only after there has been a final resolution,either in federal court or in the pending reexamination.once it does attach,subsection b prevents the requester from request ing an inter partes reexamination on the basis of issues which it raised or could have raised in federal court or the prior reexamination.because subsection b prevents further reexamination proceedings once parallel federal court proceedings have reached their resolution,it serves a similar purpose to the estoppel.
the parallel structure of subsections a and b suggests that,while subsection a applies during the pendency of reexamination proceedings,subsection b applies only when reexamination and all appeals have terminated.the relevant house and senate records confirm that b applies after any appeals.cong.rec.and the patent office has interpreted consistent with this legislative history in emphases in original 
while congress desired that the creation of an inter partes reexamination option would lead to a reduction in expensive patent litigation,it nonetheless also provided in the statute that a court validity challenge and inter partes reexamination of a patent may occur simultaneously but once one proceeding finally ends in a manner adverse to a third party,then the issues raised or that could have been raised with respect to the validity of a claim in that proceeding would have estoppel effect on the same issues in the other proceeding.
the b estoppel applies only in a situation where a final decision adverse to the requester has already been issued.if there remains any time for an appeal,or a request for reconsideration,from a court,district court or federal circuit decision,or such action has already been taken,then the decision is not final,and the estoppel does not attach.
while we believe that b is clear,even if it were ambiguous,the patent office interpretation that b does not apply i f there remains any time for an appeal would be entitled to deference.see cooper techs.dudas,holding that the patent office had the authority under to interpret section of the act creating interpartes reexamination because that interpretation both governs the conduct of proceedings in the patent office,not matters of substantive patent law,and is a prospective clarification of ambiguous statutory language.finally,we note that while this court agrees with bunzl interpretation of,we do not agree entirely with the reasoning presented by bunzl.specifically,we do not agree with bunzl arguments premised on internal inconsistency within or inconsistency between and.in our view,neither argument withstands critical scrutiny.
reexamination proceedings 
the framework of reexamination proceedings also suggests that estoppel attaches after all appeals are exhausted.during appeal,the board can assert new grounds of rejection provided that the applicant has the opportunity to respond.see b a new ground of rejection pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial review.emphasis added.and the addition of new grounds even extends to proceedings before this court.see in re comiskey,w e may where appropriate,affirm the agency on grounds other than those relied upon in rendering its decision,when upholding the agency decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the agency.quoting killip office of pers.because the addition of new grounds of rejection on appeal entitles applicants to continue prosecution before the examiner,the structure of the reexamination proceeding suggests that reexamination is not final prior to the exhaustion of all appeal rights.
related regulations 
bettcher argues that the regulations discussing the right of appeal notice establish that the phrase final determination in refers to the right of appeal notice.bettcher relies on,which states in relevant part 
the right of appeal notice shall be a final action,which comprises a final rejection setting forth each ground of rejection final decision favorable to patentability including each determination not to make a proposed rejection,an identification of the status of each claim,and the reasons for decisions favorable to patentability the grounds of rejection for each claim.
bettcher also relies on a,which states 
upon the issuance of a right of appeal notice the requester may appeal to the board with respect to any final decision favorable to the patentability,including any final determination not to make a proposed rejection,of any original,proposed amended,or new claim of the patent 
bettcher argument is essentially that because these regulations treat the right of appeal notice as a final action and a final decision,and because the right of appeal notice incorporates a final determination not to make a proposed rejection,therefore the phrase finally determined in must refer to a component of a right of appeal notice.the quoted regulations in no way address the application of any estoppel.they certainly do not purport to interpret or define the statutory language of.bettcher argument thus rings hollow and is not persuasive.
f.other arguments 
bunzl also argues that the ordinary meaning of finally determined implies that the entirety of the controversy is at an end.as the discussion above makes clear,however,the phrase finally determined is not in the context of this statute.
bettcher also argues that the purpose of minimizing harassment is not accomplished unless the estoppel attaches when the examiner issues a right of appeal notice.indeed,according to bettcher,the estoppel would be redundant if it only applied after all appeals because decisions of this court are binding on district courts in any event.bettcher argument does not overcome the weight of evidence against bettcher proposed interpretation.as discussed above,congress intended that reexaminations and civil patent litigation could occur in parallel,and it must be assumed that congress was aware of any potential for harassment when it passed this provision.and bettcher view that the estoppel would be redundant if it did not apply immediately is wrong.this court affirmance of an examiner decision on reexamination does not preclude district courts from considering challenges to validity premised on the same prior art,in the absence of an estoppel.the supreme court recently recognized as much,albeit in the context of examining the burden of proof applicable to a validity challenge.see microsoft,d n ew evidence supporting an invalidity defense may carry more weight in an infringement action than evidence previously considered by the pto.
finally,bettcher looks for support from the legislative history of the uncodified fact estoppel of the act establishing reexamination proceedings,published as a note to,div.a title iv,stat.the legislative history of this provision states that the estoppel arises after a final decision in the inter partes reexamination or a final decision in any appeal of such reexamination.cong.rec.according to bettcher,this statement distinguishes final decisions in reexaminations from final decisions on appeal,such that c should be read to apply as soon as there is a final decision in a reexamination a right of appeal notice.this court is at a loss to understand how this argument helps bettcher.section itself distinguishes final decisions from final determinations,as discussed above.but more importantly,the legislative history of the fact estoppel proves that it applies only after all appeal rights are exhausted.if anything,this suggests that the same is true of the estoppel of,which applies to the ultimate issues whose determination is based on those same facts that are the subject of the fact estoppel.bettcher argument is not persuasive.
the parties other arguments have been considered and are not persuasive.for the reasons discussed above,we hold that the estoppel provision of c applies only after all appeal rights are exhausted,including appeals to this court.
for these reasons,this court vacates the denial of bunzl motion for new trial on invalidity based on references excluded under the district court interpretation of c and remands so that the district court may determine in the first instance whether a new trial is warranted in the particular circumstances of this case.
infringement 
in its,bettcher seeks a new trial on the issue of infringement.bettcher argues that stallion testimony was prejudicial because his opinion amounted to nothing more than unfounded speculation,because he testified as an expert on the ultimate legal and factual issues of infringement contravening the safeguards against incompetent expert testimony and invading the province of the court to explain the law,and because counsel for bunzl wrongly characterized stallion as an authority on legal and factual issues of infringement during closing argument.bettcher also argues that this court needs to clarify the limits on the admissibility of opinion of counsel evidence in inducement cases and that the district court should not have instructed the jury to rely on such evidence.
bunzl counters that the jury was properly instructed regarding the law of indirect infringement that any error was harmless because bettche
