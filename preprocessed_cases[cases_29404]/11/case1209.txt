suntrust bank suntrust appeals the district court judgment in favor of golden west refining company golden west in an action brought by golden west to draw on a letter of credit issued to it by suntrust predecessor crestar bank crestar.suntrust argues that the district court erred by holding that the letter of credit was not perpetual under uniform commercial code ucc d and thereby had not automatically expired before golden west made a draw against it,by rejecting suntrust waiver argument,and by concluding that golden west specific performance and breach of contract claims were not precluded by the exclusive remedies available under article of the ucc.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
in,cenco,cenco acquired,among other assets,two leases from golden west that resulted in the execution of a may,letter agreement the letter agreement.cenco is a corporation wholly owned by a trust unitrust of which pat robertson is the trustee.the letter agreement obligated cenco to defend,indemnify,and hold golden west harmless against any claims arising from the liabilities imposed on golden west as tenant under the leases.to secure performance by cenco of these duties,the letter agreement required cenco to obtain a million irrevocable letter of credit.the letter agreement required golden west to terminate the letter of credit upon satisfaction of the conditions relating to the leases.
in may,unitrust requested that crestar,the predecessor of suntrust,issue a million letter of credit on cenco account.on may,crestar issued the irrevocable letter of credit.it stated,in pertinent part 
this letter of credit shall expire one year from the date hereof provided however,that it shall be deemed automatically renewed without amendment for additional one year periods from the present or any future expiration date hereof,unless at least days prior to any such date s,golden west refining company shall have sent crestar bank notice by certified mail,return receipt requested,or overnight courier service,that golden west refining company elects not to require this letter of credit renewed for any such additional period.
the letter of credit also contained an express provision for termination that required the consent of both golden west and cenco 
the amount of this letter of credit shall be reduced or terminated on receipt by crestar bank of a notarized written agreement signed by a vice president of golden west refining company and a vice president of cenco authorizing such reduction or termination.
unitrust signed a negative pledge agreement under which it agreed to maintain liquid assets in a specified amount,free of encumbrances,while the letter of credit was in effect.crestar believed,based on representations by pat robertson,that the letter of credit would only be outstanding for ninety days.
in spring,suntrust advised robertson that it would not renew the letter of credit unless robertson secured it.suzanne franklin,an employee of suntrust responsible for cultivating the bank relationship with robertson and unitrust,testified by deposition that she received a call from cenco counsel stating that unitrust was thinking about suing golden west.on april,cenco filed an action against golden west in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles,alleging that golden west had improperly failed to terminate the letter of credit.in may,suntrust told robertson that unitrust must either provide collateral to secure the letter of credit or transfer it to another bank.after being informed by robertson that there soon would be an order from the superior court requiring golden west to consent to cancellation,suntrust agreed to give unitrust an additional ninety days to deliver collateral to secure the letter of credit.during the state court action,cenco forwarded to suntrust copies of status reports drafted by cenco counsel,one of which recited that golden west claimed that it had not been properly served in the state court action.on june,the superior court entered golden west default for failure to answer cenco complaint.
on july,the superior court ordered that golden west by default consented to the termination of the letter of credit on its behalf by suntrust and held that the letter of credit was released.on july,robertson by facsimile sent suntrust a copy of the default judgment,with a letter requesting immediate termination of the credit.that same day,suntrust counsel telephoned cenco counsel to determine whether there was any waiting period before a default judgment became effective.suntrust counsel knew that suntrust was not a party to the action in the superior court,and did not believe that the superior court had jurisdiction over suntrust.suntrust counsel did not know and did not inquire whether golden west had notice of the default judgment before advising that suntrust cancel the letter of credit.at robertson request,suntrust then terminated the credit.on july,franklin advised robertson that suntrust had cancelled the letter of credit effective july.
on july,the superior court by order vacated the default judgment.on october,the superior court entered another order,providing 
the letter of credit shall be,and hereby is,reinstated as it exited sic on july,immediately prior to entry of the subsequently vacated default judgment herein and 
plaintiffs cenco a shall take all actions and do all things reasonably necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of paragraph above b shall fully cooperate,as reasonably requested by golden west,with golden west efforts to effectuate the provisions of paragraph above and c shall not interfere with any efforts by golden west to effectuate the provisions of paragraph above.
despite cenco request that suntrust reinstate the credit,suntrust did not reinstate the letter of credit because neither cenco nor unitrust offered suntrust adequate collateral.unitrust refused to reinstate the negative pledge,or to provide any other security,taking the position that the letter of credit had terminated properly on july.
during and,the lessor of the properties leased by golden west demanded that golden west comply with the terms of its lease,an obligation for which cenco had agreed to indemnify golden west under the letter agreement.on january,golden west demanded that cenco deliver to the lessor the requisite funds.after cenco failed to do so,on february,golden west made a draw on the letter of credit for.suntrust dishonored the letter of credit on february,on the grounds that it had been cancelled pursuant to the default judgment and that it was perpetual and therefore had expired under ucc d.suntrust dishonoring of the letter of credit,rejecting golden west draw,precipitated this dispute.
golden west brought this action in the federal district court,asserting diversity jurisdiction.it claimed in its amended complaint wrongful dishonor of the letter of credit and breach of contract,and requested specific performance and declaratory relief.on may,the district court gave summary judgment to golden west and denied suntrust motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded that,under ucc d,the letter of credit was not perpetual and therefore had not expired and was still in effect on the date of the draw.the district court also held that the superior court default judgment was ineffective because golden west had not consented to cancellation of the letter of credit as required in the letter agreement.the district court also held that golden west had not waived its right to compel cenco to follow the superior court orders reinstating the letter of credit because the default judgment had not given suntrust license to terminate the letter of credit.in a judgment entered july,the district court awarded golden west damages,including consequential damages,for its wrongful dishonor,breach of contract,and specific performance claims.suntrust appealed.
we review de novo a district court summary judgment.see,universal health servs.thompson,cir.on review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
we also review de novo a district court interpretation of state law.edmonds hammett,cir.when interpreting state law,we must follow the decisions of the state highest court,but when the state supreme court has not spoken on an issue,we are not precluded from affording relief and must determine what result the state supreme court would reach based on state appellate court opinions,statutes and treatises.see hewitt joyner,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
suntrust argues that the letter of credit it issued to golden west on may,was a perpetual letter under article of the ucc and therefore expired five years after it was issued and about two years before golden west made a draw on the letter of credit on february.the district court concluded that the letter of credit was not perpetual because so long as a letter of credit articulates an expiration date,albeit one that renews automatically and terminates only upon notice by the beneficiary,the letter of credit can not be said to be perpetual.we agree with the district court and hold that the plain language of ucc d requires that a letter of credit state that it is perpetual to qualify as a perpetual letter of credit.
section of the ucc prescribes rules regarding letters of credit 
a a letter of credit is issued and becomes enforceable according to its terms against the issuer when the issuer sends or otherwise transmits it to the person requested to advise or to the beneficiary.a letter of credit is revocable only if it so provides.
b after a letter of credit is issued,rights and obligations of a beneficiary,applicant,confirmer,and issuer are not affected by an amendment or cancellation to which that person has not consented except to the extent the letter of credit provides that it is revocable or that the issuer may amend or cancel the letter of credit without that consent.
c if there is no stated expiration date or other provision that determines its duration,a letter of credit expires one year after its stated date of issuance or,if none is stated,after the date on which it is issued.
d a letter of credit that states that it is perpetual expires five years after its stated date of issuance,or if none is stated,after the date on which it is issued.
ucc emphasis added.we must give effect to the language of a statute if it is plain and unambiguous.see texaco united states,cir the interpretive inquiry ceases if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.quoting barnhart sigmon coal,d catholic mut.relief soc y superior court,cal th,d,if the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature.internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted marsh city of richmond,i f statutory language is not ambiguous but has a usual and plain meaning,rules of construction do not apply and resort to legislative history is both unnecessary and improper.instead,we determine legislative intent from the plain meaning of the words used.the plain meaning of to state is to express in words.see collegiate dictionary ed.applying this definition to ucc d,a letter of credit is only perpetual if it expresses in words that it is perpetual.this,as golden west concedes,means that a letter of credit can be perpetual without using the exact word perpetual,and instead using synonyms that clearly declare that the letter of credit will remain outstanding in perpetuity,but it is essential that the words of the letter of credit definitively provide it will continue in perpetuity.
here,we see no ambiguity.under the plain meaning of the word states,suntrust letter of credit is not perpetual.suntrust letter of credit states to the contrary that it shall expire one year from the date hereof provided however,that it shall be deemed automatically renewed without amendment for additional one year periods unless golden west elects not to require this letter of credit renewed.thus,the letter of credit recites that it will expire that it will not continue perpetually,either when golden west elects not to renew or when suntrust receives a written agreement by both golden west and cenco authorizing the termination.although the matter is not entirely free from doubt because of the automatic renewal provision,we conclude that under the plain language of d,the letter of credit is not perpetual.to interpret the law governing letters of credit in such a nonliteral way as is urged by suntrust would introduce grave uncertainties into the use of letters of credit and impair their utility for domestic or foreign commerce.
suntrust argues that this approach to the ucc is at odds with the intentions of the drafters of article and the primary purpose of letter of credit,to limit letters of credit of unlimited duration.as such,suntrust urges us to adopt a functional and broad definition of states that it is perpetual.but,if the word states in ucc d is interpreted,as suntrust advocates,so that letters of credit like that at issue here are perpetual,portions of other of ucc will be rendered superfluous,in contravention of the rules of statutory interpretation.see bosley med,kremer,cir we try to avoid,where possible,an interpretation of a statute that renders any part of it superfluous and does not give effect to all of the words used by the legislature.internal quotation marks and citation omitted big creek lumber county of santa cruz,cal th,d,courts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage.alteration omitted quoting arnett dal cielo,cal th,d,cook commonwealth,words in a statute should be interpreted,if possible,to avoid rendering words superfluous.under ucc c,a letter of credit expires one year after issuance if there is either no stated expiration date or no other provision that determines its duration.ucc c.this thereby contemplates two methods to avoid expiration of a letter of credit one year after issuance the letter of credit could state an expiration date or include another provision that determines its duration.id.in other words,subsection c is the default provision if a letter of credit has no termination date or other measure of its duration subsection d is the default provision if a letter of credit states that it is perpetual.if the interpretation of ucc d advocated by suntrust is applied to ucc c,then the second method to avoid expiration of a letter of credit one year after its,including in the letter of credit a provision that determines its be superfluous.our interpretation of d,on the other hand,gives effect to the second prong of c.
finally,suntrust asks us to interpret the official comments accompanying ucc to conclude that suntrust letter of credit is perpetual.official comment states,in pertinent part,a letter of credit that may be revoked or terminated at the discretion of the issuer by notice to the beneficiary is not perpetual.ucc,official comment.suntrust suggests that by explaining that letters of credit that provide for revocation or termination at the discretion of the issuer are not perpetual,the official comment implies that letters of credit that provide for revocation or termination only at the discretion of the beneficiary are perpetual,and therefore fall within the limitations of ucc d.we reject this argument.the absence of an official comment addressing renewal clauses controlled by the beneficiary does not make such letters of credit perpetual.as golden west notes,the drafters of article of the ucc could have included official comment specifically to protect a particular type of letter of credits and not to indicate that all other letters of credit that contain renewal clauses terminated at the discretion of the beneficiary are perpetual.we will not speculate what the drafters intended by electing not to comment on a particular type of letter of credit.see,texaco,at.we conclude that the language of the statute supports the district court interpretation of ucc d.we hold th
