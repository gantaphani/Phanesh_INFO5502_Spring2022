appellant nicholas bredimus bredimus conditionally pled guilty,expressly reserving his right to appeal,to the charge of knowingly and willfully traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in a sexual act with a person under years of age in violation of b.on appeal,he challenges the sufficiency of the factual basis for the guilty plea,arguing that the statute of conviction is an invalid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce clause and it unconstitutionally punishes mere preparation,mere thought,and mere travel.he also contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the charge on the grounds that the offense lacked a domestic effect as required by the statute of conviction.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
the following facts are not in dispute.in october,bredimus,a united states citizen,left his residence in coppell,texas to travel to thailand after first stopping in hong kong and tokyo.in addition to attending scheduled business meetings,while in thailand bredimus intended to make videotapes and digital images of thai children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
upon arriving in thailand,bredimus contacted pensri suhongsa suhongsa,and hired her to accompany him to chiang rai province as a procurer and interpreter.on november,bredimus and suhongsa traveled to mai sao in the chiang rai province of northern thailand and obtained two rooms at the srisamoot hotel.bredimus asked suhongsa to find young boys or girls who would come to the hotel for him to photograph.that same day,bredimus videotaped himself engaged in sexually explicit conduct with a thai boy at the srisamoot hotel,and took digital images of the boy engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
bredimus was indicted on march,in a six count indictment on june,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging bredimus with one count of knowingly traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in a sexual act with children under years of age in violation of section b and one count of traveling in foreign commerce with the intent to promote sexually explicit conduct by minors for the purpose of producing visual depictions of such conduct in violation of a b a and c 
on may,bredimus moved to dismiss the indictment,asserting an challenge that congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,by enacting the two statutes under which he was charged,and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over an extraterritorial offense that has no effect within the united states.on july,the district court denied the appellant motion to dismiss,finding inter alia,that section b does not exceed congress authority under the commerce clause because congress has the authority to keep the channels of foreign commerce free from immoral or injurious uses and that banning foreign travel for an illicit purpose does not impermissibly burden a person fundamental right to travel.the court also ruled that it had jurisdiction under section b on the grounds that the statute targets an activity that occurs within the united states because the foreign travel originates domestically.
bredimus entered into a conditional plea agreement with the government on august.bredimus pled guilty to count two of the original indictment,but specifically reserved his right to challenge the constitutionality of section b on appeal at the arraignment hearing,bredimus moved the court to reconsider this motion to dismiss,which the district court denied 
on november,the district court sentenced bredimus to months in the bureau of prisons,a fine of,and conditioned supervised release for three years.all remaining counts in the original and superseding indictment were dismissed.bredimus timely filed a notice of appeal.

iii.discussion 
a.the constitutionality of section b 
under section b,a united states citizen who travels in foreign commerce,for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined imprisoned b.bredimus argues that the statute of conviction,as applied constitutes congress exercising a general police power in violation of united states lopez,d and united states morrison,d,and therefore,he contends that this court must inquire into whether the regulated activity substantially affects commerce.specifically,bredimus challenges the constitutionality of section b,on the grounds that congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause,because on these facts there is no substantial relationship between the proscribed conduct the crime of sexual exploitation of minors and foreign commerce travel by citizens abroad.bredimus also contends that,as applied in this case,the statute unconstitutionally burdens his individual rights under the first,fifth,and eighth amendments,because it punishes mere thought,mere travel,or mere preparation for a crime.we will discuss each in turn.
first principles 
because bredimus brings a challenge under lopez and morrison,we begin our analysis by briefly elucidating the first principles of commerce clause jurisprudence.united states ho,cir the constitution ensure s protection of our fundamental liberties.id.pursuant to this aim,the framers devised a federal government of limited and enumerated powers.this constitutionally mandated division of authority appears in the article i vesting clause,const.art.i,which confers upon congress solely the legislative powers herein granted.the clause necessarily implies that the framers denied congress a general police power,ho,at quoting,morrison,at and,reposing such power instead in the states.
the constitution,however,expressly granted congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states art.i,cl.since the scales of the federal courts commerce clause jurisprudence tipped more towards according to congress considerably greater latitude in regulating conduct including federal criminal statutes.see morrison,at,rather than to maintaining a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.id.at.lopez,at.a new era emerged with the court decisions in lopez and morrison,which clarified the legal standards applicable to a constitutional challenge under the commerce clause based on those two landmark cases,it is now clear,that while courts still maintain a wide degree of deference to congress power to enact legislation pursuant to the commerce clause,such power is now subject to certain outer limits.lopez,at.see also ho,at.with that in mind,we begin our analysis of the current facts.
the commerce clause 
our consideration of bredimus assertion that congress exceeded the outer limits of the commerce clause must begin with lopez.in lopez,the plaintiff brought a challenge to the constitutionality of the gun free school zones act of,q a,which made it a federal crime to have a gun within feet of a school.the lopez court summarized three broad categories of activity that congress may properly regulate under its commerce power the use of the channels of interstate commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities,and activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.lopez,at.in lopez,the court found section q unconstitutional because that criminal statute merely regulated firearms near schools,and thus,had no substantial effect on interstate commerce.id.at.relying upon lopez,bredimus contends that congress regulation of sexual acts with a minor under section b has no substantial effect on interstate commerce.we disagree.
although this court has not addressed the constitutionality of section b under the commerce clause,other circuit courts have.in united states han,cir,the second circuit upheld section b constitutionality.the defendant in han was convicted of violating the interstate commerce prong of section b after traveling from new jersey to new york to engage in sexual acts with an individual he thought to be a girl,but who was in fact an undercover police officer.id.at.like bredimus,the defendant in han relied on the reasoning of lopez and claimed that the statute was invalid because the regulated activity did not substantially affect interstate commerce.id.the second circuit in han rejected the defendant claim,distinguishing lopez on the grounds that lopez dealt exclusively with the third category in contrast section b deals with the use of the channels of interstate commerce.see also united states brockdorff,stating that section b presents a channels of commerce issue rather than a lopez affecting commerce issue.we find no reason to generally disagree with han,and therefore,we reject bredimus contention that we should inquire into whether the regulated activity substantially affects foreign commerce.
bredimus argues,in the alternative,that even assuming that section b generally presents a channels of commerce issue,a substantial affect analysis may still be appropriate.essentially,bredimus argues that the lopez categories should be viewed as fluid rather than hermetically sealed constructs designed solely for rigid application.united states schaffner,cir.the supreme court and other lower federal courts have found that these three bases of congressional authority are in fact analytically distinct.united states robertson,d see also united states pappadopoulos,cir brockdorff.at.in robertson,the supreme court concluded that transporting equipment and workers from into alaska to further an illegal mining operation was interstate commerce activity subject to congressional regulation without regard to the affecting commerce test.id.as stated by the court,t he affecting commerce test was developed in our jurisprudence to define the extent of congress power over purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial interstate affects.id.at.emphasis in original.furthermore,in schaffner,the seventh circuit found that although the lopez categories are useful as a synopsis of the court commerce clause jurisprudence,the attempt to fit a regulation within one category can prove elusive,even fruitless.at emphasis added.interpreted in this light,schaffner highlights the potential for certain cases to fall into several lopez categories rather than focusing,as bredimus urges us to do,on the lack of distinctiveness of the categories themselves.id.at.therefore,we reject bredimus reading of the lopez categories.our determination comports with the treatment by other courts of commerce clause challenges to statutes analogous to the one at issue today.
this court notes that other circuits have found statutes similar to section b a and to be valid exercises of congress commerce clause authority.for example,courts have rejected commerce clause challenges to the violence against women act of,a,which criminalizes crossing a state line with the intent to violate a protection order and then violating it,because that statute criminalizes only those violations of protection orders that involve the use of interstate commerce.han,at see also united states von foelkel,cir upholding a as it falls within lopez first category united states bailey,cir,cert.denied,d united states wright,cir upholding a as it falls within congress authority to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses.quotations omitted.
similarly,courts have upheld,under the commerce clause,the constitutionality of,which provides a person who travels across a state line with the intent to injure,harass,or intimidate that person spouse or intimate partner,and who,in the course of or as a result of such travel,intentionally commits a crime of violence and thereby causes bodily injury to such spouse or intimate partner,shall be punished han,at see also united states gluzman,cir united states lankford,cir finding that because a is a regulation of the use of channels of interstate commerce,the court need not address whether domestic violence substantially affects interstate commerce united states page,cir because the triggering factor of a is the movement of the victim across state lines,this statute falls into the first category and is a valid exercise of congress power to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.
in upholding the constitutionality of sections a and,the previously mentioned cases generally refer to congress ability to regulate morality under the commerce clause.in caminetti united states,the court held that the mann act,which prohibits the transportation of women in commerce for immoral purposes,was a valid exercise of congress commerce power.in that decision,the court clearly stated that to keep the channels of commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained,and is no longer open to question.id.at.pursuant to this aim,the court has long held that congress has plenary power to reach and punish the movement in interstate commerce of those who seek to accomplish unlawful purposes 
we have said that the liberty protected by the constitution embraces the right to be free in the enjoyment of one faculties to be free to use them in all lawful ways to live and work where he will to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling to pursue any livelihood of avocation but surely it will not be said to be part of any one liberty to enter into commerce an element that will be confessedly injurious to the public morals.
lottery case.
we acknowledge that unlike section b,which criminalizes crossing state or international lines with a criminal intent,without requiring the commitment of any further criminal act,the aforementioned statutes,sections a and,require both crossing borders with criminal intent and the commission of an unlawful act thereafter.however,we do not find that distinction dispositive here.courts have also upheld a statute,which,like section b,does not require the commission of a further act.section requires only that the government prove the defendant traveled in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent that a murder be committed for hire.united states delpit,cir see also united states degan,cir rejecting defendant claim of no nexus between interstate commerce and crime and upholding the constitutionality of section b on the basis of the sufficiency of the evidence.like section b,under section,once the commerce facility has been used with the required intent,the crime is complete.bredimus points out that these courts did not specifically conduct a commerce clause analysis as part of their process.while acknowledging his argument,we still find the holdings of these cases persuasive,however,because the statute itself was upheld in both instances pursuant to congress commerce clause authority.delpit,at degan,at.
we find no reason to disagree with the aforementioned precedent as applied here.quite the contrary,we find the deference accorded to congress under section b even more compelling when,as here,the commerce at issue is foreign,as opposed to interstate.the s
