background 
is a rhode island corporation with its principal place of business in west warwick,rhode island.its grass technologies product group manufactures,sells,and distributes instruments for sleep and neurological research and clinical applications of sleep science and brain wave recording and analysis.although the identity of some of its customers is well known,financial arrangements with its sales people,its marketing strategy,and its pricing and cost structures are all highly confidential,and makes strenuous efforts to protect its trade secrets and other confidential information.
in october,even though plant had no prior experience in the medical industry or in medical equipment sales,hired him as a product specialist,responsible for the demonstration and training of its grass technologies product line.provided plant with extensive training about its business,products,customers,and competitors,and it was training that later made him marketable to nihon kohden.when hired plant,he signed an employee agreement,which contains a clause 
i recognize that the company sells its products throughout north america and europe as such,upon termination of my employment at the company,for whatever reason,i shall not directly or indirectly enter into or engage in a business that competes with the company,in a territory consisting of north america,and europe,either as an individual,partner,joint venturer,employee,agent or salesman for any person,or as an officer,director or stockholder of a corporation or otherwise,for a period of one year thereafter.
and a trade secrets clause 
i hereby agree t hat any inventions,discoveries or improvements and any technical data,trade secrets,including,but not limited to,customer lists,information or,made,discovered or conceived or acquired by me during the period of my employment,whether patentable,patented or not,are to be and remain the property of the company that,without the written authorization of the company,i will neither use nor disclose to any person other than my superiors in the company,any information,trade secrets,technical data or relating to the company products,processes,methods,equipment and business practices,which i have acquired during my employment.
the employee agreement also contained a and clause,which stated that it shall be governed by the laws of the state of rhode island and that plant consented to jurisdiction in rhode island for any dispute arising out of the agreement.
subsequently,plant asked to be transferred to the state of florida and become a field sales representative granted his request and paid to relocate him to florida.on july,promoted plant to district sales manager for sales of grass technologies products.as district sales manager,plant had access to and used trade secrets,including confidential marketing,pricing,and customer information.he became intimately familiar with customers and their preferences as well as pricing strategy and cost data.he also learned about suppliers,products they supplied,and the customers who purchased these products.finally,he was informed about research and development efforts with respect to its grass technologies product line.
nihon kohden,a california corporation,has its principal place of business in foothill ranch,california.as a manufacturer of instrumentation for patient monitoring,sleep assessment,and neurology,nihon kohden competes directly with.in,brian kehoe,the florida sales representative for nihon kohden,was about to leave the company,and on july,he emailed gary reasoner,the director of the neurology business unit for nihon kohden,and informed him that he had met a man,kevin plant,who was a potential replacement for the florida sales territory.plant was indeed interested in employment with nihon kohden and in subsequent discussions,he emphasized his experience.he reminded nihon kohden that he was coming from the industry and one of the competitors in the field and in his employment application,he touted his knowledge of applications.
in september,plant sent a resume to reasoner,and reasoner interviewed plant several times over the telephone.in late september,plant traveled to foothill ranch and met with michael ohsawa,the director of operations for nihon kohden,and with reasoner.directly after the interview,nihon kohden made plant a job offer,which he accepted.after plant accepted the nihon kohden position,kehoe emailed plant i will be interested in seeing what you have in the works with grass technologies.plant replied,sounds good.
before offering plant employment,nihon kohden became aware of the employment agreement with plant and referred the contract to counsel for review.nihon kohden lawyer advised nihon kohden that there was some minimal risk in hiring plant notwithstanding that advice,nihon kohden hired plant to sell its products in competition with in the sales territory he had covered for.
discussiona.the jurisdictional issue 
from the very outset of this litigation,nihon kohden has vigorously maintained that,as a california business,it should not have been haled into court in rhode island to defend its hiring of a florida resident to sell its product in florida in support of its contention that it lacks sufficient contacts with rhode island to be subjected to jurisdiction,nihon kohden marshals evidence that it contends demonstrates an absence of any contacts between it and rhode island,between plant and rhode island,and between its deal with plant and rhode island.
legal standards 
to hear a case,a court must have personal jurisdiction over the parties,that is,the power to require the parties to obey its decrees.united states swiss am.bank,cir.early on,nihon kohden moved to dismiss the lawsuit under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction.the district court denied the motion.on a motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of persuading the court that jurisdiction exists.mcnutt motors acceptance.sch.of law at andover,amer.bar ass n,cir.faced with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a district court may choose from among several methods for determining whether the plaintiff has met its burden.adelson hananel,cir quoting daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson poole,cir.

there are two means of establishing jurisdiction over a defendant person available under the fourteenth amendment specific and general jurisdiction.for specific jurisdiction,the plaintiff claim must be related to the defendant contacts.harlow children,cir.for general jurisdiction,in which the cause of action may be unrelated to the defendant contacts,the defendant must have continuous and systematic contacts with the state.id.here,the district court concluded that it had both specific and general jurisdiction.since we conclude that the district court correctly concluded it had specific jurisdiction,we will address only that issue.
specific jurisdiction 
this circuit divides the minimum contacts analysis into three inquires relatedness,purposeful availment,and reasonableness.laminate sales,at cardinale,at stating that personal jurisdiction under international shoe,allowing jurisdiction to be asserted as to a specific claim,can be established where the defendants availed themselves of the opportunity to do business in the state,the claim in question is related to that access and the gestalt factors are consistent with requiring an out defendant to defend within the state phillips prairie eye,cir children,at.questions of specific jurisdiction are always tied to the particular claims asserted.phillips exeter acad.howard phillips fund,cir.claims against nihon kohden sound in tort and in tort cases,a court charged with determining the existence vel non of personal jurisdiction must probe the causal nexus between the defendant contacts and the plaintiff cause of action.id.
a relatedness 
the first inquiry,relatedness,asks whether the claim underlying the litigation directly arise s out of,or relate s to,the defendant activities.laminate sales,at quoting united workers pleasant,cir.the relatedness test is a flexible,relaxed standard.id.quoting pritzker yari,cir.
focusing on the tortious interference with a contractual relationship claim,to prove such a claim,a plaintiff in rhode island must establish the following elements the existence of a contract the alleged wrongdoer knowledge of the contract his intentional interference and damages resulting therefrom.jolicoeur furniture baldelli,quoting smith dev.bilow.before nihon kohden hired plant,it knew that was located in rhode island,that plant had entered into the employee agreement in rhode island,that the contract specified it would be governed by rhode island law,that the contract contained and provisions,and that by virtue of the contract,plant had consented to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of rhode island over any disputes related to the contract.further,nihon kohden had sought and obtained legal advice that by hiring plant,it was exposing itself to some legal risk.thus,nihon kohden knew that by employing plant,it was running the risk that plant would thereby have breached his rhode island contract with a rhode island company and any ensuing suit would be initiated in rhode island and interpreted under rhode island law.
despite this formidable array of rhode island connections,nihon kohden insists that because it is a california corporation and because all its direct dealings with plant,a florida resident,took place either in florida or in california,jurisdiction can not lie in rhode island.nihon kohden argument,however,emphasizes too fine a point.consistent with calder jones,d,a defendant need not be physically present in the forum state to cause injury and thus activity for jurisdictional purposes in the forum state.laminate sales,at.nihon kohden conduct in florida and california was a cause of the breach of actual occurred in rhode island.that injury was clearly related to tortious interference claim,satisfying the first prong of the minimum contacts analysis.
b purposeful availment 
to satisfy the second requirement,the defendant contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state laws and making the defendant involuntary presence before the state courts foreseeable.laminate sales,at quoting united workers,at.the focus is on voluntariness and foreseeability.id.quoting sawtelle farrell,cir.here,nihon kohden was fully aware of the employee agreement,including its rhode island provisions,and persisted in negotiations in the face of legal advice from its own counsel that to do so would pose a risk.it must have been foreseeable to nihon kohden that it might be held accountable for its actions in a rhode island forum.id.at.
c reasonableness 
to evaluate the reasonableness requirement,the supreme court has provided a set of gestalt factors to consider.laminate sales,at united workers,at.these factors include the defendant burden of appearing,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of the controversy,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.burger king rudzewicz,d laminate sales,at.nihon kohden contends that rhode island assertion of jurisdiction imposed a substantial burden on nihon kohden,because inter alia it has no offices or employees in the state of rhode island and all percipient witnesses to the hiring of plant and other information about the misappropriation of trade secrets were located either in california or florida.
nihon kohden position becomes manifestly untenable when companion litigation against plant is factored into the mix.as nihon kohden concedes,had the legal right to initiate a lawsuit for breach of the employment agreement against plant in rhode island,the state where the contract was formulated and executed.once rhode island asserted uncontested jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim and the related misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition claims,the florida and california witnesses and evidence were heading for trial in rhode island.nihon kohden earnest complaint about undue burden rings hollow,when its alternative would have resulted in two separate cases in two jurisdictions on opposite ends of the rhode island and florida or rhode island and california.contrary to nihon kohden position,the gestalt factors militate strongly in favor of jurisdiction in rhode island.
d specific 
applying the specific jurisdiction tripartite analysis,we conclude that the district court properly asserted jurisdiction over claims against nihon kohden.we need go no further.
nihon kohden argues that rhode island was not the proper venue for lawsuit,and the district court should have either dismissed the claim or transferred the case to a different district in accordance with 
determining venue 
the applicable venue provision of title states 
a civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship may,except as otherwise provided by law,be brought only in a judicial district where any defendant resides,if all defendants reside in the same state,a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated,or a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced,if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.
a.although nihon kohden is a california business,it resides for purposes of venue in rhode island plant is a resident of florida.as the defendants reside in different states,subsection does not apply.
under subsection,the question becomes whether the district of rhode island is a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred.id.in determining whether rhode island is a district in which a substantial part of the events occurred,we look not to a single triggering event prompting the action,but to the entire sequence of events underlying the claim.uffner la reunion francaise,cir quoting first of.bramlet,cir.in addition,we do not focus on the actions of one party.rather,our approach takes a holistic view of the acts underlying a claim.id.at.furthermore,we are not required to determine the best venue,merely a proper venue.see id.at quoting bates c s adjusters,cir,for the proposition that venue may be proper in any number of districts.thus,even though plant was a resident of florida when he was hired by nihon kohden,a california corporation,venue in rhode island may still be proper.id.at stating that contemplates that venue may be proper in several districts.
and plant entered into an employment contract in rhode island,the district in which was headquartered,that contained the and clauses at issue here.with full knowledge of the employee agreement and its contents,nihon kohden hired away plant,thereby interfering with contract and misappropriating its trade secrets.because was headquartered in rhode island,this district is one of the places where the tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets occurred and where the harms from these torts were felt.see bates,at cir.in addition,rhode island was the forum selected by the employee agreement to resolve disputes.see lambert kysar,cir upholding forum selection clause.taken together,these facts constitute a substantial part of claims against nihon kohden.
further,plant did not contest venue in rhode island and that portion of the lawsuit was,for venue purposes,going to proceed in rhode island.thus,the convenience of the parties strongly militated in favor of retention of venue in rhode island.uffner,at t he general purpose of the venue rules is to protect the defendant against the risk that a plaintiff will select an unfair or inconvenient place of trial.quoting leroy great united,d.given that a substantial part of claims involved rhode island and proceeding in rhode island would not thwart the underlying purpose of the venue statute,we conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the claims pending against nihon kohden in rhode island for improper venue.
transfer of venue 
nihon kohden also appeals the district court denial of its motion for change of venue under a.section a is intended to place discretion in the district court to adjudicate motions for transfer according to an individualized,consideration of convenience and fairness.stewart,ricoh,d quoting van dusen barrack,d.where the contract between the parties,here speaking of and plant,contains a clause,the clause will be a significant factor that figures centrally in the district court calculus.royal bed spring famossul industria e comercio de moveis,cir quoting stewart,at.we review a district court decision on transfer of venue for an abuse of discretion.coady ashcraft gerel,cir cianbro,cir.not only does the burden of proof rest with the party seeking to transfer there is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff choice of forum.coady,at.in the circumstances of this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying nihon kohden motion for transfer of venue.
c.the verdict 
following the verdict,nihon kohden and plant moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b and moved for new trial under federal rule of civil procedure or in the alternative for remittitur.the district court denied each motion.defendants object both to a number of the district court legal rulings and to the verdict,claiming that the evidence strongly supported almost mandated a defense verdict.we disagree.

the provision 
employee agreement with plant contained a provision 
i recognize that sells its products throughout north america and europe as such,upon termination of my employment at the company,for whatever reason,i shall not directly or indirectly enter into or engage in a business that competes with the company,in a territory consisting of north america,and europe,either as an individual,partner,joint venturer,employee,agent or salesman for any person,or as an officer,director or stockholder of a corporation or otherwise,for a period of one year thereafter.
defendants argue that the provision was unenforceable until it was modified by the district court,that changes in plant employment status voided the agreement,that own breach of the employment agreement voided plant obligations under the agreement,that the provision was unenforceable since it did not protect legitimate business interests,and that nihon kohden can not be liable for interfering with an unenforceable contract.we address each contention.
a partial enforcement 
in the district court,defendants objected to the territorial breadth of this provision,which included not only all of north america but also all of europe,and to the breadth of the activity captured by the provision.defendants cited rhode island state law,which disfavors covenants.see,cranston print works pothier,koppers prods.readio,stating that noncompetitive employment contracts are carefully scrutinized by the court and only enforced when reasonable and when the restriction does not extend beyond what is apparently necessary for the protection of those in whose favor they are made.consistent with rhode island law,the district court partially enforced the provision,restricting its territorial application to the state of florida and to a limited subset of customers.see durapin,am.
defendants do not complain about the trial court more restrictive interpretation of the employee agreement.instead,they argue that the provision was not enforceable until the district court modified it to make it enforceable.we have no quarrel with defendants general contention that under the partial enforcement rule,an provision can not be enforced until it is modified,a proposition that seems.but,defendants real contention is that a party to a agreement can not breach the agreement until it is judicially modified,and specifically that it was impossible for plant to breach his agreement with until the district court modified the provision to make it enforceable 
defendants contention does not withstand analysis.their logic would give the promisor in a agreement one free breach,requiring a prior judicial order before the provision could be said to have been violated.such a proposition,the validity of which is without authority,would eviscerate all but the most narrowly tailored agreements,since a modification of any term of the provision would justify a breach of all its terms.further,because most breaching employees gain the full benefit of the breach the first time they compete with their former employer,a second breach after judicial warning would in most cases be cumulative.also,once a court restricts the scope of the agreement,the breaching party is being held to a more narrowly circumscribed agreement than the one he signed,and the more restrictive terms of the agreement remain as effective as the day they were agreed to.finally,contrary to defendants contention,the courts in rhode island have consistently issued orders against prior breaches of modified provisions.carbone regan,d modifying a agreement and issuing a preliminary injunction against the former employee nestle food miller.granting injunctive relief on the basis of a modified agreement and awarding nominal damages for conduct occurring prior to modification cranston print works,at reversing a preliminary injunction,directing the trial court to determine the reasonableness of a covenant and to decide what remedies,if any,are appropriate for any proven violations of the settlement agreement aim high,jessen,no,wl.lexis,modifying geographic range and issuing a preliminary injunction against former employees carcieri creative,wl.lexis.july,modifying geographic scope and issuing preliminary injunction against former employees.
b changes in plant employment 
defendants next contend that after hired plant,it made material changes in his employment,which voided the provision.they note that plant job changed in from product specialist in rhode island to salesperson in florida,and in,substantially reduced his sales territory.regarding the job change,defendants point out that the introductory paragraph of the employment agreement states that it applies only to employees involved in the design,development or manufacture of products for the company.defendants argue that once plant became a salesman,this definitional language did not apply to him.
turning first to material change,defendants cite afc cable.clisham,d applying massachusetts law,for the proposition that a change in an employee job can void a agreement.it is apparently correct that under massachusetts law,e ach time an employee employment relationship with the employer changes materially such that they have entered into a new employment relationship a new restrictive covenant must be signed.lycos,jackson,wl.lexis.the genesis of the massachusetts material change rule is bartlett tree expert barrington.however,as interpreted in massachusetts,in both bartlett tree and afc cable systems,the court found that the conduct of the parties clearly showed that they had abandoned and rescinded by mutual consent the earlier employment agreement containing the pertinent provision and had entered into a new employment relationship that included no such provision.intertek testing servs,llc,wl,at.lexis,at.further,in both cases,the employer provided the employee with a new employment agreement,which the employee refused to sign.id.at.lexis,at see iron mountain info,taddeo,d,applying massachusetts law and stating that i n determining whether there has been a material change to the employment relationship,courts have considered it extremely significant that the employer sought to have the employee sign a new agreement.the question,according to intertek,is whether the employment agreement had been mutually abandoned and rescinded.intertek,wl,at.lexis,at slade gorton,describing the question as whether the contract was abandoned or superseded by the conduct of the parties prior to the employee resignation bartlett tree,at observing that changes in the employee remuneration and sales area,memorialized in a new contract that the employee refused to sign,strongly suggest that the parties had abandoned their old arrangement and had entered into a new relationship.finally,whether there has been such a modification of a previous agreement,rather than an implied revocation or termination of the agreement as the result of such a subsequent change,depends upon the intention of the parties.envelope saley,or,see bartlett tree,at noting that parties conduct subsequent to changes in employee position was inconsistent with an intention that the original remained in effect.
assuming that rhode island would adopt massachusetts material change rule,the evidence in this case is insufficient to generate its application.see elizabeth grady face first,escavich,d,stating that bartlett tree and afc cable stand for nothing more than the unremarkable proposition that contracting parties are free to abandon their prior contracts and form new ones,and an intention to do so may be evidenced not only by words or writing but also by the parties conduct.plant job change from product specialist to district sales manager does not reflect a mutual abandonment and rescission of the provision there is no suggestion that approached plant with a new employment agreement and,there is no evidence of intent on either or plant part to revoke or supersede the employment agreement.
regarding the supposed restriction in the employee agreement to work involving design,development or manufacture of products for the company,defendants reading of the agreement is much too narrow.the introductory paragraph of the employee agreement provides,in part i am now or am about to be employed by,inc and in connection with such employment,i am,may,or will be engaged in work relating to the company business,involving design,development or manufacture of products for the company.on the basis of this recital and in exchange for continued employment and compensation,a signatory of the agreement,here plant,makes various promises,including not to compete.the recital can not fairly be read to apply only to those employees involved in design,development,or manufacture of products for.the subordinate clause,design,development or manufacture of products,describes the nature of business it does not limit the type of work an employee must perform at to become subject to the agreement.
defendants claim that by substantially reducing plant sales territory,materially breached the employee agreement,thereby releasing plant from its provisions.however,as the district judge observed,during trial,plant admitted that when he accepted the sales position in florida,informed him that his sales territory might be partly reallocated in the future.when later reduced his sales territory,it was acting in accordance with the agreement of the parties,and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,can not be said to have breached the contract by implementing its terms.
d legitimate business interests 
defendants final argument against the enforceability of the provision is that it was not designed to protect legitimate business interests.rhode island law requires that a party seeking to enforce a agreement demonstrate that there exists a legitimate interest that the provision is designed to protect.durapin,at max garelick,leonardo.while the desire to be free from competition,by itself,is not a protectable interest,durapin,at,protecting a business confidential information and as the special relationship its sales force has developed with qualify as a legitimate interest.carbone,d at nestle.at dial media,schiff,rego displays,fournier.at trial,produced evidence of the proprietary nature of the information it disclosed to plant,including strengths and weaknesses of its products,its pricing strategies,the new products under development,and its customers.the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict.
e interference with an enforceable agreement 
because defendants have failed to demonstrate that the provision in the employee agreement is unenforceable against plant,the argument that nihon kohden could not have interfered with the employee agreement also fails.
evidence of trade secret misappropriation 
based largely on the testimony of employees,defendants insist that there is no evidence that either plant or nihon kohden ever used any of confidential information.they contend that this failure dooms misappropriation claim,which they say requires proof that shared a confidential relationship with the defendant,possessed a trade secret,disclosed it to the defendant,and that the defendant made use of the disclosure in breach of the confidence reposed in him.burten milton bradley,cir.
defendants reliance on our discussion of massachusetts tort law in burten is misplaced.misappropriation claim arises under the rhode island uniform trade secrets act,laws et,which defines misappropriation as follows 
i acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means or 
ii disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who 
a used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret or 
b at the time of disclosure or use,knew or had reason to know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was 
i derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it 
ii acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use or 
iii derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use or 
c before a material change of his or her position,knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.
laws.the act definition of improper means includes breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy.id.misappropriation thus includes disclosure of a trade secret by one who acquired it while under a duty to maintain its secrecy and the acquisition of a trade secret by one who knows that it was acquired by breach of a duty to maintain secrecy.contrary to defendants assertion,need not have shown that either plant or nihon kohden used trade secrets disclosure or acquisition is sufficient to constitute misappropriation,subjecting defendants to liability for actual loss and unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation.id.a.
here,there was ample evidence that the very reason nihon kohden hired plant was to obtain access to his intimate knowledge of business viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,it is a logical inference that a competitor who hires away a rival valued employee with access to inside information has done so in order to use that inside information to compete with the rival,and it is an equally logical inference that once plant became a nihon kohden employee,he sought to justify its hiring decision by revealing and using the information nihon kohden had bargained for.
defendants next say that failed to produce evidence of direct sales that lost to nihon kohden as a consequence of its hiring plant,and that to prove damages,instead relied on sales quotations,not actual sales.defendants contend that to rely on sales quotations,not actual sales,required the jury to assume a damages verdict based on speculation and conjecture in violation of law.nestle.at reiterating the enduring rule that damages must be established by a reasonable certainty and may not be recovered if purely speculative.at the same time,is not required to prove its damages with mathematical precision.cordeco dev.santiago vasquez,cir.all that is required is a reasonable basis of computation and the best evidence obtainable.knightsbridge mktg,promociones y proyectos,cir.
the district court undertook a painstaking analysis of the damages evidence at the trial and considered as well the reasons why nihon kohden did not present evidence of actual sales.we have reviewed the district court careful review of the evidence and can add nothing.it suffices to say,as the district court concluded,that the evidence,again when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,supports the damage award.
an inconsistent and nonsensical verdict 
defendants correctly observe that the jury issued the following monetary awards against plant for breach of contract against nihon kohden for intentional interference with the contract against plant and nihon kohden for misappropriation of trade secrets and,against plant for unfair competition.nihon kohden characterizes these awards as based on their inconsistency and lack of evidentiary support.other than strongly telegraphing its resolute disenchantment with the verdict,defendants have not explained why these monetary awards are inconsistent.we are left to guess.it is well settled in this circuit that issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some developed argumentation,are deemed to have been abandoned.piedrahita mukasey,cir quoting tum gonzales,cir.we will not attempt to supply an argument the appellant has not articulated 
evidentiary rulings and jury instruction 
nihon kohden raises several claims of error in the district court evidentiary rulings.we have carefully reviewed nihon kohden contentions and conclude that nihon kohden failed to preserve some of its claims,and failed to adequately develop others as to the remainder,we conclude the district court did not err.
defendants also contend that the district court erred when it instructed the jury on plant failure to produce evidence of the commissions he received as a nihon kohden employee.the district court gave the following instruction 
if you find that kevin plant failed to produce documents or information concerning the actual sales that he made on behalf of nihon kohden in the state of florida,you may infer from kevin plant nonproduction that the documents and information are unfavorable to the defense.
