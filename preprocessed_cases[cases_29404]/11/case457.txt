in,samuel hosford was indicted under for unlicensed dealing in firearms and conspiracy to deal firearms without a license.he moved to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds.specifically,he argued that the indictment violated his second amendment right to engage in intrastate firearm sales between persons the due process clause of the fifth amendment for vagueness and the commerce clause.the district court denied his motion,and hosford timely appealed.
we review the district court factual findings on a motion to dismiss an indictment for clear error,but we review its legal conclusions de novo.united states perry,cir.quoting united states woolfolk,cir.we hold that the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing comports with the second and fifth amendments both facially and as applied.it is also a valid exercise of congressional power under the commerce clause.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of hosford motion to dismiss his indictment.
hosford,a resident of montgomery county,maryland,sold firearms to an individual he met in a public parking lot five times over the course of months.he had no reason to believe that the individual was a prohibited purchaser,but he also took no measures to ensure that the individual was a valid purchaser.unbeknownst to him,the individual was an undercover officer.hosford was arrested and indicted for one count of conspiracy and five counts of unlicensed firearm dealing.
according to the facts agreed to in his conditional plea agreement,hosford conspired with another man,henry parrott,to sell firearms.parrott purchased firearms from gun shows and delivered them to hosford.hosford then sold these firearms to the undercover officer.over five transactions,hosford sold the officer eight guns and intended to sell another four guns before he was arrested.
hosford moved to dismiss his indictment as unconstitutional under the second amendment,due process clause of the fifth amendment,and commerce clause.the district court held that the indictment was constitutional.hosford then pleaded guilty,conditioned on the outcome of this appeal about the statute constitutionality.
hosford was indicted under the gun control act of,et,which prohibits individuals without a license from regularly selling,for the predominant purpose of gaining profit,firearms that are not part of their personal collection or for their hobby.because hosford motion challenges on second amendment and vagueness grounds the constitutionality of this prohibition,we first more carefully review the statutes at issue,as well as the burdens and responsibilities they trigger.
forbids anyone except a licensed importer,licensed manufacturer,or licensed dealer,to engage in the business of importing,manufacturing,or dealing in firearms.a a.
lays out the relevant definitions for this prohibition.a dealer is,in relevant part,any person engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail.a.a licensed dealer is a dealer who has obtained a federal license to commercially buy and sell firearms.id.and under clarifying statutory definitions passed in,e ngaged in the business means a person who devotes time,attention,and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.c see also firearm owners protection act,pub,stat.and with the principal objective of livelihood and profit means that the intent of the sale is predominantly one of obtaining livelihood and pecuniary gain,as opposed to other intents like decreasing or increasing one personal firearm collection.but these definitions explicitly exempt anyone who makes occasional sales,exchanges,or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby,or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.c.
to obtain a license,a prospective firearms dealer must submit an application,be at least years old,pay a fee,and establish lawful premises for selling firearms.a,d.if the applicant fulfills these steps and is otherwise legally able to possess,transport,and ship firearms,the application must be approved.d.
licensed dealers are subject to regulations that those conducting personal sales are not.for example,the attorney general may require licensed dealers to maintain importation,production,shipment,and other kinds of records,g a,and may inspect a dealer inventory or records without reasonable cause for a warrant,subject to other limitations,g b.
we first review hosford second amendment challenges.a well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.const.amend.ii.for centuries,the second amendment received minimal judicial interpretation.
then,in district of columbia heller,the supreme court determined that the second amendment protects an individual right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.id.at.the court held unconstitutional the district of columbia ban on possession of handguns in the home and its requirement that all firearms in the home be stored in a manner that rendered them inoperable for immediate.id.
but the court underscored that heller was not meant to clarify the entire field of second amendment jurisprudence.id.it further emphasized that heller should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.id.at.in a footnote,the court identified these kinds of prohibitions as presumptively lawful regulatory measures.id.at.
since heller,courts have endeavored to establish what conduct the second amendment protects and what burdens on that conduct are constitutionally justifiable.the fourth circuit has adopted a inquiry for second amendment challenges.first,the court must ask whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the second amendment guarantee.united states chester,cir.quoting united states marzzarella,cir.if it does not,then the law comports with the second amendment.but if the challenged regulation does burden conduct within the scope of the second amendment as historically understood,the court must apply an appropriate form of scrutiny.id.at.
against this backdrop,hosford raises both facial and second amendment challenges to the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing.we consider each in turn.
we first examine hosford facial challenge.to succeed in a facial constitutional challenge,a movant must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.united states salerno.because of this stringent standard,a facial challenge is perhaps the most difficult challenge to mount successfully.id.and while courts generally engage in the analysis for facial second amendment challenges,our precedent simplifies that analysis for prohibitions deemed presumptively lawful in heller.
in united states moore,cir,this court found the federal prohibition against possession of firearms by felons facially constitutional because it was identified in heller as presumptively lawful.id.at.according to this court,the supreme court identification of longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons as presumptively lawful streamlined the analysis.id.at.it is unclear to us whether heller was suggesting that longstanding prohibitions such as these were historically understood to be valid limitations on the right to bear arms or did not violate the second amendment for some other reason.id.at quoting chester,at see also marzzarella,at.but either reasoning demonstrated that these presumptively lawful prohibitions were facially constitutional,because they could be constitutionally applied.moore,at.
the same reasoning applies here.hosford facial challenge fails if the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing is the type of regulation deemed presumptively lawful in heller.there may be debate as to whether the supreme court called presumptively lawful all laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,or only longstanding laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.heller,at.but we need not parse that language here the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing is a longstanding condition or qualification on the commercial sale of arms and is thus facially constitutional.
first,the regulation covers only the commercial sale of firearms.it affects only those who regularly sell firearms,not owned for personal use,in the course of trade or business for the principal purpose of profit.it explicitly excludes the vast majority of noncommercial sales,such as sales from one own personal collection,sales meant to enhance one hobby,and infrequent sales or exchanges.
second,the regulation imposes a mere condition or qualification.though framed as a prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing,the law is in fact a requirement that those who engage in the commercial sale of firearms obtain a license.a prospective dealer who wishes to obtain a license need only submit an application,be at least years old,pay a fee,and establish lawful premises for selling firearms.a,d.neither the application procedure nor the fee are so prohibitive as to turn this condition or qualification into a functional prohibition.ass of firearms retailers city of chicago,supp,finding that city ordinances allowing firearm sales and transfers only outside city limits were a functional ban on firearm acquisition teixeira county of alameda,cir.noting that if no unincorporated area of county qualifies under zoning requirement that firearm retailers must be feet from certain establishments,zoning requirement may be functional ban on firearm stores.
and lastly,this prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing is longstanding.federal appellate courts have only recently begun to establish how old a firearm regulation must be to be longstanding.and no court has previously examined whether the prohibition at issue here is longstanding.but a review of similar cases establishes that the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing is of similar age to other longstanding firearm regulations,and is thus also longstanding.
the third circuit found new jersey permit requirement for possessing handguns longstanding new jersey established its permit requirement in and first required permits for only concealable handguns in.drake filko,cir.the circuit noted that the supreme court found prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons to be longstanding although states did not start to enact th ose prohibitions until the early century.heller district of columbia,cir.see also kevin marshall,why ca martha stewart have a gun,harv.pub.pol y,noting that bans on possession of firearms by felons not passed in any state other than new york until,and not passed in states with constitutional provisions until.and the circuit found that washington,requirement,first passed in,was longstanding,even though some states first regulated the possession of handguns in or,and those laws required less of the purchaser.see heller,at see also,stat,requiring purchasers of pistols in district of columbia to give seller basic personal identifying information haw.sess.laws,same.
licensing requirements for dealers have been around for as long as these laws,if not longer.the federal government first required dealers to obtain licenses in,nearly eighty years ago.federal firearms act,pub,stat,repealed replaced with gun control act of,pub,stat.and some states required licenses for dealers even earlier thus,the federal progenitor of the law at issue was passed decades before the requirements examined by the third circuit and circuit.and licensing requirements on dealers have existed at least as long as regulations on the possession of handguns.
for these reasons,the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing is a longstanding condition or qualification on the commercial sale of firearms.as a result,hosford facial second amendment challenge fails.
even if a statute is facially constitutional,the phrase presumptively lawful regulatory measures suggests the possibility that one or more of these longstanding regulations could be unconstitutional in the face of an challenge.chester,at quoting united states williams,cir.we thus now turn to hosford challenge.
as stated above,this court has established a analysis for second amendment challenges whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the second amendment guarantee,and if so,whether the challenged law survives an appropriate form of scrutiny.chester,at.but even when applying this analysis,we are at liberty to assume that a challenged statute burdens conduct protected by the second amendment and focus instead on whether the burden is constitutionally justifiable.woollard gallagher,cir.w e are not obliged to impart a definitive ruling at the first step of the chester inquiry.and indeed,we and other courts of appeals have sometimes deemed it prudent to instead resolve challenges to firearm prohibitions at the second step.because we can resolve the statute constitutionality on the inquiry second prong,we also find it prudent in this case to assume,without holding,that the federal prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing burdens conduct protected by the second amendment.
we first must determine what level of scrutiny applies.the right to bear arms,after all,is not unlimited.heller,at.even as historically and traditionally understood,citizens do not have the right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.id.
in united states masciandaro,cir,this court held that laws burdening core second amendment conduct receive strict scrutiny,while less severe burdens receive only intermediate scrutiny.id.at.we noted that core second amendment conduct includes the fundamental right to possess firearms for within the home.but a considerable degree of uncertainty remains as to the scope of that right beyond the home id.at.a s we move outside the home,firearm rights have always been more limited,because public safety interests often outweigh individual interests in self defense.id.at.thus,less severe burdens on the right,laws that merely regulate rather than restrict,and laws that do not implicate the central concern of the second amendment,may be more easily justified.id.at quoting chester,at.
here,even assuming that the prohibition implicates conduct protected by the second amendment,the prohibition does not touch on the second amendment core protections.individuals remain free to possess firearms for.individuals also remain free to purchase or sell firearms owned for personal,use.the law merely imposes a licensing requirement on those who wish to profit by regularly selling firearms outside of their personal collection it serves,not as a prohibition,but as a condition or qualification.the law,therefore,regulates rather than restricts,addresses only conduct occurring outside the home,and does not touch on concerns.it is thus subject to intermediate scrutiny.
to satisfy intermediate scrutiny,the government must show that there is a reasonable fit between the challenged regulation and a substantial government objective.chester,at quoting bd.of trs.of state of fox.
the government enacted the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing,alongside myriad other firearm regulations,because the ease with which firearms could be obtained contributed significantly to the prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the united states.huddleston united states,citing,at.the government interest is,therefore,to c ur b crime by keeping firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age,criminal background,or incompetency.id.
such interests in public safety and preventing crime are indisputably substantial governmental interests.see woollard,at.the question then is whether there is a reasonable fit between the prohibition against unlicensed firearm dealing and the government objectives.
