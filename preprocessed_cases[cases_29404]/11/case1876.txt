cke requested a judicial declaration that ingestion of its food products does not pose any significant risk of causing cancer or reproductive harm in humans that cke is not required to provide any proposition warnings and that cke is in compliance with proposition.
special motion to strike 
respondents filed a special motion to strike cke declaratory relief action under section.they contended the filing of the proposition notice was an exercise of free speech,a protected activity,and cke could not establish the probability that it would prevail on its action for declaratory relief.
in its opposition to the motion,cke argued that its declaratory relief action did not arise from any protected activity.it claimed that the statute does not apply to declaratory relief actions and that analytical testing confirms that there is no detectable amount of naphthalene in any of the food products,thus there was no violation of proposition.it contended that the complaint did not challenge the sufficiency of the proposition notice or seek to enjoin respondents from filing a lawsuit.
attached to the opposition was the declaration of scot wilson,counsel for cke.he visited a carl restaurant near his office in newport beach and ordered six orders each of french fries,crisscut fries,onion rings and fried zucchini.he immediately drove to west coast analytical service,wcas in santa fe springs,california,where the food samples were tested.

also attached to the opposition was the declaration of james coughlin,an expert in the regulatory,nutritional and toxicological evaluation of chemicals in food products and the environment.coughlin declared that he reviewed the test results produced by shelton,along with other scientific reports,and concluded that the food products do not expose california consumers to any detectable amount of alone an amount of naphthalene that exceeds the nsrl under proposition.
richard fortman,executive vice president of operations for cke,declared that he had reviewed the declarations and concluded that the food products do not expose consumers to any level of naphthalene in violation of proposition in addition,he stated that his marketing data reflects that cke customers do not consume more than a single large size order per day of any one of the four food products,so they are not exposed to unsafe levels of naphthalene.
respondents filed a reply to cke opposition.attached was the declaration of toxicologist harry louis skalsky.he reviewed a laboratory analysis of cke food products,as well as the declaration of james coughlin.skalsky concluded that there is a concentration of micrograms of naphthalene per kilogram of food products.the average individual ingests grams of the food product per day.this results in a daily exposure of amount exceeding the proposition nsrl of micrograms per day.
trial court ruling 
the trial court issued an order after hearing,granting respondents motion to strike.it concluded that the declaratory relief action arose from the exercise of a protected activity and that cke had failed to meet its evidentiary burden.the test results on a small amount of food from a single store were insufficient to sustain a judgment that cke is in compliance with proposition regarding naphthalene.the court rejected cke argument that the statute is inapplicable to a pure declaratory relief action,noting that the supreme court had expressly declined to decide that issue in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn,d,equilon.
