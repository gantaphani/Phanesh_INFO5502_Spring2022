the,rwb services,llc,says that the defendants misappropriated used cameras in which it had security interests and then resold the cameras as new to.in the district court,the vessels for this allegation were a number of claims and one civil count under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,c the latter of which forms the basis of this appeal.below,the defendants moved to dismiss the rico count under rule b,arguing that the plaintiff lacked the requisite standing and,as a result,the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.the district court agreed,dismissed the rico claim,and remanded the remaining claims to the circuit court of cook county.this appeal resulted,and for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
background 
the allegations in this case stem from a commercial lending agreement originally entered into between rwb services and a company called old argus in.the agreement was for the purchase and sale of cameras.under the terms of the agreement,old argus would secure the sale of a number of cameras to a particular retailer,in this case.after being notified of the sale,rwb services would purchase the needed number of cameras from vendors on old argus behalf,and old argus would then deliver the cameras to and receive payment from.the proceeds from these sales would go into a bank account held by a special purpose entity,wip marketing,created for purposes of the lending arrangement.rwb services would then draw down old argus debt from this account.to ensure that this would happen,rwb services retained a security interest in all of wip marketing assets including,specifically,the purchased cameras.
with one minor hitch the parties followed this process the first time through,and on june,rwb services loaned old argus an additional to purchase another set of cameras.unbeknownst to rwb services,however,storm clouds had gathered over old argus general ledger,and shortly after agreeing to the second round of financing,old argus entered into an assignment for the benefit of creditors,with a company called rally capital services,llc as the assignee.after allegedly chasing off two other bidders rally capital eventually sold all of old argus assets for approximately million to another defendant,hartford computer group.as part of the sale,hartford agreed to collect old argus existing receivables but was expressly precluded from obtaining any interest in the wip marketing inventory or any of the cameras funded by rwb services.all moneys owed for the cameras were to go to rwb services,as were,importantly,any returned cameras.
it is what followed that resulted in this case.rwb services alleges that hartford and its anthony graffia senior and up a scheme to defraud old argus former customers.for any number of reasons,retailers like will return cameras to their distributors customers may return unwanted but functioning cameras or there could be something wrong with the camera itself.when this happened under old argus watch,old argus would give its customer a credit for any returned cameras,which the customer could then draw from in making future purchases.when hartford took over old argus assets,there were a number of returned cameras from that old argus still had in its possession.rwb services alleges that,rather than return these cameras to rwb services as required,hartford instead repackaged and then resold them to as new.in addition,it claims that hartford both told to pay amounts owed for kept cameras directly to than to rwb took possession of returned cameras from than send them to rwb services as promised.rwb services claims that hartford sold repackaged cameras as new.
realizing that the faucet of payments for its loan had dried,rwb services demanded payment from hartford,a request that hartford refused.rwb services claims that this scheme of repackaging cameras and selling them as new continued apace through at least march,involving both its cameras and those of others.that month,hartford transferred most of its assets to a new company,impero electronics,which rwb services alleges was a shell for the graffias.impero allegedly continued on with hartford alleged scheme,repackaging different brands of returned cameras as new.
rwb services initially filed suit against hartford,impero,rally capital services,and the graffias in.in january,rwb services filed its fourth amended verified complaint,which added to the nine claims a new one alleging a rico violation against the graffias,hartford,and impero.the defendants removed the case to the northern district of illinois.and on august,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,reasoning that rwb services had failed to show standing to sue under rico.the basis for its jurisdiction was the federal rico claim,and,after this claim fell,the court relinquished supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the civil rico cause of action arises under c,which provides 
any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.
as is relevant here,this cause of action requires rwb services to adequately plead three things an injur y in its business or property by reason of the defendants violation of section.see c.the district court held that rwb services failed at step two,a decision we review de novo,accepting any factual allegations that rwb services has properly pled.see vicom,harbridge merchant svces,cir.
rwb services alleged in its pleadings that its injury arose because it was deprived of its property which defendants stole or obtained by fraud and then fraudulently resold as new.when hartford purchased old argus assets,the sale expressly excluded rwb services cameras.nonetheless,hartford kept the returned cameras sent back from and then resold them as new.as a result,rwb services property was thus injured when hartford converted these cameras to use in its purportedly fraudulent scheme.
in addition to its injury,rwb services alleged that the defendants had violat ed,specifically sections c and d.section c makes it 
unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
c.and section d makes it unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any other subsection of section.d.in rwb services estimation,the graffias both operated an enterprise involved in interstate,then a pattern of racketeering activity,c and conspired to do the same,d.
to prove the pattern of racketeering activity,rwb services pointed to the violation of five of the statutes laid out or referenced in as predicate acts the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act,ilcs mail fraud wire fraud bank fraud and the interstate transportation of stolen or fraudulently obtained property.four of these acts relate to the scheme to defraud by selling repackaged cameras as new,consisting of the three claims of fraud and one of deceptive trade practices under illinois law.the other act alleges the transportation of stolen or fraudulently obtained property across state lines,an act that relates to rwb services loss of its cameras.the parties do not dispute here that rwb services has properly pled a violation of section.
the question on appeal is instead whether rwb services showed that its injury occurred by reason of this alleged violation.such a showing proves the plaintiff standing and is thus jurisdictional.gagan american cablevision,cir.and to make it,the plaintiff must prove,among other things,that the pattern of racketeering activity both factually and proximately caused its injur y.holmes securities investor protection,d.the district court held that rwb services had failed to show either.as for factual or but for causation,the district court pointed to a gap in rwb
