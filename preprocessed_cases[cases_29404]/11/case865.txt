the plaintiffs sued volvo for breach of dealership agreements that each of the plaintiffs had entered into with samsung,volvo predecessor.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants because the dealership agreements contained clauses permitting termination without cause.the plaintiffs appeal and we affirm the judgment except for one statutory claim brought by one plaintiff.for that claim,we vacate the judgment and remand.
between and,each of the plaintiffs entered into dealer agreements with samsung corporate entities either samsung america,or samsung construction equipment america corporation or samsung construction equipment company,all of which we will refer to as samsung to become authorized dealers of certain samsung products in designated territories.following the lead of the parties,we will refer to the plaintiffs as the samsung dealers.the samsung products covered by the contracts are listed sometimes specifically as excavators,wheel loaders,crawler dozers,rubber tired loaders and hydraulic excavators,and sometimes generally as samsung construction equipment for sale in north america or samsung heavy equipment or even all products.in one instance,the contract fails to mention the products covered.in general,though,the contracts make clear that the samsung dealers were authorized to sell samsung construction equipment.
in,an affiliate of volvo construction equipment north america,volvo acquired samsung worldwide construction equipment business.as a result,volvo assumed samsung contractual rights and responsibilities,including the dealer agreements.volvo had an existing dealership network for similar construction equipment and eventually decided to terminate some of samsung dealership agreements.in,volvo began contacting the samsung dealers to negotiate terminations of the dealer agreements.volvo sent the samsung dealers notices that they were terminated or were going to be terminated within sixty days pursuant to the termination without cause provision that is included in each of the dealer agreements.by june,all but two of the dealer agreements at issue here had been terminated.the remaining two were terminated on november,and december.
the samsung dealers took exception to the terminations,claiming that they had been promised they would not be terminated so long as they were performing adequately.they sued volvo in arkansas state court claiming breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing violations of the illinois franchise disclosure act all of the dealer agreements contained an illinois provision violations of the arkansas franchise practices act violation of the texas farm,industrial and outdoor power equipment dealer act violation of the texas deceptive trade protection act violations of the maine franchise law for power equipment machinery and appliances violations of a montana statute that prohibits grantors from terminating dealership agreements without good cause tortious interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage misappropriation unjust enrichment estoppel and,for good measure,recoupment.volvo settled with the only plaintiff and then removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas.the district court then granted volvo motion to transfer the case to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.volvo subsequently moved for summary judgment.
the district court granted the motion in its entirety.the court first noted that its jurisdiction rested solely on diversity.although a court sitting in diversity normally applies the rules of the state in which it sits,when a case has been transferred from another district,the court instead applies the rules that the court in the transferring state would apply.see van dusen barrack,d.in this case,the district court noted,an arkansas provision governed.arkansas law provides that the parties to a multistate transaction may choose their own law so long as it bears a reasonable relation to the transaction.arkansas appliance distrib.tandy electronics.stat.ann.the parties here chose to apply the law of illinois.at the time the parties signed the contract,samsung construction equipment america corporation was an illinois company with its principal place of business in illinois.samsung construction equipment company was a division of samsung america,which was a new jersey corporation with its principal place of business in illinois.the plaintiffs in this diversity suit,of course,are all citizens of other states and foreign jurisdictions.although the contracts were later assigned to volvo,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in north carolina,the contracts bore a sufficient connection to illinois at the time they were executed to uphold the choice of illinois law.there is no evidence,for example,that samsung sought to apply the law of illinois in order to avoid some less favorable law in a state more connected to the transactions.see tandy,at,at.the district court remarked that much of the training and support provided to the samsung dealers took place in illinois,providing an additional connection to the state.therefore,as the district court did,we will apply the law of illinois to the contracts.
at the time volvo sought to terminate the dealer agreements,five of the seven contracts had already expired under their own terms.the district court found that for the five expired contracts,the parties either continued to operate under the terms of the original agreements or the relationships became terminable at will.in either case,the court held,volvo had a right to terminate the relationships without cause.the court rejected the samsung dealers attempt to apply the illinois franchise disclosure act the ifda to the contracts.the ifda provides that franchises may not be terminated without cause,and that parties may not waive this protection in their contracts.see ilcs.the court found that the ifda did not apply because by its own terms it was limited in application to franchises located within the state of illinois,and none of the franchises here were in illinois.the court also declined to apply the ifda because to do so would allow a general provision to trump a specific contradictory term of a contract between sophisticated parties.similarly,the provision of the ifda did not help the samsung dealers,according to the court,because it applied only to dealerships located within the state.
the district court rejected the samsung dealers claim that volvo breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by terminating the dealerships without cause because the contracts provided that the agreements could be so terminated.to hold otherwise,the court stated,would allow an implied covenant to replace an express contractual term.no relief was available for the samsung dealers because that relief is available only when there is no express contract between the parties.the claim that volvo tortiously interfered with its own relationship with the samsung dealers failed,according to the district court,because a party can not tortiously interfere with its own contracts.to the extent the samsung dealers were claiming volvo tortiously interfered with the dealers relationships with their customers,the district court held that the claim could not survive summary judgment.one of the elements of tortious interference is that the defendant must act without justification to induce a breach of contract.the court found that volvo merely passed on truthful information to the samsung dealers customers,and that supplying truthful information did not qualify as an unjustified act.the court did not specifically rule on the claims related to franchise laws in the states where particular plaintiffs resided,but granted summary judgment as to all claims.the samsung dealers appeal.
on appeal,the samsung dealers maintain that the ifda applies to them even though they are located outside of illinois.they argue that the ifda invalidates the termination without cause provisions in each of their contracts,and that the terminations violated the ifda.they also contend that the provisions do not void the additional protections available in the states where some of the franchises are located.in particular,they ask us to apply the law of texas,maine and montana,which each prohibit dealers from waiving statutory protections.the samsung dealers urge us to find that the terms of the contracts consisted not only of the writings submitted here but also include oral promises,implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing,and the course of dealing among the parties over the course of the relationships.the samsung dealers defend their claims for unjust enrichment and recoupment as allowable pleadings in the alternative.finally,they maintain that their claims for tortious interference were improperly dismissed.
we begin by addressing whether the protections of the ifda are available to the samsung dealers.the dealers are anxious to apply this statute because it prohibits terminations of franchises without cause.see ilcs.the dealers point out that each contract contained a clause specifying that the contracts would be construed and interpreted in accordance with the law of the state of illinois.the ifda is a provision of illinois law but,by its own terms,the ifda applies only to franchises located within the state of illinois.the dealers are located in texas,maine,montana,new york,alberta and saskatchewan.relying on the restatement second of conflict of laws,the samsung dealers argue that the provision requires the application of the substantive portions of the ifda to the agreements but not the limitations related to territorial scope 
in the absence of a contrary indication of intention,the reference is to the local law of the state of the chosen law.
the commentary of that section further clarifies 
the reference,in the absence of a contrary indication of intention,is to the local law of the chosen state and not to the that state law,which means the totality of its law including its rules.when they choose the state which is to furnish the law governing the validity of their contract,the parties almost certainly have the local law rather than the law of that state in mind.
commentary.because the parties expressed no contrary intention,the samsung dealers maintain that they meant to invoke the substantive protections of the ifda but not its territorial limitation,which they characterize as procedural and falling outside the bounds of local law.
we agree with volvo that the commentary to section does not exclude territorial limitations from its definition of local law rather,the commentary excludes only rules from local law.a number of courts have held that a state territorial limitations apply even when that state law is selected for application by a provision.for example,the sixth circuit considered the applicability of the ifda to a contract between an illinois franchisor and an ohio franchisee.highway equip.caterpillar,cir.the agreement in that case designated illinois law as the parties law of choice.the court noted that the illinois supreme court had stated it would not give extraterritorial effect to illinois statutes unless the legislature expressly directed it to do so.graham general grant post.when the illinois legislature the ifda in,it added a provision limiting application of the law to franchises located within illinois.the sixth circuit understood that amendment as confirmation that the legislature intended to protect illinois residents only and therefore declined to apply the ifda extraterritorially even to an agreement requiring the application of illinois law.caterpillar,at.
similarly,the fourth circuit refused to apply new york regulatory law to a distributor agreement that contained a new york provision.peugeot motors of america,eastern auto distributors,cir,cert.denied,d.the regulatory law was limited by its own terms to distributors who sell or distribute in this state.at.the distributor had never done business in new york.the court concluded that the regulations could not be applied to the distributor contract even though the agreement specified that new york law would apply.instead the court turned to new york common law to interpret the contract at issue.at.
we faced a similar issue regarding the application of wisconsin fair dealership law wfdl to a contract that prohibited product sales in wisconsin.generac caterpillar,cir.the contract contained a clause providing that it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the state of illinois.at.the company producing the products was based in wisconsin and had made substantial investments in wisconsin to allow it to manufacture products for sale and distribution elsewhere.although the company had invested in infrastructure in wisconsin,a quirk in the contract prohibited sales in wisconsin.the company nonetheless sought to bring a case under the wfdl.in deciding that case,we remarked 
we know of nothing that would prevent the wisconsin legislature from announcing a particular choice of law rule for dealership cases in duly enacted legislation.that,in fact,is what the legislature has done.the wfdl specifies who can take advantage of its protections through its definitions of the terms dealer and dealership,and thus obviates the need to resort to general choice of law principles.
caterpillar,at.we therefore looked to the law itself rather than to general choice of law rules to determine if the legislature meant for it to apply.because the statute defined dealer to mean a person who is a grantee of a dealership situated in this state,we held that the protections of the wfdl were available only to dealerships that do business within the geographic confines of the states of wisconsin.this holding was bolstered by the fact that we had previously concluded that the wisconsin supreme court would not construe the wfdl to apply extraterritorially and that therefore a dealer seeking relief under that statute could not recover damages for lost sales arising out of the termination of dealerships.at.
we are inclined to agree with this line of reasoning.the plain language of the illinois law that the samsung dealers seek to apply excludes those same dealers from its coverage because they are located outside of illinois.nothing in the restatement suggests a contrary result.the restatement excludes from local law only the rules of the state,not any territorial limitations contained in the statute.the samsung dealers paradoxically argue that the application of the ifda is required,not by the law of illinois,but rather by the intention of the parties.this is a circle from which the samsung dealers can not successfully emerge.if they insist as they must,because the contract chooses illinois law that illinois law applies,then we must look to the law of illinois to determine the scope of application.the ifda limits its scope to franchises located within the state,and the samsung dealers may not claim its protections.
certain of the samsung dealers claim additional protections from the franchise laws of the states in which they are located.texas,maine and montana prohibit dealers from waiving those states statutory protections against termination without cause.citing section of the restatement second of conflict of laws,the samsung dealers argue that a party choice of a certain state law does not preclude the application of statutory protections within that party own state if enforcement of the chosen state law would be contrary to the express public policy of the state law that would otherwise apply.we considered a similar claim in ricoh,cir.was an indiana company that entered into a franchise agreement with a franchisor incorporated in new york with its principal place of business in new jersey.the contract specified that new york law would govern the agreement.when ricoh refused to renew the agreement after it expired by its own terms,brought a claim under the indiana franchise laws.indiana law,like illinois law,prohibits terminations without good cause,and also prohibits waiver of its protections.indeed,the indiana statute prohibits limiting litigation brought for breach of the franchise agreement in any manner whatsoever.at.ricoh claimed economic as the good cause required by the statute,and also argued that new york rather than indiana law should apply under the contractual provision.
we deferred to the district court finding that indiana had a strong public policy against allowing contractual provisions to control the applicability of its laws to indiana franchises.but indiana law,following the restatement,permits state public policy to override contractual only if the state has a materially greater interest in the litigation than the contractually chosen state.at.thus,for the indiana public policy to control the choice of law,indiana must have a materially greater interest in the litigation than does new york.at.we concluded that indiana in fact had a materially greater interest in the litigation than new york because the franchisee was incorporated and located in indiana,the witnesses and documents relevant to the claims were located in indiana,the contract negotiations occurred in indiana,and the contract was,in part,performed in indiana.id.new york only connection to the litigation was that the defendant was incorporated there.we concluded that,because indiana had a materially greater interest than new york,and because the application of new york law would be contrary to a fundamental indiana policy,indiana franchise law should govern.
before the district court,volvo argued that the texas and montana statutes did not apply because the type of equipment covered by the contracts does not come under those statutes protections.volvo did not argue in the court below that the maine statute did not apply to the equipment at issue.instead,volvo contended before the district court that,even if those statutes applied to the contracts in question,it had good cause to terminate the dealerships as that term is defined by the texas,maine and montana statutes.on appeal,volvo argues for all three states that the statutes do not apply to the equipment covered by the contracts,and that even if they did apply,volvo had good cause for the terminations.for reasons that are unclear from the record,the district court did not address whether texas,maine and montana law would override the provision in the contracts with franchisees located in those states.
there are three distinct questions here that must be answered.first,we must determine whether the texas,maine and montana franchise statutes apply to the equipment at issue here.second,using the analysis we set out in the ricoh case,we must determine whether the states of texas,maine and montana evinced a public policy against allowing provisions to control the applicability of those states franchise laws to the contracts at issue.if they did demonstrate that public policy,we must determine whether those states have a materially greater interest in the litigation than the contractually chosen state of illinois.third,we must determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding volvo asserted good cause for the terminations.if the statutes do not cover the equipment detailed in the contracts,there is no need to proceed to the second and third questions,and so we will begin there.
the texas statute in question is titled farm,industrial,and outdoor power equipment dealer agreements.texas bus.ann.vernon.the law specifies in relevant part 
equipment means farm tractors,farm implements,utility tractors,industrial tractors,and outdoor power equipment and the attachments to or the repair parts for those items.
outdoor power equipment means any machinery operated by an engine or electric power and used in landscaping or cultivation of land for purposes,and includes law and garden implements.
texas bus.ann.vernon.three of the samsung dealers are texas corporations with their principal places of business in texas.they are cromeens,holloman,sibert,cisco ford equipment cisco,and.cisco dealer agreement with samsung specifies the products covered by the agreement as cr.excavators,wheel loaders,and crawler dozers.both and dealer agreements cover samsung construction equipment for sale in north america.when we compare the products listed in the contracts with the equipment covered by the statute,we must conclude that the texas statute was not intended to apply to the types of dealerships held by the samsung dealers in texas.the products are clearly construction equipment and not the farm equipment contemplated by the texas statute.we conclude that the texas samsung dealers were not entitled to the protections of the texas law.for that reason,we need not engage in the analysis set forth in ricoh for the texas dealers.
we turn next to montana.the statute there is titled termination,cancellation,nonrenewal,or substantial alteration of farm implements dealership agreements.ann.on reviewing the title,it should be no surprise that the statute covers dealership agreements for farm implements 
farm implement means any vehicle,machine or attachment designed or adapted and used exclusively for agricultural operations and only incidentally operated or used on the highways.
ann.only one of the samsung dealers is a montana corporation,performance machinery company pmc.pmc dealer agreement specifies that the products covered by the agreement are samsung heavy equipment.the samsung dealers maintain that some of the products that pmc purchased from samsung were sold to farmers other agricultural operators for the exclusive use of digging irrigation ditches in farming fields,and for use in platting land for agricultural use.they maintain that these sales bring the equipment within the definition of farm implement in the montana statute.we agree with volvo that the use by some farmers of some of the equipment can not convert construction equipment into farm implements.the statute specifies that the equipment must be designed and used exclusively for agricultural operations.at best,the samsung dealers claim only that some of the construction equipment was used incidentally for farming purposes.because the montana statute does not apply to pmc dealer agreement,we once again forego the ricoh conflict of law analysis.
that leaves maine.fms,fms is a samsung dealer incorporated in maine and with its principal place of business in maine.the maine statute is much broader than those of texas or montana,and it may be for this reason that volvo did not argue before the district court that the maine statute did not apply to the equipment at issue.instead,volvo argued that even if the maine law applied,volvo had good cause to terminate the dealership.the maine statute is titled franchise laws for power equipment,machinery and appliances.the products covered by the maine statute are 
residential,recreational,agricultural,farm,commercial or business equipment,machinery or appliances that use electricity,gas,wood,a petroleum product or a derivative of a petroleum product for operation.
samsung contract with fms covers all samsung construction equipment for sale in north america.
recall that volvo failed to raise its claim that the maine statute did not apply to the equipment at issue in the court below until its reply brief on summary judgment.instead,volvo argued that,even if the maine law applied,it had good cause to terminate the agreement.the samsung dealers contend that volvo has waived the issue on appeal,citing schoenfeld apfel,cir.there we held that issues not raised before the district court are waived on appeal.but volvo did not completely fail to raise the issue it merely raised it late.because volvo raised the applicability of the maine statute in its reply brief,the district court was entitled to find that volvo waived the issue.as we noted previously,for reasons not apparent from the record,the district court never ruled on the applicability of the texas,montana and maine statutes.on appeal,the samsung dealers raised the applicability of the maine law in their opening brief.although the district court was entitled to deem the issue waived below,the samsung dealers have waived waiver by raising the issue here and addressing it substantively.riemer illinois of,cir.volvo is therefore entitled to respond at this stage of the proceedings.
the very materials upon which volvo relies support the samsung dealers position.both the legislative history of the maine statute and the single case cited by volvo acknowledge that,although the law was initially written to protect snowmobile dealers,the legislature greatly expanded the statute to protect franchisees selling any electric or equipment,machinery or appliance with an exception not relevant here.see rolec,finlay hydrascreen usa,maine legislature,reg.session,comm.amend.a,at.the maine statute is broad enough to encompass samsung construction equipment for sale in north america.therefore,we must address the conflict of law question and determine whether maine has articulated a strong public policy against allowing provisions to prevail over state statutes,and whether maine public policy interest is substantially greater than illinois interest in the outcome of the case.if we answer both of those question in the affirmative,we must consider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding volvo argument that it terminated the fms dealership for good cause.
maine public policy can best be determined not by the varying opinions of laymen,lawyers,or judges as to the demands of the interest of the public,but rather,by its constitution and statutes,and,when cases arise concerning a matter upon which they are silent,by its judicial decisions and the constant practice of the government officials.the policy must be well defined and dominant and may not be gleaned from general consideration of supposed public interests.american home assurance stone,cir citations and internal quote marks omitted.the state of maine has rendered this task exceedingly easy for us.one section of the maine franchise law is titled public policy.
a contract or part of a contract or activity undertaken pursuant to a contract in violation of this chapter is deemed against public policy and is void and unenforceable.
under the section titled prohibited conduct,we learn that it is unlawful for a manufacturer such as volvo or samsung 
to cancel,terminate,fail to renew or refuse to continue a franchise relationship with a distributor or dealer,notwithstanding the terms,provisions or conditions of an agreement or franchise or the terms or provisions of a waiver,unless a manufacturer 
has satisfied the notice requirement of section 
has acted in good faith as defined in this chapter and 
has good cause for the cancellation,termination,nonrenewal or noncontinuance or 
to terminate,fail to renew or refuse to continue any franchise relationship with a distributor or dealer,notwithstanding the terms,provisions or conditions of an agreement or franchise or the terms or provisions of a waiver,without good cause.the manufacturer has good cause for a termination,cancellation,nonrenewal or noncontinuance as follows.
failure by the distributor or dealer to comply with a provision of the franchise agreement that is reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship when the manufacturer first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the failure not more than days before the date on which written notification is given pursuant to section is good cause.
if the failure by the distributor or dealer,as set forth in subparagraph,relates to the performance by the distributor or dealer in sales or service,then good cause is the failure of the distributor or dealer to carry out effectively the performance provisions of the franchise when 
a the distributor or dealer was notified by the manufacturer in writing of that failure,the notification stated that notice was provided of failure of performance pursuant to this section and the distributor or dealer was given a reasonable opportunity for a period of not less than months to make efforts to carry out the performance provisions 
b the failure continued within the period that began not more than days before the date on which notification of termination,cancellation or nonrenewal was given pursuant to section and 
c the distributor or dealer has not substantially complied with reasonable performance criteria established by the manufacturer and communicated to the distributor or dealer.
there is good cause when the manufacturer and the dealer or distributor agree not to renew the franchise.
there is good cause when the manufacturer discontinues production or distribution of the franchise goods.
the maine statute thus evidences a strong public policy against contracts that violate the franchise law generally.when we review the franchise law,we find that manufacturers may not terminate or fail to renew without good cause notwithstanding the terms,provisions or conditions of an agreement or franchise or the terms or provisions of a waiver.b c.we read this to mean that maine law applies even when contracts purport to waive its protections.maine has thus expressed a strong public policy against allowing provisions to prevail over state statutes,and we must determine whether maine public policy interest is substantially greater than illinois interest in the outcome of the case.again,this is not a difficult assessment.samsung,an original party to the contracts,was located in illinois.samsung transferred all of its interests to volvo.none of the plaintiffs or defendants are citizens of illinois and none of the franchises are located here.maine public policy therefore exceeds illinois interest in the outcome of the case.
this means that fms is entitled to the protections of the maine franchise law.volvo maintains that it had good cause to terminate or fail to renew the agreements.volvo contends that its legitimate business objective of consolidating its distribution network satisfies the good cause standard.volvo also contends that it made a good faith business decision to withdraw excavators and introduce remodeled excavators,another good cause reason to terminate under the maine law.the maine statute provides that t here is good cause when the manufacturer discontinues production or distribution of the franchise goods.the samsung dealers dispute volvo characterization of the withdrawal of samsung products from the market.according to the dealers,volvo made modest improvements to some of the excavators and rebranded them but that the excavators essentially continued to be sold in a form covered by the dealer agreements.the samsung dealers characterize this as a unilateral decision to rebrand the product rather than a discontinuation of production or distribution of the franchised goods.at this stage of the proceedings,we believe there is a genuine factual dispute over whether volvo had good cause to terminate fms,and therefore we vacate and remand as to fms only for trial as to the good cause issue under maine law.
we have now determined that the illinois,texas and montana statutes do not provide any additional protections for the samsung dealers.the maine statute may provide some additional protection to fms,the only franchise plaintiff located in maine,and we are remanding on fms claims as we described above.all that remains,then,are the samsung dealers arguments under the illinois common law of contracts.the samsung dealers urge us to find that there is a material issue of fact regarding the terms of the dealer agreements based on samsung representations to the dealers before,during and after execution of the contracts.in particular,the samsung dealers maintain that the written agreements can not be read in a vacuum but must be supplemented with samsung oral representations and with the course of dealing of the parties over the course of the relationships.the samsung dealers also contend that the contracts were modified by acquiescence in the modification through a course of conduct consistent with acceptance of the changed terms.the dealers point out that volvo continued its relationships with the dealers even after the written documents had expired,including some cases where the agreements expired multiple times.the samsung dealers also continued investing in their dealerships in reliance on promises by volvo that they would be given opportunities to continue as exclusive dealers of volvo equipment if they performed beyond the terms of the written agreements.the samsung dealers charge volvo with breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by terminating the agreements without cause.the dealers argue that even without a for cause term,the expectations of the parties temper volvo discretion in terminating the contracts.they also dispute the district court judgment on their alternative theories of liability grounded in unjust enrichment and recoupment.finally,they argue that their claims for tortious interference should survive summary judgement because they have provided sufficient evidence that volvo was recruiting the dealers customers prior to the contract terminations.some of these arguments are variations on a theme and will be addressed together.we will address the remainder seriatim.
we begin by examining the language of the various dealer agreements,which are identical in all relevant respects 
this agreement may be terminated at any time by either party without cause by giving at least sixty days written notice to the other party of such decision to terminate this agreement.
ex.the samsung dealers do not argue that this paragraph is ambiguous.rather,they insist that it must be read in conjunction with samsung oral assurances that the company would not use this clause unless a dealer was failing to perform adequately.this is a curious position for the samsung dealers to adopt because the next paragraph gives samsung the option to terminate immediately,without notice,if the dealers fail to pay samsung in a timely fashion,or if there are changes in control at the dealerships,or if the dealers breach their obligations to maintain insurance,among other things.the paragraph after that allows the company to unilaterally terminate the agreement on thirty days notice if the dealers fail to meet sales objectives,fail to maintain inventory and services up to samsung expectations,or fail to perform their obligations and duties to customers,ex.these paragraphs thus address the right of samsung to terminate if the dealers are failing to perform adequately.the termination without cause provision would thus be meaningless under the dealers reading.
before we analyze the dealers claims under illinois common law,we will quote other relevant contract language.first,the contract expressly contemplated the expiration of the agreement by its own terms 
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create any express or implied obligation on either party to renew or extend this agreement or,if the dealer is continued as the company dealer,to create any right to continue such relationship on the same terms and conditions contained herein.each party,in its discretion,may determine,for any reason whatsoever,not to renew or extend this agreement or to continue such relationship on the terms and conditions contained herein.
ex.next,the contract addressed what meaning to assign any additional transactions that occurred after the agreement had formally terminated 
the consummation of any transaction of a type covered by this agreement by mutual consent after the expiration or termination thereof shall,unless otherwise agreed in writing,be governed by the applicable provision of this agreement but shall not be construed as reviving this agreement or as in any way modifying the effectiveness of such expiration or prior termination.
ex.the contract also explicitly rejected oral modifications and confined the contract to the terms of the written document 
this agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,whether oral or written.except for changes by the company permitted under this agreement,no amendment or modification of this agreement or any portion thereof shall be valid unless executed in writing by both parties.
ex.finally,the agreement specified that delays or failures in exercising rights were not to be construed as waivers 
neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,or of any other right,power or remedy,nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,power or remedy,preclude any further or other exercise thereof,or the exercise of any other right,power or remedy.
the samsung dealers first line of argument encourages us to use various forms of parol evidence to inform our reading of the dealer agreements.according to the dealers,they asked samsung about the meaning of the termination without cause provision and samsung assured them,before signing and again after signing the contracts,that it had no intention of exercising that option unless the dealers were not performing adequately.do the job,keep the line was the fundamental tenet of the relationship,according to the samsung dealers,and all of the dealers protest that they would not have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the sale of the samsung line but for their reasonable expectation that they would be able to continue their dealerships so long as they adequately performed.in addition to these oral promises,the samsung dealers claim that the contracts also consisted of terms that arose through the course of dealing and custom and usage in the industry.before volvo terminated these dealerships,no dealer had been terminated except for cause,demonstrating that terminations could only be for cause,according to the dealers.the dealers also maintain that the contracts were modified by samsung acquiescence to certain changes in the relationships.in particular,the dealers claim that samsung sale of products to the dealers even after the contracts expired by their own terms demonstrated that the dealers would be allowed to keep the line so long as they adequately performed.in sum,the samsung dealers urge us to find that the contracts were supplemented by oral statements made both before and after the contracts were signed and the conduct of the parties after the contracts were signed.
the interpretation or legal effect of a contract is a question of law to be determined by the court.bowers,chicago mach.tool,d.in interpreting a contract,we may not consider evidence of a prior agreement or contemporary oral agreement that would contradict the written agreement.bowers,at.
an agreement,when reduced to writing,must be presumed to speak the intention of the parties who signed it.it speaks for itself,and the intention with which it was executed must be determined from the language used.it is not to be changed by extrinsic evidence.
western illinois oil thompson.the only exception to this rule is for ambiguous contracts.pioneer trust sav.bank lucky stores,d.extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the true meaning of an ambiguous contract.id.determining whether a contract is ambiguous in the first place is a question of law.a contract is ambiguous only if the language employed is susceptible of different constructions when read in its plain and ordinary meaning.althoff,elgin med,d.thus,before we may consider the samsung dealers extrinsic evidence,we must determine whether the contracts are ambiguous.
on the issue of termination without cause,the dealer agreements are not ambiguous.the contracts each state that the agreement may be terminated at any time by either party without cause by giving at least sixty days written notice to the other party.the language could not be more plain,and the samsung dealers have not suggested any viable alternate meaning.the dealers urge us to find that this provision really means that samsung could terminate only if the dealers were not performing adequately.another provision,however,gives samsung the unilateral power to terminate for nonperformance on thirty days notice.samsung right to terminate without cause on sixty days notice a right which extended to the dealers as well,incidentally must mean what it says or the provision is rendered superfluous.moreover,the contracts themselves provide that they may not be modified orally,and that the written agreement supercedes all prior oral statements.a party is not justified in relying on representations outside of or contrary to the written terms of a contract he or she signs when the signer is aware of the nature of the contract and had a full opportunity to read it.northern trust viii south michigan,d,a party can not close his eyes to the contents of a document and then claim that the other party committed fraud merely because it followed this contract.
conduct does not move the dealers any closer to rewriting the dealer agreements.again,the contract itself contains a waiver clause providing that a failure or delay in exercising a right will not operate as a waiver.that samsung had never terminated a dealer without cause did not preclude volvo from using that provision later.nor does the sale of products to the dealers after some of the dealer agreements had expired by their own terms indicate that the dealers would never be terminated except for cause.again,the contracts provided for the possibility of transactions occurring after expiration,and specified that transactions would be governed by the applicable provisions of the dealer agreement but would not be construed as reviving the agreement or modifying the effectiveness of the termination.the samsung dealers citation to maher quality cabinets,d,is unavailing.that case holds that a contract may be validly modified if the party that did not propose the changes is shown to acquiesce in the modification through a course of conduct consistent with acceptance,at.here the alleged change to the agreements was that they could not be terminated without cause.the change was allegedly brought about by samsung failure to ever terminate a dealer without cause and by samsung continued transactions with dealers after the expiration of some of the agreements.but both of these occurrences were contemplated by the contract and samsung never had a chance to acquiesce to different terms.the change was never proposed by the samsung dealers,and the change contradicted the written contracts.termination without cause was an event that could happen only once for each dealer and thus there could be no course of conduct.samsung was also following the terms of the written agreements when it engaged in transactions with the dealers.on some occasions,samsung signed new agreements with certain dealers when it intended to reinstate a relationship.samsung conduct could not reasonably be interpreted as acquiescence under these circumstances.in sum,we reject the samsung dealers invitation to rewrite the contracts with extrinsic evidence because the contracts are unambiguous.
we address next the samsung dealers claim that volvo breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by terminating the contracts without good cause.every contract contains an implied promise of good faith and fair dealing between the contracting parties.northern trust,at.see also dayan mcdonald,d,a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied into every contract unless expressly disavowed.generally,problems involving the covenant of good faith and fair dealing arise when one party to a contract is given broad discretion in performance.northern trust,at dayan.the covenant requires a party vested with broad discretion to act reasonably and not arbitrarily or in a manner inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties.northern trust,at.illinois courts use the covenant to determine the intent of the parties where a contract is susceptible to two conflicting constructions.id.this is not such a case.
as we discussed above,the contracts very clearly give the right to terminate without cause on sixty days notice to both parties.there is no ambiguity and the provision does not vest a single party with discretion but rather grants both parties the unfettered right to terminate.illinois law holds that parties to a contract are entitled to enforce the terms to the letter and an implied covenant of good faith can not overrule or modify the express terms of a contract.northern trust,at jespersen minnesota mining,d.t he duty of good faith and fair dealing does not override the clear right to terminate at will,since no obligation can be implied which would be inconsistent with and destructive of the unfettered right to terminate at will.jespersen,at.
the samsung dealers rely on dayan for an additional obligation in the case of franchise agreements.the court in dayan was addressing for the first time the illinois common law as it related to termination without cause of franchisees by franchisors.the court noted that a number of other courts had refused to enforce termination without cause provisions in franchise agreements,especially where the franchisor held broad,unilateral powers of termination at will,at.this practice was the result of judicial concern over longstanding abuses in franchise relationships,apparently,and the court found that the then recently passed but not retroactively applicable franchise disclosure act expressed the same public policy that many of these courts had recognized.that is,a franchisor may not terminate a franchisee without good cause.id.the court accepted as good cause for termination any failure by the franchisee to substantially comply with obligations under the agreement,but also noted that good cause turns generally on commercial reasonability.dayan reasoning does not save the samsung dealers claims for a few reasons.first,the cases on which dayan relied dealt with contracts that contained no express provision that the contract could be terminated without good cause.dayan,at.the dealer agreements each contained an express clause allowing termination without cause.second,the dayan court rationale depended in part on the unilateral nature of the franchisor right to terminate without cause,and abuses of that practice.in our case,both the franchisor and the franchisee hold the right to terminate.we have no doubt that if volvo began producing an inferior product,the samsung dealers would be here enforcing their right to terminate the franchise agreements.the clause protected both parties in the event that samsung business was sold.third,later cases in illinois clarify that the duty of good faith and fair dealing can not override an express term of a contract.northern trust,at jespersen,at.in short,volvo can not be held to have breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing for simply enforcing the contracts as written.
the samsung dealers sought relief on grounds in the alternative.they claimed that volvo was unjustly enriched by the dealers substantial investments of time and money in building up business for samsung and subsequently volvo products.they complain that they relied on samsung promises of continued business so long as they performed adequately.as a result of their efforts,the dealers believe that volvo has been unjustly enriched by the product lines that had been developed by the dealers for volvo own dealership network.the dealers also brought a claim for recoupment.the substance of that claim is that the dealers invested considerable resources into the establishment of dealerships for samsung products and volvo then terminated the dealerships without giving the dealers an opportunity to recoup their investment.
the district court granted summary judgment on the samsung dealers claims for unjust enrichment and recoupment on the grounds that,in illinois,relief is available only where there is no express contract between the parties.we agree.relief is available when one party has benefitted from the services of another under circumstances in which,according to the dictates of equity and good conscience,he ought not to retain such benefit.barry mogul,terrestris dev,d.but a plaintiff may not pursue a claim where there is an enforceable,express contract between the parties.wagner excello foods,fearn int l,d,promissory estoppel not available when parties have entered a binding contract on the same subject matter.is not a means for shifting a risk one has assumed under a contract.barry mogul,at quoting industrial lift truck serv.mitsubishi int l,d.the samsung dealers signed an unambiguous contract that gave both parties the right to terminate without cause on sixty days no
