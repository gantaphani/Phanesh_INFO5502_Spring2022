the state of arizona and frederick lindstrom and larry wanger brought this suit under the americans with disabilities act ada,and the arizonans with disabilities act azda,to remedy what they allege are discriminatory accommodations at movie theaters owned by harkins amusement enterprises,and its affiliates harkins.plaintiffs contend that harkins failure to provide open or closed captioning for hearing impaired patrons and audio descriptions of a movie visual elements for visually impaired patrons violates the ada and the azda.the district court granted harkins motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the basis that the ada and the azda do not require movie theaters to alter the content of their services.because closed captioning and audio descriptions are correctly classified as auxiliary aids and services that a movie theater may be required to provide under the ada,we conclude the district court erred in finding that these services are foreclosed as a matter of law.
frederick lindstrom has hearing loss so severe that he can not hear or discriminate speech.because of his hearing loss,lindstrom does not fully appreciate a movie soundtrack.lindstrom alleges that three technologies would allow him to more fully enjoy movies despite his hearing impairment.
the first two technologies employ open captioning,a technique that displays captions on a movie screen for an entire audience.one type of open captioning is achieved by engraving text onto each individual frame of a film.only a limited number of films are engraved with captions.a second method of open captioning uses open caption projection systems,which project captions through a separate projector onto a movie screen.movie theaters may turn open captioning projection systems on or off,depending on whether a patron has requested captions.
the third technology employs closed captioning,a technique that displays captions to individual viewers using a captioning device.one brand of captioning is rear window captioning,which displays captions from a computer disc that is synchronized with a movie.as a movie appears on a theater screen,captions are transmitted to an led data panel installed on the rear wall of a theater,where the text is reversed.patrons use portable,clear reflector panels that make the captions appear superimposed on or beneath the movie screen.there are other captioning systems as well,such as wearable caption displays.
major movie studios distribute a significant number of movies with captions for use with rear window captioning and open caption projection systems.however,accessibility to these services is limited to theaters that have equipment for rear window captioning or open caption projection systems.
larry wanger is totally blind in his right eye and has corrected visual acuity of less than in his left eye.because of his impairment,wanger can not see the visual aspects of a movie.wanger alleges that a technology known as descriptive narration would allow him to appreciate visual aspects of a movie by using a headset.descriptive narration enables people to hear information about key visual aspects of a movie through descriptions of scenery,facial expressions,costumes,action settings,and scene changes during natural pauses in dialogue.major movie studios distribute movies with descriptive narration capability,but accessibility to this service is limited to theaters that have equipment for audio descriptions.
harkins owns and operates theaters with auditoriums in arizona.harkins shows movies with engraved open captioning,but only at limited times at two theater locations.none of harkins arizona theaters have equipment for descriptive narration.
in august,larry wanger visited harkins north valley theaters to see a movie with descriptive narration.a harkins employee informed him that the theater did not have descriptive narration.on december,rachel lindstrom,frederick lindstrom mother,called the box office of north valley theaters to find a captioned showing of king kong.lindstrom was told that there were no showings of king kong or auxiliary aids to display closed captioning at any of the theater auditoriums.
larry wanger and rachel lindstrom,on behalf of her son,filed complaints of public accommodation discrimination with arizona civil rights division.after an investigation,the division found that there was reasonable cause to believe that harkins discriminated against frederick lindstrom and larry wanger by denying full and equal enjoyment of harkins services in violation of the azda.
the state of arizona subsequently filed suit in arizona superior court alleging violations of the azda on behalf of frederick lindstrom,larry wanger,and a putative class of similarly situated persons.lindstrom and wanger also joined the suit as alleging violations of the ada and azda.harkins removed the case to the united states district court for the district of arizona and moved to dismiss the case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion in a published march,order,arizona harkins amusement enterprises,d,which plaintiffs now appeal.
we review de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim.siracusano matrixx initiatives,cir.we accept the plaintiffs allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.dismissal is inappropriate unless plaintiffs complaint fails to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.id.
americans with disabilities act 
congress enacted the ada to provide clear,strong,consistent,enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities b.title iii of the ada prohibits discrimination by public accommodations,prescribing generally that 
no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or leases to,or operates a place of public accommodation.
a.to prevail on a discrimination claim under title iii,a plaintiff must show that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada the defendant is a private entity that owns,leases,or operates a place of public accommodation and the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of his disability.molski cable,cir.the parties do not dispute that plaintiffs lingstrom and wanger are disabled or that harkins owns a place of public accommodation.this appeal centers on whether plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that harkins discriminated against them on account of their disabilities.
title b a iii provides that discrimination by public accommodations includes a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded,denied services,segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services,unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the good,service,facility,privilege,advantage,or accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.
the ada defines auxiliary aids and services 
the term auxiliary aids and services includes 
a qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments 
b qualified readers,taped texts,or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments 
c acquisition or modification of equipment or devices and 
d other similar services and actions.

qualified readers,taped texts,audio recordings,brailled materials,large print materials,or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments 
acquisition or modification of equipment or devices and 
other similar services and actions.
b emphases added.
movie captioning and audio descriptions clearly are auxiliary aids and services.captioning and audio descriptions are effective methods of making aurally or visually delivered materials available to individuals with hearing and visual impairments.a b b see duvall county of kitsap,cir plaintiff survives summary judgment with claim that superior court failed to provide captioning of oral testimony.indeed,open and closed captioning and audio recordings are listed as examples of auxiliary aids and services in the regulations.the district court reasoned that captioning and descriptive narration do not fall within b a iii mandate because,under weyer twentieth century fox film,cir,the scope of the ada prohibition against discrimination under a is limited to the goods and services offered by an entity.harkins,d at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,the ada does not require provision of different goods or services,just nondiscriminatory enjoyment of those that are provided.weyer,at.we now turn to weyer and its bearing on this case.
weyer concerned an insured challenge to her disability insurance policy limit on mental illness benefits that did not similarly limit illness benefits.at.the plaintiff alleged that the insurer and her employer violated the ada by offering and administering a plan that discriminated against those with mental disabilities.id.at.affirming the district court grant of summary judgment,we held that the insurer could not be held liable under title iii because,among other reasons,title iii does not address the terms of policies that the insurer sold.id.at.we reasoned 
title iii prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.the ordinary meaning of this language is that whatever goods or services the place provides,it can not discriminate on the basis of disability in providing enjoyment of those goods and services.this language does not require provision of different goods or services,just nondiscriminatory enjoyment of those that are provided.thus,a bookstore can not discriminate against disabled people in granting access,but need not assure that the books are available in braille as well as print.likewise,an insurance office must be physically accessible to the disabled but need not provide insurance that treats the disabled equally with the.
id.internal quotation marks,brackets,and footnote omitted.we further concluded that the plaintiff title iii claim against her employer,fox,similarly failed 
t here is no discrimination under the act where disabled individuals are given the same opportunity as everyone else,so insurance distinctions that apply equally to all employees can not be discriminatory.fox did not treat weyer any differently because of her disability.it simply gave her the same opportunity that it gave all the rest of its into the group policy with the limitation at the cheaper,group price or buy her own individual insurance coverage without the limitation at whatever the market price may be.
id.at footnote omitted.analogizing from weyer,harkins argues that the ada does not require it to alter the content of its services by offering captions and descriptive narration rather,the ada only requires it to offer all persons equal access to its services.
we disagree with harkins that captioning and descriptive narration fall outside the ada as a matter of law.as stated previously,b a iii provides that discrimination includes a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded,denied services,segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services emphasis added.in arguing that the ada requirement of auxiliary aids and services is limited by weyer,harkins puts the cart before the horse weyer does not limit subsection b a iii requirement that a public accommodation provide auxiliary aids and services the requirement that establishments provide auxiliary aids and services limits weyer general rule that public accommodations do not have to provide different services for the disabled.although weyer may be controlling in the provision of goods and services generally,here plaintiffs are seeking an auxiliary aid,which is specifically mandated by the ada to prevent discrimination of the disabled.
for similar reasons,harkins reliance on mcneil time insurance,cir,is misplaced.in mcneil,the plaintiff purchased a health insurance policy that limited coverage for benefits to during the first two years of the policy.id.at.within the first year of the policy,the plaintiff was diagnosed with aids.id.when the insurance company refused to pay more than of his medical bills,the plaintiff brought suit under title iii of the ada.id.affirming a grant of summary judgment,the fifth circuit held that the plain language of title iii demonstrates that a business is not required to alter or modify the goods or services it offers to satisfy title iii therefore,because the policy offered the same terms to those without aids,the policy limit did not discriminate on the basis of basis of disability.see id.at.
the mcneil court also noted that t he provisions in b a i iii concerning the opportunity to benefit from or to participate in a good or service do not imply that the goods or services must be modified to ensure that opportunity or benefit.rather,this section only refers to impediments that stand in the way of a person ability to enjoy that good or service in the form that the establishment normally provides it.id.at.the district court in this case relied on this passage to reason that b a iii does not require accommodations to offer different services.harkins,d at.
the district court reasoning effectively eliminates the duty of a public accommodation to provide auxiliary aids and services.by its very definition,an auxiliary aid or service is an additional and different service that establishments must offer the disabled.for example,a courthouse that was accessible only by steps could not avoid ada liability by arguing that the wheelchair equal access to the steps.and an office building could not avoid having to put braille numbering on the buttons in its elevator by arguing that the equal access to the written text.although weyer and mcneil support the proposition that the content of a good or service need not be altered under the ada,neither of those decisions turn on whether a place of public accommodation must provide an auxiliary aid or service that falls within the mandate of b a iii.
harkins also contends that regulations promulgated by the department of justice defeat any requirement that harkins provide captioning or descriptive narration.in particular,harkins points to the doj preamble to regulation of on the basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities,which provides commentary on title,part of the code of federal regulations.there,the commentary plainly states that m ovie theaters are not required by to present films.pt,app.b c,at.
plaintiffs dispute that the commentary precludes a court from requiring open captioning through open caption projection systems,which did not exist when the commentary was first published in.plaintiffs cite to two authorities in an effort to distinguish between engraved open captioning and open caption projection systems.the first,a,provides,this part does not require a public accommodation to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods that are designed for,or facilitate use by,individuals with disabilities.plaintiffs argue that the commentary provision concerning open captioning is no longer viable now that open captioning is available through open caption proje
