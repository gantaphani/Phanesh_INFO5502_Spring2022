fedmet resources corporation fedmet appeals a final decision of the court of international trade trade court denying fedmet motion for judgment upon the agency record and affirming the department of commerce final scope determination regarding antidumping and countervailing duty orders covering imports of certain magnesia carbon bricks mcbs from china and mexico.fedmet res.united states,d.int l trade.for the reasons below,we reverse the trade court decision and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
i.the underlying investigations 
on july,resco products,resco filed a petition with the department of commerce commerce requesting initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on imports of certain mcbs from china and mexico.mcbs are a type of refractory brick used to line ladles and furnaces employed in steelmaking and steel handling processes.resco petition proposed that the scope of the investigations be limited to the following 
c ertain chemically bonded resin or pitch,magnesia carbon bricks mcb whose magnesia component contains at least percent magnesia mgo,regardless of the source of raw materials for the mgo,with carbon levels ranging from trace amounts to percent,regardless of enhancements,regardless of whether or not antioxidants are present.the scope of this investigation excludes bricks,bricks and all dolomite class bricks 
joint appendix at footnotes omitted.in proposing that the domestic like product be defined to cover only mcbs,the petition further limited the proposed scope of the investigation by describing mcbs as the product covered by the petition and distinguishing mcbs from other types of refractory bricks 
there are several types of standard refractory bricks in addition to magnesia carbon,the subject of this petition.among the most important are fired magnesite,fired bauxite,magnesia dolomite and magnesia alumin a carbon brick.each of these bricks possess certain unique properties,which make their use highly preferred,and even required,for certain uses in the lining of steel,ceramic,and other furnaces and holding vessels.the different types of bricks are not generally substitutable in a technical sense,due to varying chemical and physical properties and wear characteristics.
id.at emphases added.this language prompted commerce to inquire regarding the proposed scope of the investigation other types of refractory bricks.in particular,as part of its investigation,commerce issued a questionnaire,referring to the subject of the petition as mcb.resco responded to the questionnaire on august.regarding questions and,resco stated 
question.on page of the petitions you state t here are several types of standard refractory bricks in addition to mcb,the subject of this petition.among the most important are fired magnesite,fired bauxite,magnesia dolomite,and magnesia aluminum carbon brick.how does your proposed scope exclude these types of refractory bricks 
answer the scope of our petition focuses only on mcb.these other products do not provide the same performance where mcb are used in steelmaking and steel handling applications.their use or substitution results in significantly lower performance,higher costs and can be disruptive to the steel maker operation.no other system over the last years helped steel makers achieve performance levels in furnace and ladles like mcb,which are used in the most critical and high wear areas of the furnaces and ladles.
question.if necessary based on the response to the questions above,please provide a revised version of the scope of the investigations as it should appear in the federal register.
answer petitioner does not believe it is necessary to revise the scope based on the responses to the questions above.the complete version of the scope of the investigations as it should appear in the federal register is provided in the petition.
id.at emphases added.on august,at commerce request,resco revised its proposed scope language to remove the explicit exclusion of aluminacarbon bricks,bricks and dolomite class bricks.resco confirmed that the exclusion was unnecessary because those three types of bricks do not have the magnesia levels specified by resco.see id.at.
resco continued to reinforce the distinction between mcbs and other types of refractory bricks during the preliminary injury investigation conducted by the united states international trade commission commission.in particular,on august,resco counsel testified before the commission that 
o ther refractory products,such as fired magnesite,fired bauxite,magnesia dolomite,and magnesia alumina graphite bricks,and the subject merchandise do not have the same physical characteristics and uses are not perceived by producers and purchasers as substitutable and are easily differentiated by price.
commerce published notices of initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on august.in the notices,commerce adopted almost all of the language proposed by resco to define the scope of the investigations 
imports covered by this petition consist of certain chemically bonded resin or pitch,magnesia carbon bricks with a magnesia component of at least percent magnesia mgo by weight,regardless of the source of raw materials for the mgo,with carbon levels ranging from trace amounts to percent by weight,regardless of enhancements,for example,magnesia carbon bricks can be enhanced with coating,grinding,tar impregnation or coking,high temperature heat treatments,treatments or metal casing and regardless of whether or not are present for example,antioxidants can be added to the mix from trace amounts to percent by weight as various metals,metal alloys,and metal carbides.

both commerce and the commission issued questionnaires to known producers,exporters and importers of subject merchandise.the commission issued its preliminary injury determination on september.see certain magnesia carbon bricks from china and mexico,inv.ta and ta,usitc pub.the commission identified the scope of the investigations as including only chemically bonded mcbs in which the magnesia content is at least percent and the carbon content ranges up to percent.id.at.the commission also found that mcbs are not used interchangeably with other refractory products because they have distinct uses,differ in physical characteristics,are priced higher,and are made by different production processes.id.at.accordingly,the commission concluded that the domestic like product did not include other refractory products such as fired magnesite,fired bauxite,magnesia dolomite,and magnesia alumina graphite bricks.id.the commission defined the domestic like product as mcbs making it coterminous with commerce determination without objection from any party.id.
on september and,commerce published its final affirmative antidumping and countervailing determinations and issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on mcbs from mexico and china.the orders continued to use the scope language proposed by resco and adopted during initiation of the investigations.see certain magnesia carbon bricks from mexico and the people republic of china antidumping duty orders,certain magnesia carbon bricks from mexico and the people republic of china countervailing duty order,collectively,the orders.likewise,the commission final injury determination continued to define the domestic like product as coterminous with the scope of the investigations.see certain magnesia carbon bricks from china and mexico,inv.ta and ta,usitc pub.at.
ii.fedmet scope ruling request 
fedmet is a domestic importer of refractory bricks and other products used in the steelmaking industry.fedmet was not a party to the antidumping and countervailing duty investigations initiated at the petition of resco.additionally,the record does not indicate that fedmet was served with an antidumping or countervailing questionnaire by either commerce or the commission.
on may,fedmet requested from commerce a scope ruling that its bastion line of magnesia carbon alumina mac bricks was outside the scope of the outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders on mcbs from china and mexico.in its request,fedmet indicated that its mac bricks contain approximately to percent magnesia,to percent alumina aluminium oxide,to percent carbon,and smaller amounts of silicon dioxide,calcium oxide,iron oxide and titanium dioxide.fedmet also stated that the significant amounts of alumina contained in mac bricks result in distinct properties that distinguish mac bricks from mcbs.specifically,fedmet explained that the alumina facilitates the formation of fused magnesia spinel when mac bricks are heated to steelmaking temperatures,which prevents cracks and decreases chemical attack by promoting permanent expansion and closing pores in the bricks.
on march,after receiving comments and questionnaire responses from interested parties,commerce preliminarily determined that fedmet mac bricks were included within the scope of the orders.commerce first found that the plain language of the orders was ambiguous regarding whether mcbs with alumina were covered.commerce then examined the descriptions of the subject merchandise contained in the petition,the initial investigation,the determinations of commerce and the like product determination of the commission.commerce found that these sources contained language that excluded mac bricks from the scope of the orders.commerce nonetheless determined that these sources were not dispositive because mac bricks were only referenced by name and no technical descriptions were provided in the underlying investigations to identify the chemical composition of mac bricks.
commerce therefore turned to the extrinsic information obtained from interested parties and through its own research during the scope proceedings.commerce gave the greatest weight to the fact that fedmet mac bricks fall squarely within the levels of magnesia and carbon provided in the orders.commerce also found that fedmet mac bricks have the same characteristics and uses as mcbs,and are marketed and sold in the same way and through similar channels as mcbs.based on these findings,commerce preliminarily determined that fedmet mac bricks were included within the scope of the orders.
commerce issued its final scope ruling on july,wherein it continued to find ambiguity in the record of the underlying investigations.acknowledging that mac bricks had been identified as a type of refractory brick distinct from the domestic like product,commerce observed that resco never identified the chemical composition and technical specifications of mac bricks,or expressly state d that mac bricks with a chemical composition like that of fedmet bastion mac bricks fall outside of the scope of the investigations or the resulting orders.at.additionally,commerce noted that the commission included an mcb with added alumina in its pricing analysis.based on the evidence regarding the physical characteristics and uses of fedmet mac bricks and the manner in which they are advertised and sold,commerce determined that fedmet mac bricks were included within the scope of the orders.
fedmet filed suit at the trade court seeking to reverse commerce scope ruling.the trade court upheld commerce determination,finding that it was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.the trade court agreed with commerce that the record in the underlying investigations was not dispositive in finding ambiguity in the intrinsic record,the court relied on evidence obtained during the scope proceedings that showed that mac bricks with more than magnesia known as bricks can also be called mcbs.the trade court then found that substantial evidence supported commerce determination that fedmet mac bricks have physical characteristics and uses similar to those of mcbs,and are in fact interchangeable with mcbs.the trade court therefore affirmed commerce determination that fedmet mac bricks are within the scope of the orders.
fedmet timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

this court reviews the trade court grant or denial of judgment on the agency record without deference.see corus staal bv dep t of commerce,thyssenkrupp acciai speciali terni united states.we apply anew the same standard of review used by the trade court.atar united states.accordingly,we must uphold commerce scope determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.we review for clear error the factual findings made by the trade court on a motion for judgment on the agency record.see de cecco di filippo fara martino united states.
the countervailing duty and antidumping duty statutes authorize commerce to impose duties on imported goods that benefit from certain government subsidies in their country of manufacture,or that are sold in the united states at less than fair value.see.at the conclusion of a countervailing duty or antidumping duty investigation,assuming the requisite findings are made,commerce may issue orders imposing duties on imports of goods covered by the investigation.when questions arise as to whether a particular product is included within the scope of a countervailing or antidumping duty order,an interested party may request that commerce issue a scope ruling to clarify the scope with respect to particular products.see a.

k.we afford significant deference to commerce own interpretation of its orders,mindful that scope determinations are highly and.king supply,at see also ericsson ge mobile commc ns,united states.
fedmet argues that commerce scope ruling is not supported by substantial evidence.fedmet maintains that the administrative record in the underlying investigations clearly demonstrates that mac bricks were excluded from the scope of the investigations,and that commerce adopted the scope language proposed by resco intending to exclude mac bricks.according to fedmet,the k sources are dispositive,and commerce conclusion to the contrary is unsupported by substantial evidence.fedmet argues in the alternative that,to the extent that examination of the k factors is necessary to resolve any ambiguity,commerce findings under the k factors are also unsupported by substantial evidence.
commerce and the intervenors respond that the k sources are ambiguous because there is no accepted industry standard for mac bricks,and the record of the underlying investigations does not contain any technical specifications for mac bricks.they contend that commerce properly proceeded to an analysis of the k factors and that such analysis is supported by substantial evidence.according to commerce and intervenors,fedmet is inviting this court to reweigh the evidence,which the court is not permitted to do.
we agree with fedmet.the k sources are dispositive and unequivocally confirm that fedmet mac bricks are not within the scope of the orders.first,these sources contain multiple representations made by resco disclaiming coverage of all mac bricks in general.for example,resco explicitly asserted in its petition that mcbs and mac bricks are not generally substitutable and have varying chemical and physical properties and wear characteristics.at.when commerce requested confirmation that resco proposed language was sufficient to distinguish mcbs from other types of refractory bricks,including mac bricks,resco responded that no revisions were necessary and confirmed that its petition focused only on mcb and not other types of refractory bricks,which according to resco do not provide the same performance as mcbs in steelmaking and steel handling applications.id.at.resco counsel further supported the like product determination with testimony before the commission that mac bricks and mcbs do not have the same physical characteristics and uses are not perceived by producers and purchasers as substitutable and are easily differentiated by price.id.at.
second,the k sources confirm commerce and the commission understanding that the underlying investigations did not extend to mac bricks.commerce specifically inquired whether the proposed scope language was sufficient to exclude other types of bricks such as mac bricks,implicitly demonstrating an understanding that such bricks should be excluded.the commission echoed commerce understanding in its final injury determination when its stated that,although mac bricks may be used in place of mcbs for some applications,they generally do not have the same physical properties as mcbs,are easily differentiated by price,and their uses are not perceived by the steel producers as substitutable.usitc pub.at i this is contrary to commerce and the trade court finding that the k sources are devoid of evidence regarding physical properties of mac bricks.
to put it simply,the question before this court was asked and answered during the underlying investigations.resco had an opportunity to clarify whether mac bricks were included within the scope of the investigations,and it confirmed that they were not.in doing so,resco chose to rely on industry terminology to continue to define the subject merchandise and the domestic like product.at the urging of resco,commerce adopted this industry terminology and defined the scope of the orders in terms of magnesia carbon bricks,with the understanding that other types of bricks such as mac bricks would not be covered.in turn,the commission adopted commerce language to define the domestic like product as mcbs,relying on resco representation that mac bricks are not interchangeable with mcbs.had resco not made these statements,it is possible that the commission would have defined the domestic like product differently and,in so doing,perhaps arrived at a different injury determination.
indeed,the tariff act provides that only producers of the domestic like product,or unions or associations affiliated with producers of the domestic like product,may file a petition.see generally b,b.a petitioner must also demonstrate that domestic producers who support the petition account for at least of the total production of the domestic like product,and more than of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.see id.c a,c a.here,it is not clear that resco would have been considered an interested party for purposes of initiating the underlying investigations if they had encompassed mac bricks.see b,b.we see nothing in the record indicating that resco is a domestic producer of mac bricks,and fedmet maintains that resco is not.the record also contains no information regarding whether the domestic producers who supported resco original petition manufacture mac bricks.
a scope analysis begins with the scope language in a final order.if the language is ambiguous,the next step is an identification of the products that were actually investigated.the inquiry includes whether the petitioner sought to explicitly include or exclude the product in question from the underlying investigation.these initial steps are necessary because,in the underlying investigation,a petitioner must balance the incentive to achieve as broad a definition of the domestic like product as possible,with the requirement that it must prove standing and injury via production and economic trade data that is relative to the product subject to the investigation.in view of this dynamic,we hold that,where a petitioner is requested to clarify with a high degree of specificity the scope of its petition,its response is highly germane to a subsequent scope determination.a petitioner has an obligation to be explicit and precise in its definition of the scope of the petition both prior and during the investigation.
contrary to the dissent view,the fact that the k sources identify no point at which addition of alumina to an mcb transforms it into a mac brick does not result in ambiguity.see dissent at.the public including domestic importers like fedmet is entitled to rely on the multiple statements in the k sources disclaiming coverage of mac bricks.to the extent that mcbs and mac bricks do in fact overlap to some degree,the overlap was surrendered by resco failure to provide a technical definition or cut off point when asked to be more specific.
to be clear,our holding does not elevate resco petition over the language of the orders.see dissent at.commerce found that the scope language in the orders was ambiguous regarding whether fedmet mac bricks were covered.at.the trade court did not disturb this finding and proceeded to analyze the k sources.see fedmet,d at.the ambiguity in the scope language arises not because of the carbon and magnesia levels which no party disputes are met by fedmet mac bricks but because the orders are limited to magnesia carbon bricks.this limitation is clear and unambiguous.as a result,the question of whether fedmet mac bricks are covered by the orders must be resolved by examining the k sources,which include resco petition,and we may only consider the k factors if the k sources are not dispositive.see k.
we recognize that antidumping and countervailing duty orders should not be interpreted in a vacuum devoid of any consideration of the way the language of the order is used in the relevant industry.arcelor mittal stainless belg.united states.but the reason why the k sources are afforded primacy in the scope analysis is because interpretation of the language used in the orders must be based on the meaning given to that language during the underlying investigations.in this case,the terms magnesia carbon brick and magnesia alumina carbon brick are ubiquitous and in the refractories industry.indeed,resco characterized both types of bricks as standard.
apparently satisfied by resco representations that industry terminology was sufficient,commerce and the commission determined not to go beyond the name of mac bricks,not to provide any chemical composition or technical specifications for mac bricks,and not to adopt an explicit exclusion for mac bricks because it was unnecessary.these decisions can not now operate to create ambiguity or otherwise detract from the clear import of the meaning given to the term mac bricks in the underlying investigations.while commerce enjoys considerable latitude in clarifying its orders,it may not change the original scope of its orders through the interpretative process.see tak fat trading united states,duferco steel,united states.
it is commerce duty to define the scope of the merchandise that will be investigated,and it is the commission duty to conduct its injury determination based on the like product.commerce also has the responsibility to define the scope of the orders in such detail as the administering authority deems necessary.a.having explicitly inquired about the exclusion of mac bricks,and having accepted resco representation that no revisions to the scope language were necessary to exclude mac bricks,commerce can not later depart from its previous understanding based on its own failure to define merchandise more precisely than by name.we therefore hold that commerce finding of ambiguity in the k sources lacks substantial evidence 
the trade court erred in relying on evidence outside the k sources to find ambiguity within those sources.although the court acknowledged the repeated statements in the k sources excluding mac bricks,it found that two critical facts instilled the term with considerable ambiguity.fedmet,d at.first,the court found that advertisements and other record evidence indicate that the term macb can refer to bricks as well as bricks.id.second,the court found that record evidence of industry naming conventions reasonably suggests that so long as the magnesia content of a brick with added alumina remains above,it can be called either an mcb or an macb.id.emphasis in original.but the k sources do not mention,much less make a distinction,between socalled and bricks.indeed,in making its findings,the trade court relied solely on information provided by interested parties or obtained through commerce own research during the course of the scope proceedings.the k sources themselves neither support the two critical facts nor the court conclusion that resco may have intended to exclude only some macbs on which the trade court premised its finding of ambiguity.id.emphasis in original.those findings therefore can not provide the basis for holding that commerce finding of ambiguity in the k sources is supported by substantial evidence.
in sum,because nothing in the k sources detracts from the otherwise clear statements that all mac bricks were excluded from the scope of the underlying investigations,we hold that the k sources are dispositive of the question presented by fedmet scope ruling request.commerce erred in proceeding to analyze the k factors,and we decline to review such analysis see eckstrom,united states.because fedmet bricks are mac bricks,we hold that they are not covered by the orders.
conclusion 
commerce scope ruling is unsupported by substantial evidence.we therefore reverse the trade court decision and grant fedmet motion for judgment on the agency record.we hold that fedmet bastion mac bricks are outside the scope of the countervailing and antidumping orders at issue in this case.we remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
reversed and remanded 
the majority fails to ground its analysis in the plain language of the scope of the investigation,as defined in the antidumping and countervailing duty orders for mcbs the orders,and instead focuses on the petition of a domestic producer,contrary to the governing regulation.because i would affirm the decision of the court of international trade cit,i respectfully dissent.
fedmet merchandise has concentrations of magnesia and carbon falling within the scope of the orders.the majority nevertheless holds commerce erred in finding fedmet magnesia alumina carbon mac bricks were subject to the orders because the k sources disclaim mac bricks.the trouble is that the k sources never define the disclaimed mac bricks except to say they have different features,uses,and prices than mcbs.some mcbs with added alumina were in fact investigated as mcbs during the commission investigation,and none of the k sources address how much alumina must be added before mcbs become mac bricks that fall outside the scope of the orders.instead,the k sources indicate that any mcbs with the recited carbon and magnesia concentrations would possess mcbs characteristic strength and usefulness.substantial record evidence supports commerce finding that the k sources do not dispositively resolve whether fedmet products are mcbs covered by the orders,or are instead mac bricks with different characteristics,uses,and prices.it was thus proper for commerce to consider the k sources.
in holding otherwise,the majority fails to defer to commerce factual findings with respect to industry terminology,and instead makes its own contrary findings that are unsupported by the record.it also criticizes commerce for failing to specifically define mcbs and mac bricks in its orders,even though binding regulation states the descriptions of subject merchandise must be written in general terms.a emphasis added.finally,the majority relies heavily on a domestic producer petition instead of grounding its analysis in the plain language of the orders,as required by this court precedent.because the record supports commerce finding that adding to alumina to otherwise dutiable mcbs does not remove them from the scope of the orders,i would affirm.
a scope ruling involves a highly and determination,king supply.llc united states,which is particularly within the expertise of commerce,sandvik steel united states.commerce enjoys substantial freedom in conducting such scope inquiries,eckstrom,united states,and this court must affirm commerce determination as long as it is supported by substantial evidence,sango int l united states.
t he plain language of the order is paramount in conducting a scope ruling.king supply,at.t he first step in a scope ruling proceeding is to determine whether the governing language is in fact ambiguous.arcelormittal stainless belg.united states.the orders in this case define mcbs as having a magnesia component of at least percent magnesia by weight and carbon levels ranging from trace amounts to percent by weight.fedmet merchandise contains approximately to percent magnesia and to percent carbon,and thus fall s squarely within the ranges identified in the scope of the orders.see.the orders further state that mcbs may have added antioxidants from trace amounts to percent by weight as various metals,metal alloys,and metal carbides,and fedmet merchandise contains alumina at a concentration of to.finally,the orders state mcbs are classifiable under,inter alia,harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus,which is the subheading covering fedmet merchandise see.
based on the magnesia and carbon content alone,commerce found fedmet merchandise f e ll within the scope of the orders,but it identified a potential ambiguity regarding whether the scope covers mcbs with alumina.see.to resolve this question,commerce considered the k sources,which are t he descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition,the initial investigation,and the determinations of commerce including prior scope determinations and the commission.see k emphasis added.
the k sources in this case include the commission investigation and injury determinations.the commission pricing investigation included mcbs with added alumina,which were also mentioned in the commission injury determination,see stating the commission collected quarterly pricing data for three mcb products including resco brand maxline afx see also finding the maxline afx was an mcb with alumina,although is less than the to alumina contained in fedmet merchandise,the inclusion of mcbs with alumina demonstrates that simply adding alumina to otherwise subject mcbs does not automatically withdraw them from the scope of the orders.
the remaining k sources do not dispositively show that mcbs with to alumina are excluded from the orders.to the contrary,resco petition emphasizes that the combination of carbon and magnesia in mcbs results in h igh thermal conductivity,r educed porosity,h igh corrosion resistance,and g ood reaction to alkaline environments.fedmet products contain the requisite concentrations of carbon and magnesia,suggesting they share these characteristics.resco petition states mcbs had different characteristics and uses than other refractory bricks including mac bricks,but did not define the different types of refractory bricks.nor did resco suggest how much alumina must be added to mcbs before they become mac bricks with characteristics unique from mcbs.see.
resco questionnaire responses also demonstrate the k sources are not dispositive with regard to the amount of alumina needed to transform an mcb into a mac brick.on august,in response to commerce,resco stated t he scope of our petition focuses only on mcb.however,four days later,resco revised the scope language to remove the explicit exclusion of alumina carbon bricks,bricks and dolomite class bricks,and confirmed the exclusion was unnecessary since the bricks did not have the requisite magnesia levels specified by resco.see.these questionnaire responses necessarily create petition ambiguity.
furthermore,none of resco questionnaire responses addresses the ambiguity posed by the orders whether adding to alumina withdraws mcbs from the orders scope.there is no indication from the k sources that f
