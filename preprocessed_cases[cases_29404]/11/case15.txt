after respondent seb invented an innovative deep fryer,obtained a patent for its design,and began selling its fryer in this country,sunbeam products,asked petitioner pentalpha enterprises,a hong kong home appliance maker and wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner appliances,to supply sunbeam with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.pentalpha purchased an seb fryer that was made for sale in a foreign market and thus lacked patent markings,copied all but the fryer cosmetic features,and retained an attorney to conduct a study without telling him it had copied directly from seb design.failing to locate seb patent,the attorney issued an opinion letter stating that pentalpha deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had found.pentalpha then started selling its fryers to sunbeam,which resold them in this country under its own trademarks at a price that undercut seb.
seb then sued sunbeam for patent infringement.though sunbeam notified pentalpha of the lawsuit,pentalpha went on to sell its fryers to other companies,which resold them in the market under their respective trademarks.after settling the sunbeam lawsuit,seb sued pentalpha,asserting,as relevant here,that it had contravened b by actively inducing sunbeam and the other purchasers of pentalpha fryers to sell or offer to sell them in violation of seb patent rights.the jury found for seb on the induced infringement theory,and the district court entered judgment for seb.affirming,the federal circuit stated that induced infringement under b requires a showing that the alleged infringer knew or should have known that his actions would induce actual infringements declared that this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer knew of the patent held that,although there was no direct evidence that pentalpha knew of seb patent before it received notice of the sunbeam suit,there was adequate proof that it deliberately disregarded a known risk that seb had a protective patent and said that such disregard is not different from,but a form of,actual knowledge.
induced infringement under b requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.
a section b text w hoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer is ambiguous as to the intent needed to impose liability.in referring to a party that induces infringement,the provision may require merely that the inducer must lead another to engage in conduct that happens to amount to infringement.on the other hand,the reference to a party that induces infringement may also be read to mean that the inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer knows is infringement.
b like b language,the case law is susceptible to conflicting interpretations.however,aro convertible top replacement,aro ii,resolves the question at issue.
c induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of indirect liability in the case law,but was treated as evidence of contributory infringement,the aiding and abetting of direct infringement by another party.when congress enacted,it separated the contributory infringement concept into two categories induced infringement,covered by b,and sale of a component of a patented invention,covered by c.in the badly fractured aro ii decision,a majority concluded that a violator of c must know that the combination for which his component was especially designed was both patented and infringing.at.that conclusion,now a fixture in the law,compels this same knowledge for liability under b,given that the two provisions have a common origin and create the same difficult interpretive choice.
deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists does not satisfy the knowledge required by b.nevertheless,the federal circuit judgment must be affirmed because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of pentalpha knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness.
a the doctrine of willful blindness is well established in criminal law.many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully,and courts applying the doctrine have held that defendants can not escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances.the traditional rationale for the doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.this court endorsed a concept similar to willful blindness over a century ago in spurr united states,and every federal court of appeals but one has fully embraced willful blindness.given the doctrine long history and wide acceptance in the federal judiciary,there is no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits for induced patent infringement under b.
b although the courts of appeals articulate the doctrine of willful blindness in slightly different ways,all agree on two basic requirements.first,the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists.second,the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.these requirements give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.
c although the federal circuit test departs from the proper willful blindness standard in important respects,the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for seb was sufficient under the correct standard.pentalpha believed that seb fryer embodied advanced technology that would be valuable in the market as evidenced by its decision to copy all but the fryer cosmetic features.also revealing is pentalpha decision to copy an overseas model of seb fryer,aware that it would not bear patent markings.even more telling is pentalpha decision not to inform its attorney that the product to be evaluated was simply a knockoff of seb fryer.taken together,the evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to find that pentalpha subjectively believed there was a high probability that seb fryer was patented and took deliberate steps to avoid knowing that fact,and that it therefore willfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of sunbeam sales.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether a party who actively induces of a patent under b must know that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.
this case concerns a patent for an innovative deep fryer designed by respondent seb,a french maker of home appliances.in the late,seb invented a deep fryer,that is,a deep fryer for home use with external surfaces that remain cool during the frying process.the deep fryer consisted of a metal frying pot surrounded by a plastic outer housing.attached to the housing was a ring that suspended the metal pot and insulated the housing from heat by separating it from the pot,creating air space between the two components.seb obtained a patent for its design in,and sometime later,seb started manufacturing the fryer and selling it in this country under its brand.superior to other products in the american market at the time,seb fryer was a commercial success.
in,sunbeam products,a competitor of seb,asked petitioner pentalpha enterprises,to supply it with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.pentalpha is a hong kong maker of home appliances and a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner appliances,
in order to develop a deep fryer for sunbeam,pentalpha purchased an seb fryer in hong kong and copied all but its cosmetic features.because the seb fryer bought in hong kong was made for sale in a foreign market,it bore no patent markings.after copying seb design,pentalpha retained an attorney to conduct a study,but pentalpha refrained from telling the attorney that its design was copied directly from seb.
the attorney failed to locate seb patent,and in august he issued an opinion letter stating that pentalpha deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had found.that same month,pentalpha started selling its deep fryers to sunbeam,which resold them in the united states under its trademarks.by obtaining its product from a manufacturer with lower production costs,sunbeam was able to undercut seb in the market.
after seb customers started defecting to sunbeam,seb sued sunbeam in march,alleging that sunbeam sales infringed seb patent.sunbeam notified pentalpha of the lawsuit the following month.undeterred,pentalpha went on to sell deep fryers to fingerhut and montgomery ward,both of which resold them in the united states under their respective trademarks.
seb settled the lawsuit with sunbeam,and then sued pentalpha,asserting two theories of recovery first,seb claimed that pentalpha had directly infringed seb patent in violation of a,by selling or offering to sell its deep fryers and second,seb claimed that pentalpha had contravened b by actively inducing sunbeam,fingerhut,and montgomery ward to sell or to offer to sell pentalpha deep fryers in violation of seb patent rights.
following a trial,the jury found for seb on both theories and also found that pentalpha infringement had been willful.pentalpha filed motions seeking a new trial or judgment as a matter of law on several grounds.as relevant here,pentalpha argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding of induced infringement under b because pentalpha did not actually know of seb patent until it received the notice of the sunbeam lawsuit in april.
the district court rejected pentalpha argument,as did the court of appeals for the federal circuit,which affirmed the judgment,seb montgomery ward.summarizing a recent en banc decision,the federal circuit stated that induced infringement under b requires a plaintiff to show that the alleged infringer knew or should have known that his actions would induce actual infringements and that this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer knew of the patent,at.although the record contained no direct evidence that pentalpha knew of seb patent before april,the court found adequate evidence to support a finding that pentalpha deliberately disregarded a known risk that seb had a protective patent.at.such disregard,the court said,is not different from actual knowledge,but is a form of actual knowledge.ibid.
we granted certiorari.
pentalpha argues that active inducement liability under b requires more than deliberate indifference to a known risk that the induced acts may violate an existing patent.instead,pentalpha maintains,actual knowledge of the patent is needed.
in assessing pentalpha argument,we begin with the text of b which is short,simple,and,with respect to the question presented in this case,inconclusive.section b states whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.
although the text of b makes no mention of intent,we infer that at least some intent is required.the term induce means t o lead on to influence to prevail on to move by persuasion or influence.webster new international dictionary ed.the addition of the adverb actively suggests that the inducement must involve the taking of affirmative steps to bring about the desired result,see,at.
when a person actively induces another to take some action,the inducer obviously knows the action that he or she wishes to bring about.if a used car salesman induces a customer to buy a car,the salesman knows that the desired result is the purchase of the car.but what if it is said that the salesman induced the customer to buy a damaged car does this mean merely that the salesman induced the customer to purchase a car that happened to be damaged,a fact of which the salesman may have been unaware or does this mean that the salesman knew that the car was damaged the statement that the salesman induced the customer to buy a damaged car is ambiguous.
so is b.in referring to a party that induces infringement,this provision may require merely that the inducer lead another to engage in conduct that happens to amount to infringement,the making,using,offering to sell,selling,or importing of a patented invention.see a on the other hand,the reference to a party that induces infringement may also be read to mean that the inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer knows is infringement.both readings are possible.
finding no definitive answer in the statutory text,we turn to the case law that predates the enactment of as part the patent act of.as we recognized in aro convertible top replacement,aro ii,t he section was designed to codify in statutory form principles of contributory infringement which had been part of our law for about years.at,quoting.
unfortunately,the relevant cases are less clear than one might hope with respect to the question presented here.before,both the conduct now covered by b induced infringement and the conduct now addressed by c sale of a component of a patented invention were viewed as falling within the overarching concept of contributory infringement.cases in the latter category,cases in which a party sold an item that was not itself covered by the claims of a patent but that enabled another party to make or use a patented machine,process,or combination were more common.
the case law provides conflicting signals regarding the intent needed in such cases.in an decision,taft suggested that it was sufficient if the seller of the component part intended that the part be used in an invention that happened to infringe a patent.he wrote that it was well settled that where one makes and sells one element of a combination covered by a patent with the intention and for the purpose of bringing about its use in such a combination he is guilty of contributory infringement.ohio brass,
on the other hand,this court,in henry dick,overruled on other grounds,motion picture patents universal film,stated that if the defendants who were accused of contributory infringement knew of the patent and that the direct infringer had unlawfully made the patented article with the intent and purpose that the direct infringer should use the infringing article they would assist in her infringing use.at emphasis added and deleted our decision in studios grokster,which looked to the law of contributory patent infringement for guidance in determining the standard to be applied in a case claiming contributory copyright infringement,contains dicta that may be read as interpreting the cases this way.in grokster,we said that t he inducement rule premises liability on purposeful,culpable expression and conduct.at.
while both the language of b and the case law that this provision was meant to codify are susceptible to conflicting interpretations,our decision in aro ii resolves the question in this case.in aro ii,a majority held that a violator of c must know that the combination for which his component was especially designed was both patented and infringing,at,and as we explain below,that conclusion compels this same knowledge for liability under b.
as noted above,induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of indirect liability in the case law.rather,it was treated as evidence of contributory infringement,that is,the aiding and abetting of direct infringement by another party.see lemley,patent infringement.when congress enacted,it separated what had previously been regarded as contributory infringement into two categories,one covered by b and the other covered by c.
aro ii concerned c,which states in relevant part 
whoever offers to sell or sells a component of a patented invention,constituting a material part of the invention,knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent,and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use,shall be liable as a contributory infringer.emphasis added.
this language contains exactly the same ambiguity as b.the phrase knowing a component to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement may be read to mean that a violator must know that the component is especially adapted for use in a product that happens to infringe a patent.or the phrase may be read to require,in addition,knowledge of the patent existence.
this question closely divided the aro ii court.in a badly fractured decision,a majority concluded that knowledge of the patent was needed,at,and,at white,concurring,at black,dissenting justice black opinion,which explained the basis for the majority view,concluded that the language of c supported this interpretation.see,at.his opinion also relied on an amendment to this language that was adopted when the bill was in committee,at.
four justices disagreed with this interpretation and would have held that a violator of c need know only that the component is specially adapted for use in a product that happens to infringe a patent.see,at.these justices thought that this reading was supported by the language of c and the case law,and they disagreed with the inference drawn by the majority from the amendment of c language.ibid.
while there is much to be said in favor of both views expressed in aro ii,the holding in aro ii has become a fixture in the law of contributory infringement under section c,moy,walker on patents,ed.so much so that seb has not asked us to overrule it,see brief for respondent.nor has congress seen fit to alter c intent requirement in the nearly half a century since aro ii was decided.in light of the special force of the doctrine of stare decisis with regard to questions of statutory interpretation,see john sand gravel united states,we proceed on the premise that c requires knowledge of the existence of the patent that is infringed.
based on this premise,it follows that the same knowledge is needed for induced infringement under b.as noted,the two provisions have a common origin in the understanding of contributory infringement,and the language of the two provisions creates the same difficult interpretive choice.it would thus be strange to hold that knowledge of the relevant patent is needed under c but not under b.
accordingly,we now hold that induced infringement under b requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.
returning to pentalpha principal challenge,we agree that deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists is not the appropriate standard under b.we nevertheless affirm the judgment of the court of appeals because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of pentalpha knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness.
the doctrine of willful blindness is well established in criminal law.many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully,and courts applying the doctrine of willful blindness hold that defendants can not escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances.the traditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.edwards,the criminal degrees of knowledge,mod,hereinafter edwards observing on the basis of english authorities that up to the present day,no real doubt has been cast on the proposition that willful blindness is as culpable as actual knowledge it is also said that persons who know enough to blind themselves to direct proof of critical facts in effect have actual knowledge of those facts.see united states jewell,en banc.
this court opinion more than a century ago in spurr united states,while not using the term willful blindness,endorsed a similar concept.the case involved a criminal statute that prohibited a bank officer from willfully certifying a check drawn against insufficient funds.we said that a willful violation would occur if the bank officer purposely keeps himself in ignorance of whether the drawer has money in the bank.at.following our decision in spurr,several federal prosecutions in the first half of the century invoked the doctrine of willful blindness later,a proposed draft of the model penal code,which has since become official,attempted to incorporate the doctrine by defining knowledge of the existence of a particular fact to include a situation in which a person is aware of a high probability of the fact existence,unless he actually believes that it does not exist.ali,model penal code proposed official draft.our court has used the code definition as a guide in analyzing whether certain statutory presumptions of knowledge comported with due process.see turner united states,leary united states,and.and every court of appeals with the possible exception of the district of columbia circuit,see,infra has fully embraced willful blindness,applying the doctrine to a wide range of criminal statutes.
given the long history of willful blindness and its wide acceptance in the federal judiciary,we can see no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits for induced patent infringement under b 
pentalpha urges us not to take this step,arguing that b demands more than willful blindness with respect to the induced acts that constitute infringement.see reply brief for petitioners.this question,however,is not at issue here.there is no need to invoke the doctrine of willful blindness to establish that pentalpha knew that the retailers who purchased its fryer were selling that product in the american market pentalpha was indisputably aware that its customers were selling its product in this country.
pentalpha further contends that this court in grokster did not accept the solicitor general suggestion that grokster and streamcast could be held liable for inducing the infringement of copyrights under a theory of willful blindness.reply brief for petitioners citing brief for united states.but the court had no need to consider the doctrine of willful blindness in that case because the court found ample evidence that grokster and streamcast were fully aware in the ordinary sense of the term that their software was routinely used in carrying out the acts that constituted infringement the unauthorized sharing of copyrighted works and that these acts violated the rights of copyright holders.see,at.
while the courts of appeals articulate the doctrine of willful blindness in slightly different ways,all appear to agree on two basic requirements the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact we think these requirements give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.under this formulation,a willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the critical facts.see williams,criminal law,ed.a court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant actually knew by contrast,a reckless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing,see ali,model penal code c,and a negligent defendant is one who should have known of a similar risk but,in fact,did not,see d.
the test applied by the federal circuit in this case departs from the proper willful blindness standard in two important respects.first,it permits a finding of knowledge when there is merely a known risk that the induced acts are infringing.second,in demanding only deliberate indifference to that risk,the federal circuit test does not require active efforts by an inducer to avoid knowing about the infringing nature of the activities.
in spite of these flaws,we believe that the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for seb is sufficient under the correct standard.the jury could have easily found that before april pentalpha willfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of the sales it encouraged sunbeam to make 
seb fryer was an innovation in the market when pentalpha copied it.app.to brief for respondent.as one would expect with any superior product,sales of seb fryer had been growing for some time.ibid.pentalph
