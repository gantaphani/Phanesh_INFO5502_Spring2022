johnson lee lee appeals from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut alan nevas,judge denying his motion for an order in aid of enforcement of an amended stipulated judgment of strict foreclosure.under a provision in the amended stipulated judgment,lee was to receive consideration from defendant appellee bsb greenwich mortgage limited partnership bsb in an amount that depended on the gross sales proceeds of unsold condominium units.the parties disagreed over the meaning of that term.the district court,approving,adopting,and ratifying the recommendation of magistrate judge holly fitzsimmons,found the provision ambiguous and,after considering extrinsic evidence,ruled that the term excludes the portion of the condominium units sales proceeds that only offset costs incurred in customizing the units above a standard amenities allowance.the district court thus found that bsb correctly calculated the gross sales proceeds and therefore did not violate the stipulated judgment.
for the reasons given below,we conclude that the term gross sales proceeds of unsold units is not ambiguous and can only refer to the aggregate proceeds of the condominium units as they were actually is,to the total proceeds including the increased revenue corresponding to any extra customization costs.accordingly,we reverse and remand for calculation of the gross sales proceeds in light of this opinion and,if appropriate,entry of an order in aid of enforcement of the amended stipulated judgment.
background 
in,johnson lee and his real estate development companies,lee lee construction and montgomery lee,obtained four mortgages from the bank mart to finance the planning and construction of the waterford of greenwich project,a luxury condominium complex in connecticut.the mortgages were secured by real property,including the waterford property.in the late,lee and his companies defaulted on the mortgages.the bank mart consequently instituted four foreclosure actions in connecticut state court,but soon itself became insolvent.thus,in,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic was appointed receiver of the bank mart and took over the foreclosure actions.fdic removed the foreclosure actions to the united states district court for the district of connecticut,and the four actions were consolidated in.in march,the district court entered a stipulated judgment of strict foreclosure as to the four mortgaged properties.in this stipulated judgment,the district court valued the four properties and assessed the debts owed by lee and his companies to fdic.
one day after entry of the stipulated judgment,fdic sold and assigned to bsb its interests in each of the mortgages and notes at issue in the four consolidated foreclosure actions.bsb,as a result,was substituted as plaintiff in the district court actions.in april,bsb and lee entered into an amended stipulated judgment of strict foreclosure,which varied the terms of and superseded the original stipulated judgment between lee and fdic.this amended stipulated judgment adopted the property values and debt amounts set forth in the original stipulated judgment,and provided that if by a certain date lee paid bsb the total debt owed,bsb would release the mortgages and dismiss the actions.if,however,lee did not pay his debt,the partially completed waterford project would be transferred to bsb and lee would be released from his obligations under all of the mortgages.
the amended stipulated judgment also contemplated the continued cooperation by lee in the ongoing construction of the waterford after bsb acquisition of the property.in exchange for such cooperation,bsb agreed to provide lee with certain compensation.first,as consideration,bsb agreed to transfer to lee one unit in the condominium complex,subject to the restriction that lee could not resell the unit until of the remaining unsold units in the complex were sold,or three years from the date of the transfer to lee,whichever occurred first.second,the agreement provided for two types of consideration.in paragraph of the amended stipulated judgment,the parties agreed that upon the completion of all remaining construction required to resell the uncompleted unsold units in the waterford,including all common areas and all amenities,bsb would pay lee the amount by which the actual construction costs were less than the budgeted amount of,up to a maximum of in paragraph,the parties agreed that if the gross sales proceeds of of the unsold units were less than,lee would have the option to purchase the remaining completed unsold unit for the amount by which the gross sales proceeds were less than.am.stipulated at.if lee chose not to exercise this option,bsb was to sell the final unsold unit and pay lee the amount by which the gross sales proceeds of all units sold exceeded,up to a maximum of.if,on the other hand,the gross sales proceeds of of the remaining unsold units equaled or exceeded,bsb was to convey the final completed unsold unit to lee by deed.id.at.bsb also agreed to keep lee reasonably informed as to marketing and sales progress the amended stipulated judgment defines unsold units as s uch condominium units comprising the waterford property other than condominium unit.id.at.it does not,however,define gross sales proceeds.
in,bsb acquired the waterford project pursuant to the stipulated judgment and began marketing and selling the unsold units.in doing so,bsb found that many prospective purchasers wanted their uncompleted units customized to suit their particular preferences.rather than allowing each buyer to hire his or her own workers to perform customization work,which would have complicated the construction and sale of the units,bsb agreed to supervise construction of the buyers selected amenities using workers of the buyers choosing and to add the customization costs to the final price of the units rather than billing the buyers separately.bsb did not intend to reap a profit from the customization work,but rather planned to increase the final unit prices only by the amounts charged by the workers.accordingly,bsb altered its form purchase agreement to include an allowance for seller work,representing the portion of the purchase price allotted to completing the units according to the buyers wishes.the seller work allowance for the units in one building was and for the units in two of the other buildings was if the actual cost of performing the buyer requested work was more or less than the seller work allowance,bsb would adjust the purchase price of the unit accordingly.thus,in certain instances buyers requested extra amenities which raised the cost above the seller work allowance bsb passed these costs onto the buyers through an increased purchase price.in those cases where purchasers wished to use their own contractors to complete uncompleted units,units were sold without any seller work.bsb sold these units after discounting the purchase prices by either or,depending on the building in which the unit was located.
the last completed unsold unit was unit.on january,bsb entered into a purchase agreement to sell unit to a third party for.before doing so,bsb did not notify lee that the other unsold units had been sold or provide lee with information regarding the marketing and sale of unit.when lee discovered that of the remaining units had been sold,he asked bsb for an account of the gross sales proceeds of those units.the parties thereupon discovered that they disagreed over the meaning of the term gross sales proceeds of of the unsold units.bsb claimed that the gross sales proceeds of of the unsold units totaled,entitling lee to purchase unit for,or the difference between and.in arriving at the figure,bsb had excluded the increase in purchase price corresponding to the costs above and beyond the seller work allowance in those instances in which buyers requested extra amenities.bsb argued that the parties did not mean to include these extra amounts in gross sales proceeds because at the time of the agreement the parties had not planned to construct extra amenities and because the extra amounts did not confer any profit on bsb.thus,bsb contended,gro
