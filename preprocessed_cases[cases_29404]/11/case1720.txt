introduction 
in his rock and roll standard,end of the innocence,bruce hornsby notes that the lawyers dwell on small details.that true.we have to.the devil is the only resident in the details sometimes truth and fairness lodge there as well.
in this case,we address a detail that was lost or hidden and resulted in what we consider an injustice.fortunately,as is usually the case,painstaking attention to other small details enables us to correct this injustice.if you dwell on small details with an eye to fairness,the law works well.
here,a homeowner sued a general contractor for allegedly shoddy and incomplete work in connection with a major home remodeling contract.the homeowner complaint also contained a cause of action against the general contractor license bond company,seeking to recover for the contractor having grossly deviated from the plans and specifications for the job.to support his action,the homeowner explicitly alleged in the complaint that the contractor was licensed at all times.
for his part,the general contractor responded with a against the homeowner for unpaid work.the included a copy of their written contract which showed the contractor license number.to that,the homeowner simply filed a general denial of all allegations.
when the case came to trial,the homeowner contrary to the applicable local rule requiring plaintiffs to identify all controverted issues did not identify licensure as a controverted issue.the contractor attorney seeing no issue,did not obtain a verified certificate from the contractors state license board the license board showing the contractor was licensed at all times during his performance.but when the contractor was about to rest his case on the,the homeowner attorney made a motion for nonsuit based on the absence of such a verified certificate as required under business and professions code section,subdivision d,when the issue of licensure is controverted.
the trial judge was also surprised the licensure issue was raised.he had been expecting the issue either.he deferred immediate ruling on the homeowner nonsuit motion.as the contractor learned to his chagrin,it presently takes at least six days to obtain a verified certificate from the license board even if one drives overnight to sacramento to pick it up in person.while the contractor was eventually able to obtain a verified certificate of licensure from the license board,he could not do so until after the close of the trial,in which he prevailed on his claim for unpaid work from the homeowner.because no certificate of licensure could be produced,the trial judge reluctantly granted the homeowner nonsuit motion,by then denominated a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov,and this appeal ensued.
we reverse the judgment in favor of the homeowner,with instructions to the trial judge to grant judgment in favor of the general contractor as against the homeowner.we conclude this is one of those relatively rare cases where a party can be bound by a judicial admission made in an unverified complaint.see reichert general ins.cal d,reichert circumstances of case justified holding party to admission made in unverified complaint.here,the judicial admission that the general contractor was licensed,compounded by the homeowner failure to comply with the local rule requiring identification of all controverted issues,rendered the question of licensure assuredly uncontroverted for purposes of section.because of the judicial admission,the rule of advantec group,edwin plumbing,th advantec does not apply.
this litigation arises out of a laguna hills home remodel undertaken by art womack.womack hired a general contractor named aztec sunpower aztec aztec,in turn,hired a pool subcontractor,caballero pools and spas caballero.by the end of,the relationships had broken down to the point where litigation was imminent.
womack filed first in january,his complaint alleging breach of contract by aztec.his first amended complaint,filed in july,alleged aztec had done an incomplete and sloppy job and thus forced him to incur extra expenses to make things right.
in his first amended complaint,womack alleged twice that aztec at all times relevant to the suit,acted in the capacity as a licensed contractor.the first time was in the standard list of parties often given at the beginning of a complaint.the second time was in connection with a fourth cause of action on contractor license bonds against american contractors license indemnity company american contractors.in that cause of action womack alleged that upon application by aztec to the registrar of contractors of the contractor state license board of the state of california for a contractor license or renewal thereof,and in accordance with the provisions of section of the business and professions code of state of california,aztec had filed with the registrar bonds issued by american contractors,bond number in the sum of,conditioned upon full compliance by aztec with all the provisions of division,chapter,of the business and professions code of the state of california inuring to the benefit of any person damaged as a result of a violation of the chapter by the defendant licensees.the pleading was unverified.
about a year later,in february,aztec responded with a against both womack and caballero,alleging they unfairly cut aztec out of the job.aztec alleged it had been a licensed contractor continuously in good standing with the state contractor board for the past years.
in april,both womack and caballero,represented by the same law firm,filed answers to aztec.each answer generally denied all of aztec allegations,which necessarily included the allegation aztec had been a licensed contractor at all relevant times,a small detail that went unnoticed.
also in april,caballero filed his own against aztec,alleging damages arising out of its breach of contract.in contrast to womack earlier complaint,however,caballero did not allege aztec was at all times a licensed contractor.caballero merely alleged aztec had represented itself to be a contractor.
three days before a september,trial date,womack and caballero law firm filed a joint list of stipulated facts and controverted issues,though calling it either joint or a list would be a stretch.it was not joint certainly not in the sense of reflecting a document agreed to by adversarial parties.the document was neither signed by aztec counsel nor,as far as we can ascertain,ever served on her.nor was it a list.it merely stated the parties had stipulated a certain surety bond company had issued a bond to aztec for a certain period and then said all other issues are controverted,without identifying any of them.
the trial was continued,and on november,just before trial was about to begin,counsel for american contractors aztec bonding agent and womack announced in open court with counsel for aztec present that they had a settlement.counsel for womack articulated its terms for the record they agreed that american contractors had issued surety bond number in the amount of to da lovell,which does business as aztec sunpower.the bond was in effect from february yeah,february,through march.american contractors indemnity company agrees that if plaintiff art womack obtains a net recovery of at least for da lovell dba aztec,that american contractors indemnity will pay to art womack up to from the penal sum of the bond.if the net is less than,american contractors indemnity shall only be obligated to pay the net recovery,not to exceed.and the parties agree that the court will retain jurisdiction pursuant to ccp to enforce this settlement.
trial then proceeded,and on november the issue of aztec licensure came up late in the afternoon,soon after aztec owner,lovell,took the stand and began testifying as to aztec licensure status.it was at that point womack and caballero counsel played the advantec card,asserting the issue of licensure had been controverted,so there was a fatal omission in aztec completed case aztec had produced no verified certificate of licensure.
the trial judge was taken aback.he reminded defense counsel he had asked at the outset of the case whether there were any dispositive affirmative defenses,and had heard not a word about the licensure issue.the short colloquy ended with the judge deciding to delay ruling on the matter until sometime after the end of the day.
that day womack and caballero counsel filed written briefing on the subdivision d issue.it had obviously not been worked up ad hoc over the lunch hour.the gravamen of the briefing was aztec licensure had been controverted by virtue of the general denials filed by womack and caballero to aztec under business and professions code section,subdivision d,proof of licensure may be shown only by a verified certificate of licensure from the state contractor license board aztec had failed to produce such a verified certificate the implication was that by this late date in the trial,aztec was not going to be able to produce such a verified certificate in time ergo aztec had failed to meet its burden of proof of showing licensure and,as the briefing put it,had to lose.period.
the next day,november,aztec rested its case on the liability phase of trial.it is an interesting,but now academic question whether,under any circumstance,including optimal funding of the license board in the best of all possible worlds,any contractor will ever be able to procure a verified certificate of licensure overnight.it certainly did happen here.rather,immediately after aztec rested,womack and caballero counsel made an oral motion for nonsuit based on the brief they had filed the previous day.
it appears the trial judge had not yet had time to read that brief.so he denied womack and caballero counsel request to have him rule on the issue immediately.rather,he said defense counsel could argue his motion the next day.if,in the interim,the jury came back with an adverse verdict,the motion could be treated as a motion for jnov.as it turned out,the jury did come back with a verdict in the liability phase of the trial first against womack on his complaint,then in favor of aztec on its,finding both womack and caballero had breached their contracts with aztec.
phase two,the trial on damages,remained so the jury was not dismissed.the next day,november,outside the presence of the jury,the judge entertained the motion.by this time there had been oral testimony aztec was fully licensed,but there was no verified certificate of licensure.aztec lawyer contended there had been no need to produce such a certificate,pointing to womack first amended complaint,in which womack admitted in his pleading that aztec was a licensed contractor.the trial judge understood the point to be that womack had made a judicial admission aztec was so licensed.womack and caballero counsel countered by citing the advantec case.while the trial judge had read the case a couple of weeks prior to the trial,he had not read it for that day,so he again deferred ruling on the motion.
four days later,on november,the jury returned a verdict on the damages issue in favor of aztec womack owed aztec,caballero owed aztec.aztec counsel told the judge she had ordered a verified certificate from the licensing board,but it was ready yet.the trial judge correctly guessed womack and caballero position would be that it made no difference.as he anticipated,in open court,womack and caballero response to the fact that aztec was now shown to have been licensed all along was,advantec case says that he wins anyway.
that day aztec counsel filed opposition to womack and caballero earlier brief,again asserting womack had made a judicial admission that aztec was licensed.after a little more discussion,the parties agreed to resume argument two days later,on november.when the parties met again on november,the trial judge had made up his mind to grant the motion,based on advantec.
aztec counsel once again asserted the argument womack had made a judicial admission aztec was validly licensed.but the trial judge expressed his concern that,there no case on point in which that is recognized as an exception to the statute and the advantec case.he added,i just do see any trend here that suggests that on my level,i should do that,though he added he was rather sympathetic to the argument.the judge granted the motion,now effectively a motion for jnov.
aztec was quite yet ready to throw in the towel.someone drove to sacramento on aztec behalf to pick up the verified certificate ordered earlier from the licensing board,and,on november,aztec brought an ex parte motion to reconsider the jnov,or alternatively for a new trial.aztec attorney presented a declaration asserting she had had notice from any of the pleadings licensure would be put at issue.according to her declaration,the board takes from six to ten days to complete a request for such a verified certificate.
it did work.the trial judge signed a judgment in favor of both womack and caballero.a notice of appeal was timely filed.
iii.discussion 
background 
subdivision a of section operates to deny access to the courts to contractors who were not licensed at all times during their performance,mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental metal works,cal th,hydrotech systems,oasis waterpark cal d,hydrotech franks construction,sahota th,alatriste cesar exterior designs,th.that proposition is dog bites man.
less well known is subdivision d of section,which requires production of a verified certificate of licensure when the issue of licensure is controverted,and so can operate to deny even licensed contractors any compensation.that phenomenon is man bites dog.see von esch,the code section that could cost you your construction case may law.
the best illustration of this possibility the spectre that haunted the trial judge here is advantec,supra,th.there a developer hired a plumber,then terminated the plumber.the developer sued for breach of contract.see id.at.the plumber for breach of contract,and of course alleged it had to that it was licensed.the developer filed a general denial,sans any specific challenge to the plumber licensure status.ibid.the case went to jury trial,and when the plumber tried to establish licensure by his testimony,the court ruled that could only be accomplished by a verified certificate.the plumber counsel then requested a continuance so as to be able to obtain a certificate from the license board,but the developer counsel already knew it would take at least two weeks,and told the court so.the court denied the continuance,and thereafter granted the developer nonsuit motion on the plumber based on the absence of a verified certificate.id.at.in the ensuing appeal the appellate court affirmed with implacable logic first,subdivision d requires a verified certificate if the issue of licensure is controverted,a general denial controverts the material allegations of the complaint,the plumber allegation it was licensed was material,ergo the issue of licensure was controverted second,the only way licensure could be proved was by producing a verified certificate,the plumber did produce a verified certificate at trial so the plumber lost.see id.at.
the result was reminiscent of sartre play no exit.there was no escape for the hopeless protagonist.the licensure issue could not be described as new matter requiring articulation in an affirmative defense advantec,supra,th at,and,under an abuse of discretion standard,the denial of the continuance could hardly be said to be unreasonable,especially since the nonsuit motion came near the end of a jury trial that had already consumed four days see id.at 
but the result in advantec and we do not disagree with the result or reasoning of the decision is not without irony.the legislative history of section,indicates that the potential within subdivision d to mislead licensed contractors into thinking no verified certificate was required was part of an effort by the legislature to prevent licensed contractors from needlessly losing cases because a verified certificate could not be procured in time.that is our case.
the history of subdivision d is a history of a pendulum swinging,as the great legal philosopher roger miller would say,like a pendulum do.section has been around since,when it was enacted as part of a comprehensive scheme to license contractors.see stats,ch.in its original incarnation there were no subdivisions.it simply said that no person could bring or maintain any action for any act or contract for which a license is required without alleging and proving he,she or it was duly licensed at all times during the performance of the act or contract.and those key words have remained in the statute,in the form of subdivision a,to this day.
a big change came in,in the form of assembly bill ab.the sponsor of ab was the license board itself,and the board main purpose was to close what the license board considered the loophole of the substantial compliance doctrine,which allowed for the possibility of recovery for some unlicensed work the legislation took dead aim at the substantial compliance doctrine with a new subdivision,then subdivision d,that sought to exclude all possibility of the doctrine application to contractor licensing actions it was ab that first inserted a verified certificate requirement into section see stats,ch,as former subdivision c 
but as written in the version of the statute,subdivision c had no if controverted clause.rather,the requirement of a verified certificate was absolute.contractors had to have a verified certificate of licensure to prove licensure,and they had to prove licensure to recover.the effect was that a verified certificate was required in every case.the theory behind the new need for a verified certification was tied to the overall purpose of ab,which was to eliminate the judicial doctrine of substantial compliance.the point of a verified certificate was to provide a bright line criterion to verify licensure without such a bright line it was feared courts might find a way to relapse into their old ways of excusing some unlicensed activity 
but it did take long for the doctrine of unintended consequences to rear its ugly head.by,the need to obtain a verified certificate in every case meant waits of up to six months for the necessary certificate.see buzgheia leasco sierra grove th,buzgheia,quoting assem.com.consumer protection,efficiency and economic,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.may,assembly consumer protection analysis.
the license board,swamped by having gotten what it wished for in,again sponsored an amendment to section in.this was assembly bill ab,which headed in the other direction.ab was intended to ameliorate the previously absolute requirement for a certificate by adding an if controverted clause to what was still at the time an absolute requirement for a certificate under subdivision c.the license board readily acknowledged that too many licensed contractors had already lost their cases because they could obtain a verified certificate in time what more,ab resurrected the doctrine of substantial compliance at least under certain limited circumstances not at issue in the case before us 
but there were still two major changes to be made before the verified certificate subdivision reached today version in,assembly bill ab clarified that contractors still had the burden of proving licensure and there was no need for persons they were suing for compensation to produce the verified certificate.see stats,ch.and finally,in,the verified certificate subdivision,formerly subdivision c,was renumbered as subdivision d to make room for a new subdivision b that allows for disgorgement suits by persons who have already paid an unlicensed contractor.see stats,ch,see also white cridlebaugh th,explaining the legislature wanted to give persons who deal with unlicensed contractors a sword in addition to the shield they already had.
neither of the two main california supreme court cases explicating section over the last years,hydrotech,supra,cal d and mw erectors,supra,cal th,have had occasion to confront the verified certificate provision in what is now subdivision d.hydrotech was decided in the wake of the compliance amendment,and decided that an unlicensed contractor could not even sue for fraud as a way around the plain terms of section,subdivision a.the hydrotech court noted the policy against any compensation for unlicensed contract work was intended to outweigh any harshness between the parties,so even a party who falsely promises to pay an unlicensed contractor can not be liable to that contractor.hydrotech,supra,cal d at,original italics omitted.along the way as befits a case decided in the aftermath of the amendments to section hydrotech made it clear that substantial compliance was outside the pale of section.see hydrotech,supra,at.
like hydrotech,mw erectors was focused on subdivision a of section,which has always been the core of section.subdivision a has always provided that a contractor must be licensed at all times during performance,and mw erectors is a set of variations on that theme.there,a steel contractor was licensed at the time the contract was made,or when performance was begun,but did obtain a license about two weeks after performance began and most of its performance occurred while it was licensed.see mw erectors,supra,cal th at.the intermediate appellate court read subdivision a to allow the steel contractor to recover for work done after it had obtained a license,but the supreme court concluded the actual language of subdivision a requires licensing at all times during performance and the legislature did not intend to allow any recovery without licensure at all times during performance.id.at.
there were no judicial admissions in the mw erectors case for the court to confront.there was a judicial estoppel argument,based on the idea that in related litigation against the owner of the project,a specialty metal contractor had implicitly represented to the owner and the owner general contractor that mw was fully licensed,and was thus able to obtain a settlement from the owner for amounts which necessarily were attributable to mw work.mw claimed the specialty metal contractor was thus estopped to assert nonlicensure in a case where mw was suing it.mw erectors,supra,cal th at.
the mw erectors court noted that neither the filed by the specialty metal contractor against the owner and its general contractor,nor its mechanic lien,contained any mention of the steel contractor work.however,in any event,said the high court,the steel contractor could not invoke judicial estoppel for the simplest of reasons,namely,subdivision a expressly precludes any action in law or equity.mw erectors,supra,cal th at.in that regard,the mw erectors court quoted hydrotech for the proposition that the bar of section a applies r egardless of the equities.mw erectors,supra,cal th at,quoting hydrotech,supra,cal d at.thus the mw erectors court concluded,citing subdivision a,that acceptance of mw judicial estoppel argument would mean that mw could recover compensation for work that required a license,even if mw was not licensed at all times during the performance of that work.a.mw erectors,supra,cal th at.
however,after emphasizing that subdivision a would be applied regardless of its harsh consequences and even if it means one party obtains an unjust windfall mw erectors,supra,cal th at,the court ended its judicial estoppel discussion with a passage that took a somewhat view of the judicial estoppel issue.we quote the entirety of the passage in the margin but two aspects of it stand out.one is the qualification that nothing we say here is intended to authorize or condone abusive manipulation of the courts and we emphasize the words abusive manipulation.the other is that such abuse can be avoided by normal discovery and investigation in that case,by the owner and its general contractor.see ibid.we note,however,that the mw erectors court stopped short of saying discovery and investigation were the exclusive means by which the abusive manipulation of the courts can be prevented.
application 
in our case,counsel for aztec was effectively trapped in a room with several doors,all locked from the outside,and in her opposition to the jnov motion she tugged at all of them.and we conclude the trial judge had no choice but to keep them all locked save one.
that one is the clear statement in womack complaint admitting aztec was licensed,and even going so far as to sue aztec license bonding company und
