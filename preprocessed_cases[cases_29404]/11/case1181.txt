in this case we consider whether portions of certain california statutes and regulations violate the dormant commerce clause.the challenged laws prevent licensed opticians from having specified business relationships with or offering services in the same locations as licensed optometrists and ophthalmologists.
the national association of optometrists and opticians,lenscrafters,and eye care centers of america,challenged a portion of the california statutes and regulations as violating the dormant commerce clause and moved for summary judgment.california attorney general and department of consumer affairs collectively the state opposed the motion.the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and entered the following declaratory judgment and injunction 
it is hereby declared that california business professions code,and,and two companion regulations,of,title and,are unconstitutional as they violate the dormant aspect of the commerce clause of the united states constitution,to the extent that individually,or taken together,they prohibit optical companies from offering prescription eyewear at the same location in which eye examinations are provided,and from advertising that eyewear and eye examinations are available in the same location.
defendants are hereby permanently enjoined and prohibited from enforcing california business professions code,and,and two companion regulations,of,title and,either individually,or taken together,so as to prohibit optical companies from offering prescription eyewear at the same location in which eye examinations are provided,and from advertising that eyewear and eye examinations are available in the same location.
the defendants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
as a preliminary matter,the state challenges the standing of two of the appellees,eye care centers of america and the national association of optometrists and opticians.it does not,however,challenge lenscrafters standing.as a general rule,in an injunctive case this court need not address standing of each plaintiff if it concludes that one plaintiff has standing.see preminger peake,cir.because lenscrafters unquestionably has standing,we must reach the question of whether the california laws violate the dormant commerce clause.thus,we do not address the challenge to the other appellees standing and refer to appellees collectively as lenscrafters.
dormant commerce clause 
the commerce clause as written is an affirmative grant of power to congress to regulate interstate commerce,but from it courts have long inferred a prohibition on state actions limiting interstate commerce.timber,wunnicke,d.this inference,commonly referred to as the dormant commerce clause,promotes a national market and the free flow of commerce between the states by preventing them from adopting economic protectionist policies.see motors tracy,d c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d.
under the dormant commerce clause,lenscrafters seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,arguing that portions of the california statutes and regulations are protectionist measures because they favor optometrists and ophthalmologists at the expense of opticians and optical companies out of state.the state responds that the california laws do not violate the dormant commerce clause because they are not impermissible economic protectionism instead,these laws prevent optometrists and ophthalmologists,as health care providers,from being unduly influenced by commercial interests,like lenscrafters.
the relevant statutes provide that licensed optometrists and opticians can not have any membership,proprietary interest,coownership,relationship,or any profitsharing arrangement in any form,directly or indirectly with each other.cal.bus.a b.they further provide that it is unlawful for an optician to advertise or furnish the services of an optometrist or ophthalmologist,employ an optometrist or ophthalmologist,maintain an optometrist or ophthalmologist on or near the optician premises,or duplicate or change lenses without a prescription from an optometrist or an ophthalmologist.id.an optician can not include in any advertisement relating to the sale of eyewear words that indicate the practice of optometry,id,and it is unprofessional conduct for an optician to advertise the services of an optometrist or ophthalmologist.cal.code regs.tit.if an optometrist rents space from a commercial concern,the rented space must be definite and apart from space occupied by other occupants of the premises,and the optometrist name or practice can not be linked in advertising or in any other manner with that of the commercial concern.id.
although the language of the statutes and regulations forbids several types of conduct,the district court noted that lenscrafters only challenged the prohibition on and advertising of optometric services 
plaintiffs challenge three sections of california business professions code,and,and two companion regulations,of regs,title and,to the extent these provisions taken together prohibit optical companies from offering prescription eyewear at the same location in which eye examinations are provided,and from advertising that eyewear and eye examinations are available in the same location.
ass of optometrists opticians lockyer,d.lenscrafters challenges the california laws primarily because optometrists and ophthalmologists can set up a practice where patients can get an eye examination and also buy prescription eyewear.opticians are unable to offer this convenience,which lenscrafters describes as shopping.
lenscrafters contends shopping provides a significant business advantage in the sale of eyewear.it also asserts that opticians are largely businesses,whereas optometrists and ophthalmologists are largely individuals or firms.thus,lenscrafters argues the california laws have a discriminatory effect on businesses because they prevent opticians from offering shopping while allowing optometrists and ophthalmologists to do so.
to address lenscrafters claim,we must first determine whether the dormant commerce clause is applicable to this case.the dormant commerce clause is implicated if state laws regulate an activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce such that congress could regulate the activity.conservation force,manning,cir.we conclude that the dormant commerce clause is applicable to this case because the retail sale of eyewear involves and affects interstate commerce such that congress could regulate in that area.see generally lenscrafters,robinson,cir.neither party challenges this premise.
once the dormant commerce clause applies,the next step is to determine whether the challenged california laws discriminate against entities.c a carbone,at.conservation force,at.laws that discriminate against entities are subject to strict scrutiny,while laws only need to satisfy a less rigorous balancing test to survive constitutional scrutiny.c a carbone,at.conservation force,at.
a statutory scheme can discriminate against interests in three different ways a facially,b purposefully,or c in practical effect.lenscrafters,at internal quotation omitted.in this case both parties agree that the california laws do not facially discriminate against entities,so we are left to consider whether the portion of the challenged laws have a discriminatory purpose or effect.
the district court discussed evidence of discriminatory purpose in this case,but it did not rely on the laws purpose in concluding that they are discriminatory.see ass of optometrists opticians,d at.the district court stated 
t he evidence shows that section,arguably the key provision being challenged,was introduced in the california legislature,as the act chief sponsor put it,on behalf of the california optometric association in an effort to protect california from some of the problems being experienced in eastern states,where large business interests have completely taken over the optometric profession.
id.omission in original.the court further stated,while this evidence does not shed further light on how the challenged restrictions operate in practice,it does buttress t
