guyana telephone and telegraph company appeals the district court dismissal of its claims under the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act.it also appeals the district court denial of its rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law on the amounts of compensatory damages and its restitution claim.
background 
is a guyanese corporation with a monopoly over the local phone network in the republic of guyana.in,entered into agreements with and mci to provide service between the united states and guyana.at all relevant times,and mci were the only two companies that could transfer calls to guyana.under separate agreements to provide service from the united states to guyana,mci and agreed to pay per minute for calls to guyana that had originated in the united states these charges are called termination payments.
sometime before,the year when the causative events occurred,began encouraging audiotext providers to route their phone traffic though guyana.audiotext providers are generally telephone companies that handle phone traffic with content of an adult nature.often these audiotext calls would originate in the united states,be sent to guyana,and then be sent back to consumers.this practice allowed to collect the termination payment from mci.the benefit for the audiotext companies was that,in exchange for routing phone traffic through guyana,would pay them a percentage of the mci termination payment.depending on the contract terms with each audiotext company,would kick back between and per minute for audiotext calls.in,audiotext calls produced approximately percent of revenue from termination payments.
claims arose from a scheme that deprived of termination fees that it would have received from mci.alleged that the scheme involved four defendants melbourne,a florida communications company that obtained calls from various carriers for delivery to a number of places in the western hemisphere wajay,melbourne general partner nacs,melbourne limited partner and chilesat,a provider of service for calls originating in chile.
under the defendants plan,melbourne solicited other communications carriers by offering low rates for calls to guyana and then entered into agreements with these companies.in august and september of,melbourne received and aggregated these calls at its facility in florida and then used telephone circuits owned by chilesat to transfer the calls from florida to mci international switching center in new jersey.this scheme made it appear as if the calls had originated in chile rather than in the thus,the contract between mci and did not seem to apply.
mci normally would have refused to send chilesat calls to guyana unless chilesat had paid termination payments to mci for the benefit of.chilesat circumvented this problem by misrepresenting to mci that it had a direct accounting relationship with.as a result,mci did not collect termination charges from chilesat because it believed that chilesat was paying termination charges directly to.therefore,because mci believed these calls originated in chile and because chilesat dishonestly convinced mci that it was paying termination charges,mci sent over one million minutes of calls to guyana without obtaining payment for if had received per minute for all of these calls,it would have received almost million in termination charges from mci.
brought its claims under civil rico,unjust enrichment tortious interference with contract,civil conspiracy,and the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act fdutpa or the act.it also sought punitive damages.the court entered a default judgment on liability as to all claims against chilesat,except for the fdutpa claim.the court dismissed the fdutpa claims as to all defendants when it granted the defendants rule motion at the close of evidence,reasoning that the fdutpa claims were improper because was not a consumer under the meaning of the act.on the claims that were permitted to proceed,the jury found melbourne and wajay liable for unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy.
as for damages,the jury found melbourne liable for plus prejudgment interest on the claim.notably,it used compensatory damages rather than restitution as the measure of recovery.on the claims,the jury awarded compensatory damages of plus prejudgment interest and in punitive damages against both melbourne and wajay.the court used the jury calculation when it assessed the default judgments against chilesat.pursuant to c,the court trebled the compensatory damages against chilesat on the civil rico claim,for a total award on this claim of plus prejudgment interest.it also entered default judgment against chilesat in the amount of plus prejudgment interest on the claim.in addition,the jury leveled punitive damages of against chilesat on the claim.
appeals three issues.first,contends that the district court erred in granting the defendants rule motion to dismiss fdutpa claims.argues that it was a consumer under the meaning of fdutpa as it stood in and,alternatively,that the district court should have applied the statute amendments retroactively.second,maintains that the district court erred in refusing to grant its rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law on the amount of its compensatory damages.contends that because the defendants deprived it of at least minutes of calls at per minute,the evidence would have compelled a reasonable jury to find damages of at least.third,argues that the district court erred when it refused to grant rule motion challenging the jury calculation of the claim.argues that the appropriate measure of recovery is the benefit conferred upon the defendants,which was.
ii.standard of review 
an appellate court reviews de novo a district court ruling on a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.combs plantation patterns,cir.seeks review of the district court decisions on two rule motions.accordingly,we review the entire appeal de novo.
iii.analysis 
whether the district court erred in dismissing claim under the fdutpa 
the district court dismissed fdutpa claims,concluding that could not avail itself of the statute because it was a than a consumer for the transactions in question.it also held that the fdutpa amendments should not apply retroactively to this case.we agree with the district court reasoning on both issues.
the transactions in question all occurred in,so the amendments to the fdutpa apply to this case.the definition of consumer in the version of the fdutpa included not only individuals but also various business organizations,including corporations.stat.ann.west.in,the florida legislature amended the stated purposes and rules of construction for the fdutpa to provide as its central aim the protection of the consuming public at large and legitimate business enterprises from those who engage in unfair methods of competition,or unconscionable,deceptive,or unfair acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.id.before,the same provision stated,to protect consumers from suppliers who commit deceptive and unfair trade practices.id.historical statutory notes.
argues that the amendments demonstrated a shift in the fdutpa to afford protection not just to consumers but also to any legitimate business enterprise that had been injured by an unfair or deceptive business practice.accordingly,argues that the fact that it was the supplier in this transaction should not prevent its fdutpa claims.at least one court has agreed with this general argument.see tampa bay storm,arena football league,wl.
here,in dismissing fdutpa claims,the district court cited of the act,which states,in any individual action brought by a consumer who has suffered a loss as a result of a violation of this part,such consumer may recover actual damages.the court reasoned that although the definition of consumer may include corporations and other business associations,florida courts have focused on the capacity in which a given entity was acting in determining whether the entity qualified as a consumer and as such could seek monetary damages under the fdutpa.the district court relied on warren technology,hines interests limited partnership,so d,and travel associates celebri
