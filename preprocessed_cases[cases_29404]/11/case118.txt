background 
deandrade purchased new windows for his home from a company called nescor in july of.at deandrade request,nescor agreed to arrange mortgage financing for the windows,although it did not specify the identity of the lender.deandrade and his wife signed documents in connection with this financing,which created a lien on their home nescor initially organized the financing through conseco finance conseco.when deandrade received notice of the first payment owed to conseco,however,the bill was greater than the amount that he had indicated to nescor that he would be willing to pay.deandrade complained,and nescor promised to remedy the situation,sending deandrade a check for with instructions to use the funds to pay the balance due conseco.shortly thereafter,deandrade received an invoice from keybank for approximately,an amount consistent with the original terms of his agreement with nescor 
deandrade made monthly payments to keybank,from september until june.the deandrades had never received copies of the loan documents,and at some point,apparently after speaking with a consumer attorney,deandrade wife contacted keybank to obtain copies of the documents.the deandrades were shocked to discover that the documents granted a mortgage on their residence to keybank and that their signatures on the documents appeared to have been forged.as a result,the deandrades filed suit against keybank in rhode island superior court on august,requesting declaratory relief as to the validity of the keybank mortgage in that complaint,deandrade alleged that he and his wife never signed any documents granting a mortgage on their home to keybank and never authorized nescor to do so on their behalf.
deandrade maintains that when he commenced the state lawsuit,he stopped sending the monthly payments to keybank and instead deposited them into an escrow account pending the resolution of that action.keybank notified the three major credit union,experian,and the alleged delinquent payments,and the bureaus updated deandrade credit report accordingly.through an attorney,deandrade then sent a letter dated july,to those three credit bureaus,advising them that the mortgage underlying the negative item reported by keybank had been fraudulently obtained and urging the bureaus to investigate the transaction attached to the letter were pages of documentation,including the rhode island superior court complaint,provided in support of deandrade allegations of fraud.experian deleted the keybank item after receiving deandrade letter,but trans union and equifax did not.
on august,trans union sent a letter to deandrade indicating receipt of his request to investigate the disputed item.trans union then contacted keybank to verify the accuracy of the item.trans union did not forward the documents it had received from deandrade to keybank,but rather sent keybank an automated dispute verification form acdv.the acdv stated that the customer d isputes acct status and believed the account to be not.keybank response verified deandrade name,address,social security number,month and year of birth,telephone number,and delinquent payment history.trans union then sent deandrade a notice,dated august,informing him that keybank had confirmed the item accuracy and advising him of his further rights under the fcra.trans union continued to publish the keybank debt on deandrade credit report,but deandrade did not contact trans union again before initiating this lawsuit.
on december,deandrade filed suit in the united states district court for the district of rhode island,claiming that trans union had violated a provision of the fcra,by failing to conduct a lawful reinvestigation of the disputed debt and failing to delete the allegedly inaccurate item from deandrade credit report.deandrade maintained that trans union refusal to delete the disputed item harmed him by negatively impacting his ability to obtain needed credit,such as a home refinancing.
trans union moved for summary judgment,arguing that the suit was an impermissible collateral attack on the validity of the keybank loan through the fcra,that deandrade had in any case ratified the loan and therefore the information published on his credit report was accurate,and that deandrade had failed to adduce evidence of negligent or willful noncompliance with the fcra considering the ratification issue to be dispositive,the magistrate judge addressed that issue only and found that deandrade had ratified the keybank debt,rendering trans union report of that debt accurate.noting that inaccuracy is a necessary element of an fcra claim,the magistrate judge recommended granting trans union summary judgment motion.the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommended decision and granted summary judgment to trans union 
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,with all reasonable inferences resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.fenton john hancock mut.life ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the party.a fact is material if it carries with it the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.s√°nchez alvarado,cir citations omitted.
if a consumer disputes the accuracy or completeness of any item contained in his or her consumer report,a requires consumer reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate.the magistrate judge reasoned that a necessary element of plaintiff claim is that the information trans union reported was inaccurate.deandrade trans union,llc,slip op.at,unpublished.this court has yet to opine on the question whether a plaintiff must show that the disputed information contained in a consumer report is inaccurate in order to prevail on a fcra claim the magistrate judge recommended decision and trans union brief on appeal cite a string of cases in support of the proposition that a showing of inaccuracy is essential.the relevant language in those cases,however,largely addresses claims brought under b,not indeed,in most of the cases cited,either no claim was asserted or the question of accuracy is not addressed directly.see,dalton capital associated,cir holding that a consumer reporting agency violates b if the consumer report contains inaccurate information and the reporting agency did not follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy spence trw,cir holding that plaintiff could not prevail on his b claim without proving the information in question was inaccurate henson csc credit,cir holding that i n order to state a claim under b,a consumer must sufficiently allege that a credit reporting agency prepared a report containing inaccurate information emphasis added citations omitted wadley ford motor credit,d,plaintiff alleged claim under a,which prohibits an entity from furnishing information relating to a consumer to a consumer reporting agency if i the entity has been notified by the consumer that specific information is inaccurate and ii the information is,in fact,inaccurate.emphasis in original dauster household credit,d,where plaintiff had conceded information reported by credit agency was accurate,plaintiff failed to state claim under fcra b see also wantz experian info.solutions,cir affirming summary judgment for defendant on a claim not on grounds that disputed information was accurate,but rather on grounds that disputed information was never reported to potential creditor and therefore plaintiff failed to show actual damages.but see cahlin motors acceptance,cir a section claim is properly raised when a particular credit report contains a factual deficiency or error that could have been remedied by uncovering additional facts that provide a more accurate representation about a particular entry.emphasis in original.
it is thus clear that to prevail on a b claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that his or her credit report sports an actual inaccuracy.looking at the statutory language,however,it is not immediately obvious that b and should be interpreted identically in this regard see kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d the starting point for interpretation of a statute is the language of the statute itself.citations omitted.b states whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.this language is not ambiguous it creates an obligation on the part of the consumer reporting agency to ensure the preparation of accurate reports independent from reinvestigation requirement.section requires consumer reporting agencies to reinvestigate free of charge if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly of such dispute.a a.it is thus not necessarily apparent,on the face of the statute,that a plaintiff must also adduce sufficient evidence to show that the disputed information was in fact inaccurate,as opposed to merely showing that the plaintiff disputed its accuracy and had informed the agency accordingly.
nevertheless,the weight of authority in other circuits indicates that without a showing that the reported information was in fact inaccurate,a claim brought under must fail.see dennis,llc,cir creates no duty to reinvestigate where the credit report accurately reflect s the status of the information contained in the public records citing williams colonial bank,kuehling trans union,llc,cir unpublished without evidence of some inaccuracy in the trans union report or reinvestigation,kuehling can not establish that trans union violated the b or a a cahlin,at.but see wadley experian info.solutions,cir unpublished vacating and remanding grant of summary judgment to defendant credit agency where district court found plaintiff failed to establish that credit report contained inaccurate information but did not address plaintiff claim,and plaintiff argued that agency had a duty to reinvestigate the credit report regardless of whether the report was accurate.dickens trans union,cir unpublished although a showing of inaccuracy is an essential element of a b claim it is unclear whether a showing of inaccuracy is required for liability citations omitted.
we find the reasoning of the majority of other appellate courts persuasive.the fcra is intended to protect consumers against the compilation and dissemination of inaccurate credit information.see equifax fed.trade comm n,cir noting stated purpose of fcra is to prevent consumers from being unjustly damaged because of inaccurate or arbitrary information in a credit report citations omitted,sess.the driving force behind the amendments to the fcra was the significant amount of inaccurate information that was being reported by consumer reporting agencies and the difficulties that consumers faced getting such errors corrected.at the very least,it is difficult to see how a plaintiff could prevail on a claim for damages under without a showing that the disputed information disclosed by the credit agency was,in fact,inaccurate.see wantz,at holding that plaintiff could not demonstrate a violation of absent evidence that defendant credit agency disclosed incorrect information to a third party salei am.exp.travel related servs,table,wl,at cir,unpublished even if a showing of inaccuracy is not a predicate to liability,damages would be almost impossible to prove without it.thus,if there is no genuine issue as to whether the keybank debt reported by trans union was inaccurate,deandrade claim fails as a matter of law.
the magistrate judge reasoned that the keybank item reported by trans union was accurate because deandrade ratified the keybank loan,and the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommended decision.however,w e are not committed to the district court reasoning,but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made apparent by the record.united states,cir see also intergen grina,cir.
to determine whether a consumer has identified a factual inaccuracy on his or her credit report that would activate reinvestigation requirement,t he decisive inquiry is whether the defendant credit bureau could have uncovered the inaccuracy if it had reasonably reinvestigated the matter.cushman,at citations omitted.the keybank debt reported by trans union does not fall under this rubric.here,there is no dispute that deandrade received windows financed by a mortgage on his home what deandrade is attacking is the mortgage validity.whether the mortgage is valid turns on questions that can only be resolved by a court of law,such as whether deandrade ratified the loan.this is not a factual inaccuracy that could have been uncovered by a reasonable reinvestigation,but rather a legal issue that a credit agency such as trans union is neither qualified nor obligated to resolve under the fcra.see cahlin,at no reasonable reinvestigation on the part of the credit agency could have uncovered an inaccuracy in cahlin report because there was never any factual deficiency in the report.
we therefore find it unnecessary to reach the question of ratification.the information reported by trans union was accurate not because deandrade had ratified the loan although that may also be true,but because it did not state any factual deficiency that could have been resolved by a reasonable reinvestigation conducted by the credit bureau.keybank did in fact have documentation granting it a mortgage on the residence of one deandrade who was in fact the same deandrade that had been making the loan payments and is the plaintiff in this case.determining whether deandrade was entitled to stop making those payments is a question for a court to resolve in a suit against deandrade did file a state suit against a job imposed upon consumer reporting agencies by the fcra.if a court had ruled the mortgage invalid and trans union had continued to report it as a valid debt,then deandrade would have grounds for a potential fcra claim.in essence,deandrade has crossed the line between alleging a factual deficiency that trans union was obliged to investigate pursuant to the fcra and launching an impermissible collateral attack against a lender by bringing an fcra claim against a consumer reporting agency.see wadley,d at the fcra does not provide a cause of action to collaterally attack an accurate credit report.williams.at a credit reporting agency has no duty,as a part of its reinvestigation,to go behind public records to check for accuracy or completeness when a consumer is essentially collaterally attacking the underlying credit information.the williams court noted that the fcra provides an alternative remedy for consumers in cases such as this pursuant to c,they may submit a statement detailing their version of the dispute to be included in their credit report.id.it is no fault of trans union that deandrade apparently chose not to avail himself of that option.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the summary judgment order of the district court.
the complaint also alleged a defamation claim against keybank.trans union is the only defendant remaining in this action the claims against equifax and keybank were dismissed after deandrade reached settlements
