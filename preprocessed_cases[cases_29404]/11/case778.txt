background 
avdo hukic obtained a mortgage from life savings bank in.the mortgage was for and had an interest rate of.the mortgage agreement required that he make monthly payments of as well as pay taxes,insurance premiums,and other charges or fines.the agreement allowed hukic as the borrower to pay the taxes and insurance premiums directly to the entities owed payment,provided that 
borrower shall promptly furnish to lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this paragraph.if borrower makes these payments directly,borrower shall furnish to lender receipts evidencing the payments.
hukic got off to a good start,making monthly payments of in a timely fashion.then,in april,hukic submitted a money order made out in the amount of to life savings bank.all should have been fine,as the amount was cents more than what he was required to pay,and he submitted it to the bank on time.for some reason,however,the money order was only processed as a payment of,and the bank only received that amount.
life savings bank assigned hukic loan to aurora loan services the next month and forwarded as hukic april payment.aurora notified hukic that his april payment was deficient and asked hukic to remit and request a refund from the money order issuer.hukic did not do so,later saying he did not have the time to do that.when hukic made monthly payments to aurora thereafter,aurora always applied his payment first to the amount that was due from the previous month,so aurora records continued to show hukic as one month delinquent.
when life savings bank assigned hukic loan to aurora,it also advised aurora that hukic hazard insurance had expired.aurora wrote to hukic and told him that if evidence of current insurance was not received within sixty days,aurora would set up an escrow account to pay the annual premium for the upcoming policy year,pursuant to the terms of the mortgage.aurora did not receive evidence of hazard insurance from hukic,so it advanced the funds.aurora also paid hukic property taxes of for the first half of because hukic had not submitted evidence that he was paying the taxes on his own.pursuant to the terms of the mortgage,aurora set up an escrow account for the reimbursement of the property taxes.aurora notified hukic of the increases to the amount due each month as a result of these accounts,but he continued to make monthly payments of.aurora reported hukic loan as delinquent to consumer credit reporting agencies in november of.
about four months later,aurora assigned hukic loan to another company,ocwen loan servicing.records ocwen received indicated that hukic had not made his january mortgage payment.on march,ocwen mailed hukic a notice of default.it stated that he needed to pay by april,to cure the deficiency in his account,and that failure to cure the default could result in foreclosure proceedings.on september,ocwen advanced to pay hukic property taxes and made an adjustment to his escrow account.ocwen also informed hukic that month that if he had paid the property taxes directly to the county without informing aurora or ocwen,he should obtain a refund of the property taxes and then remit the refund to ocwen to cure the deficiency in the escrow account.hukic did neither.when ocwen did not receive proof of payment,it advanced funds on two occasions in to pay hukic property taxes and adjusted his escrow account.
ocwen sent hukic over ten notices of default during and.on december,ocwen wrote hukic and told him that his loan had been transferred to ocwen early intervention department for review and possible foreclosure.on january,hukic counsel wrote to aurora.counsel stated that hukic had made timely payments to aurora and was paying his property taxes directly,and also that hukic had been unable to refinance his home due to negative information from aurora on his credit reports.counsel wrote a similar letter to aurora later in the year.
on november,foreclosure proceedings began against hukic in illinois state court.on may,the state court wrote in an order that ocwen had agreed to accept reinstatement of monthly payments and the parties will continue to negotiate the escrow issue.a month later,in an order dated june,the state court dismissed the foreclosure proceedings and stated that hukic had tendered proof of payment of real estate taxes for and the first installment of.hukic later prepared an application for a property tax refund and directed that the county pay a refund of the duplicate property tax payments to ocwen.
on april,hukic notified transunion,a credit reporting agency,that he disputed the status of his ocwen account and asked transunion to investigate.one month later,transunion informed hukic that the negative credit information reported by ocwen had been deleted from his credit report.hukic later credit reports reflected an adverse account associated with aurora but not with ocwen.
hukic filed suit against aurora and ocwen in illinois state court on july.he maintained that he had been denied refinancing,loans and credit as a result of false information conveyed by aurora and ocwen to consumer reporting agencies.aurora timely removed the case to federal court,and hukic did not seek to remand the case.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss seven of the counts alleged in the complaint.it later granted summary judgment to the defendants on the remaining claims for violation of the fair credit reporting act,breach of contract,and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.hukic appeals.
ii.analysis 
subject matter jurisdiction 
hukic first challenge is to our jurisdiction.he maintains that the notice of removal failed to establish diversity jurisdiction on its face,and,therefore,the federal court never had subject matter jurisdiction.although hukic did not raise this argument in the district court,it is always a federal court responsibility to ensure it has jurisdiction,so we turn to that question first.see arbaugh y h,d.we analyze jurisdiction based on the events at the time the case is brought.grupo dataflux atlas global group,d olympia,linee aeree italiane,cir.when a case is initially filed in state court and then removed to federal court,the rule means that we analyze our jurisdiction at the time of removal,as that is when the case first appears in federal court.dep t of corrs.schacht,d tropp life ins,cir.
the federal removal statute authorizes a defendant to remove any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction.a see.dep t of,at,d.one circumstance in which federal courts have original jurisdiction is when the lawsuit is between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy is over.a.paragraph four of aurora notice of removal invoked the federal court jurisdiction on that basis the notice also stated that hukic was an illinois citizen and that aurora is a delaware limited liability company and has its principal place of business in colorado.but for diversity jurisdiction purposes,the citizenship of a limited liability company is the citizenship of each of its members.thomas guardsmark,llc,cir hicklin eng g,bartell,cir c a corporation is a citizen of the states of its incorporation and principal place of business.the notice of removal therefore gave two pieces of irrelevant information about aurora the state of its principal place of business and that it was a delaware company while failing to provide the information critical to determining its citizenship the citizenship of its members.
aurora has informed us on appeal that its sole member is lehman brothers bank.at the time of removal,lehman brothers bank it has since been renamed was a federally chartered savings association.see thomas,at assessing citizenship of limited liability company members at time notice of removal filed.in contrast to corporations,the citizenship of federally chartered corporations and savings associations has not always been straightforward.the supreme court held in louis san francisco ry.james,that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it was chartered for diversity jurisdiction purposes.the court later held that a corporation chartered pursuant to an act of congress with activities in different states,on the other hand,was not a citizen of any state for diversity jurisdiction purposes.bankers trust texas pacific ry.in,congress enacted a provision now codified at c that made a corporation a citizen of the states of its incorporation and the location of its principal place of business.this provision meant that local companies could no longer bring suit in federal court on the basis of a corporate charter that had been obtained in another state.see trade finance,petra int l banking.
with bankers trust in the background,many courts concluded that c applied only to state corporations and not to federally chartered corporations or associations.the result for these courts was that,unless a specific statutory provision dictated otherwise,a federally chartered savings association was not a citizen of any state,meaning it was not eligible for diversity jurisdiction courts sometimes recognized an exception if activities were localized in one state.see,loyola fed.sav.bank fickling,cir provident bank of cal.federal savs.loan ass n,aff,cir see also feuchtwanger lake hiawatha fed.credit union,cir discussing localization exception in case not governed by c.
congress has now stepped in.after this case had been removed to federal court,congress added a provision to the united states code that states 
in determining whether a federal court has diversity jurisdiction over a case in which a federal savings association is a party,the federal savings association shall be considered to be a citizen only of the state in which such savings association has its home office.
x.although the provision became effective after the removal here,the defendants maintain that x applies in this case with the result that lehman was a citizen of delaware,where it had its home office.aurora points in support to the supreme court pronouncement that i ntervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction apply in pending cases,whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.landgraf usi film products,d see first midwest bank metabank,wl,at,applying x to case pending at time of provision passage.but see world savs.bank,fsb wu,wl,at.may,declining to apply x retroactively and concluding court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
there is another complication,though,which the parties did not discuss.that is the fact that even if x applies to cases where the removal occurred before the provision took effect,the provision text says that it applies in cases where a federal savings association is a party.a party is o ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought.see ex rel eisenstein city of new york,d citing black law dictionary ed.in this case,hukic sued aurora and ocwen,not lehman,so it is not clear that x controls lehman citizenship.netjets aviation,lhc commc ns,llc,cir stating members of a limited liability company are generally not liable for the entity debts see also creaciones con idea,de mashreqbank psc,cir finding use of party in conferred federal jurisdiction only when federally chartered corporation was a party to banking suit and did not extend to predecessor of a party.congress may have wanted a federal savings association to be considered the citizen of the state of its home office in any diversity jurisdiction determination,and the heading of the section adding x does state clarifying citizenship of federal savings associations for federal court jurisdiction,albeit.financial services regulatory relief act of,stat,emphasis added.perhaps congress will see fit to clarify its clarification.
we can put all this aside,however,because we have jurisdiction for another reason.a federal court also has original jurisdiction over a cause that arises under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.hukic complaint has from the very beginning stated a claim under a federal statute,the fcra.the federal court had original jurisdiction over the fcra claim.
the next question is whether the presence of claims in the complaint somehow means we lack subject matter jurisdiction.to answer that question we turn to.section a provides in relevant part 
i n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action with such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.
section c says that district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection a if certain conditions are met.
section a,not section c,is the relevant provision for our jurisdictional question.the supreme court has explained with respect to supplemental jurisdiction in particular,a federal court has jurisdiction over specified claims,which it may or may not choose to exercise.carlsbad,hif bio,d.in contrast,the district court exercise of its discretion under c is not a jurisdictional matter.id.at quoting moore et,moore federal practice,ed.the notice of removal and attached complaint make clear that all of hukic claims arise out of the servicing of hukic mortgage loan by aurora and ocwen and the reports those entities made to credit reporting agencies,and the claims arise out of the same case or controversy.see united mine workers gibbs,d okolie trans union llc,wl,at june,finding claims for fcra,breach of contract,and defamation shared common nucleus of operative fact wiggins hitchens,concluding that fcra,tortious interference with a contract,and conspiracy claims formed part of same case or controversy.
therefore,the federal court had jurisdiction over the claims in hukic complaint.we point out that this discussion likely would have been much shorter had the notice of removal also explicitly stated that along with provided a basis for removal.for in addition to the subject matter jurisdiction requirement for removal,there is also the statutory requirement that the defendant file a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,together with a copy of all process,pleadings,and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.a.we are sometimes unable to proceed if the notice of removal does not make the basis of federal jurisdiction clear,such as when there is an allegation in the notice that contains the parties residence but not their domicile,as the latter is the critical information we need to determine whether we have jurisdiction based on diversity.see northern league,gidney,cir per curiam finding that removal notice allegation of residence and not domicile presented genuine jurisdictional problem mcmahon,cir granting motion to amend pleadings under to supply missing jurisdictional details.
here,however,the basis of original jurisdiction was clear.the notice of removal states that the complaint alleged a claim under the fcra and cited the pertinent united states code provision,and the notice also stated that such a claim could be brought in federal or state court.the notice also states that all the claims arose out of aurora and ocwen servicing of hukic loan,and the attached complaint confirmed that the claims were part of the same case or controversy as the fcra claim.and,unlike in gavin v.at t,cir,where the defendant never argued an alternate basis of federal jurisdiction even when pressed,the defendants here affirmatively argued to first time that jurisdiction was raised as an federal question jurisdiction exists.we are satisfied that we have jurisdiction,and we will proceed to the merits.
procedural arguments 
effect of illinois state court foreclosure action 
in the first of several procedural arguments,hukic argues that the district court failed to give the state court foreclosure judgment full faith and credit.see licari city of chicago,cir federal courts must give state court judgments same preclusive effect they would have in state court.aurora and ocwen stipulated that the foreclosure judgment was entitled to full faith and credit,and the district court orally granted a motion to afford the judgment full faith and credit.although it later denied a formal motion as moot,that denial does not suggest that the district court failed to afford the foreclosure judgment its proper credit,and we find nothing in the district court decision indicating it failed to do so.
hukic true objection seems to be to the interpretation the district court gave to the state court judgment.hukic maintains that the foreclosure judgment meant that aurora and ocwen should have been collaterally estopped from raising any arguments in this case concerning his performance under the terms of the mortgage.the state court order reflects that resolution of the foreclosure action was an involuntary dismissal pursuant to illinois supreme court rule,and hukic emphasizes that the rule provides that unless specified otherwise,an involuntary dismissal of an action,other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,for improper venue,or for failure to join an indispensable party,operates as an adjudication upon the merits.
it is true that an adjudication on the merits is one of the prerequisites for collateral estoppel.in re,see also barbers,hairstyling for men women,bishop,cir.it is not the only one,however.collateral estoppel only bars relitigation of an issue already decided in a prior case.in re,at quoting people tenner.that is,the issue decided in the prior adjudication must be identical to the one presented in the suit in question for collateral estoppel to apply.see also boelkes harlem consolidated sch.dist,d.collateral estoppel does not apply here.the foreclosure judgment bears no indication that the issue of hukic compliance with his obligations under the mortgage had been litigated and decided in his favor.instead,the substance of the june,state court order dismissing the foreclosure action states only that hukic had tender ed proof of payment of cook.real estate taxes for tax year and first installment of.if that statement is relevant here at all,it is to suggest that prior to that time,when aurora and ocwen were providing information to credit reporting agencies,hukic had not submitted proof of his payment of his property taxes.the may,state court order also does not help hukic.it stated that ocwen agreed to accept reinstatement of monthly payments.the illinois statute concerning reinstatement provides that in any foreclosure of a mortgage which has become due through acceleration because of a default under the mortgage,a mortgagor may reinstate the mortgage.comp.stat,and r instatement is effected by curing all defaults then existing,id.the use of reinstatement in the may order therefore suggests a prior default,and an order stating that ocwen had agreed to reinstatement does not constitute a determination that hukic had complied with the terms of his mortgage agreement prior to that date.
finally,the district court interpretation of the state court judgment did not violate the doctrine as hukic suggests.the supreme court has emphasized the narrowness of the doctrine,stating it is confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.in short,the doctrine prevents a party from effectively trying to appeal a decision in a federal district or circuit court.see lance dennis,d.no one in this case is attempting to challenge the rulings in the state court foreclosure proceeding.aurora and ocwen are not the plaintiffs in the federal suit,nor do they challenge the foreclosure judgment or seek to resume foreclosure proceedings in this suit.the doctrine has not been violated.
denial of leave to file second amended complaint 
we turn next to hukic contention that the district court abused its discretion when it denied him leave to file a second amended complaint.although leave to amend should be freely given.a,that does not mean it must always be given.d instruct courts have broad discretion to deny leave to amend where there is undue delay,bad faith,dilatory motive,repeated failure to cure deficiencies,undue prejudice to the defendants,or where the amendment would be futile.arreola godinez,cir.
several of those circumstances apply here.hukic did not seek leave to file his second amended complaint until three days before the close of fact discovery and one day after hukic deposition.when he did so,he sought to add eleven new causes of action against the existing defendants as well to add a third defendant yet discovery on the other claims,including numerous depositions,had already taken place with only the initial claims in mind.see ferguson roberts,cir upholding denial of leave to file amended complaint where proposed complaint contained new complex and serious charges which would undoubtedly require additional discovery for the defendants to rebut internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that the reason hukic gave for requesting leave late in the process did not justify granting leave so late in the game.hukic says he learned of other pending lawsuits against ocwen that involved mortgage servicing issues shortly before he requested leave to amend,and he said he only discovered the other suits when comment logs he received from the defendants during discovery raised questions.but the existence of lawsuits against ocwen was publicly available information,available long before he sought leave to amend.the principal case to which he points,for example,had been pending against ocwen since.therefore,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to deny leave to file a second amended complaint.
substantive arguments 
hukic argues that material issues of fact remain that preclude summary judgment on his breach of contract,tortious interference with a credit expectancy,and fcra claims.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,with the familiar standard that summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the record demonstrates that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.see.c holmes potter,cir.hukic also challenges the dismissal of his claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
breach of contract and tortious interference claims 
summary judgment was proper on the breach of contract and tortious interference claims because there were no genuine issues of material fact precluding its entry.even if we disregard the shortfall that resulted when the money order for was processed only for,hukic still failed to comply with his contractual requirement that he submit proof he was paying his property taxes directly to the county and that he was buying his own insurance.see catania local of communications workers of,d,stating plaintiff must demonstrate its performance with contract requirements to succeed on breach of contract claim.the mortgage agreement provided that hukic could pay the taxes and insurance premiums directly,but only if he promptly furnish ed receipts evidencing his payments.
despite repeated requests,hukic did not furnish evidence that he had been paying his taxes directly to the county until his foreclosure proceeding.nor did he submit evidence that he was paying insurance premiums on his own.hukic does not contest that he was repeatedly advised that he was behind on his mortgage and that he was told how to cure the deficiency.because he did not do so,the servicers continued to make the tax and insurance payments,which the mortgage agreement allowed them to do.the result,though,was that hukic was in default on his mortgage and not complying with his contractual requirements.
although hukic maintains issues of fact exist as to,for example,the nature of the relationship between the parties and whether ocwen was on notice of hukic damages,none creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether hukic was in default.hukic uniform commercial code argument also fails to address the breach of contract associated with the tax and insurance funds in the escrow account.he argues that the operation of uniform commercial code section.comp.stat,meant that his obligations were discharged when he gave a money order in the amount of to life savings bank.but that does not address the larger breach related to the tax and insurance amounts.summary judgment was proper on his breach of contract claim.
summary judgment was similarly proper on the tortious interference claim.a tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim requires,among other things,an intentional and unjustified interference by the defendant.voyles sandia mortgage.in voyles,the supreme court of illinois held that a tortious interference claim premised on allegedly inaccurate credit reporting can not succeed when a mortgage servicer truthfully reports a loan as in foreclosure,even when the underlying events leading to the foreclosure are disputed and the loan is later reinstated.id.at.similarly here,hukic was in breach of the terms of his loan,and it was not inaccurate to tell credit reporting agencies that hukic had defaulted on his mortgage.therefore,summary judgment was proper on the tortious interference claim as well.
fair credit reporting act claim 
hukic also contests the district court grant of summary judgment to aurora and ocwen on his fcra claim.in addition to imposing obligations on consumer reporting agencies,the fcra contains requirements for entities such as aurora and ocwen that furnish information to those agencies.for example,an entity can not furnish information if it knows or has reasonable cause to know the information is inaccurate.a a.because hukic had not complied with his obligations under the mortgage agreement regarding the amounts aurora and ocwen paid for taxes and insurance,aurora and ocwen were not furnishing false information when they informed consumer reporting agencies that he was behind on his payments.
in b,the fcra mandates that a fter receiving notice pursuant to section a of this title of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided to a consumer reporting agency,the furnisher must conduct an investigation regarding the disputed information and report the results to the agency.if the investigation concludes that a disputed item is inaccurate or can not be verified,the furnisher must promptly modify,delete,or block the reporting of that information.b e.
on april,hukic sent a letter to the credit reporting agency transunion that disputed the status of his ocwen account,and he asked transunion to investigate.transunion conveyed information to ocwen regarding hukic dispute in accordance with its obligation under a.ocwen removed the negative information it reported on or before may.ocwen therefore complied with its obligations under the fcra.
although ocwen removed hukic negative information after its investigation,aurora continued to report that hukic account with it had been delinquent.hukic never notified any credit reporting agencies that he disputed the status of his aurora account.he argued to the district court,however,that ocwen had a duty to inform aurora that items on hukic credit report were disputed.although hukic maintained that ocwen was aurora,there is no evidence in the record that aurora hired ocwen to assist it in transacting its affairs.see ayh holdings,avreco,d.he also argued that ocwen had constructive knowledge that aurora reported hukic as late after ocwen received access to hukic credit report,but he does not point to any provision in the fcra that would require an information furnisher to investigate information reported by other entities.summary judgment was therefore proper on hukic claim under b as well.
defamation claim 
hukic also appeals the district court grant of the defendants motion to dismiss his claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.we review the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted de novo.chaudhry indiana,cir.we accept the complaint allegations as true and draw all favorable inferences in the plaintiff favor.id.
we first address the defamation count,which was premised on reports aurora and ocwen made to credit reporting agencies that his payments were past due.hukic complaint alleged these reports were false and that he had been denied refinancing,loans and credit as a result.the fcra bars defamation suits against entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies based on information such as that provided by aurora and ocwen except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.h.because hukic alleged in his complaint that the defendants acted with malice,the district court declined to grant the defendants motion to dismiss on preemption grounds.instead,it granted the motion to dismiss the defamation claim for failure to file suit within the statute of limitations.hukic appeals that determination.
our consideration of whether the statute of limitations barred this claim requires us to act how we think the supreme court of illinois would if faced with this question.rodrigue olin employees credit union,cir.illinois defamation actions have a statute of limitations.comp.stat.bryson news am.pub ns,rowan novotny,d.the statute of limitations on a defamation count in illinois generally begins to run on the date of publication of the allegedly defamatory material.bryson,at tom olesker ex citing world of fashion,dun bradstreet.under certain circumstances,namely when a publication was hidden,inherently undiscoverable,or inherently unknowable,illinois courts apply the discovery rule such that the statute of limitations does not accrue until the plaintiff knew or should have known of the defamatory report.blair.landing,d,see tom olesker,at cause of action against credit reporting agency that prohibited distribution of reports to did not accrue until plaintiff knew of allegedly defamatory report.in this case,the district court concluded that hukic knew about the defendants reports to credit reporting agencies at the latest in january when hukic counsel sent a letter to aurora questioning the report.because hukic filed suit more than a year later,the district court ruled that hukic defamation claim was.
although the defendants urge us to apply this analysis on appeal as well,the statute of limitations analysis in this case involves more than an inquiry into whether the discovery rule should be applied to a single allegedly defamatory publication.hukic complaint alleged that aurora continued to make false statements to consumer reporting agencies as of the complaint filing date.that raises the question of whether the supreme court of illinois would conclude that the statute of limitations barred even the false reports that hukic alleged had occurred within the year preceding hi
