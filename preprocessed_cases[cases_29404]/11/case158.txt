this case raises important questions about the scope of privacy protection afforded internet users under the electronic communications privacy act of ecpa.
in sum,pharmaceutical companies invited users to visit their websites to learn about their drugs and to obtain rebates.an enterprising company,pharmatrak,sold a service,called netcompare,to these pharmaceutical companies.that service accessed information about the internet users and collected certain information meant to permit the pharmaceutical companies to do comparisons of website traffic and usage.most of the pharmaceutical companies were emphatic that they did not want personal or identifying data about their web site users to be collected.in connection with their contracting to use netcompare,they sought and received assurances from pharmatrak that such data collection would not occur.as it turned out,some such personal and identifying data was found,using easily customized search programs,on pharmatrak computers.plaintiffs,on behalf of the purported class of internet users whose data pharmatrak collected,sued both pharmatrak and the pharmaceutical companies asserting,inter alia,that they intercepted electronic communications without consent,in violation of the ecpa.
the district court entered summary judgment for defendants on the basis that pharmatrak activities fell within an exception to the statute where one party consents to an interception.the court found the client pharmaceutical companies had consented by contracting with pharmatrak and so this protected pharmatrak.see in re pharmatrak.privacy,d.the plaintiffs dismissed all ecpa claims as to the pharmaceutical companies.this appeal concerns only the claim that pharmatrak violated title i of the ecpa.
we hold that the district court incorrectly interpreted the consent exception to the ecpa we also hold that pharmatrak intercepted the communication under the statute.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.this does not mean that plaintiffs case will prevail there remain issues which should be addressed on remand,particularly as to whether defendant conduct was intentional within the meaning of the ecpa.
pharmatrak provided its netcompare service to pharmaceutical companies including american home products,pharmacia,smithkline beecham,pfizer,and novartis from approximately june to november.the pharmaceutical clients terminated their contracts with pharmatrak shortly after this lawsuit was filed in august.as a result,pharmatrak was forced to cease its operations by december.
netcompare was marketed as a tool that would allow a company to compare traffic on and usage of different parts of its website with the same information from its competitors websites.the key advantage of netcompare over software was its capacity to allow each client to compare its performance with that of other clients from the same industry.
netcompare was designed to record the webpages a user viewed at clients websites how long the user spent on each webpage the visitor path through the site including her points of entry and exit the visitor ip address and,for later versions,the webpage the user viewed immediately before arriving at the client site,the referrer url this was not visible to users of the pharmaceutical clients websites.according to wes sonnenreich,former chief technology officer of pharmatrak,and timothy macinta,former managing director for technology of pharmatrak,netcompare was not designed to collect any personal information whatsoever.
netcompare operated as follows.a pharmaceutical client installed netcompare by adding five to ten lines of html code to each webpage it wished to track and configuring the pages to interface with pharmatrak technology.when a user visited the website of a pharmatrak client,pharmatrak html code instructed the user computer to contact pharmatrak web server and retrieve from it a tiny,invisible graphic image known as a clear gif or a web bug.the purpose of the clear gif was to cause the user computer to communicate directly with pharmatrak web server.when the user computer requested the clear gif,pharmatrak web servers responded by either placing or accessing a persistent cookie on the user computer.on a user first visit to a webpage monitored by netcompare,pharmatrak servers would plant a cookie on the user computer.if the user had already visited a netcompare webpage,then pharmatrak servers would access the information on the existing cookie.
a cookie is a piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser that the browser software is expected to save and to send back whenever the browser makes additional requests of the server such as when the user visits additional webpages at the same or related sites.a persistent cookie is one that does not expire at the end of an online session.cookies are widely used on the internet by reputable websites to promote convenience and customization.cookies often store user preferences,login and registration information,or information related to an online shopping cart.cookies may also contain unique identifiers that allow a website to differentiate among users.
each pharmatrak cookie contained a unique alphanumeric identifier that allowed pharmatrak to track a user as she navigated through a client site and to identify a repeat user each time she visited clients sites.if a person visited in june and in july,for example,then the persistent cookie on her computer would indicate to pharmatrak that the same computer had been used to visit both sites as netcompare tracked a user through a website,it used javascript and a javaapplet to record information such as the urls the user visited.this data was recorded on the access logs of pharmatrak web servers.
pharmatrak sent monthly reports to its clients juxtaposing the data collected by netcompare about all pharmaceutical clients these reports covered topics such as the most heavily used parts of a particular site which site was receiving the most hits in particular areas such as investor or media relations and the most important links to a site.
the monthly reports did not contain any personally identifiable information about users.the only information provided by pharmatrak to clients about their users and traffic was contained in the reports and executive summaries thereof.slides from a pharmatrak marketing presentation did say the company would break data out into categories and provide user profiles.in practice,the aggregate demographic information in the reports was limited to the percentages of users from different countries the percentages of users with different domain extensions,the percentages of users originating from,government,academic,or other organizations and the percentages of versus repeat users.an example of a netcompare user profile is the average novartis visitor is a visitor from the,visiting from a.com domain.
while it was marketing netcompare to prospective pharmaceutical clients,pharmatrak repeatedly told them that netcompare did not collect personally identifiable information.it said its technology could not collect personal information,and specifically provided that the information it gathered could not be used to identify particular users by name.in their affidavits and depositions,executives of pharmatrak clients consistently said that they believed netcompare did not collect personal information,and that they did not learn otherwise until the onset of litigation.some,if not all,pharmaceutical clients explicitly conditioned their purchase of netcompare on pharmatrak guarantees that it would not collect users personal information.for example,pharmacia april contract with pharmatrak provided that netcompare would not collect personally identifiable information from users.michael sonnenreich,chief executive officer of pharmatrak,stated unequivocally at his deposition that none of his company clients consented to the collection of personally identifiable information.
pharmatrak nevertheless collected some personal information on a small number of users.pharmatrak distributed approximately million persistent cookies through netcompare.the number of unique cookies provides a rough estimate of the number of users pharmatrak monitored plaintiffs expert was able to develop individual profiles for just users.
the following personal information was found on pharmatrak servers names,addresses,telephone numbers,email addresses,dates of birth,genders,insurance statuses,education levels,occupations,medical conditions,medications,and reasons for visiting the particular website pharmatrak also occasionally recorded the subject,sender,and date of the email message a user was reading immediately prior to visiting the website of a pharmatrak client.most of the individual profiles assembled by plaintiffs expert contain some but not all of this information.
the personal information in of the user profiles was recorded due to an interaction between netcompare and computer code written by one pharmaceutical client,pharmacia,for one of its webpages.starting on or before august,and ending sometime between december,and february,the client pharmacia used the get method to transmit information from a rebate form on its detrol website the webpage was subsequently modified to use the post method of transmission.this was the source of the personal information collected by pharmatrak from users of the detrol website.
web servers use two methods to transmit information entered into online forms the get method and the post method.the get method is generally used for short forms such as the search box at and other online search engines.the post method is normally used for longer forms and forms soliciting private information when a server uses the get method,the information entered into the online form becomes appended to the next url.for example,if a user enters respiratory problems into the query box at a search engine,and the search engine transmits this information using the get method,then the words respiratory and problems will be appended to the query string at the end of the url of the webpage showing the search results.by contrast,if a website transmits information via the post method,then that information does not appear in the url.since netcompare was designed to record the full urls of the webpages a user viewed immediately before and during a visit to a client site,pharmatrak recorded personal information transmitted using the get method.
there is no evidence pharmatrak instructed its clients not to use the get method.the detailed installation instructions pharmatrak provided to pharmaceutical clients ignore entirely the issue of the different transmission methods.
in addition to the problem at the detrol website,there was also another instance in which a pharmaceutical client used the get method to transmit personal information entered into an online form.the other personal information on pharmatrak servers was recorded as a result of software errors.these errors were a bug in a popular email program reported in may and subsequently fixed and an aberrant web browser.
on june,plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint against pharmatrak its parent company,glocal communications,and five pharmaceutical companies american home products,glaxo wellcome,pfizer,pharmacia,and smithkline beecham plaintiffs alleged nine counts including violation of title i of the ecpa,et violation of title ii of the ecpa,et violation of the computer fraud and abuse act,violation of.laws ch,violation of.laws ch.invasion of privacy trespass to chattels and conversion and unjust enrichment.
pharmatrak,glocal,and a number of the pharmaceutical defendants moved for summary judgment in august.in support of their motion,pharmatrak and glocal submitted affidavits by macinta,pharmatrak former managing director for technology,and wes sonnenreich,pharmatrak former cto,as well as written descriptions of its technology and installation method and a sample monthly report delivered to pharmaceutical clients.the pharmaceutical defendants also submitted affidavits and other documents in support of their motions.
plaintiffs argued that before summary judgment they should be allowed to conduct discovery on pharmatrak servers and to conduct.b depositions on employees of each defendant.discovery of the servers was necessary,plaintiffs argued,to determine what information netcompare had extracted from website users and transferred to pharmatrak computers.at a hearing on december,the court ordered discovery of the servers and rule b depositions of the defendants 
the plaintiffs employed computer scientist matthew curtin and his company,interhack,to analyze pharmatrak servers between december,and january.in about an hour,curtin wrote three custom computer programs,including,to extract and organize personal information on pharmatrak web server access logs,which he colloquially termed haystacks.curtin then the information he extracted with other sources such as internet telephone books.plaintiffs also conducted the rule b depositions.
after discovery was completed,pharmatrak,glocal,and other defendants renewed their motions for summary judgment plaintiffs opposed these motions and moved for summary judgment against pharmatrak and glocal on the claim based on title i of the ecpa.
following a hearing on the motions,the district court issued a memorandum and order on august,denying plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granting in part defendants summary judgment motions.in re pharmatrak privacy,d at.the court held that the claim against pharmatrak under title i of the ecpa was precluded because the pharmaceutical defendants consented to the placement of code for pharmatrak netcompare service on their websites.id.at.the court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all federal law causes of action it then declined to retain jurisdiction over the state law causes of action and dismissed them without prejudice.id.at.

elements of the ecpa cause of action 
ecpa amended the federal wiretap act by extending to data and electronic transmissions the same protection already afforded to oral and wire communications.nimmer,federal statutory restrictions,in information law,ch,para,at.the paramount objective of the wiretap act is to protect effectively the privacy of communications.gelbard united states,d accord united states vest,cir see bartnicki vopper,d.
the wiretap act provides a private right of action against one who intentionally intercepts,endeavors to intercept,or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept,any wire,oral,or electronic communication.a see providing a private right of action.the wiretap act defines intercept as the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,electronic,or oral communication through the use of any electronic,mechanical,or other device.id.thus,plaintiffs must show five elements to make their claim under title i of the ecpa that a defendant intentionally intercepted,endeavored to intercept or procured another person to intercept or endeavor to intercept the contents of an electronic communication using a device.this showing is subject to certain statutory exceptions,such as consent.
in its trial and appellate court briefs,pharmatrak sought summary judgment on only one element of a,interception,as well as on the statutory consent exception.we address these issues below.pharmatrak has not contested whether it used a device or obtained the contents of an electronic communication.this is appropriate.the ecpa adopts a broad,functional definition of an electronic communication.brown waddell,cir.this definition includes any transfer of signs,signals,writing,images,sounds,data,or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire,radio,electromagnetic,photoelectric,or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce,with certain exceptions unrelated to this case.transmissions of completed online forms,such as the one at pharmacia detrol website,to the pharmaceutical defendants constitute electronic communications.see united states steiger,cir konop hawaiian airlines,cir.
the ecpa also says that contents,when used with respect to any wire,oral,or electronic communication,includes any information concerning the substance,purport,or meaning of that communication.this definition encompasses personally identifiable information such as a party name,date of birth,and medical condition.see gelbard,at.see generally nix,cir federal wiretap statute broadly define s contents.finally,it is clear that pharmatrak relied on devices such as its web servers to capture information from users.
consent exception 
there is a pertinent statutory exception to a where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act d.plaintiffs,of course,bear the burden of establishing a violation of the ecpa.williams poulos,cir.our case law is unclear as to who has the burden of showing the statutory exception for consent.united states lanoue,cir,suggests the burden is on the party seeking the benefit of the exception,here the defendant.lanoue held that,when the defendant sought a mistrial on the grounds that the government violated,the prosecution had the burden to establish the statutory law enforcement exception.see also united states jones,cir when defendant in criminal prosecution seeks to suppress intercepted communications,the burden is on the government to prove consent pursuant to c however,there is language in poulos which could be read to say that the burden is on the party asserting a violation of the act.at.the issue of who has the burden to show consent was not directly addressed in smith,cir,an earlier case.we think,at least for the consent exception under the ecpa in civil cases,that it makes more sense to place the burden of showing consent on the party seeking the benefit of the exception,and so hold.that party is more likely to have evidence pertinent to the issue of consent.plaintiffs do not allege that pharmatrak acted with a criminal or tortious purpose.therefore,the question under the exception is limited to whether the pharmaceutical defendants gave consent to the interception.because the district court disposed of the case on the grounds that pharmatrak conduct fell within the consent exception,we start there.
the district court adopted pharmatrak argument that the only relevant inquiry is whether the pharmaceutical companies consented to use pharmatrak netcompare service,regardless of how the service eventually operated.in doing so,the district court did not apply this circuit general standards for consent under the wiretap act and the ecpa set forth in.it also misread two district court opinions on which it purported to rely chance avenue a,d,and in re doubleclick.privacy litigation,d.
this court addressed the issue of consent under the wiretap act in.a party may consent to the interception of only part of a communication or to the interception of only a subset of its communications.see,at.thus,a reviewing court must inquire into the dimensions of the consent and then ascertain whether the interception exceeded those boundaries.gilday dubois,cir quoting,at.consent may be explicit or implied,but it must be actual consent rather than constructive consent.poulos,at see also united states footman,cir the question of consent,either express or implied,may vary with the circumstances of the parties.pharmatrak argues that it had implied consent from the pharmaceutical companies.
consent should not casually be inferred,at.without actual notice,consent can only be implied when the surrounding circumstances convincingly show that the party knew about and consented to the interception.berry funk,internal quotation omitted accord lanoue,at see also watkins berry,cir k nowledge of the capability of monitoring alone can not be considered implied consent.
the district court made an error of law,urged on it by pharmatrak,as to what constitutes consent.it did not apply the standards of this circuit.moreover,doubleclick and avenue a do not set up a rule,contrary to the district court reading of them,that a consent to interception can be inferred from the mere purchase of a service,regardless of circumstances.if these cases did so hold,they would be contrary to the rule of this circuit established in.doubleclick and avenue a,rather,were concerned with situations in which the defendant companies clients purchased their services for the precise purpose of creating individual user profiles in order to target those users for particular advertisements.see avenue a,d at,doubleclick,d at.this very purpose was announced by doubleclick and avenue a publicly,as well as being.see avenue a,d at doubleclick,d at.these decisions found it would be unreasonable to infer that the clients had not consented merely because they might not understand precisely how the user demographics were collected.see avenue a,d at doubleclick,d at.the facts in our case are the mirror image of those in doubleclick and avenue a the pharmaceutical clients insisted there be no collection of personal data and the circumstances permit no reasonable inference that they did consent.
on the undisputed facts,the client pharmaceutical companies did not give the requisite consent.the pharmaceutical clients sought and received assurances from pharmatrak that its netcompare service did not and could not collect personally identifiable information.far from consenting to the collection of personally identifiable information,the pharmaceutical clients explicitly conditioned their purchase of netcompare on the fact that it would not collect such information.
the interpretation urged by pharmatrak would,we think,lead to results inconsistent with the statutory intent.it would undercut efforts by one party to a contract to require that the privacy interests of those who electronically communicate with it be protected by the other party to the contract.it also would lead to irrational results.suppose pharmatrak,for example,had intentionally designed its software,contrary to its representations and its clients expectations,to redirect all possible personal information to pharmatrak servers,which collected and mined the data.under the district court approach,pharmatrak would nevertheless be insulated against liability under the ecpa on the theory that the pharmaceutical companies had consented by simply buying pharmatrak product.or suppose an internet service provider received a parent consent solely to monitor a child internet usage for attempts to access sexually explicit the isp installed code that monitored,recorded and cataloged all internet usage by parent and child alike.under the theory we have rejected,the isp would not be liable under the ecpa.
nor did the users consent.on the undisputed facts,it is clear that the internet user did not consent to pharmatrak accessing his or her communication with the pharmaceutical companies.the pharmaceutical companies websites gave no indication that use meant consent to collection of personal information by a third party.rather,pharmatrak involvement was meant to be invisible to the user,and it was.deficient notice will almost always defeat a claim of implied consent.see poulos,at campiti walonis,cir.pharmatrak makes a frivolous argument that the internet users visiting client pharmacia webpage for rebates on detrol thereby consented to pharmatrak intercepting their personal information.on that theory,every online communication would provide consent to interception by a third party.
interception requirement 
the parties briefed to the district court the question of whether pharmatrak had intercepted electronic communications.if this question could be resolved in pharmatrak favor,that would provide
