in february,victoria secret ran a marketing campaign promoting its new line of beauty rush product.as part of that promotion,victoria secret stores sold or gave away a hot pink tank top with the word delicious written across the chest in silver typescript.fortune dynamic,fortune,the owner of the incontestable trademark delicious for footwear,sued victoria secret for trademark infringement.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of victoria secret.mindful that summary judgment is generally disfavored in the trademark arena,entrepreneur media,smith,cir quotation marks omitted,we reverse and remand for trial.
since fortune has been in the business of designing and selling footwear for women,young women,and children.in,fortune began using delicious as a trademark on its footwear for young women.two years later,in,fortune registered the delicious trademark for footwear on the principal register of the patent and trademark office.
for most of the time relevant to this appeal,fortune depicted delicious in standard block lettering with a capital 
fortune spends approximately a year advertising its footwear.in the period from to,fortune sold more than million pairs of delicious shoes.delicious shoes are featured on fortune website and in its catalogs,and have appeared in fashion magazines directed specifically to young women,including cosmo girl,elle girl,teen people,twist,in touch,seventeen,latina,ym,shop,cb,marie claire,and life style.delicious footwear is available in authorized retail outlets throughout the united states 
victoria secret is a company specializing in intimate apparel.it sells a wide variety of lingerie,beauty products,and personal care products in its retail stores.in february,victoria secret launched a line of personal care products under the trademark beauty rush.at the same time,it started a promotion that included giving away a gift package of beauty rush lip gloss importantly for our pink tank top to anyone who purchased of beauty product the tank top was folded inside a clear plastic pouch with the lip gloss and a coupon for a future beauty rush purchase.across the chest of the tank top was written,in silver typescript,the word delicious with a capital on the back,in much smaller lettering,there appeared the word yum,and the phrase beauty rush was written in the back collar.victoria secret models were featured wearing the tank top,as were mannequins on display tables.victoria secret distributed delicious tank tops in connection with its beauty rush promotion,which lasted until march.those tank tops not sold or given away during the promotion were sold at victoria secret sale a few months later.
victoria secret executives offered two explanations for using the word delicious on the tank top.first,they suggested that it accurately described the taste of the beauty rush lip glosses and the smell of the beauty rush body care.second,they thought that the word served as a playful,as if the woman wearing the top is saying,i delicious.no one at victoria secret conducted a search to determine whether delicious was a registered trademark,but victoria secret had run a very similar promotion several months earlier,this one in conjunction with the launch of its very sexy makeup.that promotion also included a tank top,but that tank top was black ribbed with very sexy written in hot pink crystals across the chest.very sexy is a victoria secret trademark.
in march,fortune filed a complaint alleging that victoria secret use of delicious on its tank top infringed fortune rights in its delicious mark.after the district court denied fortune motion for a preliminary injunction,victoria secret moved for summary judgment.in its opposition to victoria secret motion for summary judgment,fortune submitted two pieces of expert evidence the marylander survey with an accompanying declaration and the fueroghne declaration,both of which we discuss below.
invoking its duty to scrutinize carefully the reasoning and methodology underlying the expert opinions offered,the district court excluded all of fortune proffered expert evidence.without any of fortune expert evidence before it,the district court granted victoria secret motion for summary judgment,holding that the factors used to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion weigh ed in favor of victoria secret,and that fortune claims were entirely barred by the fair use defense.fortune brought this timely appeal.

eight factors,sometimes referred to as the sleekcraft factors,guide the inquiry into whether a defendant use of a mark is likely to confuse consumers the similarity of the marks the strength of the plaintiff mark the proximity or relatedness of the goods or services the defendant intent in selecting the mark evidence of actual confusion the marketing channels used the likelihood of expansion into other markets and the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers of the defendant product.amf sleekcraft boats,cir.this analysis is pliant,illustrative rather than exhaustive,and best understood as simply providing helpful guideposts.brookfield commc ns,at see e j gallo winery gallo cattle,cir this list of factors,while perhaps exhausting,is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.the sleekcraft factors are not a scorecard,a,or a checklist.thane,at.some factors are much more important than others,and the relative importance of each individual factor will be.brookfield commc ns,at.
the lanham act provides some affirmative defenses,see.b,one of which allows an accused infringer to avoid liability by showing that it has used the plaintiff trademark fairly,id.b.to establish a fair use defense,the defendant must show that it used the term fairly and in good faith only to describe its goods or services.id.we have recognized a nominative fair use defense and a classic fair use defense.nominative fair use applies where a defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product,cairns franklin mint,cir emphasis added,whereas classic fair only defense at issue a defendant use of a descriptive term in its primary,descriptive sense,id.at quotation marks omitted.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and must view the evidence in the light most favorable to fortune.in re caneva,cir.summary judgment is improper if there are any genuine issues of material fact facts which,under the governing substantive law,could affect the outcome of the case.id.quotation marks and ellipses omitted.a genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.at quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
this case is yet another example of the wisdom of the principle that b ecause of the intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,summary judgment is generally disfavored in the trademark arena.entrepreneur media,at quotation marks omitted.we are far from certain that consumers were likely to be confused as to the source of victoria secret pink tank top,but we are confident that the question is close enough that it should be answered as a matter of fact by a jury,not as a matter of law by a court.see thane,at likelihood of confusion is a factual determination.
the same is true of victoria secret reliance on the lanham act fair use defense.although it is possible that victoria secret used the term delicious is,in its primary,descriptive sense we think that a jury is better positioned to make that determination.kp permanent,lasting impression i,cir kp permanent ii noting that genuine issues of material fact indicate that the fact finder should determine whether the defense of fair use has been established.
we begin with the sleekcraft factors as a way of framing our discussion.we are going to discuss each factor,but we will devote most of our attention to the similarity of the marks,the strength of fortune mark,the proximity of the goods,and the evidence of actual confusion.
although some of the sleekcraft factors will not always be helpful in assessing the likelihood of confusion,the similarity of the marks has always been considered a critical question in the analysis,walt disney,cir.three general principles help determine whether marks are similar.first,s imilarity is best adjudged by appearance,sound,and meaning.entrepreneur,at.second,the marks must be considered in their entirety and as they appear in the marketplace,at.third,similarities are weighed more heavily than differences.id.
victoria secret makes two arguments against finding that the marks are similar.first,victoria secret argues that its use of delicious differed completely in font,color,size and purpose from fortune mark.second,victoria secret says that it is inconceivable that a customer inside a victoria secret retail store could believe that the pink tank top with delicious written on it,which was surrounded by beauty rush product,could possibly have originated with fortune dynamics.
victoria secret is correct that the marks have markedly different appearances.fortune mark is written in black,block letters on the inside heel of the shoe and on the shoe box.victoria secret delicious,by contrast,is written in silver cursive lettering across the chest of a hot pink tank top.on the other hand,there are substantial similarities between the marks.first,there is the obvious the marks sound the same and look similar because they are the same word,delicious.moreover,in each case the word delicious appears alone,and not adjacent to any other word or symbol.and there is reason to think that they share the same meaning,as they are attached to items of clothing and appear to evoke desirability and pleasure.
victoria secret second argument is also not without force.it does seem unlikely that a knowledgeable consumer would believe that fortune,which markets its shoes in a number of different retail outlets,would be selling a tank top in a victoria secret store.the record reveals,however,evidence of individuals including pop star brittney spears wearing victoria secret delicious pink tank top on the street.this evidence suggests the possibility of confusion,which,we have held,can establish the required likelihood of confusion under the lanham act.karl storz endoscopy,surgical,cir see levi strauss blue bell,cir.in such instances,at least,when knowledgeable consumers see the delicious tank top outside victoria secret stores,it seems at least plausible that they could be confused as to who produced the tank top.
thus,in light of the principle that similarities between marks are weighed more heavily than differences and our recognition of confusion,a jury could reasonably conclude that the similarity of marks factor weighs in favor of fortune.
we turn next to the strength of fortune delicious mark.as a general matter,t he more likely a mark is to be remembered and associated in the public mind with the mark owner,the greater protection the mark is accorded by trademark laws,at.a mark strength is evaluated conceptually and commercially.id.
a mark conceptual strength depends largely on the obviousness of its connection to the good or service to which it refers.the less obvious the connection,the stronger the mark,and vice versa.using a list originally formulated by judge friendly,see abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir,marks are placed in one of five categories,ranging from weakest to strongest generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,and fanciful,at.at one end of the spectrum,generic marks refer to the genus of which the particular product is a species,such as bread or door,and are not registerable as trademarks.park n fly,dollar park fly.at the other end of the spectrum are arbitrary words with no connection to the as apple computers and camel cigarettes,and fanciful words with no discernable as kodak film and sony electronics that are inherently distinctive and therefore receive maximum trademark protection.entrepreneur,at.in the middle are descriptive marks,which describe the qualities or characteristics of a good or service and only receive protection if they acquire secondary meaning,park n fly,at,and suggestive marks,which require a consumer to use imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark significance and automatically receive protection,zobmondo entm t,llc falls media,llc,cir quotation marks omitted.
categorizing trademarks is necessarily an imperfect science.far from being neatly distinct and discrete,trademark categories often blur at the edges and merge together.zatarains,oak grove smokehouse,cir,overruled in part by kp permanent,lasting impression i,kp permanent i.the labels are more advisory than definitional,more like guidelines than pigeonholes.not surprisingly,they are somewhat difficult to articulate and to apply.see also abercrombie,at the lines of demarcation are not always bright.the line between descriptive and suggestive marks is nearly incapable of precise description.lahoti vericheck,cir l egions of trademark lawyers can stay busy arguing about how marks in the middle,not so plainly descriptive,nor so plainly suggestive,should be categorized.
a suitable starting place for attempting to draw the line between a suggestive and a descriptive mark is the dictionary.zatarains,at see also surgicenters of,med.dental surgeries,cir while not determinative,dictionary definitions are relevant and often persuasive in determining how a term is understood by the consuming public.with that in mind,two tests help distinguish between a descriptive and a suggestive mark.first,a mark is more likely suggestive if it passes the imagination test,which asks whether the mark requires a mental leap from the mark to the product.brookfield commc ns,at see also mccarthy,trademarks and unfair competition ed.mccarthy is some reflection or multistage reasoning process necessary to cull some direct information about the product from the term used as a mark.t he imagination test is the primary criterion for evaluating whether a mark is suggestive.zobmondo,at quotation marks omitted.second,a mark is more likely suggestive if it passes the competitor test,which asks whether the suggestion made by the mark is so remote and subtle that it is really not likely to be needed by competitive sellers to describe their goods.id.at quotation marks omitted mccarthy.
delicious carries several different meanings,including affording great pleasure,appealing to one of the bodily senses esp ecially involving the sense of taste or smell,delightfully amusing,a definition the dictionary itself calls obsolete characterized by or sensuous pleasure.webster third new international dictionary.it commonly refers to that which is tasted,smelled,or otherwise savored with maximum pleasure and keenest appreciation.id.
we think that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether fortune delicious mark is suggestive or descriptive.the distinction is important here because if the mark is suggestive,there is a stronger likelihood that a jury could reasonably conclude that the strength of the mark factor favors fortune.on the one hand,some evidence points to a finding that delicious as applied to footwear is merely descriptive.to the extent delicious means affording great pleasure,for example,it seems to directly convey a real and unequivocal idea of some characteristic,function,quality or ingredient of the product or service.mccarthy.by that definition,delicious on footwear is nothing more than advertising,a factor that cuts against categorizing the mark as suggestive.see zobmondo,at m erely descriptive marks need not describe the essential nature of a product it is enough that the mark describe some aspect of the product.quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,a reasonable jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to fortune,might focus more on the taste and smell definitions of delicious.in that event,the connection between delicious and footwear becomes much more attenuated,indicating that the mark is suggestive because it requires a mental leap from the mark to the product.brookfield commc ns,at.in contrast with food,to which this definition of delicious has a direct connection,one arguably must use some reasoning process to get from delicious to footwear.mccarthy.delicious is not a descriptor the average consumer would associate with shoes.
for the same reasons,other shoe companies are unlikely to need to rely on the word delicious to describe their goods.indeed,we are aware of no other shoe companies,and victoria secret points to none,that use the word delicious to describe their product.see zobmondo,at.in sum,because w hich category a mark belongs in is a question of fact,id.at,and because the decision as to whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive is frequently made on an intuitive basis rather than as a result of a logical analysis susceptible of articulation,lahoti,at quoting pizzeria uno temple,cir,we think a jury should assess the conceptual strength of fortune mark in the first instance.
fortune also presented evidence of the delicious mark commercial strength,which takes into account a mark actual marketplace recognition.brookfield commcn,at.although we have said that a suggestive mark is a comparatively weak mark,sleekcraft,at,we have also noted that advertising expenditures can transform a suggestive mark into a strong mark,brookfield commcn,f d at.here,fortune proffered evidence indicating that it spends approximately yearly marketing its footwear and that it sold pairs of delicious shoes from to.in addition,fortune has advertised its delicious footwear in a variety of popular magazines,including cosmo girl,elle girl,teen people,twist,in touch,seventeen,latina,ym,shop,cb,marie claire,and life style.whatever its ultimate force,this evidence is sufficient to make the relative commercial strength of the delicious mark a question for the jury.
a genuine issue of material fact also exists,under the proximity of goods factor,with respect to whether fortune footwear and victoria secret tank top are related.where goods are related or complementary,the danger of consumer confusion is heightened.e j gallo winery,at.in addressing this factor,our focus is on whether the consuming public is likely somehow to associate fortune delicious footwear with victoria secret tank top.brookfield commc ns,at see also recot,becton,noting that the relevant question is whether the goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods.
victoria secret contends that the fact that two goods are used together does not,in itself,justify a finding of relatedness.shen ritz hotel.we have no objection to that general proposition,but the products at issue in shen did not have the same relationship as the products at issue here.the court in shen was comparing cooking classes and kitchen textiles,which,the court held,the consuming public was unlikely to perceive as originating from the same source because one is a service and the other a tangible good.id.at.here,by contrast,both of the products at footwear and a female tank tangible goods and are targeted to the same consumers young women.indeed,the products are complementary.see,avon shoe david crystal,cir noting that shoes and apparel are goods which serve both common functions and common purchasers.given the intuitively close relationship between women shoes and apparel in the minds of the consuming public,a jury could reasonably conclude that the proximity of the goods factor favors fortune.
not surprisingly,evidence of actual confusion can also support a finding of likelihood of confusion.perhaps b ecause of the difficulty in garnering such evidence,sleekcraft,at,we have held that s urvey evidence may establish actual confusion,thane,at.here,the district court refused to admit a survey conducted by howard marylander showing that consumers were actually confused by victoria secret use of the word delicious on its promotional tank top.

a district court abuses its discretion if it base s its decision on an erroneous legal standard.stormans,selecky,cir quotation marks omitted.we have long held that survey evidence should be admitted as long as it is conducted according to accepted principles and is relevant.wendt host int l,cir see clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir southland sod farms stover seed,cir e j gallo winery,at keith volpe,cir.furthermore,we have made clear that technical inadequacies in a survey,including the format of the questions or the manner in which it was taken,bear on the weight of the evidence,not its admissibility.keith,at see wendt,at challenges to survey methodology go to the weight given the survey,not its admissibility.
howard marylander,who holds an in marketing from the university of southern california,has been retained in cases to conduct a survey to determine the likelihood of confusion as to the source of goods or services.here,marylander conducted an survey among young women ages fifteen to to determine the likelihood of confusion between fortune delicious footwear and victoria secret tank top.the survey was conducted online using an panel consisting of members,ages thirteen to.most survey participants met two criteria in the past six months they had purchased shoes and a tank top or in the next six months they planned to purchase shoes and a tank top.participants were excluded if anyone in their household worked in the advertising industry.
marylander divided the respondents into a test group and a control group,each composed of members.the members of the test group were exposed to pictures of fortune delicious shoes and victoria secret delicious tank top,one at a time and in rotated order.they were then asked a series of questions about whether they thought the two marks come from the same company,related companies,or they did not know.the same protocol was followed with the control group,of which there were also members,except that instead of the word delicious on the tank top,of the control group saw the word beautiful,saw fabulous,and saw incredible.
of those in the test group,believed that the delicious shoes and the delicious tank top came from the same company.an additional thought that the companies that created the shoes and the tank top were related or associated.in the control group,thought the products came from the same company,and thought the companies were related or associated.marylander concluded that of the test group confused the products,as compared to only in the control group,and that the difference was statistically significant.
according to marylander,the survey results strongly suggested that there was a likelihood of confusion among consumers between fortune delicious shoes and victoria secret delicious tank top.he based this conclusion on three principal factors the disparity between the amount of confusion in the test group and the control group the unusually high disparity between those who believed the products came from the same company and the fact that the disparity in confusion levels would have been higher if respondents had not seen beauty rush in the back collar,as was the case for those consumers who only saw the tank top on models or mannequins.
the district court excluded the marylander survey because the survey compared the products,failed to replicate real world conditions,failed to properly screen participants,and was highly suggestive.the district court supported most of its reasoning by reference to unpublished district court decisions,only one of which even falls within the ninth circuit.the court one citation to ninth circuit precedent,moreover,is not helpful.in support of its conclusion that the survey should not have compared the products,the district court cited our decision in levi strauss blue bell,cir,in which we noted that i t is axiomatic in trademark law that comparison is not the test.id.at.but that statement,far from setting forth a standard for admitting survey evidence,merely provided support for our recognition of the possibility of confusion.see id.at wrangler use of its projecting label is likely to cause confusion among prospective purchasers who carry even an imperfect recollection of strauss mark and who observe wrangler projecting label after the point of sale.it is axiomatic in trademark law that comparison is not the test.emphasis added.indeed,the question of the admissibility of survey evidence nowhere surfaced in levi strauss.what makes the district court misuse of levi strauss even more glaring is its failure to mention even one of the numerous cases in which we have held that survey evidence should be admitted as long as it is conducted according to accepted principles and is relevant.wendt,at.in sum,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the survey because marylander appears to have conducted the survey in accordance with accepted principles,and because the results of the survey are relevant to the ultimate question whether victoria secret use of delicious was likely to confuse consumers.
by way of comparison,we approved of a similar survey in thane.there,the expert conducting the survey selected people over the age of who had purchased a bike in the last three years or planned to purchase one within the next year.see thane,at.these bike enthusiasts were interviewed in shopping malls throughout the country.three hundred of the respondents were shown pictures of trek products and orbitrek products and asked questions about the companies association.the remaining,the control group,were shown the same trek pictures,but saw pictures from yukon,a third company,instead of from orbitrek.id.at.the principles applied in the marylander survey are virtually indistinguishable.three hundred respondents were asked to compare pictures of delicious shoes and the delicious tank top,and then to answer questions about the companies that produced them.a different group of respondents were shown slightly different pictures and asked the same questions.marylander then tabulated the results to come to a conclusion regarding the likelihood of confusion.
to be sure,as victoria secret argues and as the district court noted,the marylander survey has a number of shortcomings,including the fact that it was conducted over the internet thereby failing to replicate real world conditions,may have been suggestive,and quite possibly produced counterintuitive results.but these criticisms,valid as they may be,go to issues of methodology,survey design,reliability,and critique of conclusions,and therefore go to the weight of the survey rather than its admissibility.clicks billiards,at daubert merrell dow,vigorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.viewing the survey in the light most favorable to fortune,as we must,we conclude that the survey creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether consumers were confused by victoria secret use of delicious.
the next sleekcraft factor focuses our attention on the relative sophistication of the relevant consumer,and the degree of care likely to be exercised by that consumer.the reference point for this factor is the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution.sleekcraft,at.as we explained in sleekcraft,this standard includes the ignorant and the credulous.id.we expect the typical buyer to be more less easily he is purchasing expensive items.brookfield commc ns,at.on the other hand,when dealing with inexpensive products,customers are likely to exercise less care,thus making confusion more likely.id.
the parties vigorously contest the relative sophistication of the young women purchasing their products.victoria secret argues that p urchasers of apparel are considered sophisticated consumers.for support,victoria secret points to one court observation that young women are likely to exercise a significant degree of care in purchasing their clothing,since the name of the particular designer is important in the fashion world.kookai,shabo,s.on the other hand,as fortune points out,we have noted the absence of a clear standard for analyzing moderately priced goods,such as clothing.surfvivor media,survivor,cir.and a wellrespected commentator on trademark law has questioned the wisdom of sweeping judicial observation s about relative sophisticated buying habits based on gender.mccarthy.
we can not determine with any degree of confidence the relative sophistication of the parties consumers.nor are we confident of the implications of finding that the consumers are sophisticated.we think it possible that a discerning consumer might immediately connect the products more readily than an unsophisticated consumer.whoever right,the difficulty of trying to determine with any degree of confidence the level of sophistication of young women shopping at victoria secret only confirms the need for this case to be heard by a jury.
there are also genuine issues of material fact with respect to the remaining factors marketing channels,likelihood of expansion,and victoria secret intent.we recognize that some evidence related to these factors supports victoria secret.for instance,the fact that fortune is exclusively a wholesaler that sells its shoes to a number of authorized retail outlets,while victoria secret is primarily a retailer,operating approximately retail stores nationwide under its own name,cuts against fortune.as for the likelihood of expansion,fortune has entered a licensing agreement with chaz to use the delicious mark on clothing,but there is no indication that chaz has begun using the license and victoria secret no longer creates any clothing with the word delicious on it.finally,aside from the fact that victoria secret failed to investigate the possibility that delicious was being used as a mark before promoting its tank top,there is little evidence that victoria secret intended to trade on fortune goodwill.
nonetheless,l ikelihood of confusion is a factual determination,and district courts should grant summary judgment motions regarding the likelihood of confusion sparingly.thane,at.granting summary judgment in cases in which a majority of the sleekcraft factors could tip in either direction is inconsistent with that principle.because a jury could reasonably conclude that most of the sleekcraft factors weigh in fortune favor,wendt,at see kp permanent ii,at,the district court erred in granting victoria secret motion for summary judgment on the question of likelihood of confusion.
we next turn to victoria secret argument that its use of the word delicious was protected by the lanham act fair use defense.b.long before the lanham act was enacted,the supreme court explained that t he use of a similar name by another to truthfully describe his own product does not constitute a legal or moral wrong,even if its effect be to cause the public to mistake the origin of the product.william warner eli lilly.congress codified this common law principle in the lanham act fair use defense,which allows a party to use a descriptive word otherwise than as a mark and fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party,or their geographic origin.b.in establishing that its use was fair,the defendant is not required to negate confusion.kp permanent i,at.this is because,although the lanham act is less than clear on the subject,the supreme court recently clarified that,consistent with eli lilly,some possibility of consumer confusion must be compatible with fair use.id.at.finally,victoria secret subjective good faith is relevant to the inquiry,but the overall analysis focuses on whether victoria secret use of delicious was objectively fair.id.at.
the fair use defense stems from the undesirability of allowing anyone to obtain a complete monopoly on use of a descriptive term simply by grabbing it first.id.at see park n fly,dollar park and fly,noting that the lanham act was not intended to create an exclusive right to use language that is descriptive of a product.to avoid monopolization,a company such as victoria secret may invoke a trademark term in its descriptive sense regardless of the mark classification as descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.brother records,iv.jardine,cir.in other words,how fortune delicious mark is categorized as a matter of conceptual strength has no bearing on whether victoria secret is entitled to the fair use defense.
according to victoria secret,it should prevail on the fair use defense because,as the lanham act provides,it used the term delicious otherwise than as a mark,only to describe its goods or services,and in good faith.b.we think there is some merit to victoria secret argument,but ultimately conclude that the question of fair use,like the question of likelihood of confusion,should be resolved by a jury.we consider each of the fair use factors in turn.
we first consider whether the district court correctly ruled,as a matter of law,that victoria secret used delicious otherwise than as a mark.b.the lanham act defines a trademark as something used to identify and distinguish goods and to indicate the source of the goods.id.to determine whether a term is being used as a mark,we look for indications that the term is being used to associate it with a manufacturer.sierra online,phoenix software,cir.indications of trademark use include whether the term is used as a symbol to attract public attention,ja apparel abboud,cir,which can be demonstrated by the lettering,type style,size and visual placement and prominence of the challenged words,mccarthy.another indication of trademark use is whether the allegedly infringing user undertook precautionary measures such as labeling or other devices designed to minimize the risk that the term will be understood in its trademark sense.restatement third of unfair competition cmt.c restatement see also packman chicago tribune,cir noting,in finding fair use,that the newspaper joy of six plainly indicat ed the tribune as the source.
here,there is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that victoria secret was using delicious as a trademark.delicious was written in large letters,with a capital d,and in silver typescript across the chest,suggesting that victoria secret used the word to attract public attention.further,there is little evidence that victoria secret employed precautionary measures to avoid confusion with fortune mark.it is true that the word yum appeared on the back of the tank top and beauty rush appeared in its back collar.but a jury could reasonably conclude that those words did not detract from the overall message broadcast loudly on the front of the shirt,delicious.perhaps most important,victoria secret used delicious in a remarkably similar way to how it uses two of its own and very sexy.pink is written in bold capital letters on different items of victoria secret clothing,while very sexy was written,in hot pink crystals,across the chest of a similar tank top during a very similar promotion.the fact that victoria secret used delicious in the same way that it uses other victoria secret trademarks could be persuasive evidence to a jury that victoria secret used,or at least intended to establish,delicious as a trademark.
in support of its argument that victoria secret used delicious as a trademark,fortune attempted to introduce the testimony of expert dean feuroghne,a advertising and marketing professional,who would have testified that victoria secret used delicious as a trademark.we think the district court acted within its discretion to exclude this portion of fueroghne testimony the basis of his knowledge regarding trademark use is not entirely clear.more important,fueroghne opinion does not assist the jury because the jury is well equipped to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the issue of trademark usage without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.fed.evid.advisory committee note quoting mason ladd,expert testimony,vand.even though we agree that this portion of fueroghne proffered testimony was properly excluded,we believe that there still remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether victoria secret used delicious as a trademark.
a genuine issue of material fact also remains with respect to whether victoria secret used the word delicious only to describe its goods or services.b.to prevail on this factor,we have held,a defendant must establish that it used the word in its primary,descriptive sense or primary descriptive meaning.brother records,at.as a practical matter,it is sometimes difficult to tell what factors must be considered to determine whether a use is descriptive.emi catalogue hill,holliday,connors,cosmopulos,cir.we agree with the restatement,however,that the scope of the fair use defense varies with what we will call the descriptive purity of the defendant use and whether there are other words available to do the describing.see restatement,cmt.
victoria secret makes two factual and one support of its argument that it used delicious descriptively.as to facts,victoria secret says that it used delicious merely to describe the flavorful attributes of victoria secret beauty rush lip gloss and other products that feature the same popular fruit flavors.a jury,however,could reasonably conclude otherwise.for one thing,in its advertisements,victoria secret described its beauty rush lip gloss as deliciously sexy,not delicious.for another,victoria secret executives testified that they wanted delicious to serve as a playful,as if the wearer of the pink tank top is saying,i delicious.these examples suggest that a jury could reasonably decide that victoria secret did not use delicious only to describe its goods.see restatement,cmt.if the original meaning of the term is not in fact descriptive of the attributes of the user goods,services,or business,the fair use defense is not applicable.
as to law,victoria secret argues that it used delicious in a permissible descriptive sense,even if its use of the word was not technically descriptive.victoria secret points to the second circuit decision in cosmetically sealed industries,usa,cir,in which the court noted that the statutory requirement that a defendant use the term only to describe its goods or services has not been narrowly confined to words that describe a characteristic of the goods,such as size or quality.id.at.instead,that court observed,the phrase permits use of words or images that are used in their descriptive sense.id.under that standard,the court held that although the defendants use of the phrase seal it with a kiss d id not describe a characteristic of the defendants product,it was used in its descriptive sense to describe an action that the sellers hope consumers will take,using their product.id.other second circuit cases have followed the same general approach.see johnson son,cir concluding that the defendant had established fair use because its pinetree shape air freshener describes the pine scent and refers to the christmas season,during which johnson sells th e item b l sales assocs.daroff sons,cir upholding the defendant use of the phrase come on strong because it describe d the manner in which the clothing would assist the
