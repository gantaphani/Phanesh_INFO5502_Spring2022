background 
the facts of this consolidated appeal are undisputed.the appeal arises out of the sale of the company,which comprised,among other things,supermarkets and the real estate on which three of the stores were operated.on june,seller and buyer entered into the stock purchase agreement agreement,which provided for the transfer of all shares of the company to buyer in exchange for a purchase price of.the agreement also required seller to deliver a lease to the buyer for properties owned by seller upon which four of the stores were located.

section of the agreement provided,in relevant part,that i n any case where seller is obligated to pay buyer any sum under this agreement buyer shall be entitled to make a claim against the escrow fund under the procedure set forth in the escrow agreement.
although the agreement was not contingent on the buyer ability to obtain financing,the buyer entered into various agreements with westinghouse to finance the purchase.westinghouse is not a party to any of the agreements between seller and buyer,and seller is not a party to any of the financing agreements between buyer and westinghouse.
on september,the transaction between seller and buyer closed.seller transferred all stock in the company to buyer,and buyer tendered the purchase price,comprising the cash payment of of which was placed into the escrow fund held by the escrow agents and the note for.in addition,a separate escrow agreement was signed with chemical bank as escrow agent.

on july,buyer filed a petition for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings,buyer initiated an adversary proceeding against seller in which it sought,among other things,judgment for the ppa pursuant to the agreement.the bankruptcy court permitted westinghouse to prosecute buyer ppa claim due to westinghouse security interest in the intangible assets of buyer.seller demanded arbitration of buyer ppa claim pursuant to the agreement.upon seller motion,the district court withdrew the standing reference to the bankruptcy court and in ordered buyer to arbitrate its ppa claim.durso supermarkets,in re durso supermarkets.

during the same period,seller was negotiating with the new york state taxing authorities to resolve a claim for unpaid sales taxes that had accrued prior to the closing.after reaching an agreement to settle the dispute with the state,seller sought to pay the settlement amount out of the escrow fund.upon refusal by buyer and westinghouse,seller commenced an adversary proceeding,seeking to pay the state from the escrow fund.in,seller paid the sales taxes to the state,mooting the specific relief requested by seller in that proceeding.as a result,seller and buyer exchanged a draft amended complaint and answer in,but never filed those pleadings.seller unfiled draft amended complaint sought,among other things,setoff against the state court judgment obtained on the note.the district court held this proceeding in abeyance pending the outcome of the arbitration related to the escrow fund.
on july,the arbitrator issued its decision,awarding westinghouse the principal amount of plus interest in the amount of for a total of almost million on buyer ppa claim.on august,seller sought a conference with the district court on her claim that,since the arbitration award should be set off against the unpaid judgments on the note and lease,she was entitled to the remainder of the escrow fund.on august,westinghouse petitioned the district court for an order confirming the arbitration award and directing the escrow agents to release sufficient funds from the escrow fund for satisfaction of the arbitration award.seller filed a response to the petition in which she asserted that she had no objection to confirmation of the arbitration award and affirmatively alleged that the award had been satisfied by recoupment and setoff against amounts due her pursuant to the judgments on the note and lease.
on for summary judgment,the district court confirmed the arbitration award and dismissed westinghouse claim against the escrow fund on the ground that seller was entitled to recoup or set off the award against the amounts owed on the note and lease.durso supermarkets,in re durso supermarkets,civ.lls and civ.lls,slip.op.at may.the court concluded that,since the ppa was merely an adjustment to buyer obligation to pay the purchase price,seller was not obligated to pay buyer any sum and,therefore,there is no occasion for westinghouse to claim against the escrow fund.id.at.nevertheless,concluded the court,e ven viewing the ppa as a payment by the seller to the buyer,the seller is entitled to offset or recoup the ppa against the amount the buyer owes it.id.the court determined that,although the recoupment doctrine may only be invoked for claims arising out of a single,transaction,this case involved such a transaction.the court concluded that in this case the cash payment,the note,and the lease were part of an integrated transaction,the sale of the business,and all are provided for in the stock purchase agreement.the sale of the business could not be accomplished as contemplated without each of those components.id.at.the court then granted westinghouse motion to confirm the arbitration award and seller motion for summary judgment,denied westinghouse motion for summary judgment,and directed the escrow agents to pay the entire amount remaining in the escrow fund to seller.id.
ii.discussion 
the issue raised on appeal is whether seller is entitled to satisfy and extinguish the ppa awarded to buyer by the arbitrator by recoupment or setoff against her judgments on the note and lease.because we find that the ppa and the judgments arise out of discrete and independent components of the transaction,and in light of the parties intentions as reflected in the stock purchase agreement,we hold that it would be inequitable in the circumstances to permit seller to apply recoupment in this case.we further hold that the parties may not apply the doctrine of setoff in this case because the requirement of mutuality is not met.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
the district court had jurisdiction over these actions,the escrow fund adversary proceeding filed by seller in and the petition for confirmation of the arbitration award filed by westinghouse in,pursuant to b and.we exercise jurisdiction over this consolidated appeal pursuant to.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo under the same standard applied by the district court.see taggart time,cir.a motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.the court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the party.see id.at.if there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the party on a material issue of fact,summary judgment is improper.see chambers trm copy centers,cir.
seller alleged failure to plead recoupment setoff 
westinghouse threshold seller failed to plead setoff or not supported by the record.seller pleaded setoff in the arbitration as a defense to westinghouse statement of the claim according to seller,the parties stipulated to the withdrawal of the defense and to reservation of that issue for decision by the district court,although the record is unclear as to the nature of the decision reserved to the district court,if any,concerning the defenses.it is clear,however,that seller pleaded recoupment and setoff in her response to westinghouse petition to confirm the arbitration award.finally,as noted by westinghouse,seller raised the issue of setoff in a draft amended complaint,dated december,in the escrow fund litigation originally commenced by seller in the bankruptcy court.the record indicates that seller did plead the defenses at the appropriate the arbitration and in response to westinghouse petition to confirm the arbitration.moreover,we find that westinghouse was on notice of seller assertion of these defenses and their underlying factual bases as early as december.westinghouse argument to the contrary is without merit.
construction of the agreement 
westinghouse also argues that the district court improperly construed the agreement to require payment by buyer of the full purchase price,payment in full on the note in addition to the money paid at closing before the terms providing for the remittance of the ppa were to come into effect when the court noted that i f the full purchase price had been paid,the seller would have to pay the buyer the amount of the adjustment,and provisions for that payment would come into effect,and would be secured by the escrow fund.durso supermarkets,in re durso supermarkets,civ.lls and civ.lls,slip.op.at may.westinghouse is correct that the unambiguous language of the agreement does not support such a construction.indeed,the agreement explicitly requires seller to use her best efforts to deliver the financial documents to buyer within days of closing,and to remit the ppa within days after that.the principal on the note,in contrast,was not payable until the second anniversary of the closing.however,westinghouse assertion that the district court read the agreement to impose such a requirement is incorrect.the language of the district court memorandum endorsement to which westinghouse refers merely describes the practical effect of buyer default on the note before payment of the ppa was required.in any event,before making its determination concerning the applicability of recoupment,the district court assumed for argument sake that the ppa constituted a payment to be made by seller under the agreement.id.at even viewing the adjustment as a payment by the seller to the buyer the seller is entitled to offset or recoup the adjustment against the amount the buyer owes it.
recoupment 
in addition to arguing that buyer did not plead recoupment,westinghouse asserts that seller is not entitled to recoupment because the award and the judgments on the note and lease did not arise out of a single transaction and because it would be inequitable for recoupment to defeat its rights as a secured creditor.we hold that,although this dispute concerns a single integrated transaction,because the obligations to which buyer wishes to apply recoupment arise from discrete and independent units within that transaction,and in light of the parties intent at the time they entered into the agreement,it would be inequitable in the circumstances to permit seller to apply recoupment.
in determining recoupment and setoff rights,we apply nonbankruptcy law.state gas mcmahon in re mcmahon,cir.under new york law
