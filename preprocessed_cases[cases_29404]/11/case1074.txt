shell offshore,and shell gulf of mexico,together,shell hold oil and gas leases in the outer continental shelf ocs,located in the arctic ocean off the coast of alaska.greenpeace,greenpeace usa has publicly undertaken a campaign to stop shell from drilling in the arctic.the district court granted shell motion for a preliminary injunction,which prohibited greenpeace usa from coming within a specified distance of vessels involved in shell arctic ocs exploration and from committing various unlawful and tortious acts against those vessels.greenpeace usa argues that the action is not justiciable,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue its order,and that the court erred in its application of winter natural resources defense council,d,to the merits of shell motion.we conclude that the action presents a justiciable case or controversy,that the district court had jurisdiction to issue its order,and that it did not abuse its discretion in doing so.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
greenpeace efforts to stop arctic drilling 
shell has presented evidence that greenpeace usa and greenpeace entities around the world are publicly committed to stopping shell exploration of its arctic ocs leases.indeed,the websites of virtually all greenpeace organizations,including greenpeace usa,prominently feature a campaign to stop shell.
but stop shell is not merely a campaign of words and images.greenpeace usa also uses direct actions to achieve its goals,and its general counsel has conceded that direct action can include illegal activity.there is evidence that greenpeace usa and its counterparts around the globe are united in the goal of stopping shell.when greenpeace activists forcibly boarded an oil rig off the coast of greenland in and used their bodies to impede a drilling operation,greenpeace usa executive director described their conduct as bold direct action by our activists.greenpeace usa similarly endorsed the forcible boarding of a shell vessel by greenpeace new zealand activists in february,again referring to them as our brave activists.
the record before the district court contained evidence that greenpeace activists used illegal direct action to interfere with legal oil drilling activities on many such occasions.several incidents involved shell vessels that were subsequently named in the district court preliminary injunction order and used in shell arctic ocs drilling operation.see shell offshore greenpeace,d.these incidents were as follows 
direct action against shell harvey explorer vessel 
greenpeace usa activists unlawfully boarded the harvey explorer,a vessel that shell contracted to use in its arctic ocs operation,in may.the vessel was in the gulf of mexico and scheduled to depart for alaska when activists boarded it,unfurled banners,and painted slogans on its walls 
direct action against cairn energy arctic drilling operation 
shell adduced evidence that greenpeace used direct action against another energy company,cairn energy,in order to prevent cairn from conducting ocs oil and gas exploration activities in the arctic ocean.greenpeace usa executive director described the first such action in greenpeace international annual report 
in august,our activists evaded danish navy commanders and scaled cairn exploration rig off greenland,halting the operation we knew that,due to very tight deadlines,even a minor delay could have a major effect cairn did find oil in.
in,greenpeace activists again boarded a cairn vessel off the coast of greenland.approximately twenty such activists were arrested after climbing the rig,attaching themselves under the rig in a survival pod,and hanging a few meters from the drill bit.a news report posted on the greenpeace africa website quoted one of the climbers as saying 
there no way cairn can drill for oil while we hanging next to their,and it going to be extremely difficult for them to remove our survival pod.to drill oil here would be dangerous insanity.we have to stop the arctic oil rush.
direct action against shell noble discoverer vessel 
in february,six greenpeace new zealand activists illegally boarded and occupied the shell drillship noble discoverer while it stopped at new zealand on its way to the arctic ocean.activists equipped with survival gear scaled the meter drilling tower,secured themselves to the rig,and unfurled stop shell banners.they were arrested by new zealand authorities four days later.greenpeace usa,in its blog,endorsed the activists conduct and described them as our brave activists.dkt.at.its website described the incident as only the first chapter in what will undoubtedly be an epic battle.
direct action against shell nordica and fennica vessels 
in march,greenpeace activists boarded and occupied the nordica and fennica,two of shell icebreaker support vessels,while in port in finland.again in may,greenpeace activists twice boarded and occupied the nordica while it transited through swedish and danish waters.activists chained themselves to the vessel,dropped weights and other objects in the water to obstruct the vessel propulsion,and created a human blockade using divers.
preliminary injunction 
shell was scheduled to begin exploration of its arctic ocs leases in.in the months leading up to the exploration,shell first obtained a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction that barred greenpeace usa from coming within specified distances of named shell involved in the ocs exploration.see shell offshore geenpeace,wl,at may,amended order shell offshore,d at original order.the injunction also prevented greenpeace usa from committing various tortious and illegal acts against those vessels and their occupants by its own terms,the injunction expired on october,the last day of the arctic ocean open water season during which shell would explore its ocs leases.
greenpeace usa challenges the injunction on several grounds that the dispute does not present a justiciable case or controversy that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction that shell has sued the wrong greenpeace entity and that the district court based its ruling on legal standards and factual findings that were erroneous.we conclude that each of these contentions lacks merit.
ii.standard of review 
our standard of review for preliminary injunction appeals is by now familiar 
we review the district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.our review is limited and deferential.the district court interpretation of the underlying legal principles,however,is subject to de novo review and a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.

we review standing,ripeness,and mootness de novo.see doe reed,cir stormans,selecky,cir.w e have an independent obligation to consider mootness sua sponte.nasd dispute resolution,judicial council,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.justiciability 
standing and ripeness 
greenpeace usa justiciability arguments are hazy,but appear to challenge both shell standing to sue and the ripeness of the dispute.article iii standing requires an injury that is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.in the context of injunctive relief,the plaintiff must demonstrate a real or immediate threat of irreparable injury.cole oroville union high sch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the same facts by which shell has shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that greenpeace usa would commit tortious or illegal acts against shell arctic drilling operation in the absence of an injunction,and that the resulting harm would be irreparable,necessarily establish that shell has standing to seek injunctive relief.see infra,parts.
the dispute is also ripe because the facts are sufficiently developed and the nature of the dispute warrants prompt adjudication.see abbott labs.gardner,d explaining that the ripeness inquiry considers the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.shell presented undisputed evidence that it is only authorized to explore these leases during the narrow open water season of july through october,and the district court concluded that it faced irreparable harm absent injunctive relief to withhold decision in such a context would work a serious hardship upon shell.
it is undisputed that the preliminary injunction expired by its own terms on october,after oral argument,but before this court could render a decision.so we must determine whether the action is moot we conclude that it falls within the mootness exception for disputes capable of repetition,yet evading review.naacp,region city of richmond,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in order for the exception to apply,the duration of the challenged action or injury must be too short to be fully litigated and there must be a reasonable likelihood that the same party will be subject to the action again.id.as we recently explained,c ases that qualify under prong one present controversies of inherently limited duration.doe,at.an action is fully litigated if it is reviewed by this court and the supreme court.see alcoa,bonneville power,cir.
a preliminary injunction limited to a single arctic ocean open water season,that bars greenpeace usa from physically interfering with shell arctic drilling operation,will never last long enough to allow full litigation because of the inherently limited duration of the open water season and,correspondingly,the drilling season.under its lease,shell is legally authorized to drill only between july and october of each year.the preliminary injunction against greenpeace usa was by its own terms limited to a total duration of less than seven months,encompassing the drilling season,plus the time necessary for shell vessels to transit to the arctic ocean orders of such inherently limited duration will almost always evade full review.see,united states oregon,cir holding that american indian tribe appeal from an injunctive order banning salmon fishing in was not moot even though the spring salmon run of was over and the order was limited to that run.
turning to the second prong,we have every reason to believe that the underlying wrong will recur.shell has drilling rights under a lease,and there is no reason to believe that greenpeace usa stop shell campaign was limited to the drilling season.we conclude that there is at minimum a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.weinstein bradford,d.
iv.jurisdiction 
the preliminary injunction at issue protects specific shell vessels as they journey from facilities in the united states,through united states territorial waters,and into the waters of the exclusive economic zone eez where rigs attach to the arctic seabed and conduct exploration activities.greenpeace usa does not challenge the district court conclusion that,with regard to injunctive relief in the united states and its territorial waters,the court had subject matter jurisdiction based on diverse party citizenship.see a.likewise,greenpeace usa does not dispute that the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla gave the court jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief while shell vessels are attached to the seabed.see a extending jurisdiction to the seabed of the outer continental shelf and to devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for,developing,or producing resources therefrom.
greenpeace usa is now solely appealing the district court holding that under,it had admiralty jurisdiction to enjoin conduct relating to vessels that were neither in territorial waters where diversity jurisdiction extends nor attached to the seabed where ocsla jurisdiction extends that is,vessels transiting through the eez we need not decide whether provides jurisdiction over this particular stretch of an oil rig journey because a court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the entire constitutional case.see a.the common nucleus of operative facts underlying shell claim for injunctive relief do not change when its vessels traverse an invisible line separating territorial waters from the waters of the eez,nor at the moment when its rigs detach from the seabed this is therefore a single case or controversy for the purposes of a,and we conclude that the district court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over it.
discussion 
whether greenpeace usa is the proper entity to enjoin 
a common thread in greenpeace usa various challenges is the argument that greenpeace usa was not directly involved in any prior attacks on shell vessels.but shell does not need to show past injury by greenpeace usa to establish standing or to succeed on the merits of its preliminary injunction motion.see diamontiney borg,cir a s commentators have noted,the injury need not have been inflicted when application for an injunction is made or be certain to occur a strong threat of irreparable injury before trial is an adequate basis.requiring a showing of actual injury would defeat the purpose of the preliminary injunction,which is to prevent an injury from occurring.quoting charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure at see also restatement second of torts cmt.b a common method of proving a threat of a future tort is by proving a past tort under conditions that render its repetition or continuance probable.it is not necessary,however,to prove past wrong.
regardless,greenpeace usa does not dispute evidence that its own activists carried out the attack on shell harvey explorer.and,although the record does not make clear which greenpeace entity was directly responsible for multiple attacks on cairn energy vessels in the arctic ocean,greenpeace usa executive director essentially took credit for it,describing the perpetrators as our activists and boasting that as a result of this direct action,cairn did find oil in.dkt.exh.at.accordingly,the district court observed that although shell had not demonstrated that greenpeace usa was directly involved in either the new zealand or finnish incidents involving the noble discoverer,nordica,and fennica,other evidence showed that stopping shell and other oil companies from drilling in the arctic is more likely than not one of the overall priority strategies of greenpeace worldwide,as well as of greenpeace usa.shell offshore,d at.we see no clearly erroneous factual findings undergirding that conclusion 
grant of preliminary injunction 
a plaintiff who seeks a preliminary injunction must show 
that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.
the district court applied the correct legal standard and as our discussion below makes clear,it did so in a manner that was logical,plausible,and supported by the record.see hinkson,at.as such,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.
likelihood of success on the merits 
greenpeace usa challenges the district court conclusion that shell demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that it is likely that greenpeace usa would intend to commit tortious or illegal acts against shell arctic drilling operations in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief.shell offshore,d at.first,greenpeace usa argues that the district court erred by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof to it.the court explained that it accorded a minor degree of weight to the fact that there is no sworn statement in this record from greenpeace usa indicating that the organization will not attempt tortious or unlawful acts this summer against shell and that,to the contrary,its executive director stated publicly in march that w hatever happens in court,greenpeace will continue to oppose shell plans peacefully and vigorously.id.at.the district court weighing of greenpeace usa silence amounts to an observation that contrary evidence offered by shell stood unrefuted.there is consequently no error here.
second,greenpeace usa argues that shell failed to meet its burden.the record before the district court contained evidence that greenpeace usa forcibly boarded and defaced a shell vessel,the harvey explorer,as part of its campaign to stop shell from drilling in the arctic on two occasions,activists that greenpeace usa termed our activists employed unlawful and tortious means to stop another energy company cairn from finding oil in the arctic greenpeace usa conceded that it uses direct action including unlawful conduct as means to an end greenpeace usa and the global greenpeace organization share the goal of stopping shell from drilling in the arctic and greenpeace activists from other nations have on multiple occasions employed unlawful or tortious means to stop shell from drilling in the arctic.on these facts,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that shell met its burden.see hinkson,at.
likelihood of irreparable harm 
the district court concluded that shell demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm absent injunctive relief because illegal or tortious efforts to board or interfere with its vessels would be likely to present unacceptable risks to human life,property and the environment.shell offshore,d at internal quotation marks omitted.in support of these findings,the court considered evidence that actions of the sort undertaken by greenpeace activists against shell vessels in new zealand,finland,and greenland pose risks to the safety of activists and vessel occupants alike.the court also found and greenpeace usa does not dispute that if greenpeace usa successfully disrupted shell operation,calculating the amount of economic harm would be very difficult.id.
greenpeace usa offers nothing beyond conclusory statements and case summaries in support of its argument that the likelihood of future injury is speculative and can not be based on matters that occurred in or that involved entities that are not greenpeace usa.the record provides ample support for the conclusion that greenpeace usa has either undertaken directly,or embraced as its own,tactics that include forcible boarding of vessels at sea and the use of human beings as impediments to drilling operations.we find it too plain for debate that such tactics at minimum pose a serious risk of harm to human life,particularly if attempted in the extreme conditions of the arctic ocean,and that such harm could find no adequate remedy at law.accordingly,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court conclusion.see hinkson,at.
balance of equities 
the district court concluded that b y carefully tailoring preliminary injunctive relief to focus on illegal and tortious conduct,and minimizing any impact on greenpeace usa right to monitor the activities and peacefully protest against shell within the confines of the law,the balance of the equities remains solidly tipped in shell favor.shell offshore,d at.greenpeace usa argues that the court erred by failing to apply a standard that would require the balance of hardships to tip sharply in shell favor.
under winter,a preliminary injunction movant must show,inter alia,that the balance of equities tips in his favor.at.but if a plaintiff can only show that there are serious questions going to the merits a lesser showing than likelihood of success on the merits then a preliminary injunction may still issue if the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff favor,and the other two winter factors are satisfied.alliance for the wild rockies,at emphasis added.but the serious questions approach is inapplicable in this case because,as explained above,shell demonstrated,and the district court found,a likelihood of success on the merits.
we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the balance of equities favors shell.shell has an interest in conducting legally authorized exploration of its arctic leases without dangerous interference from greenpeace usa.greenpeace usa has a countervailing first amendment right to protest shell drilling activities,and the injunction imposes safety zones around shell vessels that prevent greenpeace usa from exercising its rights in close proximity to those vessels.greenpeace usa argues that this is an undue speech restriction,prohibited under schenck pro choice network of,d.we disagree.
the safety zones do not prevent greenpeace usa from communicating with its target audience because,as the district court observed,greenpeace usa has no audience at sea.and although the injunction imposes a safety bubble around shell vessels,greenpeace usa reliance on schenck and its discussion of bubble zones around abortion clinics is sorely misplaced.speech is,of course,most protected in such quintessential public fora as the public sidewalks surrounding abortion clinics.see id.at.but the high seas are not a public forum,and the lessons of schenck have little applicability there.
we conclude that,in light of the serious risk to human life and property posed by the conduct that the preliminary injunction enjoins,and given the narrow tailoring of the order,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the scales of equity tip in shell favor.
public interest 
finally,we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that an injunction is in the public interest.congress has recognized a public interest in the expeditious and orderly development of the ocs,see amoco prod.vill.of gambell,ak,d quoting,and shell arctic ocs project is authorized by law.
greenpeace usa argues that the district court failed to consider the public interest in environmental protection before issuing the injunction.after reminding the court of the deepwater horizon disaster,greenpeace usa argues that there is an amplified public interest in allow ing the public,including greenpeace usa,to monitor oil drilling activities.finally,greenpeace usa argues that ocsla recognizes an interest in public participation and environmental protection that is furthered by groups like itself.
the district court considered the public interest in having greenpeace usa monitor shell arctic drilling activities.in fact,the court agreed with greenpeace usa ocsla argument,stating that ocsla recognizes the important role that environmental organizations such as greenpeace usa may play in legal proceedings regarding the development of the outer continental shelf.shell offshore,d at.the court also acknowledged that the injunction could impact greenpeace usa otherwise legal activities.id.it responded by crafting a narrow injunctive order that prohibited only illegal and tortious conduct and by expressly inviting greenpeace usa to 
seek to modify the order so as to permit greenpeace to more closely monitor shell activities within the safety zones established by the order at such specific times,locations,and conditions that the court may order after each party has been accorded an opportunity to be heard on any such motion.
id.at.we can not say that this treatment of public interest factors constituted an abuse of discretion.
conclusion 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting shell motion for a preliminary injunction,which is amply supported by the record.consequently,the preliminary injunction order is affirmed.
i concur with parts iii and iv of the majority opinion that discuss justiciability and jurisdiction.i part ways with the majority,however,where it holds that shell may impute the actions of other independent greenpeace entities to greenpeace usa in order to meet shell burden of proof because i can not support the imposition of legal sanctions on greenpeace usa based,in significant part,on the conduct of others that greenpeace usa does not control,i respectfully dissent.
the majority claims that greenpeace usa was properly enjoined because the evidence s
