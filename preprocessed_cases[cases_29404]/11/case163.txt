packard packard and cashmere camel hair manufacturers institute the institute appeal from the district court entry of partial summary judgment dismissing their false advertising claims under the lanham act,a,and massachusetts state law.in particular,packard challenges the dismissal of its claims for money damages,while the institute argues that the district court erred in dismissing one of its claims for injunctive relief.because we conclude that the district court relied on impermissible inferences in favor of the moving party in reaching its conclusions,we reverse and remand the case for action consistent with this opinion.
background 
the institute is a trade association of cashmere manufacturers dedicated to preserving the name and reputation of cashmere as a speciality fiber.packard is a member of the institute and a manufacturer of cashmere and fabric.
in,harve benard,harve benard began manufacturing a line of women blazers that were labeled as containing percent wool,percent nylon,and percent cashmere.its labels also portrayed the blazers as a luxurious blend of cashmere and wool,cashmere and wool,or wool and cashmere.harve benard sold large quantities of these garments to retail customers,including defendants saks fifth avenue saks and filene basement.
in,plaintiffs began purchasing random samples of the harve benard garments and giving them to professor kenneth langley and wortmann,experts in the field of cashmere identification and textile analysis.after conducting separate tests on the samples,the experts independently concluded that,despite harve benard labels to the contrary,the garments contained no cashmere in addition,wortmann found that approximately to of the fibers in the harve benard garments were is,reconstituted from the deconstructed and remnants of previously used or woven garments.
relying on their experts findings,plaintiffs filed this suit in district court claiming that defendants falsely advertised their garments in violation of a of the lanham act,a,the massachusetts unfair and deceptive trade practices act.laws ch,and the common law of unfair competition.more specifically,plaintiffs claim that the garments were mislabeled in two material respects the harve benard blazers contained significantly less than the cashmere they were represented as having cashmere content claim and any cashmere that the blazers did contain was not virgin,as the unqualified word cashmere on the label suggests,but recycled recycled cashmere claim each plaintiff seeks a different form of relief for these alleged misrepresentations whereas the institute seeks a permanent injunction against any future mislabeling,packard seeks monetary damages on the theory that it lost sales as a result of the manufacture and sale of the mislabeled garments.
the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendants,dismissing both of packard claims for money damages and seemingly dismissing the institute request for injunctive relief on its recycled cashmere claim the only ruling in plaintiffs thus the only ruling that they do not the district court denial of defendants summary judgment motion on the institute cashmere content claim for injunctive relief.
after the district court summary judgment ruling,however,the institute chose to voluntarily dismiss this remaining claim so that it could expedite the appeal of its recycled cashmere claim for injunctive relief.
standard of review 
plaintiffs appeal the district court summary judgment dismissing packard cashmere content claim for money damages packard recycled cashmere claim for money damages and the institute recycled cashmere claim for injunctive relief.we review de novo the district court summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims.see straughn delta air lines,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.t o defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party must establish a issue by presenting enough competent evidence to enable a finding favorable to the nonmoving party.leblanc great am.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in exercising our review,we construe the record evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the nonmoving party.feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.
for the purposes of this appeal,defendants concede that the issue of whether the garments were mislabeled is both material and genuinely in dispute.they argue,however,that there is no evidence that their mislabeling deceived any members of the consuming public or caused plaintiffs any harm.defendants thus seek summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs can not adduce sufficient evidence of consumer deception or causation to satisfy the requirements of the applicable law.
discussion 
before delving into the merits of plaintiffs appeal,we pause to address a jurisdictional challenge.defendants argue that the institute has no legal standing to seek appellate review because the institute is impermissibly attempting to appeal from its own voluntary dismissal.after the district court grant of summary judgment,the institute had at least one remaining claim against defendants.rather than pursuing that claim to trial,however,the institute voluntarily moved to dismiss its claim with prejudice.shortly thereafter,the institute timely filed the instant appeal.since it is well known that generally a plaintiff may not appeal a voluntary dismissal because there is no involuntary or adverse judgment against him,bell city of kellogg,cir,defendants contend that this court lacks jurisdiction over the institute improper appeal.
defendants acknowledge in their brief,however,that there is a narrow exception which permits appeals from voluntary dismissals where the dismissal was sought to expedite review of a prejudicial interlocutory ruling.see john insulation,addison assocs,cir noting that most circuits hold that voluntary dismissals,and especially those with prejudice,are appealable final orders,and holding that a plaintiff that deems an interlocutory ruling to be so prejudicial as to deserve immediate review has the alternative of dismissing the complaint voluntarily martin franklin capital,cir same holding.nevertheless,defendants assert that the institute does not fall within this exception because its voluntary dismissal was not sought for the purposes of obtaining immediate appellate review of a prior order,but rather because the institute realized that its remaining claim was without merit.
defendants argument is undermined,however,by that portion of the record establishing that the institute voluntarily dismissed its remaining claim,in part,so that it could appeal adverse rulings in the summary judgment order.in its motion to dismiss,the institute unequivocally stated 
the institute has determined that the most appropriate course of action is to dismiss its remaining claim with prejudice to avoid an unnecessary trial on that issue,without prejudice to the plaintiffs right to appeal the broader rulings dismissing the bulk of their claims.
the institute motion thus demonstrates that it believed that the summary judgment order significantly prejudiced its case by dismissing the bulk of its claims,and the institute sought the voluntary dismissal to expedite appellate review of the prior order.because the institute has satisfied the prerequisites for appealing a voluntary dismissal,see john insulation,at noting that the proper course of action is to file a motion for voluntary dismissal with prejudice,stating explicitly that the purpose is to seek immediate review of the interlocutory order in question,we conclude that the institute is properly before this court.
at oral argument,defendants unveiled a new contention they claimed that the institute could not avail itself of the exception because the summary judgment order did not substantially prejudice the institute,as is required by existing caselaw.see id.in particular,defendants argued that since the summary judgment order did not dismiss any of the institute claims for injunctive relief,there is insufficient prejudice to allow the institute to appeal its voluntary dismissal.
defendants argument fails for two reasons.first,defendants waived this argument by failing to raise it in their brief.see frazier bailey,cir ruling that arguments not fully presented in appellate brief are waived.defendants can not utilize oral argument as a forum for unveiling new arguments of which plaintiffs did not have proper notice or opportunity to challenge.
second,it appears that the district court actually dismissed the institute recycled cashmere claim for injunctive relief,thereby giving the institute sufficient prejudice to appeal its voluntary dismissal.as discussed in more detail below,for a plaintiff to succeed on a false advertising claim under the lanham act,he must demonstrate,among other things,that the alleged misrepresentation deceived the public or had a tendency to deceive the public.see clorox.proctor gamble commercial,cir.in some limited circumstances,however,the law absolves the lanham act plaintiff of this burden and allows him to benefit from a presumption of consumer deception.see id.at noting that a court may grant relief without considering evidence of consumer reaction.in assessing whether the institute demonstrated consumer deception,the district court determined that the institute was entitled to a presumption of consumer deception on its claim that defendants overstated the cashmere content,but was not entitled to such a presumption on its recycled cashmere claim the district court then concluded that b ased on the presumption alone,defendants motion for summary judgment should be denied it is clear,then,that the district court explicitly denied summary judgment only on the institute cashmere content claim,as that is the only claim to which the district court applied the presumption.
the district court,however,neglected to determine whether the institute demonstrated consumer deception,absent a presumption,on its recycled cashmere claim.the parties draw opposite conclusions from the district court ambiguous resolution of this matter ironically,plaintiffs argue that the claim was dismissed for failure to demonstrate consumer deception,while defendants assert that it was not.
though both arguments are equally plausible given the district court silence on the issue,we conclude that plaintiffs assertion that the claim was dismissed more persuasive in light of the circumstances.immediately after skipping over the issue of whether the institute demonstrated consumer deception on its recycled cashmere claim,the court assessed whether packard had proved consumer deception on its claims for money damages.after analyzing the proffered evidence,the district court found that packard proof of consumer deception was insufficient.since the district court dismissed packard claims,in part,because packard was unable to demonstrate consumer deception,it is reasonable to assume that the district court intended to dismiss the institute remaining claim for the same reason,especially because plaintiffs were relying on the same evidence to prove both 
considering the ambiguity surrounding the district court order on this issue,the apparent intention of the district court to dismiss the institute recycled cashmere claim,and the institute dismissal of its remaining claim to seek immediate appellate review of the summary judgment order,we find that the institute has satisfied the prerequisites to appeal its voluntary dismissal.
the lanham act prohibits false and misleading descriptions of products and services in interstate commerce.see a.the statute was designed to protect consumers and competitors from any duplicitous advertising or packaging which results in unfair competition.see id 
to prove a false advertising claim under the lanham act,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant made a false or misleading description of fact or representation of fact in a commercial advertisement about his own or another product the misrepresentation is material,in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision the misrepresentation actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience the defendant placed the false or misleading statement in interstate commerce and the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the misrepresentation,either by direct diversion of sales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products.see clorox,at.
a plaintiff can succeed on a false advertising claim by proving either that the defendant advertisement is literally false or implicitly is,the advertisement is true or ambiguous yet misleading.see id.where the advertisement is literally false,a violation may be established without evidence of consumer deception.see balance dynamics schmitt,cir noting that when a statement is literally false,a plaintiff need not demonstrate actual customer deception in order to obtain relief.where the advertisement is implicitly false,however,an additional burden is placed upon the plaintiff to show that the advertisement conveys a misleading message to the viewing public.clorox,at 
in addition,this court has recognized a difference in the burdens of proof between injunctive relief claims and monetary damages claims under the lanham act.in quabaug rubber fabiano shoe,cir,we held that whereas a showing that the defendant activities are likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers is sufficient to warrant injunctive relief,a plaintiff seeking damages must show actual harm to its business.see id.at 
with these elaborate and intricate statutory requirements in mind,we assess plaintiffs claims to determine if there is enough competent evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that they have satisfied their burdens of proof under the lanham act.
concessions 
for the purposes of this appeal,defendants concede that they have made a false or misleading statement of fact in describing their blazers.defendants also concede that they placed these misrepresentations in interstate commerce.
materiality 
the materiality component of a false advertising claim requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant deception is likely to influence the purchasing decision.clorox,at.one method of establishing materiality involves showing that the false or misleading statement relates to an inherent quality or characteristic of the product.basketball ass motorola,cir 
on their first claim,plaintiffs argue that overstating the cashmere content of blazers is material because the misrepresentation relates to an inherent characteristic of the product sold.indeed,it seems obvious that cashmere is a basic ingredient of a garment without it,the product could not be deemed a garment or compete in the market.thus,it seems reasonable to conclude that defendants misrepresentation of the blazers cashmere content is material because it relates to a characteristic that defines the product at issue,as well as the market in which it is sold.
moreover,defendants prominently labeled their garments as cashmere and wool,a luxurious blend of cashmere and wool,cashmere blend,or wool and cashmere,and their garments were conspicuously advertised in stores and catalogues as cashmere blazers.it seems reasonable to infer from defendants aggressive marketing strategy highlighting the cashmere nature of the blazers that defendants themselves believed cashmere to be an inherent and important characteristic of the blazers.
with respect to their second claim,plaintiffs argue that defendants misrepresentation of the recycled nature of their cashmere also relates to an inherent characteristic of the garments.to substantiate this point,plaintiffs offer the affidavit of karl spilhaus,the institute president,in which he explains 
the process of recycling involves the use of machinery to tear apart existing garments,during or after which they are subjected to a wet processing with the resulting wool fibers dried out,frequently carbonized subjected to heat and sulphuric acid,and then in the manufacture of other fabric.
in the process of tearing apart existing garments,considerable damage is inevitably done to the fibers in those garments,and additional damage is also done by the acid or other chemical treatments applied to them during the recycling process.the result is that recycled fibers frequently have substantial surface damage to their scale structure which effects sic their ability to felt,or bind together,thereby effecting sic the ability of a recycled fiber fabric to hold together as well or as long as fibers which are being used in the fabric for the first time.such fabric will be rougher to the touch and lack handle,plushness or softness normally associated with quality woolen or cashmere products.
given the degree to which recycled fibers affect the quality and characteristics of a garment,a rational factfinder could conclude that consumers,especially experienced ones like retail stores,would likely be influenced in their purchasing decisions by labeling that gave the false impression that the garments contained virgin cashmere 
in fact,plaintiffs offer anecdotal evidence as corroboration for this very assertion.in january,saks,one of harve benard largest customers,learned that the cashmere blazers it had purchased from harve benard might contain recycled cashmere.shortly thereafter,lynne ronon,the merchandise manager at saks,met with representatives of harve benard to inform them that saks did not wish to sell garments containing recycled cashmere.after the meeting,carole sadler,the associate counsel for saks,sent harve benard a letter restating saks position as set forth by ronon saks does not wish to sell jackets containing recycled cashmere.
rather than viewing this anecdote as evidence of how an actual consumer purchasing decision was influenced by the misrepresentation,defendants draw the opposite conclusion by focusing on saks ultimate purchasing decision.notwithstanding its earlier position,saks eventually decided to sell harve benard garments containing recycled cashmere.moreover,sadler testified that saks initial refusal to sell recycled cashmere garments was merely a strategic move on an issue that could ripen into a negotiation or a renegotiation between the parties.
the problem with defendants rebuttal argument,however,is that it ignores what a rational juror could find after drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.saks initial refusal to sell the recycled cashmere garments saks belief that the matter could lead to a negotiation and the actual negotiations that took place before saks agreed to continue selling the garments are competent evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the issue related to an inherent quality or characteristic of the garment.indeed,it makes little sense that saks and harve benard would spend so much time and effort resolving a matter they deemed immaterial.
furthermore,it is important to reiterate,as the caselaw explicitly states,that plaintiffs are not required to present evidence that defendants misrepresentation actually influenced consumers purchasing decisions,but that it was likely to influence them.see clorox,at.given the significant degree to which using recycled fibers adversely impacts the quality,texture,and characteristics of cashmere,and considering saks erratic behavior upon learning of the mislabeling,we find that plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that defendants recycled cashmere misrepresentation was material.
consumer deception 
the next element of a false advertising claim under the lanham act requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentation deceived a substantial portion of the consuming public.see clorox,at usually consumer deception is demonstrated through surveys,which establish that consumers were misled by the alleged misrepresentations.see johnson johnson merck,at.packard argues,however,that it does not have to shoulder the burden of presenting this evidence because existing caselaw allows plaintiffs like it who allege claims that are literally false to avail themselves of a presumption of consumer deception.see castrol pennzoil,cir ruling that a plaintiff must prove either literal falsity or consumer confusion,but not both johnson johnson gac int l,cir when a representation is literally or explicitly false,the court may grant relief without reference to the advertisement impact on the buying public.
in response,defendants recognize that a presumption of consumer deception is available to plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief for literal falsity claims however,they argue that the presumption does not apply,without more,to plaintiffs seeking money damages for literal falsity claims.
though there was once support for the assertion that consumer deception can not be presumed simply because a plaintiff alleges a literal falsity claim for money damages,see ppx,at noting that as of the presumption had only been applied to literal falsity claims for injunctive relief,it has become the practice of most circuits to apply the presumption to all literal falsity claims.see pizza hut,papa john int l,cir holding,on a claim for damages and injunctive relief,that when the statements of fact at issue are shown to be literally false,the plaintiff need not introduce evidence on the issue of the impact the statements had on consumers however p laintiffs looking to recover monetary damages for false or misleading advertising that is not literally false must prove actual deception efco symons,cir ruling,on a claim for damages,that when an advertisement is literally false the plaintiff need not prove that any of its customers were actually persuaded by the advertising balance,at noting that a presumption of consumer deception applies to a literal falsity claim for damages so long as there is other proof of marketplace damages sanfield,finlay fine jewelry,cir ruling,on a damages claim,that w here the statement in question is actually false,then the plaintiff need not show that the statement either actually deceived consumers or was likely to do so.
in fact,defendants argument contradicts this court explicit pronouncements on the issue.in assessing whether a lanham act claim for injunctive relief and money damages had been properly dismissed,we stated,if the advertisement is literally false,the court may grant relief without considering evidence of consumer reaction.in the absence of such literal falsity,an additional burden is placed upon plaintiff to show that the advertisement conveys a misleading message to the viewing public.clorox,at internal citations omitted.
moreover,applying a presumption of consumer deception to all literal falsity claims,irrespective of the type of relief sought,makes sense.when a plaintiff demonstrates that a defendant has made a material misrepresentation that is literally false,there is no need to burden the plaintiff with the onerous task of demonstrating how consumers perceive the advertising.see balance dynamics,at noting that b ecause proof of actual confusion may be difficult to obtain,most of the circuits have ruled that when a statement is literally false,a plaintiff need not demonstrate actual customer deception in order to obtain relief under the lanham act.common sense and practical experience tell us that we can presume,without reservation,that consumers have been deceived when a defendant has explicitly misrepresented a fact that relates to an inherent quality or characteristic of the article sold.to presume as much requires neither a leap of faith nor the creation of any new legal principle 
because defendants do not dispute that overstating cashmere content is a literal falsity claim,we apply a presumption of consumer deception in plaintiffs favor on this claim.based on this presumption,and defendants failure to present evidence to rebut it,packard has satisfied its burden of demonstrating consumer deception on its cashmere content claim.
whether literal falsity is involved in plaintiffs claim that defendants improperly labeled their goods as cashmere rather than recycled cashmere,however,is a contentious issue.defendants argue that this claim is,by definition,one of implied is,a representation that is literally true but in context becomes likely to mislead.see clorox,at defining an implied falsity claim as one in which the advertisement,though explicitly true,nonetheless conveys a misleading message to the viewing public.as further support for their argument,defendants offer a simple syllogism all suits based on implied messages are implied falsity claims since plaintiffs assert that the term cashmere on the garments labels implicitly conveys the false message that the garments contain virgin cashmere,their claim must be one of implicit falsity.
we agree with defendants that normally a claim like plaintiffs,in which the representation at issue is literally true the garments do contain cashmere as the label states but is misleading in context defendants failed to disclose that the cashmere is recycled,is evaluated as an implied falsity claim.see id.however,we disagree with defendants assertion that all claims that rely on implied messages are necessarily implied falsity claims.in clorox,this court noted that a lthough factfinders usually base literal falsity claims upon the explicit claims made by an advertisement,they may also consider any claims the advertisement conveys by necessary implication.id.at.we explained that a claim is conveyed by necessary implication when,considering the advertisement in its entirety,the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.id.at.
after drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,a rational factfinder could conclude that plaintiffs recycled cashmere claim is one of literal falsity.the wool products labeling act,et,requires recycled garments and fabrics,including cashmere,to be labeled as such.as a result,whenever a label represents that a garment contains the unqualified term cashmere,the law requires that the garment contain only virgin cashmere.the act,then,is essentially telling consumers that garments labeled cashmere can be presumed to be virgin cashmere as if it had been explicitly stated.clorox,at.plaintiffs also presented evidence demonstrating that experienced retailers,like saks,were aware of the act requirements.based on this evidence,we conclude that plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that consumers would view the term virgin as necessarily implicated when a garment was labeled cashmere.
the district court rejected this argument because i t is at least equally plausible to infer that congress in enacting the wool product labeling act was concerned that it would be misleading for a seller to fail to distinguish between virgin and recycled cashmere,even though it would not be literally false to do so.the district court argument,however,substitutes an irrelevant inquiry for the required analysis.rather than assessing what consumers would necessarily infer from the unqualified term cashmere in light of the act requirements,the district court delved into issues of congressional intent and statutory interpretation.see johnson johnson merck,at the question in such cases does the person to whom the advertisement is addressed find to be the message.because the act necessarily implies the term virgin anytime the unmodified word cashmere appears on a garment label and experienced retailers,like saks,were aware of the act requirements,we rule that plaintiffs recycled cashmere claim can be reasonably seen as one of literal falsity.therefore,plaintiffs may benefit from a presumption of consumer deception on this claim.
even if plaintiffs recycled cashmere claim did not involve literal falsity,plaintiffs would still be able to avail themselves of a presumption of consumer deception on alternative grounds.it is well established that if there is proof that a defendant intentionally set out to deceive or mislead consumers,a presumption arises that customers in fact have been deceived.see porous media pall,cir approving of a presumption of consumer deception upon a finding that defendant acted deliberately to deceive see also int l,jartran,cir same.
as evidence of defendants intentional mislabeling of the blazers recycled cashmere,plaintiffs introduced a letter dated january,addressed to harve benard president,bernard holtzman,from one of harve benard testing laboratories.on the top of the letter,there is a handwritten note from pedell,an agent for harve benard,which states,also see note from mill below.this is an saga.the note that pedell is referring to reads,in pertinent part,for your info pls note mill is using recicled chasmere sic.despite receiving notice that its blazers were being made from recycled cashmere,harve benard continued to market its garments without any recycled designation,as required by law,until months after the commencement of this lawsuit in.thus,harve benard unwillingness to comply with the law,despite being on notice of its violation,can be seen as an attempt deliberately to deceive the consuming public.
in response,defendants offer several factual and legal arguments,none of which we find persuasive.first,defendants argue that a presumption of consumer deception can not be triggered on an implied falsity claim,even if there is evidence of an intent to deceive.defendants claim,however,is undermined by several circuit cases that have explicitly held otherwise.see porous,at applying presumption of consumer deception to an implied falsity claim when there is intent to deceive william morris,at stating that a presumption of consumer deception applies to an implied falsity claim where there is sufficient evidence of an intent to deceive johnson johnson merck,at same resource developers,at same.the justification for applying the presumption whenever there is evidence of intentional deception is perspicuous the expenditure by a competitor of substantial funds in an effort to deceive customers and influence their purchasing decisions justifies the existence of a presumption that consumers are,in fact,being deceived,at.this reasoning holds true regardless of whether the claim that plaintiffs allege involves an implied or literal falsity.
second,defendants argue that the fact that an italian mill stated that it was using recycled cashmere has little bearing on whether the mill was using cashmere that would be considered recycled under the definitions of the wool products labeling act.defendants seem to misunderstand or underestimate the import of the letter.one of harve benard mills informed the president of the company that its garments contained recycled fabric.rather than investigating the matter to determine whether harve benard was violating the law by not properly labeling its cashmere as recycled,harve benard did nothing.it did not finally change the garments labels until more than one year later when plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order on the issue.one reasonable explanation,which a juror may choose to credit,for harve benard refusal to investigate or act on the letter is that harve benard intended to deceive the consuming public about the recycled nature of its cashmere.amirmokri baltimore gas,cir noting that intent may be inferred from a failure to act.
lastly,defendants argue that harve benard failure to act on the letter for one year does not meet the intent requirement set forth in applicable precedent.defendants read resource developers,at,as standing for the proposition that a defendant failure to dispel confusion caused by its advertising circular for four months is insufficient evidence of intent.since harve benard failure to act is comparable to the defendant in resource developers,defendants conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of intent.
even if we were to adopt defendants reading of resource developers,we remain unpersuaded by their argument because the circumstances of this case are far more compelling.first,the fact that defendants waited for more than a year before changing the blazers mislabeling is far more probative of intentional deceit than waiting for four months.second,when referring to the italian mill use of recycled cashmere,pedell noted on the top of the
