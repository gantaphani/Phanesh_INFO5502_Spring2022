ashok parmar,purnima parmar and mahinder parmar collectively the parmars sued the california state board of equalization board for a refund of cigarette and tobacco taxes paid in part by them and in part on their behalf by their corporation,santos agency,santos.following a bench trial,the trial court found the taxes had been unlawfully assessed against the parmars individually and granted the parmars request for a refund of.the court also awarded the parmars more than in attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,finding the successful litigation had resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.
on appeal the board primarily contends the parmars lack standing to recover the taxes paid by santos on their behalf.we agree.pursuant to section of the cigarette and tobacco products tax law,et,only the party who paid the tax can obtain a refund.accordingly,we reverse the judgment to the extent it awards the parmars more money than they actually paid in cigarette and tobacco taxes and affirm it in all other respects.
both the board and the parmars also appeal from the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees.in the unpublished portion of our opinion we affirm the postjudgment order to the extent it finds attorney fees were authorized in this case,but remand to the trial court to reconsider the amount of fees awarded.
factual and procedural background 
the parties 
purnima and mahinder parmar are officers and shareholders of santos.ashok parmar is a shareholder and a director of the company the parmars established santos in to import items from india and to distribute them to indian grocery stores.among the goods santos imported and distributed were tobacco cigarettes called beedies.
the board is a california agency authorized to administer the provisions of the cigarette and tobacco products tax law,et which imposes a tax on distributors of cigarettes and tobacco products.the law requires a distributor to collect the tax from the purchaser of the cigarette or tobacco product and remit the tax collected to the board,subd.a.
santos suspension 
in october santos corporate status was suspended for failure to pay franchise taxes and to submit certain required forms.during the period of its suspension santos continued to import and distribute tobacco products,including beedies,but did not collect cigarette and tobacco taxes from its customers or file distributor returns.the parmars claim they were unaware of the suspension until late or early,when their new accountant discovered it.with the assistance of their new accountant,the parmars completed and filed all required forms for the years through early,paid the delinquent franchise taxes,and on march,applied to the secretary of state for a certificate of revivor.santos corporate status was revived on april.since that date santos has remained in good standing.
the tobacco audits of santos and the notices of determination 
beginning in the board conducted two cigarette and tobacco tax audits of santos,one for the period december,through september,the second for the period december,through march.the board auditors determined that ashok parmar,as the principal operator of santos during its suspension,owed in cigarette and tobacco distribution taxes plus in interest and in penalties accordingly,on october,the board served a notice of determination on ashok parmar advising him of his personal liability for in cigarette and tobacco distribution taxes,inclusive of interest and penalties,for the period december,through march.
ashok parmar first administrative appeal of the assessment 
on november,ashok parmar filed a petition for redetermination to appeal the october,notice of determination.he argued the board calculations were erroneous and the fraud and evasion penalties were unwarranted.in addition,at the administrative appeal conference,he argued the tax liability was unlawfully assessed against him individually,rather than against santos,which had distributed the beedies during its suspension.
following the administrative appeal conference,the board issued a decision recommending a new audit.the board also recommended that,following the new audit,new notices of determination be issued to each of the parmars as individuals or as members of a de facto partnership since each of the parmars had operated the business and had been responsible for distributing the taxable items during santos corporate suspension.in addition,the board found the fraud and evasion penalties were justified.
the reaudit and the second administrative appeal of the assessment 
after the reaudit,in august the board issued adjusted notices of determination on each of the parmars as individuals and as partners in santos and to santos,a partnership,notifying each of them of their liability for in taxes account number cr et,plus in interest and in penalties.notices of determination were also issued to the parmars as individuals and partners in santos for account no.cp et,plus interest and penalties.the board did not issue a notice of determination to santos as a corporation 
in september the parmars filed a petition for redetermination appealing the august notices of determination.on february,the board issued a decision and recommendation finding the august notices of determination correct and properly served on the parmars as individuals.the board rejected the parmars contention santos should have been assessed,not each of them.
on march,the parmars requested an oral hearing before the board.following the august,hearing,the board affirmed the february,decision,finding the adjusted august notices of determination were properly issued to the parmars as individuals and as partners in a partnership even though santos had been revived as a corporation at the time of the assessment.the parmars petition for rehearing was denied.
payment of the taxes and the board denial of a refund 
from june through july santos issued checks to the board totaling,which the board credited to the parmars tax liability as the parmars had requested in addition,the board levied on the parmars joint checking accounts in the amount of,which it also credited to the parmars tax account.neither the parmars nor santos paid any of the interest or penalties assessed against the parmars.the parmars administrative claims for a refund were denied as being without merit.
the instant refund action 
on october,the parmars filed the instant action seeking a refund of the in cigarette and tobacco taxes paid in part by them and in part by santos and a declaratory judgment as to the amount of taxes,interest and penalties owed.the board,for its part,filed a against the parmars to recover unpaid interest and penalties.santos was not a party to the action.
the board and the parmars filed for summary judgment,or in the alternative,summary adjudication.the board argued the parmars lacked standing to recover any monies paid by santos on their behalf pursuant to section.the parmars argued they had been improperly assessed it was santos,not each of them,that was responsible for the taxes.the court denied both motions.the court rejected the board standing argument on the ground it was not supported by the language of section.moreover,the court ruled,the argument was without merit because the board had credited the parmars account with santos payments.as for the parmars motion,the court appeared to agree that santos,not the parmars,was liable for all taxes incurred during its suspension,but ruled a triable issue of fact existed as to whether santos was acting as a corporation when it distributed the tobacco products during its suspension or whether one or more of the parmars were acting as individual distributors.
during the bench trial,the board again argued the parmars lacked standing to recover any amount paid by santos on their behalf.the parmars,on the other hand,maintained their standing to sue and argued they had been improperly assessed as individuals based on a year old illegal and unpublished internal board policy of assessing individuals for taxes and fees incurred by their corporation during the corporation suspension.
in a lengthy statement of decision,the court determined the parmars,as the parties assessed,had standing to bring a refund action for the full amount of the taxes paid,including those paid by santos,and,in any event,having credited santos payments to the parmars personal accounts,the board was estopped from claiming otherwise.the court also found the board had erred in assessing cigarette and tobacco taxes against the parmars individually rather than against santos,which had been revived and in good standing at the time of the tax assessments.in light of its ruling that the parmars had been improperly assessed,the court dismissed the board for interest and penalties as moot.
attorney fees 
the parmars moved for in attorney fees actual fees of with a multiplier pursuant to code of civil procedure section on the ground the successful outcome of the case had resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,namely,the eradication of a and illegal board policy of assessing individual shareholders of a revived corporation for taxes incurred while the corporation was suspended.the trial court agreed attorney fees were authorized and appropriate under the circumstances and awarded the parmars in attorney fees.
discussion 
the parmars have standing to recover in a refund action only the amount they actually paid,not the amount santos paid on their behalfa.section 
section of the cigarette and tobacco products tax law provides,a judgment shall not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in any action brought against the board to recover any amount paid when the action is brought by or in the name of an assignee of the person making the payment or by any person other than the person making the payment.the parmars insist section simply prohibits the assignment of a refund action.that limited interpretation,however,is contradicted by the plain language of the statute.see day city of fontana cal th,absent ambiguity in statute,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs people lawrence cal th,same.if section simply prohibited the assignment of a refund action,the statute would have concluded with the prohibition against recovery by an assignee and would not have included the disjunctive or followed by additional language prohibiting recovery in a refund action by any person other than the person making the payment.see manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,statutory interpretations that make terms meaningless or inoperative are to be avoided palos verdes faculty palos verdes peninsula unified school dist.cal d,same select base materials,board of equalization cal d,effect should be given whenever possible to every word and phrase of a statute so that no part is left without meaning.
although the relevant language in section has not been addressed in any published appellate court decision,the supreme court interpreted nearly identical language in a similar tax statute in easton county of alameda cal d easton.in easton a real property owner brought a refund action to recover excess property taxes paid by its tenant pursuant to a lease agreement.like the parmars,the property owner argued it had standing to proceed in a refund action because it was the party assessed and thus the one legally responsible for paying the tax.the court disagreed.relying on statutory language in former political code section prohibiting recovery in a refund action when the action is brought by an assignee of the person paying the tax or by any person other than the person who has paid the tax,the court concluded only the party who paid the tax could obtain a refund.the court explained the language show s a legislative intention to allow tax refunds only to those persons who pay the taxes claimed to have been erroneously assessed.the statute operates to benefit all persons who have paid taxes they are not legally bound to pay citation but does not allow a recovery by a property owner whose taxes have been paid by someone else under a contract to do so.in that case,the property owner has parted with nothing and he has no valid claim for a refund.easton,at.
easton,supra,cal d was decided more than two decades before the legislature enacted section in.when legislation has been judicially construed and a subsequent statute on a similar subject uses identical or substantially similar language,the usual presumption is that the legislature intended the same construction people lopez cal th,accord,people ex rel.gwinn kothari th,the legislature is deemed to have acted with knowledge of existing statutes and judicial decisions in re jerry th,see people herrera th.we presume the legislature was aware of the easton interpretation of a substantially similar statute and intended the same construction for section.
our analysis is also reinforced by those judicial decisions construing section the successor to the statute interpreted in easton.see,grotenhuis county of santa barbara th,ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th,ibm personal mayhew tech center,phase ii county of sacramento th.in each case the appellate court followed easton in holding that the person who paid the property tax has standing to recover in a refund action only the money he or she paid.see,grotenhuis,at where excess property taxes were paid in part by the landlord and in part by the tenant,each only had standing to recover the amount it paid grotenhuis may not sue to recover excess property taxes paid by someone else,such as his landlord,who pays the tax by design or mistake ibm personal,at pension plan prohibited under from recovering property tax refund because it was not the party who paid the tax mayhew tech center,at state not entitled to refund of taxes paid to county by property owner because state did not pay the taxes,property owner did.
the parmars attempt to distinguish section and the judicial decisions interpreting it by claiming property tax is inherently different from the distribution taxes at issue in this case.property tax,they explain,is assessed on the property,not the person since the property assessed with the tax can not seek a refund,multiple persons or entities could claim the right to a refund.i n contrast,cigarette and tobacco taxes are assessed against a particular person,and thus it is the person assessed as the distributor that is entitled to a refund of the taxes paid.the possibility of multiple refund claims,which a property tax assessor would face,is not faced by the board as to cigarette and tobacco product taxes.
the proffered distinction is not persuasive.even assuming inherent differences between real property taxes and the instant distribution tax,the question in any refund action is not the nature of the property,but the person who paid the tax.the difficulty in sorting out who may be entitled to the refund is the reason numerous tax statutes,like section,prohibit assignment of a refund action as well as limit who may recover as the court explained in ibm personal,supra,th at page,highlighting section among other tax statutes,the reason these tax statutes impose such a restrictive standing requirement is evident.this limitation frees the taxing authority from the burden of untangling a web of agreements accounts in order to ascertain who is the proper recipient of any refund due.property tax is not unique in this aspect.as the instant case attests,competing claims may arise any time someone pays the tax on behalf of the assessed party,regardless of the nature of the property taxed 
similarly without merit is the parmars attempt to distinguish between section and on the ground the former specifies who can sue for a refund,while the latter merely limits recovery in the action to those persons who paid the tax.whether the issue is framed as one of standing to prosecute a refund action or as one authorizing recovery in the action,the effect is the same only those persons who paid the disputed tax may recover their excess payments in a refund action.easton,supra,cal d at see ibm personal,supra,th at citing as similar to in limiting recovery in refund action to those persons who paid the tax mayhew tech center,phase ii county of sacramento,supra,th at.
our opinion in lincoln national life insurance state board of equalization th lincoln is not to the contrary.in lincoln an insurance company that managed an employer benefit plan brought an action for a refund of franchise taxes it had paid after being assessed insurance taxes based on gross premiums collected.the employer filed a complaint in intervention supporting the insurance company claim for a tax refund.the trial court found the insurance company had been improperly assessed and was entitled to a refund of the taxes it had paid.in addition,the trial court awarded costs to both the insurance company and the employer as the prevailing parties in the action.we reversed the award of costs to the employer,holding that the employer,who had not paid the tax,was prohibited from recovering a judgment in its favor under section.lincoln,at,citing,subd.a a judgment shall not be rendered in favor of the plaintiff when the action is brought by or in the name of an assignee of the insurer paying the tax,interest,or penalties,or by any person other than the insurer that has paid the tax,interest,or penalties.
seizing on the observation in lincoln,supra,th at page that the employer,which was not the party against whom the tax was assessed or the insurer who actually paid the required taxes,is barred from winning a judgment herein,the parmars contend lincoln stands for the proposition that a party has standing to recover in a refund action if it was either assessed or paid the taxes.we held no such thing.in a case in which there was no issue whether assessment alone was sufficient to confer standing to obtain a refund,we simply commented the employer was not even the entity against whom the taxes had been assessed,let alone the party that had paid the tax.see golden gateway center golden gateway tenants cal th,decision is not authority for everything said in the opinion but only for the points actually involved and actually decided santisas goodin cal th,same hills superior court cal,statements or conclusions not necessary to the decision are not to be regarded as authority.
the parmars protest it elevates form over substance to look to the source of the funds as the basis to decide standing to recover in a refund action.after all,they argue,the corporation may have provided the funds to the parmars to pay their individual tax liability but it unquestionably did not pay the tax assessed the parmars did.it appears the parmars want it both ways.they insist on differentiating between themselves and the corporation when determining the proper party assessed,but not when determining the proper party to bring the refund action.in the latter case,they assert,they and santos are one and the same.we reject such a dubious proposition.absent any evidence the parmars were the alter egos of santos a proposition the parmars firmly dispute and for which the trial court found no supporting evidence the parmars may only recover the amount they paid.see grotenhuis county of santa barbara,supra,th at absent evidence that grotenhuis was alter ego of corporation,grotenhuis lacked standing to seek the refund of property taxes paid by corporation.
equitable estoppel 
the parmars argued,and the trial court agreed,the board is equitably estopped from raising the parmars lack of standing to recover in a refund action the monies santos paid on its behalf.to establish equitable estoppel it must be shown the party to be estopped was apprised of the facts and intended his or her conduct to be acted upon or so acted in a way that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party was ignorant of the true state of facts and he or she relied on the conduct to his or her injury.strong county of santa cruz cal d.
the government may be bound by an equitable estoppel in the same manner as a private party when the elements requisite to such an estoppel against a private party are present and,in the considered view of equity,the injustice which would result from a failure to uphold an estoppel is of sufficient dimension to justify any effect upon public interest or policy which would result from the raising of an estoppel.city of long beach mansell cal d,accord,mcknight ranch,franchise tax bd.th.still,t he general rule is that estoppels will not be invoked against the government or its agencies except in rare and unusual circumstances.city of santa cruz pacific gas th.indeed,it is the unusual case in which estoppel will be applied in tax cases the case must be clear and the injustice great fidelity guaranty state bd.of equalization cal d.
the parmars argue estoppel is appropriate because the board never raised the standing issue in the administrative proceedings.that argument is one of forfeiture,not estoppel.see in re cal th,failure to raise issue at earliest opportunity results in forfeiture of question in later proceedings doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn.same.even if forfeiture,which generally applies to the taxpayer claimant may bring action for refund based on grounds set forth in the administrative claim,were also extended to positions taken by the board to deny recovery,the doctrine need not be applied here,where the claim involves the legal interpretation of section based on undisputed facts.see fox state personnel bd.th,forfeiture doctrine not applied when question involves pure question of law such as statutory interpretation based on undisputed facts parr richmond industrial boyd cal d,distinguishing between exhaustion requirements when claim involves agency valuation of property rather than legality of assessment.
second,the parmars contend the board is estopped from raising its standing to recover monies paid by santos because the board accepted the payment and credited the parmars tax account.contrary to the parmars contention,nothing prohibits the board from accepting payment of taxes from someone other than the responsible party nor does crediting the taxpayer account with monies paid by someone else on the taxpayer behalf preclude the board from relying on section standing requirements.moreover,although no notice of determination was issued to santos as a corporation,there is no dispute by either the board or santos that the corporation should have been the entity assessed and,if properly assessed,owed the money it paid.this is not,therefore,the rare or unusual case in which equity demands application of an estoppel against a government agency.
section provides,if the board determines that any amount not required to be paid under this part has been paid by any person,the board shall set forth that fact in its records and certify the amount collected in excess of the amount legally due and the person from whom it was collected or by whom it was paid.the excess amount collected or paid shall be credited by the board on any amounts then due and payable from the person from whom the excess amount was collected or by whom it was paid under this part,and the balance shall be refunded to the person,or his or her successors,administrators,or executors 
the trial court found section permits a refund to the persons who accounts were credited,in this case,the parmars.the parmars cited section in the trial court for this proposition,but have abandoned that argument on appeal,and for good reason.section requires the board to credit the person or entity who paid the tax with any excess or overpayment.it does not permit the refund of money to any person other than the taxpayer successor,administrators or executors who did not pay the tax.nothing in section undermines section or transforms the board decision to credit the parmars individual accounts to an authorization permitting the parmars to recover in a refund action monies they did not pay.
the parmars were properly awarded a refund of the monies they paid 
the trial court found santos was responsible for the disputed cigarette and tobacco taxes based on its distribution of tobacco products during its suspension.the court explained santos status as a suspended corporation did not relieve it of its tax liability and that it,not its principals,remained responsible for actions undertaken during its suspension.the court relied on standard beauty supply stores,cir,which held the suspension of the corporation under section for failure to pay its franchise taxes does not operate to make its principals liable for its tax obligations incurred during its suspension it should be emphasized that,while section suspends the corporation powers,the corporation continues to exist.actions that would have been considered those of the corporation before the suspension should ordinarily continue to be viewed as actions of the corporations.if the corporation acts,it is the corporation,not its agent,officers,or shareholders,who should be held privately responsible for such actions.standard beauty supply,at.the court also relied on section,which makes clear that any corporation that transacts business or receives income within the period of its suspension or forfeiture shall be subject to tax under the provisions of this chapter.
although the board vigorously argued at trial the legality of its policy of assessing principals of a corporation for tax liabilities incurred by the corporation during its suspension,the board has expressly abandoned that argument on appeal instead,it asserts reversal of the entire judgment is required because the trial court improperly shifted the burden to it to establish the tobacco products had been distributed by the parmars in their individual capacities,instead of leaving the burden to prove entitlement to a refund with the parmars as required.see el dorado oil works mccolgan cal d,in tax refund action,taxpayer has burden of proving all facts necessary to establish its right to a refund jimmy swaggart ministries state bd.of equalization d.the record shows otherwise.
the trial court considered whether a corporation could be held liable for the distribution of taxable items during its suspension.after concluding it could,the court next considered whether santos distributed the items while acting as a corporation and found it had finally,it addressed the board arguments that the parmars were essentially the corporation,an argument resting largely on the allegation they had failed to observe corporate formalities.the court construed these arguments by the board as alter ego allegations and,citing affirmative evidence provided by the parmars,found the parmars were not the alter egos of santos.on this record,we have little difficulty concluding the court properly placed the burden on the parmars to show their entitlement to a refund on the ground it was santos that had distributed the taxable items during the relevant period 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the parmars attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine 
governing law 
code of civil procedure section provides for an award of attorney fees to a successful party in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
code of civil procedure section is a codification of the private attorney general doctrine,an exception to the american rule that parties are ordinarily required to pay their own attorney fees.see serrano unruh cal d.the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby benefit a broad class of citizens.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,consumer cause,gooch natural food markets,th.the doctrine justification rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,graham.
when,as here,the attorney fee award under code of civil procedure section does not involve statutory construction,the trial court decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.conservatorship of whitley cal th.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the litigation had resulted in a benefit to a large class of persons 
the board contends this litigation conferred a small benefit to the parmars own economic interests,but did not confer a significant benefit on the public or large class of persons.see dipirro bondo th,because the public always has a significant interest in seeing that laws are enforced,it always derives some benefit when illegal private or public conduct is rectified.nevertheless,the legislature did not intend to authorize an award of fees under code civ,in every lawsuit enforcing a constitutional or statutory right.citations.the statute specifically provides for an award only when the lawsuit has conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.the trial court must determine the significance of the benefit and the size of the class receiving that benefit by realistically assessing the gains that have resulted in a particular case.pacific mutual life ins.state bd.of equalization th,attorney fees not justified under code civ,if the public benefit gained and the important public right enforced are coincidental to the monetary or other personal gain realized by the party seeking fees flannery california highway patrol th,same.
the trial court considered the extent of the benefit a judgment declaring the board unwritten administrative policy illegal and found it significant the court found the termination of a and illegal internal board policy would affect not only the parmars,but also more than corporations subject to the cigarette and tobacco products distribution tax and other similar tax and fee programs.
the board asserts it is misleading to posit corporations as benefitting from the trial court ruling in this case,contending the relevant question is not the number of corporations subject to various tax and special fee programs,but the number of principals who have been improperly assessed for nonpayment of taxes after their corporations were suspended.in that regard,the board proffered declarations from the managers of several other board departments who directed investigations into the number of times in the last eight individuals had been assessed for the actions of their suspended corporations.those declarations indicated only two other instances had occurred in the cigarette and tobacco products distribution context and several others in other tax programs.the board contends the trial court erred in failing to consider those declarations had it done so,it would have found the alleged public benefit illusory.
although the trial court found the declarations inadmissible on the ground the declarants lacked personal knowledge of the research results presented the court also indicated it would have reached the same conclusion even if the declarations had been properly considered even if the evidence were considered,at most it shows that the board has been unable to locate more than two situations where individuals have been charged for taxes when their corporations were suspended the evidence does not show that other situations do not exist.the court also found compelling the fact that the board policy authorizing individual assessments in this context had been in effect for years and concluded the invalidation of an illegal policy adopted in violation of the administrative procedures act,et had conferred a significant nonpecuniary benefit to the public at large.state bd.of equalization superior court th,t here is a manifest public interest in the avoidance of secret law and a correlative interest in the disclo
