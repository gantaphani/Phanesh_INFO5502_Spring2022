zhejiang dunan hetian metal dunan appeals the decision of the united states court of international trade denying dunan motion for judgment upon the agency record.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.on appeal,dunan raises three issues whether the united states department of commerce commerce erred in calculating the surrogate value for brass bar by including shipments from japan,france,and the united arab emirates uae commerce applied an improper adverse inference to dunan december sales quantity data and commerce valuation of labor pursuant to c is contrary to c.dunan notice of appeal was timely.for the reasons explained below,we vacate and remand.
background 
on march,parker hannifin parker hannifin or appellee filed an antidumping petition the petition on behalf of the domestic industry concerning imports of frontseating service valves fsvs from the people republic of china china,alleging that chinese firms were exporting fsvs to the united states at prices that were less than fair value in april of,commerce initiated its antidumping duty investigation.frontseating service valves from the people republic of china preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value,preliminary negative determination of critical circumstances,and postponement of final determination.dep t of commerce,preliminary determination.commerce established july,through december,as the period of investigation.id.on june,commerce selected dunan as a mandatory respondent for the investigation.id.at.commerce published its preliminary determination in october.id.in march of,commerce published its final determination.frontseating service valves from the people republic of china final determination of sales at less than fair value and final negative determination of critical circumstances.dep t of commerce march,final determination.the factual background relating to the specific issues presented on appeal is discussed below.
selection of a surrogate value for brass bar 
for the purposes of antidumping duty investigations,commerce considers china to be a economy.preliminary determination.at.as a result,commerce employed its economy methodology to calculate the normal value of the fsvs dunan exported.as described by commerce,
section c of the act directs commerce to base normal value nv on the economy producer factors of production fops,valued in a surrogate market economy me country or countries considered to be appropriate by commerce.in accordance with section c of the act,in valuing the fops,commerce shall use,to the extent possible,the prices or costs of the fops in one or more me countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the economy country and significant producers of comparable merchandise.
id.at internal footnotes added.in accordance with this methodology,commerce selected india as the surrogate market economy.id.commerce found that india is at a level of economic development comparable to that of china,is a significant producer of comparable merchandise,fsvs and has publicly available and reliable data.
with respect to the factors of production dunan utilized to manufacture fsvs,dunan indicated that brass bar was one of its primary raw materials.to value this factor of production,dunan provided a first surrogate value submission that included indian import statistics under harmonized tariff schedule hts heading covering brass bars from the monthly statistics of the foreign trade of india,as published by the government of india directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics of the ministry of commerce and industry,as set forth in the world trade atlas wta indian import data.in addition to this information,dunan also submitted infodrive india pertaining to this hts heading.
to value brass bar for the preliminary determination,commerce used an average indian import value,which represented the average value of all the materials imported into india under hts category as reported in the wta indian import data.joint appendix ja w e find that wta indian import data represent the best available information for purposes of valuing brass bar and have relied upon these data in calculating margins for this preliminary determination.in its preliminary determination,commerce concluded that dunan dumping margin was.preliminary determination.at.
in response to commerce preliminary determination,dunan submitted a brief objecting to various aspects of the determination.specifically,dunan argued that,on the basis of the infodrive data,commerce should exclude import data from japan,france,and the uae because the materials imported from these countries were not brass bar.according to dunan,commerce inclusion of these materials in its calculation of the brass bar surrogate value rendered it less accurate,and,thus,resulted in an unduly high dumping margin.
despite dunan arguments,commerce issued a final determination that calculated the surrogate value for brass bar without excluding the imports from japan,france,and the uae.antidumping duty investigation of frontseating service valves from the people republic of china issues and decision memorandum for the final determination,wl,at comment commerce has concluded that for the final determination,we will continue to include the value of imports from japan,france,and the uae in calculating the surrogate value for brass bar issues and decisions memorandum.explaining its reasoning,commerce stated 
w ith respect to the imports in question we find that the infodrive data contain insufficient product information in the description of the line items to enable commerce to make a definitive determination that these line items are misclassified.specifically,the product description in the infodrive data are such that,given the dependency upon the chemical of the underlying products,they could be properly classified within the indian hts category where they are,or in the category addressed by dunan.thus,commerce can not determine,due to lack of product detail,chemical properties,the precise chemical of these line items.accordingly,without clear evidence to the contrary,commerce will not speculate that these materials have been misclassified.therefore,pursuant to section c of the act,commerce has determined to include imports from japan,france,and the uae in calculating the surrogate value for brass bar in the final determination because the record evidence does not demonstrate that the imports from these countries were misclassified.
id.commerce found,moreover,that the wta indian import data represent ed the best surrogate value in this case because they are publicly available,contemporaneous,tax exclusive,and representative of brass bar prices.ja.
application of partial adverse facts available to dunan december sales 
during the period of investigation,dunan reported that it had a single customer.according to dunan,it maintained inventory in this customer warehouse through a vendor managed inventory program.zhejiang dunan hetian metal united states,d.int l trade.pursuant to this program,dunan would ship fsvs from china to the customer warehouse.the customer only actually purchased the fsvs when it withdrew them from the warehouse.id.at the end of each month,the customer would send dunan a consumption report that indicated how many of each type of fsv it had withdrawn.id.utilizing this information,dunan would confirm both the quantities and prices indicated in the report.id.confirming prices was simple the sales price for each fsv was established in a prior agreement between dunan and its customer.issues and decisions memorandum,wl at comment.that price,moreover,did not vary on the basis of quantity sold,nor did it vary over the course of the period of investigation.confirmation of the quantity of fsvs the customer removed from the warehouse was a more complicated exercise.a dunan employee at the customer warehouse would examine the product inventory to determine what had been removed.zhejiang,d at.if the customer consumption report was correct,dunan would send an invoice applying the predetermined prices to the figures in the report.id.if the consumption report was inaccurate with respect to quantity,dunan would correct the inaccuracies and send the customer a corrected invoice.id.in addition,dunan would keep a record of the discrepancy.id.dunan provided commerce with sales invoices for the period of investigation.
the preliminary determination was made on the basis of this unverified sales information.see preliminary determination.at.commerce is,however,required to verify all information relied upon in making its final determination.i.during verification,commerce determined that,for december,dunan customer paid a total of thirty cents less for that period than the invoice indicated it owed.zhejiang,d at.when questioned,dunan provided no reason for the discrepancy.id.commerce also discovered that the consumption report and the sales invoice for december did not match the quantities of fsvs used by dunan customer according to the consumption report differed significantly from the quantity of fsvs dunan customer was billed for using.id.
initially,dunan did not have an explanation for these discrepancies.id.at.later,however,dunan explained that inaccurate quantities were reported in the december consumption report and that dunan employee at its customer warehouse corrected the inaccuracies in the december invoice,thereby creating the discrepancy.id.despite dunan stated policy of keeping records of such inaccuracies,however,it had no record of any inaccuracy in the consumption report or of the correction in the invoice.id.eventually,dunan indicated that its customer probably misreported the quantity numbers for financial reasons.id.
dunan also maintained separate monthly inventory reports,which carried over the inventory from the previous month id.unlike the other monthly inventory reports,the january report did not account for the final inventory from the previous month id.at.in other words,the report did not account for the december inventory remaining after subtracting the customer purchases for that month the january report instead used the customer quantity reported in the consumption report.id.after initially providing no explanation for the discrepancies in the monthly inventory reports,dunan eventually indicated that it varied the structure of the january monthly inventory report for tax reasons.id.at.
in light of these inaccuracies and discrepancies,commerce concluded that it was unable to verify dunan sales data for december.issues and decisions memorandum,wl at comment we find that the information to construct an accurate and otherwise reliable margin with respect to certain of dunan sales in the month of december,and the information to value inventory carrying cost icc for all sales for the months of october,november and december,is not available on the record.commerce also concluded that,in light of dunan failure to provide commerce with accurate and verifiable data,and its lack of clarity during verification,the application of certain partial adverse facts available partial afa inferences was proper with respect to certain sales of two types of fsvs.id.we determine that dunan failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with commerce request for information by not providing it with accurate and verifiable sales data,and that the application of partial afa is therefore warranted.with respect to these sales,commerce first applied an adverse inference to the icc information it found incalculable on the basis of dunan record.commerce then applied as the transaction specific dumping margin for dunan december sales of the two fsvs.final determination.at accordingly,as partial afa for certain sales,commerce is applying the rate from the initiation,which is percent.
regression analysis to value labor 
in accordance with c commerce valued the labor factor of production using regression analysis that included wage rates and gross national income data from market economy countries.zhejiang,d at.on this basis,commerce determined that dunan surrogate wage was per hour.id.at.dunan argued that this analysis was impermissible because it utilized data from countries that were neither economically comparable to china nor significant producers of comparable merchandise.issues and decisions memorandum,wl at comment see also c commerce in valuing factors of production shall utilize,to the extent possible,the prices or costs of factors of production in one or more market economy countries that are a at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country,and b significant producers of comparable merchandise.commerce rejected these arguments,and utilized this surrogate,wage rate in its final determination.issues and decisions memorandum,wl at comment because the department regression analysis utilizes the best available information for the calculation of a surrogate value for labor,complies with commerce regulation,and comports with the statute,commerce continues to value labor in this case using its regression analysis.
d.the court of international trade decision 
dunan appealed commerce final determination to the court of international trade.zhejiang,d at.in this appeal,dunan challenged a variety of commerce determinations,including the three issues raised before this court.sustaining commerce final determination in all respects,the court of international trade denied dunan motion.id.at.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a decision of the court of international trade evaluating an antidumping determination by commerce by reapplying the statutory standard of review that the court of international trade applied in reviewing the administrative record.nippon steel united states,citing ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states.in recognition of commerce expertise in administering the antidumping laws,courts grant deference to its decisions.see,id.at commerce special expertise in administering the law entitles its decisions to deference from the courts.torrington united states.we will uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.micron,united states,quoting b b i.
substantial evidence is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.nippon,at quoting consol.edison nlrb.this court reviews the record as a whole,including evidence that supports as well as evidence that fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.id.at quoting atl.sugar,united states.in sum,the question before this court on review is whether the administrative record contains substantial evidence to support the determination and was it a rational decision.gerald metals,united states,citation omitted.
commerce calculation of the brass bar surrogate value 
dunan first argument on appeal is that commerce erred when it calculated the surrogate value for brass bar using the wta indian import data that included imports from japan,france,and the uae.dunan argues that commerce should have excluded the imports from japan,france,and the uae from the wta indian import data before it calculated the surrogate value for brass bar.in support,dunan provided commerce with infodrive data that it argued established that the imports from these countries were not brass bar and had been imported under the incorrect hts heading.
commerce refused to exclude the imports from these countries because 
the product description in the infodrive data are such that,given the dependency upon the chemical of the underlying products,they could be properly classified within the indian hts category where they are,or in the category addressed by dunan.thus,the department can not determine,due to lack of product detail,chemical properties,the precise chemical of these line items.accordingly,without clear evidence to the contrary,the department will not speculate that these materials have been misclassified.
issues and decisions memorandum,wl at comment.the court of international trade found that substantial evidence supported commerce decision not to exclude the imports from these countries because there was insufficient evidence in the record upon which commerce could have concluded that the imports from these countries were imported under the incorrect hts heading,and thus,were not representative of the material dunan used to manufacture fsvs.zhejiang,d at.
commerce selection of a value for brass bar is governed by u.c.this statute requires commerce to choose data that is the best available information on the record.c.commerce is granted broad discretion to determine whether information is the best available because the statute does not define the term.taian ziyang food united states,d.int l trade citing rhodia,united states,d.int l trade.in determining the valuation of the factors of production,the critical question is whether the methodology used by commerce is based on the best available information and establishes the antidumping margins as accurately as possible.shakeproof assembly components united states.this court duty is not to evaluate whether the information commerce used was the best available,but rather whether a reasonable mind could conclude that commerce chose the best available information.goldlink indus.united states,d.int l trade.
the thrust of dunan argument is that the record established that the imports from japan,france,and the uae were not brass bar.accordingly,because these imports were not representative of the input dunan actually used it was unreasonable for commerce to use these shipments in its surrogate value calculation even if they were properly classified in the hts heading.dunan br.the problem with dunan argument is that the record does not establish that the materials imported from japan,france,and the uae were products other than brass bar.
dunan is correct that the infodrive data included actual product descriptions of the materials imported from japan,france,and the uae.it is also correct that,according to the product descriptions,the materials imported from these countries were copper bar,bronze bar,beryllium copper flat bar,beryllium copper round bar and cupro nickel bar.dunan,moreover,provided evidence that such materials were not representative of the material it used to manufacture fsvs,and that these materials would be imported under different hts headings,not.dunan is,however,incorrect that all of this information plainly established that of the shipments from these three countries were for products other than the brass bar used by dunan to produce the subject valves.dunan br.
here,commerce was faced with two sets of data and those data points were inconsistent.the first is the hts heading under which the materials in question were imported into india.the other set of data is the product descriptions contained in the infodrive data.as dunan concedes,for the imports in question,it is impossible for both the hts heading and the product descriptions to be accurate.if the product descriptions are accurate,the materials should have been imported under a different hts heading.if,on the other hand,the hts heading is correct,the product descriptions must be incorrect.the evidence dunan provided does not establish which data set is correct.
instead,dunan simply assumes that infodrive product descriptions are correct and the hts headings incorrect.for example,dunan maintains that t he infodrive india data on this record showed that many of the shipments within hts were not actually brass bar.dunan br.in support,dunan only points to the court of international trade discussion of how infodrive creates its data.id.at discussing quotation cited supra.this discussion by the court of international trade does not establish that the descriptions contained in the infodrive data are accurate,however.specifically,according to infodrive,it receives its data directly from the indian customs officials and then presents the indian customs data exactly as it is received,without additions or deletions.dorbest united states,d.int l trade infodrive india data appears to be the same data provided in the wta in a desegregated form,providing descriptions of the items that are imported and classified under a particular hts subheading.
as the court of international trade in this case said,e ach month,infodrive india collects,collates and standardizes from indian ports,over two million export shipping bills and import bills of entry.zhejiang,d at internal citations and quotations omitted.given this volume,there is no reason to believe and no evidence in the record to indicate that infodrive does anything to verify the information it receives.while infodrive states that it includes both product descriptions and hts headings because the classification is often wrong,this does not establish ipso facto that it is the product descriptions which are correct.as dunan admits,infodrive provides an actual product description for the shipment taken from the shipping bill.dunan reply br.what dunan overlooks is that the same importer who classified the goods into an hts heading also provided the apparently conflicting description of the goods.oral argument at,zhejiang dunan hetian metal united states,available at dunan offers no concrete reason to assume that,where a conflict in the two is apparent,the product description provided is always correct,while the hts heading the same source provided is always incorrect.the infodrive product descriptions and the hts headings it reports are all from the same source.accordingly,where the hts heading and the product descriptions are mutually exclusive,it is not possible,on the basis of only the infodrive descriptions and the hts headings,to determine which is correct,and commerce has no obligation to assume that the hts heading the data point upon which it normally relies should not control.
the cases and determinations in prior dumping investigations cited by dunan do not alter this conclusion.those cases all share the common fact that the hts heading chosen by commerce was overly inclusive.in other words,the hts heading,by definition,included materials that were not representative of the inputs utilized by the manufacturer.for this reason,both the hts heading and the product descriptions could describe accurately the materials imported.in that situation,calculating a surrogate value on the basis of every material imported under the hts heading,in the face of infodrive descriptions suggesting that certain imports were not representative,might well conflict with commerce obligation to use the best available evidence for its calculation of surrogate value.
in longkou haimeng machinery united states,for example,commerce selected an hts heading which contained several different types of pig iron,all of which had less than or equal to phosphorous.d.int l trade.the manufacturer cited infodrive data indicating that as much as of the material imported into india under the relevant hts heading was sorelmetal.id.at.sorelmetal was not suitable for manufacture of the subject merchandise because it has very different properties than the specific pig iron the manufacturer utilized.id.in response to this argument,commerce stated that it had chosen this heading because it was contemporaneous with the period of review and it was specific to the raw material used by the manufacturer because the manufacturer indicated that it used pig iron with less than or equal to phosphorous.id.at.the court of international trade found commerce argument insufficient to explain why the hts heading was the best available information for valuing the pig iron utilized by the manufacturer.id.at.the court concluded that commerce argument 
d id not address the question of whether or not the pig iron imports into india,under hts,are consistent with the pig iron consumed by plaintiffs.therefore,the court finds that commerce failed to adequately explain whether the indian imports under hts are the best available information for valuing pig iron consumed by the plaintiffs in the production of subject merchandise.
dunan does not dispute that the hts heading selected by commerce is the heading under which the type of brass bar it uses should be categorized during importation into india.nor does it argue that the category is extremely broad such that it properly also includes materials other than those dunan utilizes.see zhejiang,d at.instead,dunan argues that the imports from japan,france,and the uae were improperly categorized during importation and should have been imported under other hts headings.commerce and the court below concluded that the imports from japan,france,and the uae should be included in commerce calculation because the infodrive data was not,standing alone,sufficient evidence to support dunan contention that the imports from these countries received incorrect hts headings during importation.thus,unlike the circumstances in longkou haimeng machinery,here the hts heading is not so broad that it could encompass the infodrive descriptions.given this fact,commerce was unwilling to find that the materials were improperly categorized based on the infodrive description,absent some other evidence to indicate that the infodrive descriptions were correct,and the hts heading incorrect.issues and decisions memorandum,wl at comment.
dunan notes that commerce was admonished previously by the court of international trade for not affording infodrive data sufficient weight these cases do not,as the court of international trade determined in this case,stand for the broad proposition that infodrive data must control commerce decision making.zhejiang,d at.these cases focus on a complete failure to address whether or not infodrive india casts light on potential inaccuracies in the wta data.dorbest,d at.here,however,commerce did address the relevance of the infodrive descriptions.as the court of international trade concluded,commerce,assuming the infodrive data were in fact reliable,directly discussed infodrive india relevance to the wta data and found the infodrive data to be inconclusive.zhejiang,d at.
contrary to dunan assertion,moreover,commerce was not addressing the wrong issue when it stated that it would require additional information such as chemical analysis of the imports in question before it would conclude that the imports were classified incorrectly.id.dunan is correct that the question before commerce was whether the imports in the classification chosen by commerce were representative of the input dunan utilized.because dunan did not argue that the hts heading properly would have included inputs that were not representative of the input it utilized,however,the only question was whether the products from japan,france,and the uae were characterized properly under this hts heading.on the record before it,commerce would need to resort to speculation to conclude that they were not.we can not say,therefore that no reasonable mind could conclude that commerce calculated the surrogate value as accurately as possible.
finally,dunan cites lightweight thermal paper from the people republic of china final determination of sales at less than fair value,and accompanying issues decision memorandum at comment,claiming it sets forth the test commerce must employ to determine when it will consider infodrive data.as articulated in lightweight thermal paper,
commerce also considers infodrive data when further evaluating import data,provided the following conditions are met there is direct and substantial evidence from infodrive reflecting the imports from a particular country a significant portion of the overall imports under the relevant hts category is represented by the infodrive india data and distortions of the auv average unit value in question can be demonstrated by the infodrive data.
id.deciding to exclude certain imports from an hts basket category on the basis of infodrive data,commerce in lightweight thermal paper stated,
petitioner has placed on the record infodrive import data representing approximately percent of the imports of the base paper hts category from the united states into india for the period of investigation.these data indicate that a significant majority,over percent of these imports are not first quality base paper,but rather are almost all mill rejected paper,defective merchandise along with some coated printing paper.because the total imports from the united states constitute percent of all imports into india under this hts category,and because they have an auv that is percent below that of the next largest exporter,we find that such imports of mill rejected paper are aberrational with respect to other base paper import values and have a demonstrably distortive effect on the overall auv,lowering it by more than percent.
this test does not support excluding the imports from japan,france,and the uae on the record in this case,however.dunan has not provided any evidence with respect to what percentage of the total exports into india under the hts heading in question are from japan,france,and the uae,nor has it provided evidence that the overall auv is dramatically distorted indeed,commerce noted that the infodrive data only accounted for of the wta data.thus,even if lightweight thermal paper sets forth a controlling test for our consideration,based on this record,dunan can not establish prongs two and three of that test.
because commerce reading of the evidence was reasonable,the court rejects dunan challenge to commerce use of hts,including data on imports from japan,france,and the uae,to calculate the surrogate value of brass bar.accordingly,the court of international trade did not err by including the imports from japan,france,and the uae.
application of partial adverse facts available 
the second issue before this court is whether commerce properly selected the adverse inference it applied to certain sales of fsvs in december dunan does not challenge commerce finding that use of facts otherwise available and an adverse inference were necessary.it only disputes the extent to which commerce resorted to the use of adverse inferences in its calculation.more specifically,commerce found the sales volume data for december lacking and found that there was insufficient data available to value the icc for all sales in october,november and december,it made a determination that it needed to resort to facts otherwise available to fill these gaps in the record.as to the icc,commerce filled the gap with a partial adverse inference with which dunan does not take issue on appeal.it is the way commerce chose to address the gap in the december sales data to which dunan objects.in response to the missing december sale data,commerce applied a transaction specific dumping margin to the sales of two types of fsvs in that month.the court of international trade concluded that use of that margin was supported by substantial evidence.zhejiang,d at.it is that conclusion which dunan appeals.
resolution of this issue requires an examination of the statutes relating to the application of both facts otherwise available and adverse inferences.a governs the application of facts otherwise available.commerce may use facts otherwise available in reaching its determination,specifically where 
necessary information is not available on the record,or 
an interested party or any other person 
a withholds information that has been requested by the administering authority or the commission under this title,
b fails to provide such information by the deadlines for submission of the information or in the form and manner requested,subject to other provisions not relevant here,
c significantly impedes a proceeding under this title,or 
d provides such information but the information can not be verified as provided in i 
a.commerce use of an adverse inference is governed by b,which provides 
if commerce finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority or the commission,commerce,in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle,may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.such adverse inference may include reliance on information derived from the petition,a final determination in the investigation under this subtitle,any previous review under of this title or determination under of this title,or any other information placed on the record.
as these two subsections make clear,comm
