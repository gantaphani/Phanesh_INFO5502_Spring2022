plaza de santa fe limited,llc plaza and stump market,stump market have enjoyed a long contractual relationship in which plaza leases certain commercial property in a shopping center to stump market.stump market operates a grocery store on the leased premises.unfortunately,after a dispute regarding the calculation of rent,the existence of an option to extend the lease,and the payment of repairs to the parking garage in the shopping center,the parties found themselves embroiled in litigation.at trial,both the jury and the court found in favor of stump market on the majority of its claims,both legal and equitable.
plaza now appeals the judgment,raising three issues,but leaving the majority of the judgment unchallenged.plaza disputes the factual finding of the validity of two options extending its lease with stump market,one covering december,to november,the option and another covering december,to november,the option.plaza maintains that neither option is supported by consideration.plaza also argues the option violates the statute of frauds.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we determine plaza never disputed the existence of the option prior to or at trial.accordingly,it waived the issue for appeal.we also conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that the option is valid.the evidence showed it was supported by consideration,and we agree with the trial court that equitable estoppel prevents the application of the statute of frauds.
in the published portion of this opinion,we address plaza claim that the court retention of jurisdiction to enforce the judgment was improper.after granting specific performance as well as other equitable remedies,the court retained jurisdiction to make further orders,including injunctions,if necessary in the future to effectuate and or enforce the court judgment.although a court may retain jurisdiction to assure compliance with its judgment dawson west side union high school dist.th,dawson,such an exercise of jurisdiction is exceptional and limited to special situations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.we are concerned with the court retaining jurisdiction for the life of the lease,which may continue for another years,and interjecting itself into a contractual relationship between two business entities to resolve future,hypothetical disputes.in addition,we note the trial court resolved all the issues between the parties and there appears to be little need for the court to be involved with the administration of the lease until its end.therefore,we conclude the court unlimited retention of jurisdiction after judgment is improper and strike that portion of the judgment.we otherwise affirm the judgment as modified.
factual and procedural history 
the parties 
plaza is the owner and operator of a shopping center located in rancho santa fe,california.roger woolley owned and managed plaza stump market owns and operates village market,the grocery store tenant in plaza shopping center.stump market is a small,business managed primarily by james stump.
the shopping center was constructed in.big bear super market big bear leased space in the shopping center from hubert larson.big bear operated a grocery store on the leased premises.the term of the lease,executed on may,was for years with three additional option periods.if all options were exercised,the tenancy would continue until november.
the rent due under the lease was percent of big bear gross sales over million,with a monthly minimum base rent of.if the percentage rent exceeded per month,big bear would pay the difference on an annual basis.the lease provided that the monthly minimum rent would be automatically increased every five years during the year base term,and every five years after the base term at the beginning of each option period,using a specific cost of living index.
in june,larson transferred his interest in the lease to gilman ordway and roger woolley.through a series of subsequent transfers,the lessor under the lease became plaza,and plaza interest in the lease as the lessor was not disputed at trial.
in,five years into the tenancy,the parties negotiated a substantial change to the lease the amendment.the amendment increased the monthly minimum rent from to for the balance of the lease term.it also increased the percentage rent from percent of gross sales over million,to percent of all gross sales,less the monthly minimum rent.in addition,the parties agreed that the references to cost of living adjustments to minimum rent in the lease were deleted.
in,at the end of the year term of the tenancy,big bear exercised the first option to extend its tenancy.shortly thereafter,big bear assigned its rights under the lease to stump market.in connection with the transfer of the tenancy,the lessor and lessee negotiated further changes to the lease during early.
by letter dated june,signed by woolley and countersigned by stump market,plaza agreed that in addition to the current option,stump market would be granted five additional options.per this agreement,stump market agreed to pay an increased percentage rate of percent of gross sales,due quarterly,less the minimum monthly rent of per month.
in and,stump market exercised the available options to extend its tenancy.in both instances,stump market sent a brief letter to plaza stating its desire to exercise the option.on behalf of plaza,woolley countersigned the letters.
on march,in response to stump market written request,woolley,on behalf of plaza,provided stump market with a letter stating that the remaining three options under the lease were as follows december,to november,december,to november,and december,to november.
damage to the parking garage at the shopping center 
in september,stump met with woolley at woolley house to discuss damage to the parking garage below the village market premises at the shopping center.woolley believed the damage was caused by condensation from the village market freezer units.stump,however,testified that part of the damage had occurred from a leak in that he brought to woolley attention.woolley informed stump that the previous owner knew about the leak,but never repaired it.
both woolley and stump received estimates from engineers to repair the damage.woolley and stump ultimately agreed that stump market would proceed with the repairs proposed by stump market engineer,which included replacing a laminated wood structural beam with a steel beam,a slightly more costly and arguably superior option than the repair suggested by plaza engineer.the lease called for stump market to maintain and repair the premises,but there was evidence that the parties disagreed who was responsible for the damages.stump told woolley that he believed that plaza ha d some responsibility for the damage and asked plaza to pay for some of the repair costs.woolley agreed that plaza would pay for of the total cost of the repairs with stump market advancing plaza share of the expense by deducting plaza share from its quarterly percentage payments.stump agreed that stump market would advance plaza share of the repair costs after woolley told him he was having cash flow problems.woolley then offered stump an additional option for stump market for the period of december,to november,
also,during the september meeting,stump market exercised its option for the period of december,to november,by giving woolley a letter to that effect,which he countersigned.
a few days after the meeting,stump sent a letter to woolley memorializing their agreement.woolley did not respond to the letter.
the dispute 
after stump market proceeded with the repairs,it sent a quarterly report to plaza specifying the deduction from the third quarter percentage rent payment as agreed.woolley then hired an accountant to audit the repair cost and monitor his cost sharing,requesting that the accountant verify whether plaza cost sharing split was percent or percent.stump market calculated the balance of plaza share of the cost of the repairs in its january quarterly report and rent payment.woolley,however,on behalf of plaza,sent a letter to stump market stating he did not remember agreeing to pay for a portion of the repairs to the parking garage.
stump market and plaza then exchanged letters arguing their positions about the calculation of rent under the lease the cost sharing agreement for the repairs stump market exercise of the option to extend the lease until november,and the rent to be paid during this period if the option was exercised and the option.eventually,plaza served stump with a day notice to pay rent or quit,demanding in unpaid rent,the same amount stump market withheld for plaza share of the repairs.in response,stump market paid plaza the disputed under protest and with a full reservation of rights.stump market also filed suit to have the court declare the parties respective rights under the lease and all available option periods.
plaza responded with a letter to stump market terminating the lease.as justification for its election to terminate the lease,plaza claimed stump market failed to pay a portion of its quarterly rent in the third and fourth quarters of for a total amount of as well as for the previous two years in monthly rent.stump market sent plaza a letter denying plaza claims.plaza subsequently filed a against stump market for ejectment.
the dispute proceeded to a jury trial.the jury found predominately in favor of stump market.to this end,the jury concluded that the parties intended the monthly minimum rent to be fixed at for the duration of stump market tenancy,including all option periods.in addition,the jury found stump market committed a nonmaterial breach of the lease by failing to properly maintain and repair the premises,but otherwise was not in breach of the lease stump market exercised its option to extend the lease through november,plaza agreed to pay for of the repairs to the parking garage and stump market was entitled to in damages plaza gave stump market a valid option to extend its tenancy from december,to november,plaza overcharged stump market for maintenance fees for the parking garage and facilities and stump market was entitled to a refund of and both parties breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and were entitled to of damages.
after the jury rendered its verdict,the trial court considered the parties respective equitable claims.the court accepted all of the factual findings and issued rulings favorable to stump market on all claims in a very detailed statement of decision.most pertinent to the issues raised in the appeal,the court declared stump market had effectively exercised the option for the period december,to november,and stump market holds three additional options with the last option period ending november.the court also ordered specific performance of the lease,including the option periods if stump market exercises them and remains in compliance with the lease.in addition,the court reserved its jurisdiction to make further orders,including injunctions,if necessary in the future to effectuate and enforce the court judgment.
plaza timely appealed.
discussion 
plaza raises three issues on appeal.the first two issues involve plaza challenge to the validity of the option and the option.plaza argues that both these options are invalid as a matter of law.next,plaza contends the court has no justification for retaining jurisdiction over the dispute following the judgment.we conclude plaza first two arguments are without merit,but agree with its final contention and modify the judgment accordingly.
the option 
in its opening brief,plaza contends the option is invalid as a matter of law and that we may review its validity de novo.stump market,however,counters that plaza did not raise the validity of this option at trial.in response,plaza asserts it is merely arguing substantial evidence does not support the judgment.specifically,plaza insists stump market failed to prove that the option was supported by consideration.
we agree with plaza that an appellant can raise the contention a judgment is not supported by substantial evidence for the first time on appeal.in re brian th.that said,before we evaluate plaza argument,we need to ascertain if the validity of the option was an issue at trial.
in its opening brief,plaza lists the primary issues of the suit between stump market and plaza.the validity of the option is not referenced.the validity of the option,however,is mentioned.
plaza does not cite to anywhere in the record where it challenged the validity of the option at trial.our review of the record found none either.plaza did not offer any evidence about the validity of the option.it did not even argue the option was not supported by consideration during closing argument.the special verdict form given to the jury,prepared by both parties,did not ask the jury to decide if the option was valid.again,in contrast,the jury was explicitly asked to determine the validity of the option.
however,plaza argues that it had no obligation to challenge the validity of the option because stump market bore the burden on that issue.we agree if the validity of this option was an issue at trial.
plaza asserts stump market placed the validity of the option at issue in its original verified complaint when it alleged the rent provisions of the original lease applied to all remaining option terms.plaza maintains that before stump market could prove that the same rent was applicable to all option periods,it first had to show that the specific options were valid.even if we accept plaza argument,plaza fails to point out where it denied these allegations.the allegations on which plaza now relies were made in paragraph of stump market original verified complaint.plaza verified answer to the original complaint did not contain a response to paragraph.also,plaza verified answer included affirmative defenses,most of them pled in generic fashion,but none of which directly challenged the validity of the option.irrespective of whether stump market original verified complaint placed the validity of the option at issue,plaza did not deny the subject allegations.thus,the validity of the option was not placed at issue merely because of stump market allegations in the original complaint that the rent provisions of the original lease applied to the all remaining option terms.plaza did not deny these allegations,and thus,the allegations should have been taken as true.code civ,subd.a every material allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer,shall for purposes of the action,be taken as true.hennefer butcher d,hennefer.
plaza also claims stump market again raised the issue of the validity of the option because it alleged in paragraph of the first amended complaint that plaza failed and refused,and continue s to fail and refuse,to perform the conditions of the lease on its part in that it refute s the continuing existence of the lease,stump market right to occupy the premises pursuant to the lease,and the amount of rent due under the lease for the remainder of the lease term,including any option periods.plaza denied these allegations in its verified answer to the first amended complaint by way of a blanket denial of all allegations in paragraph.plaza argues t hese allegations necessarily placed in issue whether the remaining options granted by plaza were enforceable,including whether they were supported by consideration.we are not persuaded.
in paragraph,stump market alleges that plaza failed to comply with its obligations under the lease.plaza denied these allegations,implying that it was complying with the lease or it was justified in not doing so.the allegations in paragraph mention option periods only in the context of plaza disputing the amount of rent due.plaza denial of this allegation thus does not place the validity of the option in question.
plaza next asserts that certain allegations of stump market second amended complaint also placed the validity of the option at issue.in the second amended complaint,stump market alleged,among other things,that it had a valid and enforceable contract regarding the tenancy,t he terms and condition of the valid and enforceable contract are contained in a series of writings between the parties,and plaza breached the contract by deny ing the existence of the material terms and conditions of the parties agreement and modifications to the contract.again,even if we assume plaza denied these allegations it is less than clear that plaza was disputing the validity of the option.although the allegations plaza describes refer to the lease in general and modifications to the lease,they do not specifically mention any of the options.
while we determine that none of the allegations highlighted by plaza put the option validity into question,we have found allegations,consistent in all versions of the complaint,which arguably placed the validity of the option at issue.in the original verified complaint,stump market alleged o n march,woolley on behalf of plaza provided stump market with a letter clarifying that stump market had three remaining options under the lease december,to november,december,to november,and december,through november.plaza admitted these allegations were true in its verified answer.stump market repeated these allegations in both its first and second amended complaints,and plaza again admitted the allegations as true.
plaza,however,contends these allegations only refer to woolley sending a letter to stump market.plaza thus argues its admission merely indicates that it agrees woolley sent the letter promising the options,but does not concede that the option is supported by consideration or is otherwise valid.we do not share plaza narrow reading of stump market allegations.
the allegations do not merely refer to woolley offering options.instead,the allegations stated that,by way of letter,woolley was clarifying that stump market had three remaining options.in other words,stump market was alleging that woolley confirmed in writing the existence of three options,including the option.stump market was not alleging that woolley was promising an option that required stump market to provide consideration for the promise to become binding.to the contrary,stump market was alleging the existence of three additional options as evidenced by woolley letter.plaza admitted these allegations.if it had only intended to admit the existence of the letter,but dispute the letter effect the validity of any of the options,it should have phrased the answer accordingly.
by failing to dispute stump market allegation about the existence of the option and admitting the allegation as true,plaza failed to place the option validity at issue at trial.hennefer,supra,d at code civ,subd.a see also witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading,the effect of an express admission is to prevent the plaintiff from offering evidence on the uncontested issue.having not disputed the option validity,plaza may not now argue on appeal that stump market failed to establish the existence of the option,specifically that it was supported by consideration.see richmond dart industries,d.
our conclusion is further buttressed by plaza trial strategy.plaza did not ask the jury to determine if the option was valid.however,it did contest the validity of the option and asked the jury to determine that option validity.plaza offered no evidence at trial concerning the legitimacy of the option.its trial counsel did not examine any witness about the option cogency.further,plaza did not argue to the jury that stump market failed to prove consideration supporting the option.simply put,we find nothing in the record showing that plaza disputed the option validity at trial,which is consistent with our reading of plaza various answers 
the option 
unlike the option,plaza unmistakably contested the validity of the option at trial.however,the jury found in favor of stump market on the issue.here,plaza challenges this finding on two grounds.first,it argues the finding is not supported by substantial evidence because there was insufficient evidence of consideration.second,plaza maintains the option violates the statute of frauds because it is not in writing and equitable estoppel does not prohibit the application of the statute of frauds in this instance.we reject these contentions.

consideration 
a valid contract must be supported by consideration.consideration is a ny benefit conferred,or agreed to be conferred,upon the promisor,by any other person,to which the promisor is not lawfully entitled,or any prejudice suffered,or agreed to be suffered by such person,other than such as he is at the time of consent lawfully bound to suffer,as an inducement to the promisor.
here,plaza argues there was no evidence that stump market gave plaza sufficient consideration to make the option enforceable.plaza concedes the parties agreed that stump market would repair the damage to the parking garage and plaza would pay for of that cost.plaza also admits that at the same time the parties were negotiating the payment of repair costs,plaza granted stump market the option.plaza,however,claims stump market was required under the lease to repair the parking garage thus,its payment to repair the parking garage could not constitute consideration.see.
although plaza has made a correct statement of law regarding consideration,its argument fails because it relies on an inference the jury clearly did not draw.at trial,there was evidence that the parties disagreed about the cause of the damage to the parking garage and who was responsible.plaza argued the damage stemmed from the condensation build up from the village market freezers.however,stump market offered evidence that woolley admitted some of the damage was caused by a preexisting condition that the previous landlord acknowledged,said he would fix,but never did.thus,stump market asserted the damage was beyond what it was required to repair under the lease and that plaza was at least partially responsible for the repair.ultimately,stump market agreed to pay for of the cost of the repairs and plaza consented to pay for.at that time,woolley mentioned to stump that he was having cash flow problems,and stump agreed to front plaza share of the cost.in return,woolley orally granted stump market the option.
on this record,we are satisfied substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the option was supported by consideration.the jury could reasonably infer that plaza received valuable consideration because stump market covered some of the repair costs that were not entirely its responsibility and agreed to advance plaza share of the repair costs.
statute of frauds and equitable estoppel 
the statute of frauds requires an option to lease to be in writing,subd.a.however,e quitable estoppel may preclude the use of a statute of frauds defense.byrne laura th.here,the court found that plaza was equitably estopped from arguing the statute of frauds invalidated the option.plaza argues the court erred in applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel.we disagree.
whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel should be applied in a given case is generally a question of fact.byrne laura,supra,th at.the existence of an estoppel is generally a question of fact for the trial court whose determination is conclusive on appeal unless the opposite conclusion is the only one that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence.driscoll city of los angeles cal d,driscoll.generally speaking,four elements must be present in order to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.ibid.if one of the elements is missing,equitable estoppel does not apply.feduniak california coastal com.th.
plaza only challenges the court finding on one element of equitable estoppel.it asserts the fourth element,detrimental reliance,is not present.the court found stump market relied to its detriment on plaza promise because it hired a contractor and paid for improvements to the parking garage.similar to its argument that the option is not supported by consideration,plaza insists stump market acts can not be deemed detrimental reliance because it already had the obligation to pay for those improvements under the lease.
plaza asserts that the only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence is that stump market already had the obligation to pay for the repairs to the parking garage.we are not persuaded.as we discuss above,the parties disagreed about the cause of the damage to the parking garage and who was responsible for paying for its repair.ultimately,the parties decided to share the costs of repair,with plaza portion being.stump market also agreed to front plaza portion of the costs because plaza was experiencing a cash flow problem.in exchange,woolley,on behalf of plaza,granted stump market another option.under these facts,the court reasonably could have found detrimental reliance.because the conclusion argued by plaza is not the only one that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence,we determine the court finding is conclusive.see driscoll,supra,cal d at.
continuing jurisdiction after judgment 
after the jury rendered its verdict,the court agreed with the jury findings of fact and adjudicated equitable claims.to this end,the court ordered plaza to perform all conditions,covenants,and promises required to be performed by plaza under i the lease as amended,and ii this judgment.in addition,it required plaza to permit stump market to continue in possession of the premises until the expiration of the current option period,unless and until the court determines in the future that stump market is no longer entitled to possession.the court also ordered plaza to allow stump market to remain in possession of the premises if it properly exercises future options,unless and until the court determines in the future that stump market is no longer entitled to possession.the court declined to grant any injunctive relief.however,the court retained jurisdiction to make further orders,including injunctions,if necessary in the future to implement the court judgment granting specific performance and declaring the parties rights and responsibilities.the court also stated it was retaining jurisdiction to effectuate or enforce the judgment.
both parties agree that j urisdiction over a cause or parties after a final judgment,order,or decree is exceptional and limited to special situations.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,jurisdiction.they,however,dispute whether this case qualifies as the appropriate special situation.plaza argues the court retention of jurisdiction here constitutes unjustified judicial supervision of the parties continuing contractual relationship.stump market characterizes the court retention of jurisdiction as limited and proper to allow the court to enforce its judgment.
here,the court reserved its jurisdiction to enforce the judgment,specifically its order of specific performance.the jurisdiction of a court of equity to enforce its decrees is coextensive with its jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties,and it has power to enforce its decrees as a necessary incident to its jurisdiction.except where the decree is,jurisdiction of the cause continues for this purpose,or leave may be expressly reserved to reinstate the cause for the purpose of enforcing the decree,or to make such further orders as may be necessary.day sharp d,quoting klinker klinker d.it follows that retention of jurisdiction by the court for the purpose of interpreting and enforcing its judgment is within the scope of declaratory relief.dawson,supra,th at.ostensibly,this authority suggests the court did not abuse its discretion in retaining jurisdiction after the judgment.however,we are mindful that the court reserved jurisdiction over what could be the next years over years from the date of judgment if stump market exercises all the options.we are unaware of any reported case in which a court retained jurisdiction for a similar length of time to essentially govern the parties operating under a contract negotiated at arm length.
