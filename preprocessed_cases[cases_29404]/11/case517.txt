plaintiffs challenge a bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms batf letter requiring federal firearms licensees to submit certain record information to batf.the district court held that the letter violated section of the firearms owners protection act of,a.rsm,buckles,d.because batf issuance of the letter was limited to federal firearms licensees who had violated federal law in failing to comply with firearms trace requests,we must reverse the judgment.
pursuant to the gun control act of,as amended,the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms operates a firearms tracing system.the system is designed to assist law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations.a firearms trace typically begins when a law enforcement agency submits a trace request to batf after recovering a firearm from a crime scene or from a suspect.batf then tracks the movement of the weapon through the chain of distribution to the federal firearms licensee ffl who ultimately sold the firearm to the retail purchaser.when batf initiates a trace request,ffls are required to provide information such as the purchaser name,address,and federal firearms license number.ffls are also required to respond to batf trace requests within hours.see g a.
in february,batf adopted new internal procedures because some ffls were not adequately complying with its trace requests.first,batf developed a definition of uncooperative ffls.the definition included those ffls who,in failed to respond to a firearms trace request on at least one occasion failed to respond to a trace request within hours on three or more occasions or provided incorrect information in response to a request.batf then issued demand letters to the ffls whom batf deemed to be uncooperative.the ffls receiving these letters constituted less than percent of all the ffls nationwide.the letters required the ffls to submit information concerning their firearms purchases and sales for the past three years,and on a monthly basis thereafter.the information requested included a description of the firearms including the models,serial numbers,and types,as well as the purchasers names,addresses,and federal firearms license numbers.
batf saved the record information that it received from ffls pursuant to its letters.with the exception of the purchaser name,batf also entered all the information into an electronic database.if batf determined that an uncooperative ffl had become cooperative,batf would destroy the hard copies of the record information.however,batf continued to save the information in its electronic database.
on february,batf issued a letter to rsm,valley gun of baltimore valley gun.batf contended that valley gun had repeatedly failed to comply in a timely manner with batf trace requests.in response,plaintiffs filed this action against the director of batf seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.plaintiffs included valley gun,valley gun owner,and three anonymous individuals who lawfully purchased firearms from valley gun.plaintiffs alleged that the demand letter exceeded the scope of batf statutory authority and also violated their fourth and fifth amendments rights.in addition,plaintiffs claimed that the letter was invalid because it had been issued by an official who lacked authority to do so.
on april,after a bench trial,the district court permanently enjoined batf from seeking to enforce its letter.see rsm,d at.the court found that rsm failed to timely comply with trace requests on three or more occasions in.id.at.the court held,however,that the letter violated section of the firearms owners protection act of,a.id.at.batf now appeals.
congress passed the gun control act of,pub,stat,to regulate interstate firearms transactions.see national rifle ass brady,cir.among other things,the act requires that importers,manufacturers,and dealers of firearms obtain a federal license in order to operate.see a,a.under the act,the licensee must maintain all records of firearms transactions as required by federal regulation.the regulations are prescribed either by the secretary of the treasury or the secretary delegates,including batf officials.see g.
in december,the department of the treasury issued regulations designed to implement the gun control act record keeping requirements.in particular,section a requires licensees,when requested by letter,to submit the relevant record information to batf.see a 
in,congress enacted the firearms owners protection act,stat.fopa,to amend several provisions of the gun control act.fopa was intended to reduce the regulatory burden on firearms owners without incapacitating batf ability to combat violations of the firearms laws.see brady,at.two provisions of fopa are relevant to this case.first,fopa enacted section g a,which essentially codified a.see g a like the regulation,section g a obliges each federal firearms licensee,when required by letter,to submit record information to batf.see id.
second,fopa amended section a to limit the secretary ability to pass regulations creating a registry of firearms.see a the amendment provides that batf may not prescribe any rule or regulation after the enactment of fopa requiring firearms records to be recorded at or transferred to a facility owned,managed,or controlled by the united states.id.the amendment also prevents batf from prescribing rules or regulations which require that any system of registration of firearms,firearms owners,or firearms transactions or dispositions be established.id.
plaintiffs principal argument is that batf letter exceeds the scope of its authority under section g a and violates the limitations set forth in section a.
section g a grants batf some limited amount of authority to secure record information from ffls.see g a.that provision states 
each licensee shall,when required by letter issued by the secretary,submit on a form specified by the secretary,all record information required to be kept by this chapter.
id.likewise,a recognizes batf authority to issue letter requests.that regulation provides 
each licensee shall,when required by letter issued by the director of industry operations,submit on form,report of firearms transactions,all record information required by this subpart,or such lesser record information as the director of industry operations in his letter may specify.
batf contends that unless some other statutory provision narrows the scope of g a and a,these provisions would permit batf to issue the letter in this case.plaintiffs suggest several possible limitations.their primary argument is that batf demand letter violates section a prohibitions against the transfer of firearms records to a federal facility and the establishment of any system of registration of firearms.a.
by its plain text,however,section a does not directly limit batf authority under either g a or.section a prohibitions apply only to a rule or regulation prescribed after the date of the enactment of the firearms owners protection act.a emphasis added.section g a is a statute,not a rule or regulation.likewise,while is a regulation,it was prescribed in,long before the enactment of fopa in.
the district court was cognizant of this fact but believed that batf had never before interpreted the regulation to permit batf to issue letters such as those in this case.see rsm,d at.batf in turn presented substantial evidence that it interpreted to permit it to issue letters to noncompliant ffls as far back as.however,this dispute does nothing to change the fact that section a limitation is triggered by the date on which the rule or regulation was prescribed.see a.because was prescribed in,and because the regulation grants batf authority to issue the letters regardless of whether batf has previously exercised that authority,section a does not directly foreclose batf authority to issue the letter.however,as discussed below,the statute does not grant batf an unbounded delegation of authority to request record information.
plaintiffs next argue that section g requires batf letters to be in relation to a bona fide criminal investigation.they contend that since batf letter to valley gun is not required for determining the disposition of firearms in the course of a partic
