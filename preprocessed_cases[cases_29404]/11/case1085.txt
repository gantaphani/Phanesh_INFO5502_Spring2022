introduction 
this case concerns the constitutionality of certain california statutes and regulations.these statutes and regulations prohibit licensed opticians from offering prescription eyewear at the same location in which eye examinations are provided and from advertising that eyewear and eye examinations are available in the same location.the national association of optometrists and opticians,lenscrafters,and eye care centers of america,collectively plaintiffs maintain that these california statutes and regulations violate the dormant commerce clause on remand from this court,plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the statutes and regulations place a burden on interstate commerce that excessively outweighs the local benefits of the law.california attorney general and department of consumer affairs collectively the state filed a for summary judgment.the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the state motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that california business professions code sections,and,and two companion regulations,of regs,title sections and collectively challenged laws violate the dormant commerce clause.plaintiffs challenge these laws to the extent they prohibit opticians and optical companies from offering prescription eyewear at the same location in which eye examinations are provided and from advertising that eyewear and eye examinations are available in the same location.section prohibits opticians and optical companies from having any membership,proprietary interest,relationship,or any arrangement in any form,directly or indirectly with ophthalmologists or optometrists cal.bus.section prohibits optical companies from furnishing,employing,or maintaining optometrists and ophthalmologists on their premises.cal.bus.in addition,opticians may not advertise the services of optometrists or ophthalmologists.cal.bus.regs.tit.
plaintiffs challenged these california laws primarily because optometrists and ophthalmologists may set up a practice where patients may receive both eye examinations and prescription eyewear,but opticians may offer only the sale of eyewear,not eye examinations,and therefore are unable to offer the convenience of shopping in california.the restrictions on shopping apply to all opticians and optical companies when they sell eyewear in california,regardless of whether their stores are entirely owned by california entities or are owned by companies incorporated outside of california.
plaintiffs moved for summary judgment,and the state opposed the motion.the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the challenged laws discriminate against interstate commerce and that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence that there are no other means to address its legitimate interest in protecting public health.ass of optometrists opticians lockyer,d.the state appealed.
we reversed,holding that the challenged laws were not discriminatory on their face,in their purpose,or in their effect see ass of optometrists opticians brown,cir.although we concluded that the challenged laws were not discriminatory,we recognized that this holding was not necessarily the end of the dormant commerce clause analysis and remanded to the district court to determine whether the challenged laws violate the dormant commerce clause even though they are not discriminatory.id.at.
on remand,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the state motion for summary judgment.ass of optometrists opticians brown,d.the court effectively concluded that,based on the facts and the law,there were no genuine issues of material fact.plaintiffs argued that the challenged laws impermissibly burdened interstate commerce because the challenged laws preclude an interstate company from offering shopping,which is the dominant form of eyewear retailing and interstate firms would incur a great financial loss as a result of the challenged laws.id.at.the district court concluded that it need not consider the evidence supporting these theories because both theories failed as a matter of law.id.in reaching this conclusion,the court reasoned that,because there was no cognizable burden on interstate commerce,it need not attempt to balance the against the putative local interests under the test derived from pike bruce church,d.id.at.plaintiffs timely appealed,and that appeal is now before us.
iii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.far out,oskar,cir.therefore,our review is governed by the same standard used by the district court under federal rule of civil procedure a.id.rule a provides that a court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.the substantive law determines which facts are material only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.anderson liberty lobby,d.we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.video software dealers ass schwarzenegger,cir.
iv.analysis 
a.the dormant commerce clause and pike 
an understanding of pike and of the purpose and scope of the dormant commerce clause informs our determination of whether,as a matter of law,plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence of a violation of the dormant commerce clause.although the commerce clause is by its text an affirmative grant of power to congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce,the clause has long been recognized as a limitation on the power of the states to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on such commerce.south central timber,wunnicke,d see also oregon waste,dep t of envtl.quality of state of,d though phrased as a grant of regulatory power to congress,the clause has long been understood to have a negative aspect that denies the states the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.this limitation on state power has come to be known as the dormant commerce clause.see dep t of revenue davis,d.
modern dormant commerce clause jurisprudence primarily is driven by concern about economic protectionism that is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the principal objects of dormant commerce clause scrutiny are statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce.cts dynamics of,d.the central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism,because these are the laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent.c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d.thus,a corollary concern of the dormant commerce clause is that this nation is a common market in which state lines can not be made barriers to the free flow of both raw materials and finished goods.hughes alexandria scrap,d.
given the purposes of the dormant commerce clause,it is not surprising that a state regulation does not become vulnerable to invalidation under the dormant commerce clause merely because it affects interstate commerce.see pac.state of.a critical requirement for proving a violation of the dormant commerce clause is that there must be a substantial burden on interstate commerce.see south central timber,at.most regulations that run afoul of the dormant commerce clause do so because of discrimination,but in a small number of dormant commerce clause cases courts also have invalidated statutes that imposed other significant burdens on interstate commerce.motors tracy,d.these other significant burdens on interstate commerce generally result from inconsistent regulation of activities that are inherently national or require a uniform system of regulation.cts,at.see also exxon governor of,d recognizing that,on rare occasions,the supreme court has held that the commerce clause precludes state regulation in a particular field because a lack of national uniformity would impede the flow of interstate goods.a classic example of this type of regulation is one that imposes significant burdens on interstate transportation.see tracy,at.cts,at.
although dormant commerce clause jurisprudence protects against burdens on interstate commerce,it also respects federalism by protecting local autonomy.davis,at.thus,the supreme court has recognized that under our constitutional scheme the states retain broad power to legislate protection for their citizens in matters of local concern such as public health and has held that not every exercise of local power is invalid merely because it affects in some way the flow of commerce between the states.great atl.pac.tea cottrell,d internal quotations and citations omitted see also huron portland cement city of detroit,d recognizing that the constitution never intended to cut the states off from legislating on all subjects relating to the health,life,and safety of their citizens,though the legislation might indirectly affect the commerce of the country hood sons,du mond.noting that the supreme court generally has supported the rights of states to impose even burdensome regulations in the interest of local health and safety.
in a long line of dormant commerce clause cases,the supreme court has sought to reconcile these competing interests of local autonomy and burdens on interstate commerce.in one of those cases,pike bruce church,the supreme court set forth the following summary of dormant commerce clause law,stating 
although the criteria for determining the validity of state statutes affecting interstate commerce have been variously stated,the general rule that emerges can be phrased as follows where the statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
pike bruce church,d citation omitted.
unfortunately,the pike test has not turned out to be easy to apply.as the supreme court has acknowledged,there is no clear line in supreme court cases between cases involving discrimination and cases subject to pike clearly excessive burden test.see tracy,at.justice scalia has candidly observed that once one gets beyond facial discrimination our jurisprudence becomes and long has been a quagmire.lynn creamery,healy,d scalia,concurring internal quotation marks omitted.
much of the confusion stems from the fact that pike does not define the term and combines the test for discriminatory laws with the test for laws.the cases therefore are not clear or consistent in terms of when a regulation is considered discriminatory and virtually per se invalid and when and how a regulation is subjected to pike s clearly excessive burden test in tracy,the supreme court recognized that a number of its cases purporting to apply the pike undue burden balancing test really turned on the discriminatory character of the challenged regulations.tracy,at.according to the supreme court,only a small number of its cases invalidating laws under the dormant commerce clause have involved laws that were genuinely nondiscriminatory,in the sense that they did not impose disparate treatment on similarly situated and interests.id.
in the instant case,we previously held that the challenged laws are not discriminatory on their face,in their purpose,or in their effect.see ass of optometrists,at.nevertheless,because it is possible for nondiscriminatory regulations to place a significant burden on interstate commerce and thereby violate the dormant commerce clause,we remanded to the district court for a determination of whether the challenged laws,though,nevertheless violate the dormant commerce clause.id.at.the threshold issue in this appeal is whether plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence that the challenged laws,though,impose a significant burden on interstate commerce.as discussed below,we hold that plaintiffs have not produced such evidence.
significant burden on interstate commerce 
on remand,plaintiffs argued that,under pike,the challenged laws impermissibly burdened interstate commerce.ass of optometrists opticians brown,d.the district court,relying in large part on exxon governor of,d,rejected those arguments.id.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court misinterpreted exxon,and they argue that the challenged laws impose a significant burden on interstate commerce because the restrictions on result in a transfer of market share and income from eyewear sellers to optometrists and ophthalmologists who sell eyewear 
in exxon,the supreme court considered a maryland law that prohibited petroleum producers and refiners from owning retail service stations in maryland.exxon.because no petroleum products were produced or refined in maryland,all the producers and refiners affected by the regulation were companies.id.at.the supreme court first rejected exxon argument that the statute was discriminatory.id.at.the court then rejected exxon argument that the statute,even if not discriminatory,still impermissibly burdened interstate commerce by placing all the adverse effects of the regulation on interstate companies.id.at.in the course of explaining why there was not a burden on interstate commerce,the court made it clear that the commerce clause does not protect the particular structure or methods of operation in a retail market.id.at.
the reasoning of exxon applies to the instant case.plaintiffs want opticians to be able to offer shopping.the challenged laws regulating shopping are generally applicable regulations of a method of operating in a retail market.under the reasoning of exxon,the dormant commerce clause does not protect this method of operation,nor guarantee plaintiffs their preferred method of operation,in the eyewear retail market.
plaintiffs argue that exxon does not preclude relief here because the challenged laws have the effect of shifting market share and profits from entities to ones this argument is unavailing.plaintiffs focus on some of the supreme court language in exxon to argue that the supreme court decision in that case turned on the fact that the statute being challenged would not affect the market share of interstate refiners.in particular,plaintiffs direct us to the supreme court response to exxon argument that some refiners would stop selling petroleum in maryland as a result of the maryland statute 
some refiners may choose to withdraw entirely from the maryland market,but there is no reason to assume that their share of the entire supply will not be promptly replaced by other interstate refiners.the source of the consumers supply may switch from stations to independent dealers,but interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes some business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.
id.at.emphasis added.
plaintiffs make much of the fact that the exxon court wrote of a shift from one interstate supplier to another,and they argue that this explains why the supreme court upheld the statute.plaintiffs distinguish their own case on the grounds that here the challenged laws will cause a shift in market share from eyewear sellers owned by companies that are incorporated outside of california to entirely eyewear sellers.it is true that,in exxon,all of the shift in supply necessarily would have been from one supplier to another because there were no suppliers.in contrast,here we may assume that there will be a shift in market share from optical stores owned by companies incorporated to optometrists or ophthalmologists.
but the exxon court own analysis shows that the fact that the change in supply would be from one interstate petroleum supplier to another interstate petroleum supplier had no bearing on the court decision,especially once the court determined that the statute was not discriminatory after ruling that the maryland statute was not discriminatory,the court addressed the argument that the statute nevertheless burdened interstate commerce.the court focused its concern on the free flow of petroleum into the state,not on who ultimately profited.the court noted the crux of appellants claim is that,regardless of whether the state has interfered with the movement of goods in interstate commerce,it has interfered with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or through burdensome regulation.exxon,at.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.it was in the course of rejecting this argument that the court stated we can not accept appellants underlying notion that the commerce clause protects the particular structure or methods of operation in a retail market.id.the court went on to explain that the dormant commerce clause protects the interstate market,not particular interstate firms,from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.id.at.furthermore,the court concluded,if the statute caused the loss of stations owned by some refiners and therefore caused harm to the consuming public,such a result would be related to the wisdom of the statute,not to a burden on interstate commerce.id.at.
the exxon court determined that the challenged statute had no impact on the interstate flow of goods,pointing out that the sales by independent retailers who necessarily obtained their petroleum products from outside maryland were just as much a part of the flow of interstate commerce as sales made by the stations operated by interstate refiners.exxon,at.as part of its analysis,the court held that the case did not involve a situation in which there would be a lack of national uniformity that would impede the flow of interstate goods.id.at.having determined that there was no discrimination or other burden on interstate commerce,the court concluded its commerce clause inquiry and upheld the statute.id.at.thus,in deciding whether there was a burden on interstate commerce and a violation of the dormant commerce clause,the exxon court decision turned on the interstate flow of goods,not on where the retailers were incorporated,what the market shares of sales and profits were,or whether competition would be affected by the statute.exxon thus undercuts,rather than supports,plaintiffs claim.
plaintiffs next argue that minnesota clover leaf creamery,d,supports their claim that there is a significant burden on interstate commerce when nondiscriminatory regulations result in income shifting from corporations to businesses we find this argument unconvincing.the minnesota statute at issue in clover leaf prohibited all milk retailers in minnesota from selling their products in plastic,milk containers.id.at.the likely result of the statute was that many milk retailers would switch from plastic milk containers to paperboard milk containers.id.
after rejecting the argument that the statute was discriminatory the court concluded that the controlling question was whether,under pike,there was a burden on interstate commerce that was clearly excessive in relationship to the putative local interests.id.at.in its analysis of the burden on interstate commerce,the court discussion centered on the flow of goods and raw materials into minnesota.the court began by noting that the statute would permit milk to continue to move freely across the minnesota border.id.the court nevertheless found a relatively minor burden on interstate commerce because the statute would result in some benefits to minnesota pulpwood industry at the expense of industries.id.at.this effect was due to the fact that the plastic resin used in milk jugs was produced by firms,while pulpwood was a major minnesota product.id.
although the supreme court found the burden to be relatively minor and upheld the statute,plaintiffs argue that this part of clover leaf shows that a shift in income from to businesses is a burden on interstate commerce that must be weighed against the benefits of a statute causing such a shift in income.in clover leaf,however,the court made no mention of income and instead discussed manufacturing and exporting materials or goods into another state.the court used terms such as minnesota product,pulpwood producers,minnesota pulpwood industry,and plastics industry,and it addressed the issue of whether there would be a change in the importation into minnesota of materials and goods produced outside of minnesota.id.at.emphasis added.thus,the court determination of whether there was a burden on interstate commerce turned on a change in the flow of goods into the state,not on profits.
we conclude that supreme court precedent establishes that there is not a significant burden on interstate commerce merely because a regulation precludes a preferred,more profitable method of operating in a retail market.where such a regulation does not regulate activities that inherently require a uniform system of regulation and does not otherwise impair the free flow of materials and products across state borders,there is not a significant burden on interstate commerce.we find no support in the law for plaintiffs proposition that there is a significant burden on interstate commerce whenever,as a result of nondiscriminatory retailer regulations,there is an incidental shift in sales and profits to entities from retailers that operate but are owned by companies incorporated 
in light of this law,it is apparent that,in the case before us,there is no material issue of fact regarding whether the challenged laws place a significant burden on interstate commerce.plaintiffs have not produced evidence that the challenged laws interfere with the flow of eyewear into california any optician,optometrist,or ophthalmologist remains free to import eyewear originating anywhere into california and sell it there.in addition,we are not concerned here with activities that require a uniform system of regulation.thus,plaintiffs have failed to raise a material issue of fact concerning whether there is a significant burden on interstate commerce.
benefits of the challenged laws 
relying on pike,plaintiffs argue that,in determining whether a regulation violates the dormant commerce clause,courts are required to examine the actual benefits of nondiscriminatory regulations.however,pike discusses whether the burden on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.see pike,at.emphasis added.it does not mention actual benefits as part of the test for determining when a regulation violates the dormant commerce clause.
even if pike clearly excessive burden test were concerned with weighing actual benefits rather than putative benefits,we need not examine the benefits of the challenged laws because,as discussed above,the challenged laws do not impose a significant burden on interstate commerce.if a regulation merely has an effect on interstate commerce,but does not impose a significant burden on interstate commerce,it follows that there can not be a burden on interstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits under pike.accordingly,where,as here,there is no discrimination and there is no significant burden on interstate commerce,we need not examine the actual or putative benefits of the challenged statutes.this is the implicit lesson of exxon.once the exxon court determined that there was no discrimination and no significant burden on interstate commerce,it ended its dormant commerce clause analysis without assessing the value of the statute purported benefits or actual benefits.see exxon governor of,d.
plaintiffs ask us to determine whether the benefits of the challenged laws are illusory.occasionally,when determining whether a health and safety regulation violates the dormant commerce clause,courts will consider evidence related to a regulation actual benefits to determ
