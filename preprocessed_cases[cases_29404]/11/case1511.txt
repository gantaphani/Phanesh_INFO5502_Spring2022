background 
in september,commerce initiated the fifth administrative review of the antidumping duty order covering tpbi subject merchandise during the period of review.see polyethylene retail carrier bags from thailand.dep t of commerce,final results of antidumping duty administrative review final results.the antidumping statute governs the application of remedial duties to foreign merchandise sold,or likely to be sold,in the united states at less than its fair value.
during administrative reviews,commerce strives to create a fair comparison between the export price or constructed export price of a foreign producer sales and its home market sales or normal value.see id.a.normal value is the price at which the foreign like is first sold in the exporting country,in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and,to the extent practicable,at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price.id.a a,b i.if the price of an item in the home market normal value is higher than the price for the same item in the united states export price,then the comparison produces a positive number,indicating that dumping has occurred.id.a the antidumping duty margin is the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.
in calculating normal value,if commerce has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production cop of that product,commerce determine s whether,in fact,such sales were made at less than the cop.id.b.if so,and if certain other conditions are met,commerce may disregard such sales in the determination of normal value the test.if no foreign like product sales remain after conducting the test,commerce may determine the normal value based on a constructed value cv of the foreign like product.id.a.commerce uses the same method to calculate costs for both cop and cv.thai plastic bags indus.united states thai plastic i,d.int l trade.at issue is commerce method of calculating the normal value of tpbi merchandise based on a cv,once commerce determined that the sales in the exporting country of the foreign like product had been made at prices below the cop.when calculating the cop for the test and the cv,
c osts shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles gaap of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.
here,commerce disregarded the sales of tpbi in the previous administrative review.polyethylene retail carrier bags from thailand.dep t of commerce,preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review preliminary results.thus,commerce had reasonable grounds to suspect tpbi sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value in this review may have been made at prices below the cop.see a ii.accordingly,commerce conducted a cop analysis of tpbi sales in thailand.in its initial questionnaire for the fifth review,commerce requested that tpbi report its cop for the subject merchandise,and allocate those costs across the different products based on the physical characteristics of the products.
in its initial questionnaire response,tpbi reported its cop for the subject merchandise sold in the united states and thailand.in doing so,tpbi assigned each product a unique control number connum and reported a cop for each connum.tpbi reported the actual costs per job order for most of its incurred costs,and it allocated those actual costs on a basis by reference to the physical characteristics of individual connums.
for labor and overhead,however,tpbi system calculated a average cost taken over a period for all connums.tpbi labor and overhead records reflected only the total conversion costs therefore,tpbi financial accounting system did not record labor and overhead costs fixed and variable on an actual,level 
thus,tpbi did not follow its normal system for purposes of reporting labor and overhead costs,and instead used a method for cost allocation for labor and overhead costs based on machine times also referred to as machine hours derived from its accounting system.this method was created solely for the purpose of reporting to commerce.
subsequently,commerce issued supplemental questionnaires requesting,inter alia,additional information pertaining to the methodology tpbi employed in reporting its labor and overhead costs.commerce asked tpbi to report its standard costs recorded in tpbi normal books and records,adjusted to the actual costs,and explain why the reported costs for nine pairs of connums that were physically similar were so different.
in response,tpbi claimed that actual costs were driven by many variables,and not just physical characteristics.tpbi also explained disparities in the production quantities between the compared connum groupings,rather than physical characteristics,were largely responsible for the cost differences.tpbi listed some of the variables as production efficiencies and different costs structures at each factory,as well as the requirements of individual production runs and customer orders.tpbi proposed another allocation method based on production output,which was derived from tpbi accounting system,and again,was developed solely for the purpose of reporting to commerce.
in september,commerce published its preliminary results,where it determined that tpbi reported allocation methodology unreasonably distort ed the cost of manufacturing for the subject merchandise and the foreign like product.preliminary results.at.specifically,commerce found the reported methodologies were inconsistent with the methodology applied by tpbi in its books and records,and result ed in a large variability in costs that have nothing to do with physical differences in the merchandise.id.commerce instead tpbi labor and overhead costs on a per unit basis to prevent those significant costs differences between physically similar merchandise.id.commerce relied on an analysis similar to a difmer difference in physical characteristics or application,even though the terms of the difmer regulation apply to calculating price,not costs specifically,commerce recalculated tpbi costs by averaging them in order to prevent large discrepancies in costs between merchandise that was physically similar.thai plastic i,d at.commerce then factored in these adjusted costs in determining the cop and the cv for the normal value of the subject merchandise.after calculating costs,commerce also applied a difmer adjustment pursuant to the difmer regulation,explaining b ecause we assigned the same conversion costs to all models,any difmer adjustment we calculate is based solely on the differences in the costs of materials.
commerce published the final results on march,in which it continued to reject tpbi reported conversion costs,concluding that tpbi methodology did not reasonably reflect actual costs because it results in products with few or minor physical differences having significantly different costs of manufacturing assigned to them.see thai plastic i.at.as a result,commerce applied its alternate cost methodology,as facts otherwise available pursuant to u.a,and reallocated tpbi reported costs by them across all product lines to diminish the distortions in tpbi reported cost allocations.based on its analysis,commerce found tpbi normal value exceeded its export price to the united states,and it calculated the applicable antidumping duty margin.
tpbi challenged the final results before the cit,alleging commerce erroneously rejected its proposed methodologies on the sole basis that tpbi reported labor and overhead costs were not associated with the physical characteristics of the merchandise.it contended commerce should have used tpbi reported labor and overhead costs to calculate the cop and cv.tpbi also argued that commerce should have considered other quantitative and qualitative factors in determining the cost drivers,and that by failing to do so,commerce analysis in the final results was neither supported by substantial evidence nor in accordance with law.tpbi also made two arguments related to difmer first,that commerce misapplied the difmer standard in improperly conversion cost differences across all products and,second,by calculating the difmer adjustment to normal value based solely on cost differences in materials.
on june,the cit affirmed commerce calculation of normal value.thai plastic i,d at.it also found that tpbi did not offer any meaningful evidence to explain why physical differences in the connum pairs resulted in such large differences in conversion costs.as cost allocation based on physical characteristics is a primary factor in commerce analysis,commerce may adjust a company allocation method to more reasonably reflect costs.id.at.however,the cit remanded to commerce for reconsideration of multiple issues not relevant to this appeal.commerce then issued its remand results,which the cit affirmed on february.thai plastic bags indus.united states thai plastic ii,d.int l trade.
tpbi timely appealed the portions of the cit decision in thai plastic i sustaining commerce rejection of tpbi methodologies and commerce reallocation of tpbi conversion costs.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
standard of review 
congress did not specify a standard of review for this court in reviewing judgments of the cit.nippon steel united states.therefore,this court has adopted the substantial evidence standard prescribed for the cit at b b i,which requires upholding commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
although such review amounts to repeating the work of the cit,we have noted that this court will not ignore the informed opinion of the cit.diamond sawblades mfrs.coal.united states,quoting suramerica de aleaciones laminadas,united states,although reviewing anew the international trade commission determination,this court will not ignore the informed opinion of the cit.that court reviewed the record in considerable detail.its opinion deserves due respect.cleo united states,when performing a substantial evidence review,we give great weight to the informed opinion of the cit.indeed,it is nearly always the starting point of our analysis.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to the extent a cit decision is based on a question of law,such as statutory interpretation,this court review is de novo.de cecco di filippo fara martino united states.
in determining whether commerce correctly construed provisions of the antidumping statute,the court is guided by chevron,natural resources defense council.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the relevant question is whether commerce interpretation is based upon a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.in other words,commerce interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of language that is ambiguous.see united states eurodif,citation omitted.
ii.commerce was not required to accept tpbi reported costs 
on appeal,tpbi argues commerce improperly rejected its labor and overhead costs in calculating the cop and cv.tpbi insists its records were kept in accordance with the gaap of thailand.appellant br.these production costs,according to tpbi,were then allocated to each connum using machine time and production output as benchmarks.commerce rejected these reported costs as unreliable and unreflective of production costs.
the relevant statute provides that c osts shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,if such records are kept in accordance with the gaap of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.f a emphasis added.tpbi contends that under a chevron analysis,the statute is unambiguous and directs commerce to use tpbi own records,which tpbi maintains are consistent with the gaap of thailand.to tpbi,the plain language of the statute runs directly contrary to commerce position that cost differences among products must be supported by corresponding differences in physical characteristics.appellant br.appellees counter that commerce actions were consistent with the statute and substantial evidence supported commerce finding that tpbi alternative cost methodologies did not reasonably reflect tpbi costs in producing and selling the subject merchandise.the cit determined commerce finding that tpbi methodologies produced great variability in the costs of similar items having nothing to do with the physical aspects of the specific product was supported by the record.thai plastic i,d at.
section f a does not require commerce to accept tpbi records.it requires only that reported costs must normally be used if they are based on the records kept in accordance with the gaap and reasonably reflect the costs of producing and selling the merchandise.id.tpbi records met neither criterion.commerce reasonably interpreted its statutory obligation,and its underlying findings are supported by substantial evidence.
first,there is no evidence that tpbi labor and overhead records were kept in accordance with the gaap of thailand.tpbi provided cop allocations based on physical characteristics for direct material costs,but claims that for the fixed and variable labor and overhead costs there were no records reflecting the data commerce requested since tpbi did not keep such records.in its normal accounting system,tpbi calculates a single per kg average for all labor and overhead for all production,both subject and merchandise,regardless of physical characteristics or actual costs over a period.in providing the information commerce requested,tpbi departed from its normal accounting practice because it found the proffered records reflected neither the physical nor output differences for each product.tpbi fashioned new methodologies in response to commerce questionnaires and failed to demonstrate that the methodologies were in accordance with the gaap of thailand.indeed,tpbi submitted no evidence of what constitutes the thai gaap.therefore,the reported costs were not based on the records kept in accordance with the gaap,as the statute requires.see f a.
second,commerce properly found that tpbi labor and overhead costs did not reasonably reflect production costs.in determining whether production costs are higher than home market sales,commerce calculate s costs consistent with the model matching criteria it develops at the outset of an investigation or review.see antidumping duties countervailing duties notice of proposed rulemaking and request for public comments,dep t of commerce,preamble to proposed rules.congress has also stated that costs shall be allocated using a method that reasonably reflects and accurately captures all of the actual costs incurred in producing and selling the product under investigation or review.statement of administrative action accompanying the uruguay round agreements act,at statement of administrative action,reprinted in.
tpbi argues that because of f a language that costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise,commerce should have accepted its records based on the machine time and production output benchmarks.tpbi asserted to commerce that its reported costs based on the new methodologies were directly attributable to the physical differences of the products.
contrary to this assertion,commerce discovered that nine connum pairs were very similar in terms of physical characteristics but had substantial differences in costs.commerce accordingly asked tpbi to explain and demonstrate why the reported costs for these two models are so different.id.contradicting its own contention that the reported costs were directly attributable to physical differences,tpbi argued that several variables other than physical characteristics accounted for the cost differences between the connum pairs,including whether the connum was produced at a certain factory because one factory is more efficient than the other generated more or less waste required more or less colors,ink,or solvents was produced in smaller or larger quantities was produced or and required transparent or colored bags.tpbi also argued that much of the total production of the foreign like merchandise and the subject merchandise was produced at both of its factories,and thus there was no between the foreign and domestic markets.
commerce agreed there are many factors that may influence cost differences between products,but maintained its position that allocating costs based on physical characteristics is most certainly the primary factor in a cost analysis.therefore,commerce found the costs reported by tpbi could not be used because they did not reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.see f a.
for instance,in connum pair a,the only difference in physical characteristics between the two models was the slight difference in the percentage of color concentrate contained in each product.despite this small difference,the machine hours given for the two products were significantly different.commerce properly found it was unreasonable that the difference in color concentration would create such divergent results in machine hours.additionally,the fact that most of the connum pairs were made at the same facility,thai plastic i,d at,belied tpbi contention that the factory in which the connum was produced had an impact on the reported costs.
thus,commerce found tpbi methodologies artificially shifted the conversion costs of the connums sold in the home market and in the united states.a methodology that shifts costs unreasonably from sales to sales can heavily influence the department entire antidumping calculation.as a general rule,an agency may reject the records if accepting them would distort the company true costs.thai pineapple pub.united states.
similarly,tpbi argues that commerce,inexplicably,ignored th e record evidence that differing production quantities accounted for the discrepancies in price within the connum pairs.appellant br.commerce in fact acknowledged tpbi argument that its conversion costs varied because of,inter alia,whether a connum was produced in larger or smaller quantities,but properly determined that production quantities were not physical characteristics that would drive costs.
because tpbi departed from its normal accounting principles and failed to base its costs on physical characteristics,commerce relied on substantial evidence in determining the reported conversion costs were distortive and did not reasonably reflect the actual costs.commerce was therefore not required to rely upon those records.
iii.commerce reasonably reallocated the conversion costs 
after rejecting tpbi reported costs as distortive,commerce reallocated the costs by conversion costs evenly across all connums.the statement of administrative action provides that if commerce determines that costs reported by a respondent are shifted away from the production of the subject merchandise,or the foreign like product,commerce has the authority to adjust costs appropriately to ensure that the costs are not artificially reduced.statement of administrative action at see also.it was proper for commerce to exercise its authority to make adjustments to the distortive costs tpbi reported.the cit found that commerce properly adjusted the reported costs in order to ensure that they were not artificially reduced and distortive of true costs.thai plastic i,d at.
tpbi contends that e ven if this court finds some ambiguity in the statute,under step two of the chevron analysis,commerce application of a physical characteristics test to determine reasonable production costs is an impermissible statutory interpretation.appellant br.commerce supported its emphasis on physical differences in part by analogizing to the difmer analysis in b.see also a c ii.commerce typically uses the difmer principle in its analysis of what constitutes a reasonable allowance for differences in the physical characteristics between products sold in the united states and those sold in foreign markets.see.that regulation states,in part 
in comparing united states sales with foreign market sales,the secretary may determine that the merchandise sold in the united states does not have the same physical characteristics as the merchandise sold in the foreign market,and that the difference has an effect on prices.in calculating normal value,the secretary will make a reasonable allowance for such differences.
id.a.tpbi argues commerce use of difmer to differentiate products within the home market is inconsistent with this regulatory authority.
tpbi misconstrues commerce actions.though commerce focused on physical characteristics,it did not apply difmer as it appears in.as the cit explained,commerce also has a practice of comparing cost allocations using physical characteristics of the product in its determination of whether a company cost allocation strategy reasonably reflects actual costs.thai plastic i,d at.commerce applied this latter practice in reallocating the conversion costs.
tpbi argues commerce reliance on physical characteristics is also inconsistent with subsection b of the difmer regulation,which states that commerce,in determining the difmer adjustment,will consider only differences in variable costs associated with the physical differences.b.to tpbi,the regulation statement that commerce will not consider differences in cop when compared merchandise has identical physical characteristics,id.b,anticipates the existence of cop differences unrelated to physical differences and prohibits considering or adjusting for them.this,tpbi contends,contradicts commerce position that it may adjust for cost differences that it finds are unrelated to physical characteristics.appellant br.
commerce recognized the intended context of the difmer regulation,and acknowledged it is an adjustment to price and not costs such that the provision does not apply directly,as a matter of law,to our analysis of costs.commerce nonetheless explained that the necessity of using physical characteristics in making comparisons is key to both a difmer analysis under b as well as the analysis.in the final results,commerce stated that its focus on physical characteristics for costs was supported by a c ii,and that s uch comparison criteria are logical because physical characteristics provide commerce with a dependable,measurable means of comparing two different products sold in two different markets.
by requiring that conversion costs reflect cost differences attributable to different physical characteristics,commerce ensure d that the costs reflect ed the costs incurred by tpbi to obtain the corresponding product physical characteristics.as explained above,physical differences in products generally account for major differences in costs.see preamble to proposed rules.at discussing proposed.reliance on physical characteristics,because of its ability to promote consistency,is a predictable methodology that is administrable across all investigations and administrative reviews.
here,as the cit explained,consideration of physical characteristics is a primary factor in commerce analysis.thai plastic i,d at.when other factors influence cost allocation,it is customary for commerce to adjust a company reported
