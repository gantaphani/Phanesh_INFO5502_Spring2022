through an agent,mark and becky levin purchased several antiques from dalva brothers,dalva,an antiques dealer located in new york city.later the levins obtained information suggesting that the antiques were not as dalva described them and were worth less than the approximately that they paid.the levins subsequently brought a diversity action in the district of massachusetts against dalva alleging fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of express warranties,unjust enrichment,and a violation of.laws ch.after a trial,a jury found for dalva on the misrepresentation and warranty claims,and the court found for dalva on the chapter and unjust enrichment claims.the levins appeal,challenging the district court choice of law,the jury instructions and certain rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony.
the levins relocated from california to massachusetts in.they purchased a home on boylston street in boston in and bought a historic mansion in middleton,rhode island in.the levins retained roger harned,an interior designer based in california,to decorate these homes.levin directed harned to travel around the united states and europe to locate outrageous antiques for purchase.
in and,harned visited the dalva gallery in new york city.on both occasions,harned stated that he was a decorator but did not tell dalva that he represented the levins.harned identified the antiques that he was interested in purchasing and received written and oral descriptions of the items.he then asked dalva to send the tear sheets descriptions and pictures for the antiques to his office in california.
in,dalva sent harned tear sheets for two vases,and in,it sent harned tear sheets for a grandfather clock and two commodes.both times,after receiving these documents,harned traveled to massachusetts to discuss the items with the levins.at harned urging,the levins authorized him to purchase all of the items.the levins wired the funds for the purchase price to harned bank account in california,and harned paid dalva with checks drawn from the account.at no time prior to the consummation of these transactions did dalva know that harned was buying the items on behalf of massachusetts residents.after the purchases,harned arranged to have the items shipped to massachusetts for storage.eventually,the vases were displayed at the levins boston condominium,and the clock and commodes were displayed at their rhode island mansion.
the levins claims against dalva stem from their allegation that the tear sheets and invoices misrepresented the antiques.the vase tear sheets described them as fine and rare probably petersburg,early century,and the invoices more definitively described them as russian,century.the levins claim that these vases were in fact french in origin,and less valuable than represented.
the tear sheet for the clock described it as an exceptionally rare regence grandfather clock with superb vernis martin decoration depicting peace and justice above a panel showing cupid and psyche french,century.the levins claim that the clock was in fact an amalgam of parts and pieces from the late and centuries and originated in italy.the levins expert testified that they overpaid for the clock by more than.
the tear sheets for the commodes described one of them as a fine transitional marquetry commode french century,and the other as a transitional louis marquetry commode with pictoral marquetry depicting ruins french century.the levins claim that,in fact,these were and century pieces of furniture that were worth a fraction of what they paid.
choice of law 
the first issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in applying new york law and not massachusetts law.the levins challenge this ruling on two grounds the court abused its discretion by considering dalva argument for new york law because dalva did not raise the argument until the first day of trial,and the court erred by deciding that new york law governs.we begin with the waiver issue.
the levins are asking us to order a new trial on the ground that the district court permitted dalva to raise an argument too late in the proceeding.such orders are rare.loinaz eg g,cir.decisions regarding the management of the trial calendar and the courtroom proceedings are particularly within the province of the trial judge,and her determination s will not be disturbed absent a finding that she abused her discretion.id.reversal because of a district court case management ruling also requires the appealing party to demonstrate prejudice.see id.at if we believe that the trial judge discretionary decisions have resulted in undue prejudice to the appellant case,we will reverse.
the parties each cite cases where a court either permitted or forbade a party from raising a argument late in the proceedings,bergin dartmouth,d,deeming argument waived pi,ogle,same torah soft drosnin,d,permitting choice of law argument to be raised late in litigation.the cases cited do not establish a definitive point by which a litigant must raise a argument rather,each was decided based on the case own facts and equities.these dueling citations serve only to illustrate the essential point case supervision is the primary responsibility of the trial court.
here,dalva raised the choice of law argument on the first day of trial.but prior to that point in the litigation the issue of choice of law had never been squarely presented by either party,and the court had not issued any ruling on the issue moreover,there is nothing in the record suggesting that dalva intentionally waited to raise the issue to gain an unfair advantage.in these circumstances,we think that the district court was within its discretion in permitting dalva to raise the argument when it did.see signal mci telecomm,cir affirming ruling that a party did not waive choice of law argument offered late in the litigation where there was no evidence of an intentional delay and there was no earlier ruling on choice of law.
even if we questioned the court ruling which we do not,the levins have failed to demonstrate prejudice.they contend that dalva late argument harmed them because it required them to wrestle with new jury instructions and related issues under new york law.in complex civil litigation,legal issues frequently arise as the court prepares jury instructions and makes other rulings.the court notified the parties on the first day of a trial during which it was holding only sessions that it wanted briefing on choice of law.to expect counsel to meet this requirement does not appear unreasonable and,if the levins needed more time,they should have asked for it.jom,adell plastics,cir per curiam a party claiming prejudice resulting from its belated receipt of evidence is poorly positioned on appeal if it elected to forego a request for a continuance below.
the levins also seek to establish prejudice by identifying several ways in which they believe that applying new york law was unfavorable to them.but these arguments do not establish prejudice flowing from the consideration of the issue,they suggest only that the district court decision to apply new york law,if incorrect,was not harmless error.see hosp.supply,boston scientific,cir.
we turn next to whether the district court erred by deciding that new york law governed the levin claims.we review determinations de novo.see reicher berkshire life ins.of,cir.a federal court sitting in diversity applies state substantive law.see erie tompkins.to determine the applicable substantive law,the federal court applies the principles of the forum state,here,massachusetts.klaxon stentor.
an initial task of a analysis is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the substantive law of the interested jurisdictions.see millipore travelers indem,cir.the parties agree that such a conflict exists concerning the fraud claims.compare crigger fahnestock,cir stating that,under new york law,fraud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence,with compagnie de reassurance de france new england reinsurance,cir stating that the preponderance of the evidence standard applies to fraud claims under massachusetts law.moreover,as discussed infra,under new york law,the express warranty claims are governed by a statute that has no parallel in massachusetts law.
the next question is whether the district court correctly applied massachusetts principles to determine that new york law applies.see reicher,at.massachusetts applies a functional approach to choice of law.bushkin,raytheon.recent authority indicates that this functional approach is explicitly guided by the restatement second of conflict of laws.clarendon nat.ins.arbella mut.ins.
the parties agreed before the district court that only one state law should govern the resolution of all of the levins claims and have accordingly focused their analysis on the misrepresentation claims.the analysis for intentional and negligent misrepresentation claims is set forth in of the restatement.see uncle henry,plaut consulting,cir negligent misrepresentation computer.engineering qantel,cir intentional misrepresentation.section focuses on where the representations were made and received,and where the plaintiff relied on the representations.in situations where the representations and reliance took place in different states,the court examines the place or places where the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the defendant representations,the place where the plaintiff received the representations,the place where the defendant made the representations,the domiciles and places of business of the parties,the place where a tangible thing which is the subject of the transaction between the parties was situated at the time of the transaction,and the place where the plaintiff agreed to render performance under a contract induced by an alleged misrepresentation.see restatement,supra at.
here,the relevant contacts are as follows.harned,the levins agent,contacted dalva in new york to agree to buy the antiques.harned sent payment of the purchase price to dalva in new york from a california bank.dalva made the representations to harned in new york when harned visited the gallery and it mailed the tear sheets to harned california office.the levins,through harned,received these representations first in new york and then in california.the levins are residents of massachusetts and dalva is a new york business.the antiques were located in new york at the time of the transaction,and the levins rendered performance from california,when harned sent payment to dalva.while the contacts are somewhat closely distributed between new york and california,the levins sought the application of massachusetts law.there is little question that the transaction primarily occurred outside of massachusetts.
the levins dispute this line of analysis by contending that they received and relied on the representations in massachusetts when they received the tear sheets and issued their purchase instructions.but harned was acting on behalf of the levins in his dealings with dalva,and the levins were undisclosed principals.see old republic ins.hansa world cargo,d,an undisclosed principal is a principal whose existence and identity is not revealed to a third party that is transacting business with the undisclosed principal agent.for purposes,the relevant contacts are between harned and dalva harned communications with the levins,of which dalva had no knowledge,would seem to be of comparatively little relevance.see schwegmann giant super markets golden eagle ins,explaining that,in a analysis under the restatement,contacts between an agent and an undisclosed principal done unilaterally,without the defendant knowledge are of little import.
focusing on harned contacts with dalva comports with one of the guiding principles of the restatement the governing law should reflect the parties justified expectations.see restatement,supra at.although industry norms might suggest the possibility of undisclosed principals,dalva had no reason to know that the transaction with harned had a massachusetts connection.it would thus be unfair to impose massachusetts rather than new york law on the transaction.moreover,by deciding to conceal their identities,the levins forfeited any reasonable basis for thinking that massachusetts law would govern purchases made by harned outside of their home state.
in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion by considering the question,and its ultimate ruling was correct.
express warranty instruction 
the levins challenge the express warranty instruction as it pertains to the clock.they argue that the district court erred by instructing the jury under a new york statute that governs express warranty claims for fine art.see cult.arts law,mckinley the fine art statute.
the fine art statute provides that whenever an art merchant sells a work of fine art to someone who is not an art merchant and provides a document certifying the period or author of the piece,the merchant representation is an express warranty.id.b.the statute further provides that a warranty should be interpreted in light of the custom and usage of the trade.id.in at least one case,a gloss has been placed on the statute,requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate that the merchant warranty was made without a reasonable basis in fact at the time that it was offered.dawson malina,
the instruction offered in this case recited the requirements of the fine art statute with the dawson gloss the levins contend that this instruction was erroneous because the grandfather clock is not a piece of fine art within the meaning of the statute on appeal,the parties treat this issue as a question of law subject to de novo review.we follow their approach 
fine art is defined under the statute to mean a painting,sculpture,drawing,or work of graphic art,and print.cultural arts law.the levins make the straightforward claim that this case concerns a clock and a clock is not fine art.
this argument appeals in its simplicity,but identifying fine art may not be so easy.see generally christine haight farley,judging art,tul.discussing judicial reluctance to determine what constitutes art.as one trial expert testified,t here is sort of a murky distinction between decorative and fine arts.
the clock a picture of which is included as an addendum to this opinion has multiple painted panels showing mythological scenes all of which pertain to the relationship between peace and justice.the tear sheet focused on the painted panels as major features of the clock,and one of dalva principals testified that it viewed the painting as the most significant attribute of the clock.there also was expert testimony that a purchaser of the clock would view it as a piece of fine art because the painting is so extraordinary and it is so unusual.indeed,the levins own expert admitted that the decoration was,in fact,the most important thing with this clock.this testimony supports the district court ruling that the clock was fine art.
applying the fine art statute to the clock accords with dawson,the only reported case considering the scope of the statute fine art definition.see.at.there,the court held that a decorated bowl and several vases were fine art.like the clock,the items at issue in dawson were not traditional canvass paintings or sculpted figures.although they were items that had functional uses,the court concluded that their artistic decoration elevated them to works of fine art.id.so too here.of course,ruling that this clock is fine art does not mean that all clocks so qualify indeed,most probably do not.but in light of the expert testimony,the description provided in the tear sheet,and the photograph of the clock,we conclude that the district court was correct to instruct under the fine art statute.
the levins offer a second objection to the express warranty instruction,applicable to the warranty claims for all of the items.they contend that the court erroneously instructed that the claims should fail if the jury concluded that dalva merely offered an opinion by attributing the antiques to a specific period we review this claim de novo.see hannaford,cir.
the fine art statute was a specific legislative enactment designed to regulate express warranty claims brought by lay people after purchasing fine art from art merchants.as such,it supplants the otherwise applicable provisions of t
