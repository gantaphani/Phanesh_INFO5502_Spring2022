this case involves the time period within which a district court must render judgment following an appeal to that court from an administrative order canceling,suspending,or refusing a liquor license.texas alcoholic beverage code section provides that an appeal of a liquor license denial must be tried to the district court within ten days after it is filed.alco.b.here,the district court conducted a hearing within the required ten days,but did not sign a judgment until nineteen days after the appeal was filed.the court of appeals dismissed the appeal,holding that the district court late decision divested that court,and any subsequent court,of jurisdiction to decide the case.
we hold that section requires that judgment be rendered no later than ten days from the date the appeal to the district court is filed.but,regardless of how rendition occurs,section does not prevent a district court from performing the ministerial act of memorializing a timely rendition in a signed judgment after the period has passed.any judgment signed after that period that differs from a timely rendition of judgment is void.when,as here,a district court does not render judgment within ten days,judgment is rendered by operation of law against the party seeking the issuance,renewal,or reinstatement of a license.at that point,the district court has a ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision.proceedings in the district court remain interlocutory until the district court signs that judgment.in this case,the district court has never signed a judgment affirming the administrative decision.because the matter remains interlocutory,we affirm the court of appeals judgment dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
background 
jose luis garza applied to the texas alcoholic beverage commission tabc to renew a beer and wine retailer license for the tropicana night club in rosenberg,texas.the tabc denied garza application and ordered him to submit an application to the constitutional county court.see.alco.on october,the county judge,sitting in an administrative capacity,signed a judgment denying renewal of the permit.garza motion for rehearing was overruled by operation of law.see.gov t code c.
on january,garza appealed the county judge order to the district court,which conducted a hearing on january.see.alco.a,a.in a written judgment,the district court held that the county judge committed reversible error by limiting garza to five trial witnesses.the district court vacated the administrative judgment and remanded the case to the county judge for further proceedings.the district court judgment recited that the court rendered its decision on january.however,the court actually signed the judgment on january.on remand,the county judge conducted a second hearing,at which the judge again denied garza renewal application.garza appealed the county judge second decision to the district court.that district court denied the license renewal on january,and garza appealed to the court of appeals.
with one judge dissenting,the court of appeals held that the district court lacked jurisdiction at the time it remanded the case to the county judge because it did not render judgment within ten days following garza january,appeal to that court.the court of appeals vacated the subsequent judgments of the county judge and the district court and dismissed the appeal,effectively leaving in place the county judge october,administrative order denying the renewal application.disagreeing with that result,the dissent concluded that the legislature did not intend to preclude appeal by a party who has done everything required under the texas alcohol beverage code,just because the trial court failed to meet its responsibilities.id.at larsen,dissenting.
garza filed a petition for review contending that the court of appeals erred in interpreting alcoholic beverage code section to require both a hearing and rendition of judgment within ten days of the date the appeal is filed the record contains a entry reflecting that the district court did,in fact,render judgment within the period and the court of appeals interpretation of section violates garza right of due process under the united states and texas constitutions and contravenes the and provisions of the texas constitution.we granted garza petition to decide these issues.
ii.the trial on appeal 
the texas alcoholic beverage code gives an applicant whose alcohol permit is suspended or denied the right to appeal that administrative decision to a district court.alco.the relevant portion of the statute reads as follows 
the appeal shall be under the substantial evidence rule and against the commission alone as defendant.the rules applicable to ordinary civil suits apply,with the following exceptions,which shall be construed literally 
the appeal shall be perfected and filed within days after the date the order,decision,or ruling of the commission or administrator becomes final and appealable 
the case shall be tried before a judge within days from the date it is filed 
neither party is entitled to a jury and 
the order,decision,or ruling of the commission or administrator may be suspended or modified by the court pending a trial on the merits,but the final judgment of the district court may not be modified or suspended pending appeal.
generally,on appeal from an administrative denial of a liquor license,the district court conducts an abbreviated hearing and renders a decision within ten days after the appeal is filed.see id.a,b.at the district court discretion,the decision to withhold the license may be suspended pending the abbreviated hearing.id.b.however,a final judgment,once rendered,takes immediate effect and can not be suspended pending an appeal to the court of appeals.id.the statute makes no provision for a disposition in the event the district court does not render judgment within ten days.we address that issue today.we have held that section b requires all proceedings in the district court to be completed within ten days of the date the appeal is filed.cook walker,cook spears.in spears,we discussed the legislative history of article,section of the texas liquor control act,which is the predecessor to texas alcoholic beverage code section b.at.we observed that the earliest version of the act required only that an appeal be tried within ten days or at the earliest possible time thereafter in the event the judge is not able to try such cause within such ten day period.id.at emphasis omitted citing texas liquor control act,ch,art.i.laws.
the legislature subsequently amended that provision by striking the language permitting a judge to extend the trial beyond the period.see act of may,ch,art.i.laws.in,the legislature added article to the liquor control act and declared that the terms of the statute,including the rule,shall be considered literally.act of may,ch.laws.based on the legislature systematic efforts to constrict the timetable within which judgment must be rendered,we concluded in spears that the appeal period in the district court could not exceed the statutory limit.at.thus,we held that the permittee in spears,who sought a continuance and further discovery well beyond the period for court action,lost his right to a district court appeal when the period elapsed without a district court judgment.id.
we reached a similar conclusion in cook walker.there,although the license applicant filed an appeal to the district court on march,the judge did not set the matter for trial until may.walker,at.because more than ten days expired between the filing date and the trial date,we concluded that the applicant right to a district court appeal expired at the end of the tenth day.id.
garza contends that spears and walker are distinguishable because,in this case,the district court actually heard the matter eight days after garza filed his appeal.this distinction is significant if,as garza asserts,the trial in section b refers only to a hearing on the merits and does not necessitate rendition of judgment.in support of his argument,garza cites fox medina,christi,no writ.in fox,the district court conducted its hearing and rendered an oral judgment in open court within ten days of the date the appeal was filed,but did not sign the judgment until after the expiration of the statutory period.id.at.rather than require the appellant to obtain a written judgment within ten days,the court of appeals reasoned that the better course is to have trial judges hear or try the case within days and render judgment in that period,but not to strip appellants of their appeal and render for appellees automatically if the judge does not sign the written judgment within days.id.at.
we agree with fox that trial,as used in section,refers to a hearing on the merits and rendition of judgment.and regardless of how rendition occurs,section does not prevent a district court from performing the ministerial act of memorializing a timely rendition in a signed judgment after the period has passed.however,garza asks this court to hold that the district court may defer rendering judgment until some point in time after the period has expired.we decline to do so.garza suggested interpretation of the term trial under section b would leave the district court free of the statute time limitations and able to delay rendition indefinitely.we can not reconcile this result with the legislature express decision to confine the trial of a licensing appeal to a rigid time limit.see spears,at.considering the statute as a whole,it is evident that section b was designed to secure a speedy disposition of administrative appeals.if we were to adopt garza a district court may delay rendition business could continue operating more than ten days after the appeal is filed even when as here a county court has concluded that the business imperils the general welfare,health,peace,morals,and safety of the people.see.alco.a.the statute itself forecloses garza argument.section b provides that the order,decision,or ruling of the commission or administrator may be suspended or modified by the court pending a trial on the merits,but the final judgment of the district court may not be modified or suspended pending appeal.the legislature made certain that a business found to endanger public safety would cease operations during the pendency of further appeals.garza interpretation would contravene the statute by removing this safeguard.
we conclude section b requires that judgment be rendered no later than ten days after the licensee perfects its appeal to the district court.because the statute creates an absolute deadline for rendition of judgment,district courts have no power to render judgment or entertain motions after expiration of the period.see spears,at mcbeth riverside inn,dist,writ ref.we disapprove of cases holding that a district court has plenary power to grant a new trial or vacate,modify,or reform a judgment after expiration of the period.see texas alco.beverage comm top of the strip,antonio,pet.denied texas alco.beverage comm n,dist,no writ.
our analysis is consistent with our holdings in other contexts.see lawyers lloyds of texas webb,stating that trial ordinarily includes every step in the determination of the issues between parties including hearings on post judgment motions for new trial,but defining actual trial in the writ of error statute as the hearing in open court,leading up to the rendition of judgment see also mcbeth,at applying the lawyers lloyds definition of trial to a section b appeal.accordingly,a district court judgment in a section appeal must be rendered within ten days of the date the appeal is filed.although the district court signed a judgment remanding the case to the county court on january,that attempted rendition occurred outside the strict period conferred by the statute therefore,the january,judgment and all subsequent proceedings in the district court are void.
iii.the docket sheet entry 
garza argues alternatively that the district court did,in fact,render judgment within the period,as evidenced by the court january,recitation that judgment was rendered on january,the tabc disputes the order recitation,arguing that the record establishes that the district court did not render judgment within the period.we agree with the tabc.
generally,a judgment is rendered when the decision is officially announced orally in open court,by memorandum filed with the clerk,or otherwise announced publicly.comet aluminum dibrell,knox long,overruled in part on other grounds by,jackson hernandez,coleman zapp.despite the order pronouncement that the court took this matter under advisement and rendered its decision on january,nothing in the record shows that the district court rendered judgment orally in open court,or otherwise publicly announced its decision,before the deadline expired.thus,we must determine whether the record reflects a memorandum of decision filed on or before january.
in an effort to resolve this question,the court of appeals ordered the fort bend county district clerk to file a supplemental clerk record containing any memorandum of decision or other document memorializing the rendition of judgment filed by the district court in connection with this case.in response,the district clerk prepared a supplemental record that contained an affidavit by the deputy clerk and a docket sheet containing two entries pertaining to january,and january.both entries are preceded by a reference date and followed by the judge initials.the january entry indicates that the appellant and the appellee appeared for trial and that the court took the matter under advisement.the january entry states it is the determination judgment of this court that the hearing court limitation to witnesses deprived tropicana of due process therefore sets aside the judgment and remands for further hearing.garza contends that because the docket sheet contains the district court initialed,entry reciting the substance of the court final order before the deadline expired,the court timely rendered judgment.we disagree.
ordinarily,when there is a question concerning the date judgment was rendered,the date the judgment was signed prevails over a conflicting docket sheet entry.see snell,knox,at grant american ins,dist,no writ.in this case,the judgment was signed january.because the signed judgment takes precedence over the docket sheet entry,we do not consider the docket sheet to be a timely rendition.moreover,there is no indication that the court issued a memorandum of decision on january,or otherwise publicly announced rendition on that date.we conclude that neither the recital in the court written judgment regarding an earlier rendition nor the january,docket sheet entry is sufficient to effectuate rendition of judgment on a date earlier than january,the date the court actually signed the judgment.we hold that the district court did not render judgment within the period section mandates.
iv.the constitutional challenges 
concluding that the expiration of the period terminated the district court jurisdiction,the court of appeals stated that a ll proceedings conducted after the expiration of the period are void.at.garza argues that if he is prejudiced by the district court failure to hear and decide the appeal within ten days under section,the statute violates his constitutional rights of due process and due course of law under texas constitution article i,section and the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.he also contends that the court of appeals interpretation of the statute violates the and provisions of texas constitution article i,section and article ii,section.garza argues that he met all statutory requisites for appeal to the district court and should not be penalized for the court failure to render judgment on a timely basis.the predicament garza describes could arguably raise constitutional concerns if the district court failure to render judgment within the period precluded an opportunity for further appeal on the merits.the united states supreme court has held that although the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment does not require a state to provide appellate review,w hen an appeal is afforded it can not be granted to some litigants and capriciously or arbitrarily denied to others without violating the equal protection clause.lindsey normet,d.
here,the district court was engaged in an jury trial when garza filed his appeal.at the january,hearing,the court announced it was not going to be bound by any rule garza asserts that he had no way to control the timing of the district court rendition.although recognizing the potential for mandamus relief,garza argues that a mandamus proceeding would be denied as premature if filed while the district court still has an opportunity to render a timely decision.after expiration of the period,a district court judgment,even one compelled by writ of mandamus,would be void.see cook spears.
as we interpret the statute,however,section does not preclude an appeal to the court of appeals after the time for the expedited appeal to the district court has passed.the statute states that t he rules applicable to ordinary civil suits apply with limited exceptions detailed in the statute,which shall be construed literally.alco.b.section b designates the time period for the trial in the district court.literally construed,this provision is a limitation on the district court power to render a judgment beyond ten days.but it would go beyond the literal terms of the statute to read section b as divesting a license applicant of its statutory right to appeal when the court fails or refuses to act.
the statute does not clearly instruct how to perfect that appeal when the district court has not rendered a timely judgment.see.alco.b.we assume that the legislature did not intend to deprive a party of appellate remedies on the sole ground that the district court was unable or unwilling to perform its statutory duty.see brady fourteenth court of appeals,statutes are given a construction consistent with constitutional requirements,when possible,because the legislature is presumed to have intended compliance with state and federal constitutions.that interpretation would frustrate an express purpose of section,which contemplates that a license applicant has the right to appeal an adverse decision to the court of appeals.see.alco.b,see also.gov t code stating that in administrative cases a party may appeal a final district court judgment in the manner provided for civil actions generally.
accordingly,we hold that if the district court fails to render judgment within the allotted time,judgment is rendered by operation of law once the appeal period expires.at that point,the district court has a ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision,which can then form the basis of an appeal.dunn dunn,court has ministerial duty to sign judgment after oral rendition.requiring a signed judgment before an appeal to the court of appeals can be perfected.alco.b instructing that t he rules applicable to ordinary civil suits apply.the appellate timetable runs from the date the district court signs the judgment,rather than from the date the judgment is rendered by operation of law.see farmer ben keith,the appellate timetable does not commence to run other than by signed,written order,even when the signing of such an order is purely ministerial.
our resolution of the appeal today is different from our decision in cook spears,but in conformity with our decision in cook walker.in spears,the hearing on the appeal to the district court was first set days after the appeal was filed.at.there the commissioner sought to set aside certain trial court orders issued after the period expired,on the ground that the district court lost jurisdiction when it failed to render judgment within ten days after the appeal was filed.id.at.we declined to issue the writ of mandamus,stating that once the period expired,the commission order became final and enforceable,and the proceedings conducted beyond ten days were void because the right to a trial on appeal was lost.id.at.under that reasoning,any district court action taken after expiration of the ten days,including the court fulfillment of a ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the commission order,would be void.
we did not address in spears the issue presented a district court failure to render judgment extinguishes a party appellate rights.because section makes an appeal to the district court an essential step between the administrative order and review by the court of appeals,strict adherence to the disposition in spears would foreclose an appeal to the court of appeals when the district court fails to act timely.this court decision in walker,which was decided the same year as spears,takes the better approach.
in walker we cited spears for the proposition that the applicant lost his right to trial on appeal,but we ordered the district court to proceed to judgment approving the order of the commission.walker,at.implicit in that holding is an assumption that the underlying administrative judgment was affirmed when the district court did not render judgment within ten days.nothing in walker suggests that the license applicant lost his right to perfect an appeal in the court of appeals.indeed,our disposition resulted in a final judgment in the district court,appealable to the court of appeals.similarly,our decision today preserves the right to appeal the district court judgment affirming the license denial once the district court signs the judgment rendered by operation of law.we believe this disposition best reconciles the clear legislative directive to limit the time to decide an appeal in the district court with the legislature insistence that a license applicant be afforded the right to challenge an adverse judgment in the court of appeals.we overrule cook spears only to the extent it may be read to preclude the district court from performing its ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative license denial when the district court has not rendered judgment within the deadline contained in section.although the county judge decision was affirmed by operation of law at the end of the period,the district court has never signed a judgment in conformity with that rendition.in the absence of a valid,signed judgment,the matter remains interlocutory in the district court.the court of appeals appropriately dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.the district court failure to render a timely judgment does not foreclose further appeal therefore,the statute preserves garza right to appellate review.
conclusion 
we hold that judgment in a section trial on appeal to the district court must be rendered within ten days of the time the appeal is filed.we further conclude that the statutory requirement of section does not conflict with garza constitutional rights under the united states and texas constitutions,because the district court failure to render judgment within the statutory period does not foreclose an appeal to the court of appeals.because the district court did not render a timely judgment within the statutory period,judgment was rendered by operation of law affirming the administrative decision.the district court retains jurisdiction to perform the ministerial duty of signing a judgment in conformity with that rendition.the appellate timetable to perfect an appeal,if any,to the court of appeals commences once that judgment is signed.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
i agree with the court conclusion that section of the texas alcoholic beverage code limits the district court power to try the administrative appeal and render a judgment within ten days from the date the aggrieved party files the appeal to the district court.moreover,i agree that the district court docket sheet entry did not amount to a rendition of judgment within the statutory period.
however,i can not agree with the court decision about how to resolve the fundamental issue in this case how does an applicant under section exercise its statutory right to appeal the administrative decision to the court of appeals if the district court fails to try the appeal and render and sign a written judgment within ten days in answering this question,the court acknowledges that any rendition or other ruling by the district court that occurs outside the strict period is void.at.but then the court holds that,after the period expires,the district court has a ministerial duty to sign a judgment affirming the administrative decision,which can then form the basis of the appeal.at.
i believe the court resolution wholly ignores our law that the district court lacks jurisdiction to make any rulings after the period expires places an unnecessary burden on the applicant if the trial court fails to render and sign a written judgment within the time period and thwarts the obvious legislative intent that the district court have power over the appeal only within the constricted timetable.i would hold that,if a district court does not render and sign a written judgment from which the applicant may further appeal within the period,the administrative decision is not only deemed final and enforceable but also becomes the final judgment by operation of law so that the applicant can timely perfect an appeal to the court of appeals.accordingly,i dissent.
applicable law 
section of the texas alcoholic beverage code affords an applicant whose alcohol permit is refused,canceled,or suspended the right to appeal to a district court and then the court of appeals.the relevant part reads 
a an appeal from an order of the commission or administrator refusing,cancelling,or suspending a permit or license may be taken to the district court of the county in which the applicant,licensee,or permittee resides or in which the owner of involved real or personal property resides.
b the appeal shall be under the substantial evidence rule and against the commission alone as defendant.the rules applicable to ordinary civil suits apply,with the following exceptions,which shall be construed literally 
the appeal shall be perfected and filed within days after the date the order,decision,or ruling of the commission or administrator becomes final and appealable 
the case shall be tried before a judge within days from the date it is filed 
neither party is entitled to a jury and 
the order,decision,or ruling of the commission or administrator may be suspended or modified by the court pending a trial on the merits,but the final judgment of the district court may not be modified or suspended pending appeal.
under the statutory scheme,the district court hearing the appeal must conduct its hearing within ten days after the appeal is filed.see.alco.b.the district court has discretion to suspend the administrative ruling effect pending the hearing.alco.b.however,the district court final judgment takes immediate effect and may not be suspended pending an appeal to the court of appeals.alco.b.
in construing earlier versions of section,this court has held that the statute requires that the district court complete all its proceedings within ten days from the date the appeal is filed.cook walker,cook spears.moreover,we have held that any district court proceedings or rulings occurring after the period are functus officio and thus are void and have no effect.spears,at.and,we have also held that,if the district court fails to hear and render judgment within the ten days,the administrative decision become final and enforceable.spears,at.
ii.analysis 
a.what the statutory period requires 
in both spears and walker,this court recognized that an applicant loses his right to an appeal in the district court if the district court does not try the appeal and render judgment within the statutory period.spears,at see also walker,at.in these original proceedings,the court only considered whether mandamus should issue to preclude the district court from taking any further action after the period expired.
in spears,the alcoholic beverage commission ordered a suspension of an alcohol license.spears,at.the licensee appealed to the district court under section b predecessor,article,section.though the statute required a trial within ten days,the district court did not set the case for trial until one month later.at that time,the licensee moved for a continuance,and the parties agreed to try the case another month later.on the trial date,the licensee urged two motions,one for a continuance and the other to compel the commission to disclose certain information.the district court granted both motions but stayed the disclosure order pending the commission seeking mandamus relief from these rulings.spears,at.
on mandamus review,the commission argued that the district court lost jurisdiction to enter any orders,because the period for a trial on appeal had passed.spears,at.in discussing the legislative history of article,this court noted that the statute earliest version required only that an appeal be tried within ten days or at the earliest possible time thereafter in the event the judge is not able to try such cause within such ten day period.spears,at citations and emphasis omitted.but,in,the legislature amended the provision and struck the language permitting a judge to extend the trial beyond that period.spears,at see act of may,ch,art.i.laws.and,when the legislature added article to the liquor control act in,it declared that the statutory terms,including the trial rule,shall be considered literally.spears,at see act of may,ch.laws.
because of the legislature repeated attempts to limit the time in which the district court could try the appeal,we concluded that the time for an appeal endured for ten days and that there was no authority to extend that time.spears,at.applying this conclusion to the facts,we determined that the licensee right to an appeal in the district court expired ten days after the appeal was filed.spears,at.moreover,we determined that any orders issued after the period,such as the district court continuance and discovery rulings,were void.spears,at.we then determined that the commission suspension order became the final and enforceable decision.spears,at.based on these conclusions,we held that mandamus relief would be immaterial and thus denied the petition.spears,at.
in cook walker,the court reached the same legal conclusion but ordered a different result.see walker,at.in walker,the licensee appealed an administrative order canceling his licenses.the district court stayed the suspension order pending the trial and set that trial for over a month later.walker,at.the court held that spears governed,and therefore,the licensee lost his right to an appeal in the district court ten days after he filed the appeal.however,rather than denying mandamus relief as in spears,the walker court issued mandamus relief and ordered the district court to set aside its order staying the commission decision and to proceed to judgment approving the commission order.walker,at.
here,garza contends that spears and walker do not apply because the district court actually heard the appeal within the period,and therefore,the district court judgment has full force and effect.to support his position that the district court judgment rendered after the period is not void,garza relies on fox medina,christi,no writ.in fox,the district court tried the applicant appeal and orally rendered judgment in open court within the period.however,the district court did not sign a judgment until the statutory period expired.fox,at.the court of appeals did not require the appellant to obtain a signed judgment within the ten days and,instead,held that the district court need only hear the appeal and make a decision within the ten days.fox,at.if this occurs,the court of appeals further held,the district court can sign a judgment reflecting that decision after the statutory time period expires.fox,at.the court of appeals explained that this approach precludes parties from automatically losing the district court appeal based on a deemed affirmance of the administrative decision and from losing their further appellate rights.fox,at.
i disagree with garza contention,and fox conclusion,that section allows a district court to sign a written judgment after the ten days pass to memorialize a decision that court made within the period.accepting this position would enable the district court to disregard the statute time limitations and indefinitely delay the case finality for further appeal purpose
