in this appeal plaintiff david feldman seeks review of a summary judgment entered in favor of illinois union insurance company,which had declined to defend or indemnify feldman or his company,zf micro solutions,against a by a third party.feldman contends that the superior court erroneously found no potential for coverage under the liability policy issued to him and zf micro solutions and therefore no duty to defend or indemnify the insureds.we agree with the superior court that the claims made by the third party during the policy period were excluded from coverage.accordingly,we must affirm the judgment.
background 
appellant david feldman is the president and chief executive officer of zf micro solutions,referred to by the parties as zf solutions.zf solutions is the successor company to zf micro devices,zf devices,replacing the latter as of march.as it represents itself,zf solutions designs,markets,and sells semiconductor devices into the embedded microprocessor market.
the underlying litigation 
on april,zf solutions sued national semiconductor corporation nsc for failing to produce devices for zf solutions in accordance with the parties contract.on may,nsc filed a against both zf devices and zf solutions as successor for failure to pay for custom integrated circuits chips it had produced and sent to zf devices in accordance with the same contract.
nsc filed a first amended one year later,on april,in this pleading nsc added feldman and two others as and asserted new causes of action against the,including breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent transfer of assets from zf devices to zf solutions.in june the litigation between zf solutions and nsc culminated in a jury verdict finding both zf solutions and nsc liable to each other 
the insurance litigation 
from november,to july,zf solutions was insured by a liability policy issued by certain underwriters at lloyd,london underwriters.that policy covered directors and officers as well as the corporation.respondent illinois union insurance company illinois union covered zf solutions and its directors and officers from july,to july.
on about march,feldman tendered the defense of nsc amended to illinois union through the insurance broker.illinois union denied coverage,asserting that nsc claim had originally been made on may,before the inception date of the illinois union policy.illinois union also asserted exclusions for claims involving a contract and claims involving fraudulent acts by any of the insureds.in a written request for reconsideration,the insurance broker pointed out that the claim that was tendered was not for breach of contract but only for breach of fiduciary duty and related allegations against new defendants,including feldman.illinois union,however,adhered to its denial of defense and indemnity based on lack of coverage.this time the company invoked a policy provision that deemed interrelated wrongful acts to constitute a single claim and which required such a claim to be made during the policy period.under this provision,illinois union explained,nsc claim was made before the inception date of the policy.
zf solutions,zf devices,and feldman then brought this action against both illinois union and underwriters,which had also denied coverage in the plaintiffs first amended complaint only feldman asserted claims against illinois union,for declaratory relief fourth cause of action,breach of insurance contract fifth cause of action,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing sixth cause of action in the fourth cause of action he sought a declaration that illinois union owed a duty to defend him in the nsc and to indemnify him for the resulting judgment.
illinois union moved for summary judgment,or alternatively,summary adjudication,on the ground that there was no potential for coverage under its liability policy.illinois union argued that nsc claims were first made before the policy period began no coverage was available under an insolvency exclusion of the policy and an allegation that feldman had illegally recorded a telephone conversation was not covered under the privacy exclusion.
in his opposition feldman maintained that he was alleging new and different wrongful acts which were not causally connected and independent of the wrongful acts alleged in the original.feldman specifically pointed out that the original had alleged breach of contract,which was not a covered claim under the illinois union policy,and successor liability,which was a claim directed at zf solutions,not him.feldman further disputed the applicability of the insolvency exclusion because the zf entities were not insolvent.
the superior court,however,was unconvinced by feldman position.the court determined that the policy definition of interrelated wrongful acts encompassed both nsc original and its subsequent pleading,the first amended.the court took note of allegations in the original nsc that pertained to the same wrongful acts as those alleged in the later pleading.the court acknowledged that feldman was a new defendant in nsc first amended and that its third cause of action bore a new title,fraudulent conveyance and conspiracy but that pleading also repeat ed allegations that were clearly first made in the original and asserted that the zf entities were alter egos of feldman.because feldman had not raised any disputed issues of fact,the court summarily adjudicated the fourth through sixth causes of action against him.feldman timely appealed from the ensuing judgment on january,dismissing illinois union from the action
