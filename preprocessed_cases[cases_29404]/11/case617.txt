arguello and govea stopped with their family at a conoco store.after arguello husband pumped gas into her car,arguello and govea her father went inside to pay for the gas and buy some beer.as they stood in line,cindy smith,one of the two clerks on duty,waited on other customers.arguello testified that smith was rude to her when she reached the counter and that her demeanor was less friendly than it had been with the customers she had previously served.after arguello presented her credit card as payment,smith requested identification.arguello testified that smith singled her out by demanding that she provide identification smith contends that she requested identification because arguello was attempting to buy beer.
arguello,an oklahoma resident,presented smith with her valid oklahoma driver license.smith initially refused to accept it,claiming she could not take an license,but she eventually accepted it and completed the transaction.during arguello purchase,govea became increasingly frustrated with the manner in which smith was treating his daughter.consequently,he left the beer he had intended to purchase on the counter and walked out of the store.
after smith completed arguello sale,the tension between them escalated into a confrontation.arguello testified that smith began shouting obscenities at her and making racially derogatory remarks.arguello began to leave with her purchase,but realized that she had the wrong copy of the credit card slip and approached the counter again.after another argument,arguello and smith exchanged copies.as arguello walked away the second time,smith shoved a of beer off the counter and onto the floor.
plaintiffs testified that after arguello left the store,smith began screaming racist remarks over the intercom.at the same time,smith laughed at arguello and her family and made several crude gestures.govea and other family members telephoned conoco from a payphone outside the store to lodge a complaint.during that telephone conversation,the conoco official indicated that he wanted to know the name of the clerk in question.when govea attempted to the store to determine smith name,smith locked him out while laughing and making crude gestures.

to succeed on a claim,a plaintiff must establish that she is a member of a racial minority that the defendant had intent to discriminate on the basis of race and that the discrimination concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute.morris dillard dep t stores,cir.the first element is not parties concede that arguello and govea are hispanic.further,the testimonial and other evidence provides a basis for concluding that smith subjected arguello to substandard service.in conjunction with that evidence of maltreatment,the testimony regarding the racially charged nature of smith comments sufficed to create a jury question regarding whether smith intentionally discriminated against plaintiffs on the basis of race.therefore,this case turns on the third element,namely,whether smith conduct implicated rights guaranteed by.

to establish a deprivation of rights in the retail context,the plaintiff must demonstrate the loss of an actual,not speculative or prospective,contract interest.an allegation of the mere possibility that a retail merchant would interfere with a customer right to contract in the future is insufficient to support recovery under.morris,at collecting cases.instead,the plaintiff must offer evidence of some tangible attempt to contract that in some way was thwarted by the defendant.id.

govea can not make that showing.although his decision to abandon his purchase resulted from smith mistreatment of his daughter,smith did not actually interfere with an attempted purchase.according to govea own testimony,he voluntarily set the beer on the counter and left without trying to buy it.consequently,there is no basis on which a reasonable jury could conclude that smith prevented govea from making a purchase.nor can smith later conduct in locking him out of the store support a claim under,because his subsequent attempts to gain entry into the store were,again by his own admission,not to buy anything but to determine smith name so he could provide it to a conoco representative.
arguello likewise can not establish interference with an actual contract interest.her claim must fail,because she successfully completed the transaction having received all she was entitled to under the contract,she can not demonstrate any loss recoverable under 
plaintiffs argue for a broader interpretation of the right to make and enforce contracts on equal terms such that it would cover conduct occurring after the consummation of a contract.they note that b,enacted as part of the civil rights act of,extends the reach of by defining the term make and enforce contracts to include the making,performance,modification,and termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.b.
