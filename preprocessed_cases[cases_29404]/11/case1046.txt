civil rights 
the panel reversed the district court judgment in favor of the city of long beach in an action brought pursuant to alleging that the city zoning ordinances violate the first amendment by unreasonably restricting plaintiff ability to open and operate a tattoo shop in long beach.
the panel held that plaintiff had standing to bring a facial first amendment challenge to the zoning ordinances and that he was not required to apply for,and then be denied,a conditional use permit under a permitting system that allegedly gave city officials unfettered discretion over an expressive activity fully protected activity by the first amendment.the panel also held that plaintiff had standing to bring an first amendment challenge because it appeared likely that the city would take action against plaintiff if he opened a tattoo shop without a conditional use permit.
the panel held that plaintiff raised a cognizable claim that the city zoning ordinances constituted an unlawful prior restraint on speech.the panel held that the long beach code supported plaintiff allegations that the ordinances vested excessive permitting discretion with the city to issue or deny a conditional use permit,and did not contain adequate procedural safeguards.the panel further held that plaintiff raised a cognizable claim that the city zoning ordinances constituted an unlawful time,place,or manner restriction on speech.the panel remanded for the district court to try the city defense that the ordinances were reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions and not unlawful prior restraints on speech.

facts and prior proceedings 
real is a tattoo artist and resident of long beach.he owns a tattoo shop in huntington beach,california,but has desired to open a shop in long beach for over a decade.however,he has not opened a shop or applied for a cup due to long beach restrictive zoning ordinances,which disallow tattoo shops in most of long beach and require a cup to operate.long beach code,table.additionally,a tattoo shop may not operate within feet of any existing adult entertainment,arcade,fortunetelling,tattoo parlor,or tavern,and may only operate between and id.before issuing a cup,the city must conclude,among other things,that t he proposed use will not be detrimental to the surrounding community including public health,safety or general welfare,environmental quality or quality of life.id.generally,only a property owner in an area zoned for tattooing may apply for a cup if the affected property is not in such an area,the property owner must submit a separate application for a variance.id.
on august,real attorney sent a letter to the city identifying three locations where real desired to open a tattoo shop,and had obtained preliminary approval from landlords,but was unable to move forward because the locations were not zoned for tattooing.real attorney argued that the zoning ordinances were invalid because city officials have excessive discretion to issue or deny a cup,and the areas in which tattoo shops may be located are unreasonably restricted.the city responded on august,stating that a number of properly permitted tattoo shops operate in long beach,and the city was considering expanding zoning for tattooing,possibly to the east village arts district,where real was interested in operating 
real brought this action against the city,arguing that the city zoning ordinances unduly restricted his first amendment right to engage in tattooing by limiting the areas in which tattooing is permitted,including by requiring that there be at least feet between tattoo shops and taverns or other tattoo shops,and requiring permitting through a cup process that vests excessive discretion in city officials and imposes excessive fees.the district court held a bench trial where real testified that if the cup process were not in place,he would have the means to,and indeed would,pursue opening a shop in long beach.he testified that he never applied for a cup because the areas in which he was interested in opening a shop particularly an area named retro row were not zoned for tattooing,so he knew the application would be denied.further,to obtain a cup he would first have to rent a location,then pay a large,nonrefundable application fee,and then wait while the permit was reviewed,with no guarantee that it would be approved.moreover,he was aware that there were bars centrally located in retro row,and so the foot restriction would likely be prohibitive,even if the area were zoned for tattooing.
after real,and before presenting any evidence,the city made an oral federal rule of civil procedure c motion,claiming that real had not met his burden.the court agreed,and entered judgment for the city,concluding that the zoning ordinances constituted time,place,or manner regulations,not prior restraints,because they did not entirely forbid tattooing real brought an challenge,rather than a facial challenge,because he did not present evidence of impact on third parties and real did not have standing to bring his challenge because he did not apply for a cup,and thus suffered no.real timely appealed.

the district court inaccurately narrowed real claims in its order granting judgment in favor of the city by framing real challenge as only to the cup requirement,when real also challenged the location restrictions on tattoo shops ignoring real claim that the cup process vests unbridled discretion in the city and stating that real claim only concerned his desire to open a shop at elm street in the east village arts district,when this was just one of three locations that real initially identified in his letter to the city.by overlooking these aspects of real claims,the district court incorrectly concluded that real lacked standing and did not raise a prior restraint claim.
real has standing to bring a facial first amendment challenge to the city zoning ordinances 
the district court held that real plainly did not assert a facial challenge to the zoning ordinances because real presented no evidence regarding any third party conduct or effect of the zoning ordinances on third parties.however,there is no requirement that a plaintiff present evidence of harm to third parties in order to bring a facial challenge pursuant to the first amendment.rather,a plaintiff has standing to vindicate his first amendment rights through a facial challenge when he argue s that an ordinance impermissibly restricts a protected activity,and such facial challenges may be paired with challenges.santa monica food not bombs city of santa monica,cir.
