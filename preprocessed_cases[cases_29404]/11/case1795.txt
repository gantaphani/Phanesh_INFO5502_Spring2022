ii.motion procedure 
section is called the statute because it allows a defendant to gain early dismissal of causes of action that are designed primarily to chill the exercise of first amendment rights.siam kizilbash th,simmons allstate ins.th.in pertinent part,the statute provides,a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,subd.b.

iii.the pleadings and the motion 
a.the complaint 
in her complaint,wong asserted causes of action for libel per se and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress in support of those claims,wong alleged that in,she filled a cavity in jing and ma son tooth,and before doing so,she advised them that the silver amalgam contained mercury,and ma acknowledged this information.wong further alleged that in,after examining the boy again,she discovered cavities on the right side of his mouth and scheduled another appointment because she thought he might have a few more cavities.however,jing and ma consulted a different dentist.wong alleged that,jing and ma published slanderous complaints about her on web sites,including yelp,complaining that wong had not warned them about the mercury,she had misdiagnosed their son case,and she had improperly used a general anesthetic that is outside her scope of practice and for which she could lose her license.wong alleged that jing,ma,and yelp knew that the statements on the web site were false and had no legal excuse for making them.
wong attached a copy of the yelp review.it read as follows star rating let me first say i wish there is sic star in yelp rating.avoid her like a disease my son went there for two years.she treated two cavities plus the usual cleaning.she was fast,i mean really fast.i wo necessarily say that is a bad thing,but my son was light headed for several hours after the filling.so we decided to try another dentist after half a year.i wish i had gone there earlier.first the new dentist discovered seven cavities.all right all of those appeared during the last half a year.second,he would never use the laughing gas on kids,which was the cause for my son dizziness.to apply laughing gas is the easiest to the dentist.there is no waiting,no needles.but it is general anesthetic,not local.and general anesthetic harms a kid nerve system.heck,it harms mine too.third,the filling yvonne wong used is metallic silver color.the new dentist would only use the newer,white color filling.why does the color matter here is the part that made me really,really angry.the color tells the material being used.the metallic filing,called silver amalgams sic,has a small trace of mercury in it.the newer composite filling,while costing the dentist more,does not.in addition,it uses a newer technology to embed fluoride to clean the teeth for you.i regret ever going to her office.just want to add one more thing.dr chui,who shares the same office with yvonne wong is actually decent.
b.the motion,opposition,and reply 
in their motion,defendants claimed that posting the review was protected conduct because the review concerned an issue of public interest and was made in a public forum.they further claimed that wong could not show a probability of success on her claims.
defendants submitted,among other things,copies of various web site pages to show that the internet is an important source of public information about oral hygiene,dentists,and dentistry.defendants also submitted web site pages concerning the use of silver amalgam to fill cavities and whether it is safe because it contains mercury.
in opposing the motion,wong claimed that posting the review was not protected conduct.she argued that the review reflected only a dispute between private parties about the manner in which private services were rendered.wong further argued that she would probably succeed on her claims.
in her declaration,wong stated that in,she advised jing and ma that their son needed a filing,advised them that she would use silver amalgam containing mercury,provided a data sheet concerning the use of amalgam,and obtained written consent.thereafter,she conducted the procedure using nitrous oxide because the boy resisted needles.ma orally consented and watched the procedure.wong stated that the boy exhibited no ill effects from the gas,and his parents never complained about its use.according to wong,nitrous oxide is an analgesic,not a general anesthetic and the use of both the gas and amalgam are approved by the american dental association ada.
wong further declared that in april,jing and ma cancelled a scheduled appointment without sufficient notice and were charged for it.in may,she took of the boy,found cavities,and recommended fillings and additional.jing and ma asked for a saturday appointment,but she declined because she reserves that day for simpler procedures due to staffing difficulties.when jing and ma complained,wong waived the fee.nevertheless,jing and ma terminated her service,demanded dental files,and wentto another dentist.thereafter,jing and ma posted their negative review.
wong said that she asked yelp to delete the review because it was libelous.yelp advised her to buy a business account so she could manage the content of her listing.when she declined and asked again for the deletion,yelp claimed immunity for the review and advised her she needed a court order.in response,wong filed her lawsuit.
in addition to her declaration,wong submitted documentary information,including the fact sheet and consent forms acknowledged by ma concerning the use of amalgam,copies of pages from the ada web site,an article from its journal,and reference articles from the american academy of pediatric dentistry concerning the safety of amalgam and the pediatric use of nitrous oxide.
wong also submitted the declaration of bernard eisenga,who opined that when properly applied,silver amalgam is not hazardous to a patient health.he opined that when properly used in dentistry,nitrous oxide is not a general anesthetic and does not cause harm to the nervous system.he further explained that from a safety point of view,where the use of the gas is limited to short periods of minutes,it is better to use nitrous oxide than medication on children who are resistant to or afraid of needles.
in reply,defendants submitted the declarations of jing and ma.jing stated that he wrote and posted the review on yelp without ma knowledge.jing further stated that after his son cavity was filled in,his son was pale and vomited and felt for hours.in,after learning from wong that his son had more cavities and being concerned about the boy reaction to the nitrous oxide,jing took him to a different dentist,who found several more cavities and filled them with white composite after they discussed the pros and cons of silver amalgam.the new dentist also did not use nitrous oxide.thereafter,jing researched the use of silver amalgam and nitrous oxide on the internet.he then shared his views on both and his experience with wong with others in his posting.
in her declaration,ma stated that she did not write or even know about jing review before it was posted and did not know about the review until long after it was posted.
the parties filed objections to the declarations and exhibits each had submitted in support of and opposition to the motion.before the hearing on the motion,wong voluntarily dismissed yelp from her lawsuit without prejudice.
c.the trial court ruling 
in denying defendants motion,the court found that they had shown that wong action arose from protected,a writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.citations.the court further found,however,that wong had established a probability of success on the merits by making a prima facie showing of facts,which,if believed,would support a finding of libel and infliction of emotional distress against all defendants.
concerning ma potential liability in particular,the court acknowledged jing and ma declarations concerning ma but noted that they raised the issue in defendants reply,and wong had not had the benefit of discovery to controvert them.under the circumstances,the court ruled that the declarations did not establish ma.in addition,the court also ruled on the parties evidentiary objections,overruling all of wong objections and sustaining and overruling some of defendants objections.
iv.yelp right to appeal 
wong initially challenges yelp standing to appeal.she argues that because she voluntarily dismissed yelp as a defendant in her lawsuit without prejudice,yelp has nothing to appeal.
although the general rule is that once a person has been dismissed from an action he is no longer a party and the court lacks jurisdiction to conduct any further proceedings as to him,the rule has exceptions.frank annino sons construction,mcarthur restaurants,d.thus,e ven after a party is dismissed from the action he may still have collateral statutory rights which the court must determine and enforce,including the right to statutory costs and attorneys fees and the right to notice and hearing on a motion to set aside the dismissal.citations.ibid accord,day collingwood th.
for example,in liu moore th,the defendant liu filed a against moore and others,and in response,moore filed an motion.prior to the hearing,liu dismissed the as to moore only without prejudice.moore then sought attorney fees as authorized by the statute,subd.c prevailing party on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.the trial court denied the motion,reasoning that the dismissal of moore nullified her motion and precluded a finding that she was a prevailing party entitled to fees.liu moore,supra,th at.moore appealed from the order,and the court reversed.the court observed that the purpose of the statute is to give relief,including financial relief in the form of attorney fees and costs,to persons who have been victimized by meritless,retaliatory slapp lawsuits because of their participation in matters of public significance.citation.id.at,quoting,subd.a.the court explained that the trial court ruling would effectively negate an important part of the relief the legislature intended to provide to slapp defendants,frustrate the purpose of discouraging plaintiffs from filing slapp suits,and prolong both the defendant predicament and the plaintiff outrageous behavior.ibid.accordingly,the court held that a defendant who is voluntarily dismissed,with or without prejudice,after filing an motion,is nevertheless entitled to have the merits of such motion heard as a predicate to a determination of the defendant motion for attorney fees and costs id.at accord,kyle carmon th,party has absolute right to voluntarily dismiss an action before a motion has been heard,but dismissal does not preclude the trial court from addressing whether the prevailing party should be awarded attorney fees white lieberman th,order sustaining demurrer to complaint without leave to amend does not moot concurrently filed special motion to strike prevailing defendant entitled to award of attorney fees.
here,jing,ma,and yelp filed a joint motion.although wong dismissed yelp before the hearing on the motion,yelp remained a party to the motion because it would have been entitled to fees had defendants prevailed.thus,as a party to the motion,yelp was entitled to appeal from the order denying the motion and seek reversal in order to pursue attorney fees.see,subd.i order granting or denying motion is appealable.
wong reliance on gray superior court th is misplaced.gray did not involve an motion or the issue of whether an defendant may appeal the denial of his or her motion even after he or she has been dismissed from the plaintiff lawsuit.the court in gray held that where there is a preliminary evidentiary hearing in a case,after which a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses a party,that party may still move to vacate the dismissal.moreover,although the party may not appeal from a voluntary dismissal because it involved a ministerial,rather than judicial,act,the party may seek review of the order in a petition for extraordinary writ.id.at.gray is inapposite and does not suggest that yelp has nothing to appeal.
analysis of the motion 
on appeal,we review the motion de novo and independently determine whether the parties have met their respective burdens.christian research institute alnor th,mann quality old time service,th.
defendants burden to show protected conduct 
defendants bore the burden to establish that posting the review was protected conduct.on appeal,wong does not argue that the court erred in finding that defendants had met that burden.this is understandable.
as noted,the statute is designed to protect,among other acts,any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.
it is settled that web sites accessible to the public are public forums for purposes of the statute.barrett rosenthal cal th,fn,ampex cargle th,yahoo web site message board qualifies as public forum vogel felice th,web site listing top ten dumb asses wilbanks wolk th,posting on a consumer watchdogs web site bernardo planned parenthood federation of america th,posting on defendant organizations web site computerxpress,jackson th,two web sites qualified as public forums.
second,although not every web site post involves a public issue th,consumer information that goes beyond a particular interaction between the parties and implicates matters of public concern that can affect many people is generally deemed to involve an issue of public interest for purposes of the statute.compare,carver bonds th,newspaper article about medical practitioner involved issue of public interest where information would assist others in choosing doctors wilbanks wolk,supra,th at statements about insurance broker involved issue of public interest because they constituted a consumer warning to others with similar problems dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,claim that manufacturer disseminated false information concerning effectiveness of drug used by many was an issue of public interest with dyer childress th,false portrayal of real person in a movie not an issue public interest weinberg feisel th,published allegation of theft by one token collector against another not an issue of public interest rivero american fed.of state,county mun.employees,th,information published in union newspaper about termination of person who supervised eight people not an issue of public interest.
here,the court found,and we agree,that defendants made a prima facie showing that the posted review involved a public issue,namely public concern,discussion,and controversy about the use of silver amalgam because it contains mercury.wong own documentary submissions lend further support.the data sheet concerning amalgam that wong provides to her patients advises that mercury can be harmful and has caused discussion about the risks of mercury in dental amalgam and a diversity of opinion regarding the safety of dental amalgams.wong also submitted an ada journal article that acknowledges the existence of a controversy concerning the potential adverse health effects of exposure to mercury in amalgam.
moreover,the posting went beyond parochial issues concerning a private dispute about particular dental appointments.it implicitly dealt with the more general issues of the use of nitrous oxide and silver amalgam,implied that those substances should not be used in treating children,and informed readers that other dentists do not use them.thus,the review was not just a highly critical opinion of wong performance on particular occasions it was also part of a public discussion and dissemination of information on issues of public interest 
wong burden to show a likelihood of success 
to show a likelihood of success,t he plaintiff showing of facts must consist of evidence that would be admissible at trial.hall time warner,th.the plaintiff may not rely on the allegations in the complaint or assertions in a declaration based on information and belief.evans unkow th,nagel twin laboratories,th.however,to meet his or her burden,the plaintiff need only make a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th.in evaluating whether the plaintiff has met that burden,the court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant.ibid.where the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of probable success on the merits,the court should grant the motion only if as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.ibid.
ma liability 
defendants assert that wong offered no evidence to show that ma wrote or assisted in writing or posting the review,that ma knew jing intended to write a review or had done so,or that ma was even aware of the review before it was posted.on the contrary,in their declarations,jing and ma state that ma did not know about the review until after it was posted.given the lack of such evidence,defendants argue that wong failed to show a probability of success in establishing ma liability on any of her claims.
there is no evidence,admissible or otherwise,suggesting that ma had anything to do with the review and its posting.the posting did not state the name of the person who wrote the review,but it did reveal the person thus,the posting supports an inference that tai jing wrote and posted the review.however,it does not similarly support a reasonable inference that ma had something to do with it.indeed,the review is written in the first person,which implies that the review was written and posted by one person and reflects only that person sentiments.
concerning ma potential liability,the court faulted defendants for belatedly raising the issue of ma nonliability in their reply memorandum to wong opposition and not doing so in their initial moving papers.the court implied that it would be unfair to grant their motion as to ma based on jing and ma declarations,which it was not bound to believe,because wong had not had the benefit of discovery to learn facts that might show ma involvement and liability.
however,in our view,the court approach was flawed.defendants had the initial burden to show only that the complaint was based on protected conduct.they did not have to make a preemptive factual showing to negate what wong might present to satisfy her burden.in other words,contrary to the court ruling,defendants did not have the initial burden to show ma nonliability.rather,wong had the burden to present admissible evidence to establish ma liability in the first place.she failed to do so 
thus,because all of the causes of action asserted in the complaint are based on the posting of the review,wong failed to show probable success on any cause of action against ma.accordingly,as to the claims against her,the court erred in denying the motion.
defamation 
before determining whether wong showed a probability of success on her libel claim,we set forth the general legal principles that govern an action for defamation.
the elements of a defamation claim are a publication that is false,defamatory,unprivileged,and has a natural tendency to injure or causes special damage.taus loftus cal th.civil code section provides,libel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing,printing,picture,effigy,or other fixed representation to the eye,which exposes any person to hatred,contempt,ridicule,or obloquy,or which causes him to be shunned or avoided,or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.
statements that contain such a charge directly,and without the need for explanatory matter,are libelous per se.citation.a statement can also be libelous per se if it contains a charge by implication from the language employed by the speaker and a listener could understand the defamatory meaning without the necessity of knowing extrinsic explanatory matter.citation.mcgarry university of san diego th,mcgarry,italics added.
the sine qua non of recovery for defamation is the existence of falsehood.citation.because the statement must contain a provable falsehood,courts distinguish between statements of fact and statements of opinion for purposes of defamation liability.although statements of fact may be actionable as libel,statements of opinion are constitutionally protected.citation.mcgarry,supra,th at.that does not mean that statements of opinion enjoy blanket protection.ibid.on the contrary,where an expression of opinion implies a false assertion of fact,the opinion can constitute actionable defamation.milkovich lorain journal.the critical question is not whether a statement is fact or opinion,but whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude the published statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact.mcgarry,supra,th at.
to determine whether a statement is actionable fact or nonactionable opinion,courts use a totality of the circumstances test of whether the statement in question communicates or implies a provably false statement of fact.citation.under the totality of the circumstances test,f irst,the language of the statement is examined.for words to be defamatory,they must be understood in a defamatory sense next,the context in which the statement was made must be considered.citation.mcgarry,supra,th at.
in her complaint,wong alleged that the review was libelous per se because it falsely implied the following facts wong had failed to tell jing and ma that their sons filling contained mercury wong the case wong used a general anesthetic.concerning the last allegation,wong alleged that the use of a general anesthetic is outside the scope of her practice,and she could lose her license for putting a patient under a general anesthetic.
as noted,wong specifically alleged that she had,in fact,disclosed to ma that amalgam contains mercury and that ma acknowledged the disclosure.wong alleged that during the last visit,jing and mas child struggled,making it difficult to take of his teeth.she was able to get pictures of only the right side.she advised jing and ma that he had at least two cavities there.she suggested a return visit to the left side because she suspected the boy had more cavities.wong further alleged that she does not use general anesthesia,using it is outside the scope of her practice,and she could lose her license for using it.
on appeal,wong argues,as she did below,that the review implied that she was negligent and incompetent in failing to warn jing and ma that silver amalgam contains mercury and advise them of alternatives in failing to find the boys cavities and thereby misdiagnosing him and in filling the boys cavities under a general anesthetic and thereby exposing him to an unreasonable risk of harm.
failure to warn and advise 
the review stated that wong used a material called amalgam to fill the boy cavities,but later,the new dentist used a different,filling material.the review explained that color indicates what the filling material contains.the review states that what made jing really,really angry was that silver amalgam contains mercury.the white material used by the new dentist does not contain mercury and is better because it also contains a fluoride to clean teeth.
a reasonable person could understand jing statement that he was really,really mad about the fact that silver amalgam contains mercury and his statement that he regretted bringing his son to wong to mean that mercury is bad and should be avoided and that he did not know that wong had used amalgam or consent to its use and did not know that there were alternatives that did not contain mercury until later when he brought his son to the new dentist.furthermore,a reasonable person could well infer that jing would not have consented to the use of amalgam and would have insisted that wong use an alternative.
however,wong submitted evidence showing that before filling the boy cavities,she provided ma with an data sheet concerning filling material which not only disclosed that amalgam contains mercury but also revealed an alternative,composite resin filling material and then compared the pros and cons of each.wong also submitted evidence that ma acknowledged receiving the sheet and consented to the procedure that wong ultimately employed.in addition,wong submitted documentary evidence and the declaration of a dental professional indicating that when properly used,silver amalgam is safe and that within the dental profession there is no genuine controversy about its safety and use.
given jing introductory remarks that wong deserves a zero rating and should be avoided like a disease and that he regretted ever bringing his son to see her,his rage at wong use of amalgam because it contains mercury,and wong evidence that jing was advised and consented to the use of amalgam,a jury reasonably could find that the review falsely implied that wong had failed to warn and advise about silver amalgam and arguably better alternatives to its use.moreover,a jury could also find that such a false implication was defamatory,in that it could subject wong to contempt and cause her to be avoided and thereby injure her professional career as a dentist.slaughter friedman cal d letters to dental patients from insurance administrator denying claims for dental procedures it considered unnecessary and for which the dentist was overcharging implied that dentist charged excessive fees and performed unnecessary work supported claim of libel by dentist.
defendants argue that the review does not expressly accuse wong of failing to warn and advise.indeed,in his declaration,jing concedes that ma received the data sheet about filling materials.however,defendants propose a different,more innocent interpretation of the review.they argue that it was not the potential danger from mercury and the lack of warning that amalgam contains mercury that made jing really,really mad rather,jing was mad because he did not fully understand that other dentists use arguably safer and better alternatives to amalgam that do not contain mercury until he took his son to another dentist.
first,that the review did not expressly state that wong failed to warn or advise is irrelevant.a defendant is liable for what is insinuated,as well as for what is stated explicitly.citation.bates campbell cal.thus,as noted,a writing can be libelous if it implies a false assertion of fact.mcgarry,supra,th at.the way the review was written reasonably implies a lack of warning and advice.moreover,the review does not preclude such an implication by,for example,suggesting that jing or ma knew that amalgam contains mercury before wong used it.
even if defendants reading of the review were reasonable,statements can be libelous despite the possibility of an innocent,nondefamatory interpretation.macleod tribune publishing cal d.however,we find their reading to be strained and it is undermined by the data sheet which discloses that amalgam contains mercury and reveales an alternative resin filling material that does not contain mercury.finally,the suggestion that jing was not mad because amalgam contains mercury is particularly unpersuasive in light of defendants strenuous effort to show that the review involved a public issue concerning the safety issues related to the use of amalgam because it contains mercury.
citing forsher bugliosi cal d,defendants argue that wong could not oppose the motion on the ground that the review was libelous by implication because the complaint does not expressly allege libel by implication or the facts necessary to draw a defamatory implication.
in forsher bulgiosi,supra,cal d,the court reaffirmed settled principles.t he definition of libel has been held to include almost any language which,upon its face,has a natural tendency to injure a person reputation.citations.in determining whether a statement is libelous we look to what is explicitly stated as well as what insinuation and implication can be reasonably drawn from the communication.citation.to constitute a libel it is not necessary that there be a direct and specific allegation of improper conduct,as in a pleading.the charge may be either expressly stated or implied and in the latter case the implication may be either apparent from the language used,or of such a character as to require the statement and proof of extrinsic facts,inducement,colloquium,and innuendo to show its meaning.in the last case,proper allegations and proofs of the facts necessary to make the meaning of the language apparent will be required.citation.in this connection the expression used as well as the whole scope and apparent object of the writer must be considered.citation.id.at,italics in forsher.
here,the implied,allegedly defamatory accusation that wong failed to warn or advise can reasonably and readily be inferred directly from the review without additional facts or explanation.under such circumstances,further pleading and proof was unnecessary.see,fn,ante.
in sum,the review falsely implies that wong failed to warn and advise,and defendants showing does not conclusively negate that implication or preclude a finding that it was false and defamatory.
misdiagnosis 
the review stated that wong treated jing and mas son for two years she worked very fast and she found only two cavities.however,when jing and ma brought their son to another dentist,he discovered seven more cavities.concerning that discovery,jing stated,all right all of those appeared during the last half of the year.
viewed in light of jings introductory and closing remarks,a reasonable person could probably understand these statements to be criticism of wong for working hastily,failing to find all of the cavities that the boy had,and thereby substantially mis or the condition of the boys teeth.jings statement,quoted above,does not necessarily or unequivocally represent an honest concession that his sons seven cavities developed only after wong stopped treating him.rather,given its context and the tone of the entire review,the statement would more reaonsonably be understood as a sarcastic remark implying just the opposite those seven cavities did not just suddenly appear in such a short time after wongs services were terminated 
in her declaration,wong stated that in february,she took an of jing and mas sons teeth,discovered a cavity,and later filled it.over the next two years,she saw the boy,took additional,and cleaned his teeth.in april,jing and ma cancelled a scheduled appointment without advance notice,and she billed them for it but later waived the fee.in may,she took two of the boy and found multiple cavities,and recommended fillings and additional because the boy had made it difficult to get clear pictures.jing and ma sought a weekend appointment,but wong could not accommodate them because she has limited staff on weekends and reserves that time for simple procedures.thereafter,jing and ma terminated her services and demanded the sons file.
if believed,wongs statement would refute the implied assertion that she worked so fast that she failed to find several cavities thus had mis or the condition of boys teeth.moreover,a jury reasonably could conclude that such a false implication was defamatory.defendants showing does not conclusively negate or preclude such a conclusion.
use of general anesthesia 
the review asserted that laughing gas nitrous oxide is a general anesthetic and that it is easy for dentists to use.the review further stated that using a general anesthetic harms a child nervous system,and wong use of the gas had harmed the boy by causing him to be dizzy for hours after the appointment.
again,given jing introductory and closing remarks,especially about how fast wong worked,a reasonable person would probably infer that wong put jing son under general anesthesia to make her job quicker and easier,exposed the boy nervous system to potential injury,and had,in fact,harmed him by causing prolonged dizziness.
however,in her declaration,wong stated that the use of nitrous oxide has long been approved by the ada.she explained that she used it for a procedure because the boy had exhibited resistance to needles.moreover,she did so with the oral consent of ma,who watched the entire procedure.wong said that she did not observe any negative side effects during or after the procedure,and the boy parents never complained or even mentioned that he had experienced some problems.
wong further explained that as applied in dental procedures,nitrous oxide is not considered a general anesthetic because the patient does not lose consciousness rather it is an analgesic.moreover,she opined that there is no real controversy over the use of the gas on children when it is used as she uses it,and this is especially so when a child is resistant to the use of needles,which can break and cause harm.wong submitted additional documentary evidence to this effect.
wong also submitted the declaration of a dental professional.he stated that when used briefly and sporadically on children to perform dental procedures,nitrous oxide is not a general anesthetic but a conscious analgesic akin to the medications injected with needles,and such a brief use of the gas does not harm or pose a risk of harm to their nervous system.he stated that its use in this way is accepted within the dental profession and is,from a medical standpoint,preferable for young children who are resistant to fearful of needles,which can cause physical and emotional trauma.he explained that only the severe and prolonged administration of the gas could conceivably pose a neurological or risk of harm but that situation is distinguishable from using the gas for minutes to perform a dental procedure.
given wong evidence,a jury reasonably could find that the implied assertion that to make her job easier and quicker,wong put defendant son under general anesthesia to fill his cavities,exposed the boy nervous system to potential harm and harmed him was false and defamatory.again,defendants showing does not conclusively negate or preclude such findings.
conclusion 
our discussion of wong burden leads us to find that she made a prima facie showing of probable success on her cause of action for libel.thus,the court properly denied the motion as it applied to that claim.
claims for infliction of emotional distress 
intentional infliction 
the elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are outrageous conduct by the defendant,intention to cause or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress,severe emotional suffering and actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress.agarwal johnson cal d,disapproved on another point in white ultramar,cal th,fn.
although emotional distress may consist of any highly unpleasant mental reaction such as fright,grief,shame,humiliation,embarrassment,anger,chagrin,disappointment or worry fletcher western national life insurance company d,fletcher,to make out a claim,the plaintiff must prove that emotional distress was severe and not trivial or transient.id.at 
the california supreme court has set a high bar for what can constitute severe distress.hughes pair cal th,hughes.severe emotional distress means emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable person in civilized society should be expected to endure it.citations.potter firestone tire rubber cal th,potter,quoting girard ball d,fletcher,supra,d at see rest d torts,com.j.moreover,i t is for the court to determine whether on the evidence severe emotional distress can be found it is for the jury to determine whether,on the evidence,it has in fact existed.citation.fletcher,supra,d at,italics added.
pertinent here is hughes,supra,cal th.there,the plaintiff sued a trustee for,among other things,intentional infliction of emotional distress,alleging that he made sexually explicit,offensive,and threatening comments,in effect,demanding sex if she wanted her request for funds from the trust to be granted.id.at.in upholding summary judgment against her,the court concluded that the plaintiff allegations that she has suffered discomfort,worry,anxiety,upset stomach,concern,and agitation as a result of the defendant conduct do not comprise emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that no reasonable person in civilized society should be expected to endure it.citation.id.at compare with saari jongordon th complete disruption of life and diagnosis of depression wohl shoe th anxiety,tightness in chest,heart palpitations,panic attacks,depression,insomnia,and diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.
wong alleged in her complaint that the posting caused her to suffer severe emotional damage.however,in her declaration,she stated only that the review was very emotionally upsetting to me,and has caused me to lose sleep,have stomach upset and generalized anxiety.
this minimal showing does not reflect emotional distress that was any more severe,lasting,or enduring than that shown in connection with the summary judgment motion in hughes,and we reach the same conclusion reached by our supreme court.wong alleged emotional reaction to being professionally criticized in a yelp review,however unjustified or defamatory that criticism might have been,does not constitute the sort of severe emotional distress of such lasting and enduring quality that no reasonable person should be expected to endure.potter,supra,cal th at.this is especially so because jing later modified the review on yelp to delete the allegedly defamatory remarks.
