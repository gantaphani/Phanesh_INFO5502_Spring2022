background 
washington regulates the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages through a system that strictly limits the pricing authority and business practices of beverage producers,distributors,and retailers.costco filed an action against the state defendants contending,in count i,that several aspects of this system violate the sherman antitrust act,et.count ii alleged that revised code of washington and violate the commerce clause of the united states constitution by permitting only wineries and breweries to distribute directly to retailers in the state.count iii claimed that the restraints challenged in counts i and ii give rise to a cause of action under.count iv contended that the challenged provisions also deprived costco of rights secured by the washington constitution.
shortly after the filing of the complaint,wbwwa,a nonprofit professional trade organization comprised of beer and wine distributors,filed a motion to intervene as a defendant pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court granted the motion after finding that wbwwa had a protectable interest in the litigation because costco claims challenged the statutes and regulations underlying wbwwa members contractual arrangements with producers and retailers,and the state defendants would not necessarily adequately represent wbwwa interests in the litigation.thereafter,wbwwa materially assisted the state defendants in defending the challenged laws at every stage of the litigation.
costco mostly prevailed in the district court notwithstanding wbwwa intervention.following the united states supreme court decision in granholm heald,d,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of costco on count ii of the complaint and the related part of count iii,holding that revised code of washington and violate the commerce clause by discriminating against breweries and wineries.to remedy the violation,costco requested an injunction permitting producers of beer and wine to distribute directly to retailers.however,the district court declined to order that remedy,finding that it would be excessively disruptive of the state regulatory scheme,and instead enjoined producers from distributing directly to retailers.the court stayed the entry of judgment to permit the washington legislature a reasonable period within which to either withdraw the privilege from producers or to extend the privilege to producers.the legislature responded by passing a measure that extended the privilege to producers for a period of two years.
in substantial part,the district court also ruled in costco favor on for summary judgment concerning count with one exception,the court also held that all of the challenged restraints violate federal antitrust law.accordingly,wbwwa and the state defendants motions were denied.the court denied costco motion for summary judgment as well,but only because there were disputed issues of material fact concerning whether the challenged restraints were defensible as valid exercises of the state powers under the amendment.
the district court subsequently held a bench trial to adjudicate the amendment defense to costco antitrust claims.based on the evidence presented,the court concluded that the amendment did not shield the restraints found invalid under the sherman act.the district court then enjoined the state liquor control board from enforcing any of the restraints except for the sales ban.
based on its adjudication of the motions for summary judgment and at the bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of costco on all aspects of count i except for the sales ban.the court also entered judgment in favor of costco on count ii and the related portion of count iii.judgment was entered in favor of the state defendants and wbwwa on the sales ban under count i,and on count iv without prejudice to costco pursuing that claim in state court.
the state defendants and wbwwa appealed to our court the adjudication of count i,and costco the district court decision concerning the legality of the sales ban.we reversed the district court in part and affirmed in part in costco wholesale maleng,wl cir.we affirmed by holding that the and requirements violate the sherman act,that those requirements are not saved by the amendment,and that the sales ban comports with the sherman act.id.at.we reversed by holding that none of the other challenged restraints violate the sherman act.id.the judgment on counts ii,iii,and iv was not reviewed.id.at.
while maleng was pending on appeal,the district court adjudicated liability for attorney fees and costs.the parties stipulated that costco was entitled to in fees and in costs and that the state defendants were liable.however,the parties disagreed about whether wbwwa should be jointly and severally liable along with the state defendants.applying independent federation of flight attendants zipes,d,the district court held that wbwwa was not liable for fees and costs because wbwwa did not violate federal antitrust law or costco constitutional rights and did not defend the state laws in a frivolous manner.costco now appeals that decision

iii.discussion 
the parties dispute concerns whether independent federation of flight attendants zipes,d,permits costco to recover attorney fees and costs from wbwwa.zipes involved a class of flight attendants who sued their airline employer for sex discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of.id.at.after almost ten years of litigation,the parties reached a comprehensive settlement.id.at.the petitioner flight attendants union intervened to challenge the settlement on behalf of flight attendants not affected by the employer discriminatory practice,but the district court,seventh circuit,and supreme court successively rejected that challenge and upheld the agreement.id.at.the original class of plaintiff then sought attorney fees against the union.id.at.the district court and court of appeals awarded fees,but zipes reversed,holding that a district court should not grant fees under k against an innocent intervenor unless the intervenor action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.id.at.
because costco partially prevailed on its antitrust claims under count i and prevailed on its claim under counts ii and iii,there are two possible statutory bases for imposing liability for attorney fees and costs on wbwwa.the first is b,which provides that i n any action proceeding to enforce a provision of the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.the second is,which provides that a court shall award the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee,to any plaintiff who files an action seeking injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the federal antitrust laws and su
