tti filed the instant action claiming that the interest charged by pmf violated the sbia.the bankruptcy court found that pmf had charged excessive interest and ordered pmf to pay tti double the interest that tti had paid on the loan and further ordered pmf to return the two promissory notes.upon appeal,the united states district court for the district of utah agreed that pmf had violated the sbia by charging usurious interest and ordered payment of double the interest paid and return of the two promissory notes,or the proceeds therefrom.
on appeal to our court,pmf concedes that the interest charged on the loan was usurious and does not contest the district court order to pay tti double the interest that it paid on the loan.pmf contends,however,that the district court order to return the promissory notes or the proceeds thereof exceeds the statutory remedies provided for usurious loans under the sbia.exercising our jurisdiction pursuant to,we hold that the usury remedy detailed in the sbia at i does not provide for the return of collateral retained upon proper foreclosure of the underlying usurious loan.accordingly,we reverse the district court order requiring pmf to return the promissory notes.

the sbia provides consequences in the event that a lender charges a small business borrower an interest rate that exceeds the maximum limit authorized by statute.no case has interpreted the remedial provisions of the sbia at issue in this case,which state 
a if the maximum rate of interest authorized under paragraph on any loan made by a small business investment company exceeds the rate which would be authorized by applicable state law if such state law were not preempted for purposes of this subsection,the charging of interest at any rate in excess of the rate authorized by paragraph shall be deemed a forfeiture of the greater of i all interest which the loan carries with it,or ii all interest which has been agreed to be paid thereon.
