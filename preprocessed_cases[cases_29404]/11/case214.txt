plaintiff appellant georgitsi realty,llc georgitsi appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york irizarry,granting summary judgment to defendant appellee penn star insurance company penn star.the primary question presented by this appeal is whether an act performed on adjacent property that causes damage to the plaintiff property may constitute vandalism under the plaintiff property insurance policy.the subsidiary question of whether malicious damage may be found to result from an act not directed specifically at the insured property is critical to resolving this issue.because this question has not been decided by the new york court of appeals,and because it is dispositive of this appeal,and because the answer to this question will likely have broad implications for insurance disputes under new york law,we believe that the new york court of appeals should have the opportunity to address it.we therefore certify this question to the new york court of appeals.
background 
georgitsi owns an apartment building the building,which is located on eighth avenue in brooklyn,new york.on october,georgitsi obtained a broad form insurance policy the policy from penn star to insure the building from july,to july.the policy,which is governed by new york law,included coverage for a variety of perils,including fire,windstorm,smoke,riots,and vandalism.the policy defines vandalism as the willful and malicious damage to,or destruction of,the described property.
beginning in,the building sustained significant damage as a result of construction and excavation work performed on the property adjacent to the building owned by armory plaza,the adjacent parcel.the excavation work was performed as part of a plan to construct an underground parking garage.georgitsi had previously notified armory plaza and the excavators,engineers,and architect working on the adjacent parcel collectively,the excavators about the damage to the building.georgitsi had also notified the new york city department of buildings,which issued numerous stop work orders and summonses to the excavators.the stop work orders specifically referenced the damage caused to the building and other neighboring properties by the work being done on the adjacent parcel.georgitsi also obtained a temporary restraining order from the kings county supreme court enjoining the excavators from continuing their construction work on the adjacent parcel.the excavators nonetheless continued the construction work and ultimately admitted to many violations of the stop work orders,paying in fines to the city.
on december,georgitsi notified penn star of its claim under the policy for damage that the excavation on the adjacent parcel had caused the building.georgitsi requested reimbursement pursuant to the policy coverage for vandalism.penn star refused on the ground that the excavation damage did not constitute vandalism under the policy.georgitsi then brought suit against penn star in the kings county supreme court,which penn star then removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york based on the complete diversity of citizenship of the parties and amount in controversy in excess of.the district court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of penn star the magistrate judge,in its report and recommendation to the district court,found that the excavators had not committed vandalism within the meaning of the policy because their actions were directed only to the adjacent parcel,not the building,and that proof of recklessness would not satisfy the malice requirement of the policy as a matter of law.the district court adopted the recommended ruling of the magistrate judge we conclude that this appeal turns on the unsettled and important question of new york law of whether malicious damage within the meaning of an insurance policy covering vandalism may be found to result from an act not directed at the policyholder property but causing damage thereto and undertaken with knowing disregard for the policyholder rights.

ii.malice as an element of vandalism under the policy 
because the new york court of appeals has yet to resolve the issue before us,we turn to the decisions of the trial and intermediate appellate courts of new york state.see windsor united states,cir when we are faced with a question of new york law that is decisive but unsettled,we may predict what the state law is,consulting any rulings of its intermediate appellate courts and trial courts,or we may certify the question to the new york court of appeals.
