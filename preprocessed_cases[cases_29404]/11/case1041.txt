this action between an english plaintiff and chinese defendants requires us to navigate a jurisdictional minefield.bp chemicals sued jiangsu sopo corporation sopo alleging violations of the lanham act,the international convention for the protection of intellectual property,the missouri uniform trade secrets act and missouri common law.sopo claimed immunity from suit under the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,stat,because it is owned by the government of the people republic of china.the district court agreed and dismissed bp action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.bp chems.jiangsu sopo,d.we reverse the district court decision and remand for further proceedings.
a few words about the procedural posture of this case are appropriate at the outset of our discussion,for that posture regulates our consideration of the facts.sopo moved to dismiss bp action on several grounds soon after an amended complaint was filed in october.sopo contended the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,personal jurisdiction,and should dismiss the action under the forum non conveniens doctrine.in this appeal,we consider only sopo challenge to the district court subject matter jurisdiction,which we construe as a facial,not factual,challenge because sopo limited its attack to the allegations in bp amended complaint.see osborn united states,cir explaining the difference between facial and factual jurisdictional challenges.
we observe that the parties presented the district court with a robust evidentiary record from which competing accounts of the underlying events can be discerned.it may seem odd,then,that we construe sopo motion as a facial jurisdictional challenge.having closely examined the record,however,we believe the parties proffered affidavits,testimony,and documentary materials to assist the district court in deciding the ancillary issues presented in sopo motion,questions of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.the portion of sopo motion devoted to subject matter jurisdiction does not draw upon facts presented in the evidentiary record.ja.instead,sopo contested the district court subject matter jurisdiction by arguing the allegations in bp amended complaint failed to erode its presumptive foreign sovereign immunity.the district court tracked sopo facial challenge and did not make findings of fact pertinent to establishing subject matter jurisdiction.the manner in which the district court resolved sopo motion obliges us to accept as true the allegations in bp amended complaint,titus sullivan,cir,so we will not delve into possible disputes of fact brought to our attention in the parties appellate briefs.
bp amended complaint reveals that this action stems from its interest in certain trade secret practices and technologies.in,bp acquired monsanto corporation proprietary interests in the methanol carbonylation process for making acetic acid,a chemical used in making paints,plastics,resins,pharmaceutical and agrochemical products.that process entails a combination of special design features and exotic metals that can not be found in standard texts or design manuals.bp retains trade secret interests in these combinations,features,and technologies used to design and operate an acetic plant employing this process.
bp has licensed its trade secrets worldwide,enabling other companies to build acetic acid production plants using the methanol carbonylation process.to build those plants,bp and its licensees often relied upon outside engineering firms vendors to produce equipment and other intricate components.it appears that many of these vendors operated in the united states.the vendors operated at all times under strict,contractual duties to maintain the secrecy of bp methods and technologies during and after the construction process.
in the amended complaint is not learned that nooter corporation in louis,a vendor,had been asked to manufacture equipment in connection with an acetic acid plant under construction in china.through its own investigation,bp learned that other american vendors had received similar product specifications and directions to prepare materials needed in building an acetic acid plant.those product specifications closely resembled trade secrets developed by monsanto and bp.in some instances,the specifications disclosed to american vendors replicated typographical errors in original bp documents.
bp investigation traced the disclosures to sopo and shanghai petrochemical engineering company speco,another business.sopo allegedly worked in concert with speco to build the plant in china using bp trade secret designs.bp believes speco acted as sopo purchasing agent by procuring sophisticated engineering products and equipment in the united states for sopo to use in constructing the plant.bp claims speco disclosed bp trade secrets to american vendors to permit them to assess the cost and feasibility of manufacturing the requested components.speco also apparently signed contracts with several vendors to manufacture components used to build the plant.
in february,bp filed this action against sopo,speco,and nooter.bp quickly settled its claims against nooter and speco defaulted.when sopo moved to dismiss bp complaint on the grounds mentioned above,bp opposed the motion and,in the alternative,moved to file a second amended complaint and to conduct additional discovery in china pertaining to jurisdictional facts.the district court reasoned sopo was immune from suit in federal court under the fsia and dismissed bp action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court declined to reach sopo alternative personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens arguments the district court also denied bp motion to amend its complaint and its request for further jurisdictional discovery.bp now appeals from these adverse decisions.
from the earliest days of our republic,courts have distinguished between the public and private acts of government.see bank of the united states planters bank of,wheat.public acts,such as punishing criminals and printing money,emanate from the power inherent in sovereignty.private acts,such as commercial transactions,are not unique to government and could be performed by an individual.jurisdictional consequences flow from this distinction between public and private acts.a nation is generally immune from suit in another nation courts in matters arising from its public or sovereign acts,but not its private or commercial acts.saudi arabia nelson,d restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states.the fsia endorsed this understanding of sovereign immunity a foreign sovereign is presumptively immune from suit in federal court,but this presumption erodes when the suit concerns the sovereign commercial activities and transactions,id,a.
sopo is considered a foreign sovereign because it is owned by the government of the people republic of china.see id.a b.though sopo is ostensibly immune from suit,bp believes the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction because its action satisfied two of the fsia three commercial activity exceptions that deprive a foreign sovereign of its immunity from suit.the district court disagreed,holding it lacked jurisdiction because bp action fit neither exception.we review the district court decision de novo.capital grossman,cir.
our review concentrates upon the first commercial activity exception,which vitiates a foreign sovereign immunity in an action based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states.a.this plain statutory language naturally lends itself to analysis in two parts.to rebut a foreign sovereign presumption of immunity,a plaintiff action must be based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states.see id.bp contends its action meets both elements of this exception and thereby eliminates sopo presumptive immunity,a contention we shall explore in detail below.
the fsia contains no definition of based upon,so we must accord that phrase its plain and ordinary meaning in interpreting the statute.nelson,at.a claim is based upon events in the united states if those events establish a legal element of the claim an action is based upon the elements that prove the claim,no more and no less.if one of those elements consists of commercial activity within the united states or other conduct specified in the act,this country courts have jurisdiction.santos compagnie nationale air france,cir cited approvingly on this point in nelson,supra.we emphasize that only one element of a plaintiff claim must concern commercial activity carried on in the united states.the entire case need not be based on the commercial activity of the defendant.sun taiwan,cir.
because our task is to discern whether any of bp claims or any elements of those claims are based upon commercial activity carried on in the united states,we turn our attention first to bp amended complaint.the amended complaint includes a formidable array of claims with roots in state law,federal law,and international law.we need not consider each of these claims separately,since only one claim or element of a claim need concern commercial activity in the united states to erode sopo presumptive immunity.following bp lead,we train our focus upon its state law claims that sopo misappropriated bp trade secrets.in particular,according to count iii of the amended complaint,sopo violated the missouri uniform trade secrets act mutsa by improperly disclosing bp trade secrets to numerous american vendors without bp express or implied consent,while sopo knew or should have known the trade secrets were stolen or were derived from a person owing a duty to maintain their secrecy.ja.
the missouri legislature adopted the mutsa in.the nearly every set of state trade secret from the uniform trade secrets act,first promulgated by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws in.the uniform act provides that misappropriation of trade secrets may occur in any of three forms improper acquisition,disclosure,or use.its prefatory note explains that liability for misappropriation exists when either a person acquisition of the trade secret,disclosure of the trade secret to others,or use of the trade secret is improper.uniform laws annotated west.
the mutsa generally follows the uniform act by acknowledging these alternative forms of misappropriation,though the mutsa lumps improper disclosure and use into a single category.thus,the mutsa defines misappropriation to take two forms 
a acquisition of a trade secret of a person by another person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means or 
b disclosure or use of a trade secret of a person without express or implied consent by another person who 
used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret or 
before a material change of position,knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake or 
c.at the time of disclosure or use,knew or had reason to know that knowledge of the trade secret was 
derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it 
ii.acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use or 
iii.derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.
a recent decision from a district court within our circuit cogently explains the two forms of misappropriation recognized by the mutsa.
the first is when one acquires a trade secret through improper means,that is,through such means as theft,bribery or inducing one to breach a duty of secrecy.id.a the second example of misappropriation occurs when one disclosing a trade secret without consent,inter alia,knew or had reason to know that the secret was a cquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.id.b ii.
h r block tax,enchura,d.applying similar state law,we have previously recognized these alternate means of proving misappropriation,ekco group,cir defining misappropriation of trade secrets under minnesota law as either improper acquisition of a trade secret or disclosure or use of a trade secret without consent,as have other circuits,sokol crystal,dsc communications,cir same accord dtm research,v.at t,cir nora beverages,perrier group of,cir.
bp has elected to pursue a misappropriation claim against sopo stemming from sopo purported wrongful disclosure of bp trade secrets to american engineering firms.bp might have chosen to pursue claims against sopo,but bp elected not to do so and that strategic,legal choice is well within bp discretion as the master of its complaint.it may be true that many misappropriation claims arise when one party steals another trade secret.such theft is often followed by disclosure,as the thief attempts to cash in on his gains.in that case,we believe the mutsa permits a trade secret holder to pursue both theft and disclosure claims for misappropriation.one type of claim does not preclude the other.our review of trade secret law confirms that the mutsa is hardly novel in this respect a plaintiff may premise his misappropriation claim on any or all of these alternate forms of improper conduct.
we believe bp mutsa claim is based upon sopo commercial activity carried on in the united states.the claim requires bp to prove sopo disclosed bp trade secrets to others without consent,while having reason to know the trade secrets were acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain their secrecy.see.b c.in the course of proving that claim,bp says it will demonstrate sopo disclosed bp trade secrets to american vendors in the united states while procuring equipment to fabricate the plant.bp mutsa claim satisfies the required nexus with the united states because the claim is linked to sopo procurement activities in the united states.therefore,we have little difficulty concluding that an element of bp claim is based upon events transpiring in the united disclosures to american vendors.
both sopo and the district court disagree with our line of reasoning,but for slightly different reasons.sopo contends bp reliance on disclosure to american vendors is immaterial to bp misappropriation claim and that bp claim actually turns on whether sopo acquisition of bp trade secrets was tortious.appellee brief.sopo urges this distinction because it claims bp trade secrets were stolen outside the united states,hence bp action would not concern commercial activities in the united states.sopo appears to argue that the mutsa does not provide a misappropriation cause of action based entirely upon improper disclosure,but rather requires every trade secret plaintiff to prove the defendant stole its proprietary contention we have rejected in the preceding discussion.we believe the mutsa provides for misappropriation claims based upon wrongful disclosure of trade secrets,and we conclude sopo disclosure of trade secrets lies at the very heart of bp action.
unlike sopo,the district court acknowledged bp could ground a misappropriation claim upon sopo wrongful disclosures in the united states.but the district court believed bp reliance on a disclosure theory was merely a semantic ploy because bp true claim was captured by a theft theory.at its core,this lawsuit concerns sopo acquisition of bp technology in an unknown place and sopo commercial exploitation of that technology in china.bp,d at.the district court effectively recast bp misappropriation claim under the rubric of theft,rather than wrongful disclosure.and because sopo alleged theft likely occurred outside the united states,the district court held bp misappropriation claim was not based upon commercial activity occurring in the united states.
the district court reference to a semantic ploy derives from nelson,in which the court rejected a plaintiff artful attempt to refashion an intentional tort claim as a negligent failure to warn claim.at.for aught we can see,a plaintiff could recast virtually any claim of intentional tort committed by sovereign act as a claim of failure to warn,simply by charging the defendant with an obligation to announce its own tortious propensity before indulging it.nelson refused to consider the failure to warn claim as a proper basis for proving
