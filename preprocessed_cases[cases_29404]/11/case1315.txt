todd vess brought this diversity class action claiming that three defendants acted illegally to increase sales of the prescription drug ritalin,in violation of the california consumers legal remedies act clra,cal.et,and california unfair business practice laws,cal.bus.the district court dismissed vess complaint as to all three defendants for failure to plead fraud with particularity as required by federal rule of civil procedure b dismissed the complaint as to two of the defendants for failure to state a claim under rule b granted all three defendants motion to strike under california lawsuits against public participation statute,cal.civ.and granted attorneys fees to all three defendants pursuant to the statute.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
ritalin,a schedule ii controlled substance,is commonly prescribed for attention deficit deficit hyperactivity disorder.vess alleges that he was prescribed,and purchased,and ingested ritalin when he was nine years old.are novartis pharmaceuticals novartis the successor in interest to named defendant,the primary or exclusive manufacturer of ritalin in the united states since the american psychiatric association apa,publisher of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm,commonly used by medical professionals to diagnose and the nonprofit advocacy group children and adults with attention disorder chadd.
vess first amended complaint alleges that the three defendants have acted illegally to increase sales of ritalin.the complaint alleges an illegal conspiracy involving all three defendants,and illegal individual actions and inactions by defendant novartis.
the complaint alleges that novartis,the manufacturer of ritalin,has made substantial financial contributions to the apa and chadd,and that it has failed to disclose the extent of those contributions.it further alleges that novartis planned,conspired,and colluded with the apa and chadd to develop,promote,broaden and confirm the diagnosis of,in order to increase the market for ritalin.the complaint also alleges that novartis has failed fully to disclose information regarding the side effects of ritalin,and that novartis has failed to disclose the drug limited effectiveness.
the complaint alleges that the apa,as part of the conspiracy with novartis and chadd,fraudulently and falsely represented that the diagnostic criteria for add in the dsm were scientifically reliable that i n an effort to cover up this fraud,the apa improperly clustered data from tests of diagnostic criteria for add with data from tests of diagnostic criteria for different and unrelated medical conditions and that the apa purposefully and fraudulently failed to use objective criteria in the creation and promulgation of diagnostic criteria.the complaint further alleges that the apa has fraudulently failed to disclose,through misrepresentations and omissions,the role of the drug industry and,in particular,novartis,in the creation,promulgation and revisions of the dsm or the financial connection between its committee members and novartis.
finally,the complaint alleges that chadd,in exchange for financial contributions from novartis,deliberately attempted to increase the sales of ritalin,and to increase the supply of the drug available in the united states,and to reduce or eliminate laws and restrictions concerning the use of ritalin.the complaint alleges that during this time chadd was misrepresenting itself to the public as a neutral nonprofit organization dedicated to persons suffering from.in support of its allegation that chadd participated in the fraudulent conspiracy,the complaint alleges that chadd failed to disclose that it has received significant if not life sustaining contributions from novartis,and contends that chadd has distributed misinformation.
vess asserts the same three causes of action against all of the defendants.vess first cause of action asserts a violation of cal,which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale of goods or services to any consumer.vess second cause of action asserts a violation of cal.bus,which prohibits unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act s or practice s and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.vess third cause of action asserts a violation of cal.bus,which prohibits any statement that is untrue or misleading and made with the intent directly or indirectly to dispose of property or services.
all three defendants moved to dismiss vess original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to plead averments of fraud with particularity.the apa and chadd also moved to dismiss the complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim.all three defendants filed motions to strike pursuant to california statute and for attorneys fees under that statute.without ruling on the motions,the district court granted vess leave to file a first amended complaint.after vess did so,the defendants renewed their motions as to the first amended complaint the allegations of which are described above.the district court granted without prejudice all three defendants motion to dismiss vess complaint under rule b,and the apa and chadd motion to dismiss under rule b.it did not rule on the motions to strike under the statute.vess declined to amend his complaint again.the district court then dismissed with prejudice under rule b as to all three defendants,and under rule b as to the apa and chadd.it granted the motions to strike and awarded attorneys fees to all three defendants under the statute.
we review dismissals under rules b and b de novo.see united states ex rel.lee smithkline beecham,cir lipton pathogenesis,cir.we review the granting of defendants motion to strike under the statute de novo.see metabolife int,wornick,cir.we review an award of attorneys fees pursuant to state law for abuse of discretion.see roy allen slurry seal laborers int l union,cir.
ii.applicability of rule b 
vess contests two foundational propositions concerning the applicability of rule b.the first proposition is that the pleading requirements of rule b apply to both state and causes of action.vess argues that the doctrine of erie tompkins,precludes application of rule b to a cause of action,but his argument is based on a misunderstanding of erie and of the scope of the federal rules.erie applies irrespective of whether the source of subject matter jurisdiction is diversity or federal question.see maternally yours your maternity shop,cir.the federal rules of civil procedure apply irrespective of the source of subject matter jurisdiction,and irrespective of whether the substantive law at issue is state or federal.see hanna plumer,d.
the constitution and the rules enabling act authorize and,at the same time,limit the scope of the federal rules.the constitutional provision for a federal court system confers power on congress to regulate the procedures in the federal courts,but limited to a power to regulate matters which,though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure,are rationally capable of classification as either.id.at.the enabling act similarly implements the constitutional power and limits the scope of its implementation.the enabling act authorizes the adoption of federal rules,but provides that s uch rules shall not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.a federal district court can refuse to apply a federal rule of civil procedure in a civil case only if the advisory committee,the supreme court,and congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the enabling act nor constitutional restrictions.hanna,at.in other words,if a federal rule of civil procedure is valid under the constitution and the enabling act,it applies according to its terms in all civil cases in federal district court.
with only one exception,the federal rules have the same meaning in suits based on federal and state law.the exception is rule,specifying when a civil suit commences for purposes of the statute of limitations.the supreme court has construed rule to apply in suits brought under federal law,but not in suits brought under state law.see west conrail,d federal law walker armco steel,d state law see also sain city of bend,cir.the court different reading of rule,depending on whether federal or state law is involved,has been heavily criticized,see,stephen burbank,of rules and discretion the supreme court,federal rules and common law,notre dame,and the court has not applied this somewhat unconventional interpretative technique to other rules.specifically,the court has never suggested that rule b means one thing when applied to state causes of action and another when applied to federal causes of action.
it is established law,in this circuit and elsewhere,that rule b particularity requirement applies to causes of action.w hile a federal court will examine state law to determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action,the rule b requirement that the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule.hayduk lanna,cir emphasis in original.see also jenkins commonwealth land title ins,cir applying rule b to pleading of cause of action minger green,cir same roberts francis,cir same.we therefore reject vess argument that we should refuse to apply rule b to his causes of action in this diversity case.
the second proposition is that rule b applies to averments of fraud in all civil cases in federal district court,and that in cases in which fraud is not an essential element of the claim,rule b applies,but only to particular averments of fraud.vess argues that rule b does not apply at all in this case because the state statutory claims he asserts do not require a showing of fraud.vess is correct that fraud is not an essential element of the california statutes on which he relies.see comm.on children television,foods,cal d.but he is not correct in concluding that his averments of fraud therefore escape the requirements of the rule.
in cases where fraud is not a necessary element of a claim,a plaintiff may choose nonetheless to allege in the complaint that the defendant has engaged in fraudulent conduct.in some cases,the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of a claim.in that event,the claim is said to be grounded in fraud or to sound in fraud,and the pleading of that claim as a whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of rule b.see,anderson clow in re stac elecs.sec.litig,cir we now clarify that the particularity requirements of rule b apply to claims brought under section of the securities act when,as here,they are grounded in fraud.emphasis added shaw digital equip,cir d espite the minimal requirements of sections and of the securities act,a complaint asserting violations of those statutes may yet sound in fraud.for example,if a plaintiff were to attempt to establish violations of sections and as well as the provisions of the exchange act through allegations in a single complaint of a unified course of fraudulent conduct,fraud might be said to lie at the core of the action.emphasis added citation omitted,third and fourth brackets in original melder morris,cir appellants maintain that their securities act claims were inappropriately subjected to the rule b heightened pleading standard.this argument is untenable in light of the complaint wholesale adoption of the allegations under the securities fraud claims for purposes of the securities act claims.when securities act claims are grounded in fraud rather than negligence as they clearly are here,rule b applies.emphasis added shapiro ujb fin,cir w e determine whether rule b applies to and claims grounded in fraud,a question not yet decided by this court t he plain language of the rule clearly encompasses and claims based on fraud like those before us.emphasis added.
in other cases,however,a plaintiff may choose not to allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct in support of a claim,but rather to allege some fraudulent and some conduct.in such cases,only the allegations of fraud are subject to rule b heightened pleading requirements.the text of rule b requires only that in all averments of fraud,the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.b emphasis added.the rule does not require that allegations supporting a claim be stated with particularity when those allegations describe conduct.
in such cases,application of rule b heightened pleading requirements only to averments of fraud supporting a claim rather than to the claim as a whole not only comports with the text of the rule it also comports with the rule purpose of protecting a defendant from reputational harm.as we stated in in re stac,rule b serves to protect professionals from the harm that comes from being subject to fraud charges.at.see also ross bolton,cir rule b heightened pleading requirement safeguards defendant reputation and goodwill from improvident charges of wrongdoing.fraud allegations may damage a defendant reputation regardless of the cause of action in which they appear,and they are therefore properly subject to rule b in every case.to require that allegations be stated with particularity merely because they appear in a complaint alongside fraud averments,however,serves no similar function,and would impose a burden on plaintiffs not contemplated by the notice pleading requirements of rule a.
this circuit has not analyzed the application of rule b in a case where fraud is not an essential element of the claim,and where allegations of both fraudulent and conduct are made in the complaint.two of our sister circuits have provided such an analysis,however,and we now join them in holding that in a case where fraud is not an essential element of a claim,only allegations averments of fraudulent conduct must satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule b.allegations of conduct need satisfy only the ordinary notice pleading standards of rule a.as the fifth circuit wrote 
where averments of fraud are made in a claim in which fraud is not an element,an inadequate averment of fraud does not mean that no claim has been stated.the proper route is to disregard averments of fraud not meeting rule b standard and then ask whether a claim has been stated.
lone star ladies inv.club schlotzsky,cir emphasis added.as the eighth circuit elaborated 
the only consequence of a holding that rule b is violated with respect to a claim would be that any allegations of fraud would be stripped from the claim.the allegations of innocent or negligent misrepresentation,which are at the heart of a claim,would survive.
carlon thaman in re nationsmart.sec.litig,cir emphasis added.thus,if particular averments of fraud are insufficiently pled under rule b,a district court should disregard those averments,or strip them from the claim.the court should then examine the allegations that remain to determine whether they state a claim.
iii.motions under rules b and b 
novartis moved to dismiss vess first amended complaint for failure to plead with particularity under rule b,but made no motion under rule b.vess asserts that alleged actions and inactions by all three defendants,including novartis,state claims under cal.and cal.bus.and.fraud is not an essential element of a claim under these statutes.therefore,to the extent that vess alleges fraud,his allegations should be disregarded,lone star,at,or stripped from the claim,nationsmart,at,for failure to satisfy rule b.to the extent that vess does not aver fraud,however,his allegations need not satisfy rule b.
vess alleges that novartis fraudulently conspired with the apa and chadd to increase sales and sustain the price of ritalin.as we discuss in the next two sections,the allegations of fraudulent conspiracy with the apa and chadd do not satisfy the heightened pleading standards of rule b.we therefore disregard the conspiracy allegations against novartis.
however,at least some of vess allegations against novartis are not based on fraud.fraud can be averred by specifically alleging fraud,or by alleging facts that necessarily constitute fraud even if the word fraud is not used.under california law,the indispensable elements of a fraud claim include a false representation,knowledge of its falsity,intent to defraud,justifiable reliance,and damages.moore brewster,cir quoting bank of the west valley bank of,cir,quoting hackethal cas,d.in some of his allegations against novartis,vess neither mentions the word fraud,nor alleges facts that would necessarily constitute fraud.for example,vess alleges that novartis negligently failed to disclose its financial relationship with the apa and chadd,knowing that the information would be important to those diagnosed with and to those who were subsequently prescribed ritalin took steps to increase the sales of ritalin in various ways failed to warn consumers that the full range of ritalin side effects has not yet been adequately studied failed to disclose the limited effectiveness of its product and failed to disclose that the clinical literature on referred to in the dsm is of poor quality.
because vess allegations against novartis do not rely entirely on a unified fraudulent course of conduct,his claims against novartis are not grounded in fraud as were the claims in in re stac,melder,and shapiro.rather,many of vess allegations describe conduct,in the same manner as many of the allegations in lone star and nationsmart.those allegations should not have been disregarded or stripped from his complaint pursuant to rule b.we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of the entirety of vess complaint against novartis for failure to satisfy rule b.
novartis did not move in the district court to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim.on remand,it will be free to make such a motion to test the legal sufficiency of vess surviving allegations.we intimate no view on the likely success of such a motion.
american psychiatric association 
the apa moved to dismiss vess first amended complaint for failure to plead with particularity under rule b and for failure to state a claim under rule b.the entirety of vess complaint against the apa is comprised of allegations of a unified fraudulent course of conduct.each of his claims against the apa is therefore grounded in fraud within the meaning of in re stac,and the complaint as a whole must satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule b.
we agree with the district court that vess complaint against the apa fails to satisfy rule b.rule b demands that,when averments of fraud are made,the circumstances constituting the alleged fraud be specific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct so that they can defend against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong,at quoting neubronner milken,cir.averments of fraud must be accompanied by the who,what,when,where,and how of the misconduct charged.cooper pickett,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a plaintiff must set forth more than the neutral facts necessary to identify the transaction.the plaintiff must set forth what is false or misleading about a statement,and why it is false.decker glenfed,in re glenfed.sec.litig,cir.
vess alleges a fraudulent conspiracy between the apa and the other defendants,but he does not provide the particulars of when,where,or how the alleged conspiracy occurred.he alleges that the apa received financial contributions from novartis,but he offers scant specifics as to when or between whom the money changed hands.he further alleges that the apa fraudulently included add in the dsm even though add failed to meet the manual own diagnostic criteria,but he fails to indicate which criteria it failed to satisfy and how it failed to satisfy them.he charges that the apa sought to conceal its fraud by improperly clustering testing data for add with testing data for other conditions,but the allegation is unsupported by details,such as the names of those conditions.vess also fails to point to the specific scientific literature that the apa failed to fully address or actually obscured.finally,he alleges that the apa misrepresented its connection to novartis,but he does not identify any specific misrepresentations or specify when and where they occurred.these allegations are not particular enough to satisfy rule b.see,smithkline beecham,at holding that broad allegation that the defendant knowingly changed control numbers on various tests to wrongfully represent that the laboratory results fell within an acceptable standard of error,where the plaintiff did not specify the types of tests implicated in the alleged fraud,identify the defendant employees who performed the tests,or provide any dates,times,or places the tests were conducted,did not satisfy rule b in re glenfed,at requiring a plaintiff to state the time,place,and content of an alleged misrepresentation and explain why the statement is false or misleading in order to satisfy rule b.
when an entire complaint,or an entire claim within a complaint,is grounded in fraud and its allegations fail to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule b,a district court may dismiss the complaint or claim.we recognize that there is no explicit basis in the text of the federal rules for a dismissal of a complaint for failure to satisfy rule b,but it is established law in this and other circuits that such dismissals are appropriate.see,california,cir t he complete absence of particularity in first amended complaint fails to satisfy rule b.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal citation omitted in re burlington coat factory sec,cir w hile dismissal on rule b alone would not have been proper,the dismissal on rule b grounds was.lovelace software spectrum,cir because we find that plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead scienter under rule b,we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs claims for failure to plead fraud with particularity.bankers trust old republic ins,cir holding that the complaint should have been dismissed for failure to comply with rule b,but remanding to the district court for consideration of whether plaintiff should be permitted to amend.
a motion to dismiss a complaint or claim grounded in fraud under rule b for failure to plead with particularity is the functional equivalent of a motion to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim.if insufficiently pled averments of fraud are disregarded,as they must be,in a complaint or claim grounded in fraud,there is effectively nothing left of the complaint.in that event,a motion to dismiss under rule b would obviously be granted.because a dismissal of a complaint or claim grounded in fraud for failure to comply with rule b has the same consequence as a dismissal under rule b,dismissals under the two rules are treated in the same manner.see lovelace,at we treat a dismissal for failure to plead fraud with particularity under rule b as a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.bank carlstedt,cir the dismissal of a complaint or counterclaim for failing to satisfy the requirements of rule b is treated as a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under fed.civ.b.as with rule b dismissals,dismissals for failure to comply with rule b should ordinarily be without prejudice.l eave to amend should be granted if it appears at all possible that the plaintiff can correct the defect.balistreri pacifica police dep t,cir internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.see also,at when dismissing for failure to comply with rule b leave to amend should be granted unless the district court determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts internal quotation marks omitted caputo pfizer,cir where the plaintiff has requested leave to amend in the event the court is inclined to dismiss on rule b grounds,the failure to grant leave to amend is an abuse of discretion unless the plaintiff has acted in bad faith or the amendment would be futile.see also eminence capital aspeon,cir.
