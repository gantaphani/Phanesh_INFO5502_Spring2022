empresa cubana del tabaco cubatabaco challenges the trademark trial and appeal board grant of summary judgment to general cigar,on the basis that cubatabaco a cuban company lacks standing to seek cancellation of general cigar two registrations for the trademark cohiba the registrations.because this court finds that cubatabaco has a statutory cause of action to petition the board to cancel the registrations,and that issue and claim preclusion do not bar cubatabaco amended petition to cancel the registrations,this court vacates the board decision and remands for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
both cubatabaco and general cigar manufacture and distribute cigars using the cohiba mark.empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,cir.general cigar,a delaware corporation,owns two trademark registrations for the cohiba mark for use in connection with cigars.the first,issued on february,first registration and the second,issued on june,for the mark in block letter format second registration.id.
cubatabaco is a cuban entity that owns the cohiba mark in cuba and supplies cigars bearing that mark throughout the world.empresa,at.the cuban assets control regulations,part cacr,prohibit cubatabaco from selling cigars in the united states.the cacr generally prohibits a wide range of transactions with cuban entities,including the importation of products of cuban origin.see.of note,b generally prohibits a transfer of property rights to a cuban entity by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.
the cacr is subject to exceptions.a general or specific license allows cuban entities to engage in certain otherwise prohibited transactions.see,a.the cacr itself sets forth general licenses.for instance,a expressly authorizes cuban entities to engage in transactions related to the registration and renewal of trademarks before the patent and trademark office.specific licenses,on the other hand,must be requested from the department of treasury office of foreign assets control ofac.
here,cubatabaco used a general license to attempt to register the cohiba mark in the united states.specifically,in january of,cubatabaco filed an application to register cohiba for cigars and related goods.operating under the general license contained in a,cubatabaco based its application on its registration of the same mark in cuba,relying on section e of the lanham act,e.section e allows an applicant to rely on a foreign registration to register the same mark in the united states if the applicant has a bona fide intent to use the mark in commerce,and thus does not require actual use at the time of filing.cubatabaco also filed a petition to cancel the registrations,which the patent and trademark office cited as grounds for refusing registration to cubatabaco because its mark created a likelihood of confusion.
cubatabaco subsequently requested a special license from ofac to commence litigation against general cigar for its use of the cohiba mark.in october of,ofac agreed and granted cubatabaco a special license to initiate legal proceedings in the courts and to otherwise pursue their judicial remedies with respect to claims to the cohiba trademark.empresa,at.shortly thereafter,on november,cubatabaco sued general cigar in the district court for the southern district of new york alleging trademark infringement and seeking,inter alia,to enjoin general cigar use of the cohiba mark in the united states and to cancel general cigar competing registrations.a few weeks later,cubatabaco requested that the board suspend the cancellation proceedings pending the outcome of the district court action.the board agreed and stayed the proceedings.
in june,the district court granted partial summary judgment.empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,d.the court cancelled the first registration,finding that general cigar had abandoned it during five years of from to late.id.at.
in march of,after a bench trial,the district court permanently enjoined general cigar use of the cohiba mark and cancelled the registrations,finding that cubatabaco had acquired ownership of the mark under the famous marks doctrine during the period between general cigar abandonment of the first registration and the filing date of the second registration.empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,wl,at.general cigar appealed.
on appeal,the second circuit reversed the district court finding of infringement and vacated cancellation of the registrations and any injunctive relief granted by the district court.empresa,at.specifically,the second circuit held that the district court could not grant cubatabaco the injunctive relief it sought because the remedy would involve a prohibited transfer of property under of the cacr,given that cubatabaco would acquire ownership of the underlying mark.id.at.the second circuit noted that general cigar has the full panel of property rights in the cohiba mark.id.at.the second circuit specifically did not address the district court conclusion that general cigar had abandoned the first registration,dismissing the issue as moot.id.at.
after the second circuit issued its mandate dismissing all of cubatabaco remaining claims,general cigar moved the district court for orders dismissing cubatabaco cancellation petition before the board as well as an order mandating denial of cubatabaco application for registration.empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,d.the district court denied the motion as untimely.id.at.in dicta,however,the district court stated that the board should decide on its own the preclusive effect of the second circuit decision,if any,leaving open the question of whether cancellation by the board rather than injunctive relief granted by federal courts would constitute a prohibited transfer under the cacr.id.at.
general cigar appealed,and the second circuit affirmed denial of the motion.empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,cir.the second circuit stated that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to let the agency decide what preclusive effect should be given to our decision.id.the second circuit similarly did not address the open question of whether cancellation of the registrations by the board would constitute a prohibited transfer under the cacr.id.at.
when proceedings before the board resumed on june,cubatabaco filed its amended petition.general cigar answered and moved for summary judgment on grounds that cubatabaco lacked standing and,moreover,that principles of issue and claim preclusion barred the amended petition.the board agreed,granting general cigar motion and dismissing the amended petition with prejudice.the board expressly noted that it need not reach the merits of the preclusion analysis because cubatabaco lacked standing to pursue the matter.although the board acknowledged that a petitioner generally has standing when a pending trademark registration application has been refused based on one or more blocking registrations,the board still found that cubatabaco lacked standing in light of the binding,federal court judgment from the second circuit.
in its decision,the board cited stephen slesinger,disney,wl ttab june,and gal israel military indus.of the ministry of def.of the state of israel,ttab lexis ttab june,for the proposition that where a previous final judgment determines that a party does not own a property interest in a mark,the party lacks standing to challenge another registration of the same mark.notably,the determinations of no standing in slesinger and gal depended on an application of issue preclusion,whereas the board here explicitly did not address preclusion.slesinger,wl,at disney is entitled to summary judgment based on collateral estoppel.gal,ttab lexis,at in determining that collateral estoppel bars gal from asserting proprietary rights in the term uzi in this action,we must conclude that gal does not have standing.
this court reviews the board grant of summary judgment de novo.see coach,triumph learning llc,berkshire fashions.the supreme court recently clarified that issues sometimes discussed in terms of standing are more appropriately viewed as interpretations of a statutory cause of action.lexmark int l,static control components.therefore,this opinion focuse
