ihop properties,appeals an order denying its special motion to strike flora navarro complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section.we find that the special motion to strike should have been granted because navarro claim arises from litigation activity and she is barred from prevailing on the merits.we therefore reverse and remand with directions for the trial court to dismiss the complaint.
on august,ihop properties,ihop filed suit against navarro for unlawful detainer of an international house of pancakes restaurant in irvine.ihop alleged that navarro had breached a sublease and related franchise documents and that she was more than in arrears on rent.the unlawful detainer complaint requested possession of the premises,a declaration that navarro had forfeited her rights under the sublease,and damages.
according to navarro,she contacted ihop after the unlawful detainer complaint was filed to discuss her attempts to sell the franchise,but ihop would not discuss the matter with her unless she agreed to settle the unlawful detainer lawsuit and stipulate to judgment.the stipulated judgment was filed on august.the judgment was for possession and in damages,but execution was stayed if navarro met certain requirements,including timely payments and financial reporting.if navarro defaulted more than twice,or defaulted once and failed to cure the default,then the judgment could be enforced immediately.
further,navarro was to have until december,to attempt to sell her franchise and other rights.under their prior agreements,ihop approval for such a sale was required,and ihop agreed to review any proposed sale without undue delay.if navarro was unable to sell the franchise by december,then ihop would be able to enforce the judgment and navarro rights under the prior agreements would terminate.finally,she agreed to waive any right to appeal from or attack the judgment,directly or collaterally,and to release ihop from all claims related to the parties prior agreements.
on october,ihop filed an application for writ of possession.navarro filed an ex parte application to stay enforcement of the writ of execution,arguing that ihop had failed to process a potential buyer.she also claimed that an accountant had determined that ihop was not owed the money it asserted.the stay was specifically requested to allow an accounting.
ihop opposed the application,arguing the request for an accounting was an attempt to revisit the stipulation,which stated the exact amount navarro owed to ihop.ihop stated that navarro had repeatedly defaulted since the stipulation by failing to pay as specified and submitting checks that were returned for insufficient funds.the notices of default and copies of the checks were submitted as evidence.default notices were sent on august,september,october,and october.
the court denied navarro application and ihop pursued execution of the judgment.according to navarro,she heard nothing more from ihop about her proposed sale of the franchise until january,when it rejected her proposed buyer.
in july,navarro filed her initial complaint in the instant action,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.the fraud cause of action alleged that ihop had falsely promised to consider offers to buy her franchise rights without undue delay but intentionally delayed consideration of purchase offers until the deadline had passed.

the statute 
a slapp suit is a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.wilcox superior court th,fn,d.in response to the threat such lawsuits posed to the important public policy of open and free participation in the democratic process,the legislature adopted section the statute a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.the statute is to be construed broadly,subd.a.
the statute defines act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue as any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
we engage in a analysis to determine the propriety of granting or denying a special motion to strike under the statute.first,we decide whether the causes of action arise from acts in furtherance of the defendant right of free speech or right of petition.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e.braun chronicle publishing th,d.if the defendant has made such a showing,we then determine if the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing,subd.b.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier sletten cal th,d.
the applicability of section 
section was adopted in to address a disturbing abuse of section,subd.a.section exempted certain lawsuits from the ambit of the statute.therefore,it raises a threshold issue,and we address it prior to examining the applicability of section.
as relevant here,section states section does not apply to any cause of action brought against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services arising from any statement or conduct by that person if both of the following conditions exist the statement or conduct consists of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services,that is made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services,or the statement or conduct was made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.the intended audience is an actual or potential buyer or customer,or a person likely to repeat the statement to,or otherwise influence,an actual or potential buyer or customer,subd.c,italics added.
although navarro immediately jumps to a lengthy discussion of the nature of commercial speech,we need not go that far to conclude that section does not apply here.the speech at allegedly false promises to process potential buyers of navarro franchise rights without undue delay does not meet the requirements of section,subdivision c.such promises do not qualify as representations of fact about that person or a busine
