background 
united parcel service ups describes itself as the world largest package delivery company.as a motor carrier transporting goods interstate,ups is subject to the jurisdiction of the secretary of transportation and the board and is governed by certain substantive provisions of the mca.see.fulfillment services,a freight shipping company,alleges that ups violated one of these provisions,namely.
section provides that a motor carrier may enter into an agreement with one or more other carriers to establish joint rates,and that such agreements may be made and carried out and the antitrust laws do not apply to parties or other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.a.subsection f requires that a motor carrier whose rates or classifications are determined or governed by publications established under agreements approved under this section must participate in the determining or governing publication for such provisions to apply.f emphasis added.in other words,provides an exception from antitrust liability to carriers for collective rate and classification setting,provided they meet certain conditions.the subject of this appeal is ups hundredweight service,which fulfillment alleges runs afoul of f.
according to ups,its hundredweight service entitles shippers to lower rates if they send multiple packages to the same location on the same day.at the time ups introduced its hundredweight service in,it participated in the national motor freight classification nmfc,a collectively compiled rate classification publication covered by.through item of its general tariff,ups incorporated the nmcf series nmcf classification as part of its pricing mechanism,and referenced the nmcf classification in the published rates for its hundredweight service.in october,ups ceased participating in the nmcf,and stopped listing nmcf as a governing publication.notwithstanding these changes,ups hundredweight service tariffs continued to refer to the nmcf classification until.
under the nmfc classification,commodities carried by truck have a classification rating ranging from class to class,based primarily on their density.articles with the heaviest density,such as books and ingots,fall in class,whereas the lightest items,such as ping pong balls,are assigned class.fulfillment claims that ups tariff,even after it withdrew from nmfc publication,continued to refer to classes and that ups restricted its hundredweight service to commodities in those classes 
fulfillment filed this putative class action on behalf of itself and others who shipped parcels using ups hundredweight service between october,and july,claiming that ups continued reference to the nmcf classification violated f.the suit asked for a declaratory judgment that item of ups tariff became void and unenforceable when ups withdrew from participation in nmcf.fulfillment also sought relief under a,alleging that this provision allows private parties to sue for violations of the mca,including violations of.
the district court granted ups motion to dismiss because liability under does not extend beyond antitrust violations.the district court denied ups motion for attorney fees under e,holding both that it lacked jurisdiction to award fees,because it had dismissed the underlying suit for lack of standing,and that e requires only that attorney fees be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs,not defendants such as ups.fulfillment now appeals the dismissal of its suit,and ups cross appeals the denial of attorney fees.we affirm the district court,although we differ in our analysis.
this case was briefed to us as presenting the question whether fulfillment stated a claim under.only in a supplemental submission just before oral argument did ups shift ground and seek to cast its argument in terms of standing.of course,we do not rely on the parties to raise an issue of standing.see bates united parcel service,cir en banc standing is a threshold matter central to our subject matter jurisdiction.we must assure ourselves that the constitutional standing requirements are satisfied before proceeding to the merits.
the question of article iii standing is related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.ass of data processing serv.orgs.camp,d quoting flast cohen,d.although there are three requirements for article iii,causation,and the injury component is in serious contention here.agency of natural res.united states ex rel stevens,d.
to suffice for article iii standing,an injury must be a harm that is both concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.quoting whitmore arkansas,d.the injury required by article iii can exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing.warth seldin,d quoting linda richard,d.essentially,the standing question in such cases is whether the constitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff position a right to judicial relief.id.
although in some cases,it may seem difficult to separate where standing ends and analysis of the cause of action begins,the supreme court has provided guidance on this point it is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid as opposed to arguable cause of action does not implicate jurisdiction,the court statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.steel citizens for a better env t,d.the court went on to note that the scope of a statutory right of action goes to the merits and not to statutory standing.id.at.
stripped to its essence,fulfillment claim is that ups violated by charging an unlawful rate and fulfillment is entitled to an award of damages,including disgorgement fulfillment claim is founded on a colorable construction of the related statutes.its alleged injury is being subjected to an unlawful tariff and,as in citizens for a better environment,i t would have been a different matter if the relief requested would not have remedied their injury in fact but it of course would.at.
to be certain,not all statutes endow rights on a given plaintiff,the infringement of which is sufficient to support standing.see fernandez brock,cir stating that a plaintiff who merely claims that a defendant violated a statutory duty does not necessarily satisfy the requirement of injury in fact in article iii.nevertheless,as we explain below,because congress has enacted specific legislation,namely a,establishing a private cause of action for violations of the mca,including violations of,we must infer that it intended to create such rights.see cal.cartage,united states,cir holding that once it is established that a private cause of action exists,our inquiry shifts from whether article iii standing exists to whether prudential standing concerns are satisfied.
neither is prudential standing a barrier to fulfillment claims.most important here,the doctrine of standing concerns,apart from the case or controversy test,the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute.ass of data processing,at.as a shipper subject to pricing arrangements governed by the mca,fulfillment interest in being charged a legitimate tariff is precisely the sort of interest protected by.while also serves to benefit motor carriers by creating a fair harbor for collective pricing arrangements,this scheme simply evidences that congress sought to protect both interests,by striking a balance between the two.
ii.section a creates a private cause of action for violations of 
we have previously held that a creates a private cause of action for violations of the mca and its attendant regulations,and neither party disputes this basic premise.see rivas rail delivery,cir see also indep.drivers ass n,new prime,cir.that also implicates the antitrust laws provides no reason for departing from this general rule.
the district court found that liability under does not extend beyond antitrust violations.reasoning that congress struck a delicate balance when it adopted,excepting certain agreements from antitrust liability,the district court explained 
the agreement requirements contained in serve the purpose of the statute,which is to provide an exemption from antitrust liability for agreements that comply with the very specific provisions of the statute for securing such an exemption.imposing further liability,as fulfillment suggests exists under a,goes beyond the narrow purpose of,constrains contractual freedom,and is contrary to the policies and principles behind deregulations.
rather than examining the policies and principles behind the termination act and the antitrust laws,of which there are no doubt many,our analysis begins with the text that congress actually enacted.in this case,the text of a provides no basis to distinguish between violations of f and violations of other provisions of the mca.section a reads simply a carrier or broker providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier or broker in violation of this part.a.although congress may have had different purposes in enacting different provisions of the mca,the plain language of a provides equally a damages remedy for an act or omission in violation of the mca,without discriminating as to provisions under the act.
the eighth circuit analysis in new prime is not,as ups has suggested and the district court found,to the contrary.new prime.in new prime,the court held that a authorizes private actions for damages and injunctive relief to remedy at least some violations of the motor carrier act and its implementing regulations.id.at emphasis added.ups has latched onto the word some in this passage as evidence that not every violation of the mca is actionable under a.but ups misreads this language.
the plaintiff in new prime sought both an injunction under a and damages under a.id.at.section a,a provision not at issue in this case,allows suits for injunctions against violations of sections and.a.the defendant claimed that some of the regulations it was accused of violating were not promulgated under or,and thus were outside the scope of a.new prime,at.the court held that question was not properly before it,but included the caveat that a allows suits to enforce at least some violations of the motor carrier act and its regulations.id.at.in other words,the at least some language was meant to reserve judgment on the availability of a injunctions for violations of regulations promulgated outside of or.this language has no bearing on the scope of a.
in sum,the plain language of a counsels that there is a private right of action for violations within that part of the termination act,without limitation as to whether the claim rests on an antitrust violation.the alleged tariff violation here falls squarely within the statute.
iii.failure to state a claim under a 
although a does not limit claims to particular provisions of the mca,neither does it allow suits for abstract violations to state a claim,a plaintiff must still allege damages as a consequence of the violation.by its terms,a only makes carriers liable for damages sustained by a person.a.fulfillment claim that congress has provided a statutory penalty for violations of f b i,and that congress intended a to transfer the interstate commerce commission power to award restitution to shippers to the shippers themselves,is belied by the text of a.
the supreme court has been clear that damages do not include restitution or penalties,but rather are based on the extent of the injury actually suffered.int l coal mining.the statute an earlier version of the ica gives a right of action for damages to the injured party,and by the use of these legal terms clearly indicated that the damages recoverable were those known to the law and intended as compensation for the injury sustained.a close examination of fulfillment complaint and briefing reveals that although it uses the term damages,in effect fulfillment seeks disgorgement of ups unlawful tariff or a penalty similar to what the interstate commerce commission could have imposed.because fulfillment alleges only restitution and penalties,it has alleged no damages,and therefore failed to state a claim.see doe chao,d a n individual subjected to an adverse effect without more has no cause of action for damages.
fulfillment points to to plug this hole in its claim.that provision,although called a savings clause,can not save fulfillment claim.section states except as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part are in addition to remedies existing under another law or common law.even if were read to allow a court to impose equitable or other remedies in the event of a successful a claim,the provision does not eliminate a basic requirement that a plaintiff allege damages.in other words,the plain language of a requires a plaintiff allege damages,regardless of whether other remedies may also be available under.
in any event,fulfillment position suffers from another,equally fatal,flaw does not even appear to allow courts to impose equitable remedies as an adjunct to damages under a.nearly years ago,the supreme court construed an earlier version of the ica,which included language identical to that in 
w e have held that a manifest purpose of the savings clause is to make it plain that such appropriate common law and statutory remedies as can be enforced consistently with the scheme and purpose of the act are not abrogated or displaced that this provision is not intended to nullify other parts of the act,or to defeat rights or remedies given by earlier sections,but to preserve all existing rights not inconsistent with those which the act creates.
sonman shaft coal.internal citations omitted.the savings clause merely preserves the causes of action and remedies that already existed and do not conflict with the act it does not allow a plaintiff to seek equitable remedies under the new causes of action created by the act nor does it create a freestanding remedy unhinged from the private cause of action under.
the tenth circuit explained this distinction in overbrook farmers union coop.ass.pac,cir.there,a shipper alleged willful violations of an older version of the ica related to rail carriage,under a provision containing language identical to that of a,and sought punitive damages.id.at.the railroad argued that punitive damages were not authorized by the act,as the language allowed only for damages sustained by a person,actual damages.id.at.overbrook,like fulfillment,pointed to the savings clause,and argued that it preserved the common law right to seek punitive damages.id.at.the court disagreed,holding that the savings clause preserved the plaintiff right to seek state law or common law remedies,but only if the plaintiff brought a separate claim based in state or common law.id.at at a minimum,before punitive damages can be imposed upon a carrier the plaintiff must seek r
