the dispute in this case arises from clinical systems,llc use of maximus,paper templates designed to capture a encounter,and the electronic version of that product developed by.utopia provider systems,utopia alleges that both products are derivatives of its paper templates,ed maximus pursuant to an agreement in effect between october,and october,the license agreement or agreement,utopia licensed ed maximus to and was obligated to pay utopia royalties if any portion of ed maximus was provided to an end user.in,utopia obtained a copyright for ed maximus,effective as of october.
contending that committed unauthorized use of ed maximus and failed to pay royalties that it owed utopia,utopia brought this action against alleging claims of copyright infringement,breach of fiduciary duties,and breach of contract.the district court granted summary judgment on utopia copyright infringement claim on the ground that ed maximus was not copyrightable,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over utopia breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims that were based on state law dismissing them without prejudice 
utopia appeals,arguing that the district court erred in finding that it did not hold a valid copyright in ed maximus and abused its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.the dismissal of some of utopia breach of contract claims,contending that the district court should have found them preempted by federal copyright law.we affirm.
in august,michael mchale,an emergency physician,and joshua plummer,a healthcare administrator,created a prototype template from which they would develop ed maximus,a system of templates for use in hospital emergency departments mchale and plummer sought to license ed maximus to,a marketing agent,which would sell the template to hospitals.on august,mchale and plummer formed utopia to own and manage the rights in ed maximus.
in september,utopia and entered into the license agreement,effective october.pursuant to this agreement,utopia granted an exclusive license to sell,market,service,distribute and otherwise use its rights associated with the ed maximus charts the licensed materials.would use the licensed materials to formulate a product called maximus maximus would refer to any software product which uses or employs a full or partial copy of any licensed material.such a product could include the printing and manual completion of charts,as well as the creation of an electronic medical record based on or derived from the charts.
the agreement specified that would owe utopia of the revenue it collected from the sale,licensing or other distribution of the maximus module in any form distributed by either as a component or on a basis.the license agreement would remain in effect for five years,unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms,and would automatically renew for an additional period each year thereafter absent notification of nonrenewal by either party.once terminated,had to stop using the licensed materials.
in october,mchale and plummer created ed maximus templates to capture a patient encounter.in the words of the district court,
t he templates as a whole act as an integrated system for efficiently 
documenting a patient symptoms,and the physician conclusions and directions to the patient each of the templates consists of two or sets of charts,each useful for a particular type of ailment,such as chest pain,burns,head injury,pregnancy related problems.other than what necessarily differs chart to chart based on the nature of the ailment addressed,each chart is identical.they consist of blocks in which to record information from the patient the top block calls for personal data such as name,date of birth,and chief complaint.the next block calls for information on the present illness,such as how long it has been present,the quality of the pain,what exacerbates it,what relieves it.the next block calls for information on the present state of all the patient body systems.the next block calls for information about the patient medical and social history.the next two blocks,on page two,call for information to be input as part of the actual exam done for the problem presented and the decisions made by the physician.these blocks change based on the particular illness to be addressed using the chart.the final blocks allow for information to be input for clinical impressions,consultations with other doctors,and discharge instructions.see generally de,ex.each of the blocks on the charts contains blanks to be filled in by the physician with the relevant information.the line item blanks each have a word or two identifying what information should be placed there.
on october,mchale and plummer submitted the ed maximus templates to the united states copyright office,requesting a certificate of registration.mchale and plummer ultimately received a certificate of registration for ed maximus as a compilation of terms 
in creating maximus,copied the ed maximus templates verbatim,changing only the name of the product.on november,began selling maximus templates to hospitals throughout the united states.about a year later,began the development of its electronic physician documentation system epd based on the and thus ed maximus templates.copied directly from the maximus templates to create the first version of epd,but modified the second version.began marketing the full version of epd in september.
in february,reduced the amount of royalties it paid utopia on maximus from to of its sales.the license agreement expired on october,after unsuccessful negotiations to extend the agreement.continued to sell maximus until.continues to sell epd.has never paid utopia royalties on the sale of epd.
the present litigation began in the circuit court of broward county,florida,on january.utopia filed suit against for breach of contract,the license agreement.after moved the court to dismiss the case on the ground that utopia claim arose under copyright law,and thus had to be brought in federal court,utopia voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.on may,utopia sued in the united states district court for the southern district of florida its complaint contained three counts count i for copyright infringement count ii for breach of fiduciary duties and count iii for breach of contract,the license agreement all three counts were based on use of maximus and epd beyond the period of the license agreement and failure to pay royalties 
answer to the complaint admitted the existence of the license agreement but challenged its enforceability,denied the complaint material allegations,and asserted nine affirmative defenses,two of which are relevant here ed maximus was not copyrightable because its templates were blank forms that did not convey information,and utopia breach of contract claim was preempted by the copyright act.
the parties motions for summary judgment on count on september,prior to ruling on these motions,the district court sua sponte dismissed counts ii and iii.the court explained that,while it could entertain those counts under its supplemental jurisdiction,those claims present questions of state law which would otherwise predominate over the federal claim present here.
on february,the district court denied utopia motion for summary judgment and granted motion on count i.the court concluded that ed maximus was not subject to copyright protection because ed maximus was a series of blank forms,which did not convey information.utopia appeal and followed 
these appeals present two issues first,whether the district court erred in granting motion for summary judgment on utopia copyright infringement claim.second,whether the district court erred in its sua sponte dismissal of utopia state law claims.the parties both assert error in this dismissal on different claims that utopia state law claims fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states district courts and were preempted by the copyright act utopia claims that the district court refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims was an abuse of discretion.we consider these issues in order.
the district court awarded summary judgment on utopia copyright infringement claim on the basis that ed maximus templates were blank forms and thus not entitled to copyright protection.utopia challenge to the court ruling presents a question of law

it is that blank forms which do not convey information or contain original pictorial expression are not copyrightable.john harland clarke checks,cir citing baker selden.examples of blank forms include time cards,graph paper,account books,diaries,bank checks,scorecards,address books,report forms,order forms and the like,which are designed for recording information and do not in themselves convey information.c 
ed maximus is a set of charts for a physician to use to record a patient medical history and present symptoms.the charts contain headings such as history of present illness and room thereunder for a physician to fill out the patient unique medical information.the relevant test for copyrightability of ed maximus,therefore,is whether its forms convey information.the forms,before they are filled out,most certainly do not convey any information about a patient.the only way that the ed maximus forms could convey information would be in the selection of the terms on the forms that is,if they convey information to the doctors about what questions they should be asking.
our relevant precedent on how to determine whether a form conveys information is our decision in clarke checks.john harland created a product to address the portability problem associated with checkbooks.at.harland inserted a small,stub between the check and the checkbook permanent stub,so that a person could comfortably travel with a check and the stub.id.clarke checks,soon modified its desk checkbook to include an intermediate stub.harland brought suit against clarke checks on a number of claims,including copyright infringement.id.at.the district court ruled in favor of clarke checks,and we affirmed 
harland memory stub does not convey any information beyond that contained on previously existing check stubs which are manufactured by numerous bank stationery companies.the memory stub merely provides lines on which the check writer can record the date,the dollar amount of the check,the payee of the check,and the purpose of the check.thus,we agree with the district court that harland memory stub is merely designed for recording information and does not convey information or contain original pictorial expression.consequently,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the ground that the memory stub expression was not copyrightable.

while we know from clarke checks that a check stub asking for the date,the dollar amount of the check,the payee of the check,and the purpose of the check does not convey information,clarke checks does not set forth a clear test for determining whether a form conveys information,and the information requested through the ed maximus forms is more expansive than that in clarke checks.the second circuit decision in kregos associated press,cir,is more helpful in this regard.there,the second circuit explained that blank forms do not convey information if the 
headings are so obvious that their selection can not be said to satisfy even minimal creativity such a work conveys no information,not just because it contains blanks,but because its selection of headings is totally uninformative.on the other hand,if a scorecard or diary contained a group of headings whose selection or possibly arrangement displayed cognizable creativity,the author choice of those headings would convey to users the information that this group of categories was something out of the ordinary.
the second circuit offered examples of works with obvious headings versus works with headings that convey information.a baseball scorecard with columns headed innings and lines headed players and a travel diary with headings for cities,hotels,and restaurants would fall into the former category books intended to record the events of a baby first year or a european trip,depending on the suggestions of items to record and their arrangement,could fall into the latter id.at.
in accordance with these principles,we examine whether the selection of information requested by the ed maximus forms or its arrangement is informative or out of the ordinary.we look first to whether the headings are anything other than what would be expected on such a medical template,and second to whether the terms actually convey information to the treating physician.we find that each of the forms calls for the same information that any responsible physician would ask a patient with the given ailment.we reach this conclusion through our own examination of the forms and an analysis of mchale deposition,the evidence most favorable to utopia.
the originality claimed in the forms is in the selection and arrangement of the terminology used in the templates.we find that the selection and arrangement of the terms does not convey information and is not sufficiently original.as a starting point,we note that if the correct way to perform an action is well established in a profession,we fail to see how a description of how to perform that action can be original looking to the forms themselves,the first section on the forms is the same regardless of the ailment,calling for personal information such as the patient name,date of birth,sex,and chief complaint.
the forms then call for the history of the present illness,a review of systems,medical and social history,physical exam,medical decision making,clinical impressions,and finally,consultation,disposition,and instructions.the subcategories on the forms are often very similar,even when the complaints are very different.for example,the history of present illness subcategories,timing,duration,location are identical on the forms for lower and chest pain with the exception of cardiac risk factors being listed as an additional subcategory on the latter form.the questions in these categories differ only inasmuch as would be expected given the different type of complaint.for example,the lower extremity form asks for an evaluation of ankle range of motion in the physical exam,whereas the chest pain form calls for an exam of the lungs.given that the forms are for routine,superficial exams,however,we would not expect disagreement on the questions presented on a specific type of complaint.
turning to the evidence submitted by the parties,mchale,in his deposition,agreed that it is common when a doctor examin es a patient in the emergency department to go through all of the different major headings that were on the ed maximus templates and that the content in the ed maximus forms was content that a physician doing a systems review of an emergency room patient would consider as a part of his job.mchale nonetheless asserted that the terms would not necessarily be considered in that order or documented in that fashion.when pressed on this point,mchale agreed that the first thing a doctor in the emergency department generally does is inquire about the history of the present illness,and that is why it was the first substantive portion of every ed maximus template.likewise,the review of systems would be the next step taken.the medical and social history would also be taken it would not necessarily follow next,but mchale conceded that taking it next would not be unusual.certainly,mchale did not invent the idea of doing a medical and social history after the review of systems or doing a physical exam after the medical and social history.
our review of the forms and mchale testimony indicates that the headings and subcategories on the ed maximus forms are what one would expect to find on such a medical template.the ed maximus forms,therefore,are better analogized to the baseball scorecard or travel diary with generic headings described by the second circuit than to a possibly copyrightable book about a baby first year or the file structures used to organize a dental laboratory.
we next look to the question of whether the headings actually conveyed information to treating physicians.mchale agreed that the function of the ed maximus template was to record or capture the information gathered during a patient encounter.mchale stated that the template could prompt a patient encounter in that some people need to be prompted to capture all of the elements of a patient encounter,including billing,coding,and medical legal aspects.when mchale was asked whether the prompting he described referred to capturing information or adequately addressing the needs of the patient,however,he conceded that the template did not do the template did not have anything to do with the actual patient care.mchale further clarified that t he practice of medicine is an art and science.we are talking a documentation form that you are capturing that encounter on.so,i do think there is any documentation to help anyone practice medicine.in sum,mchale agreed that the template does prompt the physician to adequately care for the patient but rather prompts the physician to capture the information that derives from providing the care.indeed,when mchale was directly asked whether the forms conveyed information,he agreed that the forms do not c onvey information before they are filled out nor tell an emergency physician how to do his job.he characterized them instead as a means for capturing and retaining information.
between our independent review of the ed maximus forms and especially the uncontradicted evidence gleaned through depositions,we are unconvinced that the selection or arrangement of terms in the ed maximus forms is original or conveys information.therefore,we find that the ed maximus forms are not copyrightable.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting motion for summary judgment on utopia copyright infringement claim 
having found that the district court did not err in granting motion for summary judgment on utopia copyright infringement claim,we turn to the question of whether the district court erred in its sua sponte dismissal of utopia state law claims.asserts that certain of utopia state law breach of contract claims fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states district courts and are preempted by the copyright act.utopia asserts that the district court refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims was an abuse of discretion.we consider these arguments in turn.
first,the district court sua sponte dismissal of certain of utopia breach of contract claims.appellees brief at.in count iii,utopia alleges that breached their contract by failing to pay royalties on epd and maximus,competing against the maximus templates with epd failing to report revenue derived from epd,falsely reporting revenue from epd,and continuing to sell maximus and epd after the license agreement expired.
while it is not entirely clear which of these breach of contract claims contends are preempted by federal copyright law,we deduce from brief that it is referring to all of utopia claims regarding epd as well as claims relating to the use of the maximus templates after the license agreement expired.contends that the license agreement does not govern these claims therefore,they are merely disguised copyright infringement claims and are preempted by the copyright act.
the copyright act preempts 
legal or equitable rights under state law that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections and.

looking to the preemption test set forth in wainwright,the lipscher court found that because the material at issue was a compilation of facts,all of law bulletin claims fell within the subject matter of copyright.the determinative element,therefore,was whether the rights asserted were equivalent to the exclusive rights of section.the exclusive rights under the copyright act include the right to reproduce the copyrighted work,to prepare derivative works,and to distribute copies to the public.id.at citing.to determine whether the rights asserted in a claim are equivalent to these rights,
w e employ an extra element test such that if an extra element is required instead of or in addition to the acts of reproduction,performance,distribution or display,in order to constitute a case sic of action,then the right does not lie within the general scope of copyright and there is no preemption.
id.at quoting foley luster,cir.
we held that the state law deceptive trade practices act and unfair competition claims were preempted because the rights law bulletin was attempting to protect in its acquisition misconduct claims were copyright rights.id.at.law bulletin breach of contract claim,however,was not preempted law bulletin sought to enforce rights created by a simple contract,not copyright rights.as the seventh circuit has stated,claims involving contracts are not preempted because contracts do not create exclusive rights,but rather affect only their parties.id.at citing procd,zeidenberg,cir c ourts generally read preemption clauses to leave private contracts unaffected.id.citing procd,at the extra element test was satisfied by law bulletin need to show the existence of a valid contract between the parties.
applying lipscher,we find generally that utopia breach of contract claims are not preempted to succeed on its breach of contract claims,utopia must prove a valid license agreement,which constitutes an extra element under lipscher the rights utopia asserts,therefore,are not equivalent to exclusive rights under section,as required for preemption under the second prong of the wainwright preemption test 
argues that even if utopia breach of contract claim is not wholly preempted,certain of the breach of contract claims should be dismissed because the license agreement does not encompass them.of course,utopia can not,pursuant to the license agreement,recover for any actions took that were not covered by the license agreement that is simply acknowledging that actions outside the scope of a contract can not be said to breach that contract.to the extent that is argument,it is we need not parse through utopia claims here to decide what is covered by the license agreement.that is a matter of state law,and we leave it to the state court before which these claims are currently pending to perform the task 
we now briefly turn to utopia argument that the district court abused its discretion by not exercising supplemental jurisdiction over utopia state law claims.pursuant to a,a district court has supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.given that the district court had original jurisdiction over utopia copyright claim,and that the conduct underlying the state law claims was the same conduct underlying the copyright claim,the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over utopia state law claims.a district court may,however,
decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection a if 
the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law,
the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,
the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction,or 
in exceptional circumstances,there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
c.here,prior to dismissing utopia copyright claim,the district court sua sponte determined that such state law claims would tend to dominate the federal claim and obscure its significance.therefore,pursuant to c and,the court exercise d its discretion and dismiss ed the state law claims.
on appeal,utopia argues that the district court erred by refusing to entertain utopia state law claims through supplemental jurisdiction.we review the district court decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion.parker scrap metal processors,cir.as a practical matter,the district court is in the best position to weigh the competing interests in deciding whether it is appropriate to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.lucero trosch,cir.
in addition to utopia breach of contract claim in count iii,reviewed supra,utopia set forth a breach of fiduciary duty claim against and grossjung in count ii.utopia asserted that these defendants breached their fiduciary duties to utopia by putting interests ahead of utopia by marketing and selling epd,which competed with maximus taking unfair advantage of position in collecting revenues from sales of epd and maximus by refusing to pay utopia royalties,withholding revenue information and falsely reporting revenue information using the licensed materials solely for benefit and to utopia detriment demanding concessions regarding royalties and refusing to pay royalties.
in order to resolve utopia breach of contract claim,a court will need to examine the scope of the license agreement,applying state law,which may be an arduous task.see supra note.it will need to decide whether owes any royalties on epd,and if so,for which versions.then,the court will need to comb through the record to deduce the royalties that paid and which,if any,royalties are still owed.the breach of fiduciary duty claims will also require an analysis of the duties owed by to utopia under state law.given the deference we afford a district court decision whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by finding that adjudicating counts ii and iii would require resolution of complex issues of state law and would predominate over the federal claim.we therefore affirm on this issue as well.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is

utopia argues that the supreme court decision in feist modified the eleventh circuit standard as announced in clarke checks.utopia argues it did so by specifying that compilations need only minimal creativity to be copyrightable they are copyrightable so long as choices as to selection and arrangement are made independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity.feist,at.at.utopia ignores,however,that feist dealt with how to resolve the tension between facts generally not being copyrightable and factual compilations being copyrightable.feist held that a factual compilation may be copyrightable if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts,but the copyright is limited to the particular selection or arrangement.id.at.at emphasis added.feist did not imply in any way that the rule concerning the creativity in selection of facts was a standard that applied to anything but factual compilations or impacted the blank forms rule.while we note that the creativity in the selection of terms on the ed maximus forms bears on whether the forms convey information,the convey information a creativity in selection or arrangement governs blank forms and was not altered by the feist decision concerning factual compilations.utopia argument that the selection and arrangement of terms in the ed maximus templates show extraordinary degrees of creativity and originality,therefore,is relevant only to the extent that it shows the forms convey information.utopia argues that the supreme court decision in feist modified the eleventh circuit standard as announced in clarke checks.utopia argues it did so by specifying that compilations need only minimal creativity to be copyrightable they are copyrightable so long as choices as to selection and arrangement are made independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity.feist,at.at.utopia ignores,however,that feist dealt with how to resolve the tension between facts generally not being copyrightable and factual compilations being copyrightable.feist held that a factual compilation may be copyrightable if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts,but the copyright is limited to the particular selection or arrangement.id.at.at emphasis added.feist did not imply in any way that the rule concerning the creativity in selection of facts was a standard that applied to anything but factual compilations or impacted the blank forms rule.while we note that the creativity in the selection of terms on the ed maximus forms bears on whether the forms convey information,the convey information a creativity in selection or arrangement governs blank forms and was not altered by the feist decision concerning factual compilations.utopia argument that the selection and arrangement of terms in the ed maximus templates show extraordinary degrees of creativity and originality,therefore,is relevant only to the extent that it shows the forms convey information.
the third circuit approach in whelan accords with the second circuit approach.in whelan,the third circuit examined whether file structures used to organize the business aspects of a dental laboratory were copyrightable under the blank forms doctrine.at.defendants did not argue that the files did not convey information,and the court noted that such an argument would fail.id.not only were the files complex and detailed,butthere are many ways in which the same organization of the business aspects of a dental be accomplished,and several of these approaches might use significantly different file structures.the file structures in the dentalab and dentcom systems require certain information and order that information in a particular fashion.other programs might require different information or might use the same information differently.when we compare the comprehensiveness and complexity of the file structures at issue here with the blank forms at issue in the cases mentioned above,we have no doubt that these file structures are sufficiently informative to deserve copyright.footnote omitted gentieu tony stone,
