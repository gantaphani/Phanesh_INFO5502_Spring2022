this case arises from the district court dismissal of allergan,allergan claim for relief under california business professions code ucl et the unfair competition provisions for lack of standing.the issue before the court is whether a party must allege an injury compensable by restitution to have standing under the ucl.the california supreme court makes clear in two recent decisions,kwikset superior court of orange county,cal and clayworth pfizer,cal,that ucl,as amended by proposition,requires that a party need only allege an injury in fact that was caused by defendant unfair competition.we therefore reverse and remand.
