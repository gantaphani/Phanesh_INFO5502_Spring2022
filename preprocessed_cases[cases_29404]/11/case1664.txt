avenues in leather,avenues appeals the court of international trade grant of summary judgment upholding the tariff classification and rate of duty imposed by the united states customs service on certain imported folio merchandise.because the court of international trade applied the wrong legal standard in its evaluation of the motion and improperly estopped avenues from litigating the merits of its case,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
this is not the first time that the parties have disputed the proper tariff classification of this type of merchandise.avenues and the customs service have previously disagreed over the correct tariff classification for the goods avenues imports.see avenues in leather,united states,avenues i.
in avenues i,the imported goods were folios used to store,organize and carry papers,books,pens,pencils,and the like.upon importation,the customs service classified those goods under subheading,as containers.avenues disagreed,arguing that the goods should be classified under subheading,as diaries,notebooks and similar articles.the court of international trade agreed with the customs service.
on appeal,we affirmed the trial court decision.we held that,under the ejusdem generis analysis,the common characteristic or unifying purpose of the goods in heading consisted of organizing,storing,protecting,and carrying various items,id.at citing totes,united states,and that the imported goods fell within that description.we rejected avenues contention that the goods in question should have been ejusdem generis classified under heading.id.
this current appeal turns on the proper tariff classification of two other styles of folios imported by avenues.the disputed goods,style numbers and presentation,measure approximately inches tall by inches wide by inches deep when closed,are zippered on three sides with an interior sleeve,possess one exterior open flat pocket and a number of small interior pockets,have a single padded carrying handle fitted to the exterior spine,are constructed of paperboard covered with plastic foam and a exterior and interior,contain a calculator,and have an interior metal binder permanently affixed to the spine.
the customs service classified the goods under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus and assessed duty on the merchandise at the rate of percent ad valorem.subheading provides 
heading trunks,suitcases,vanity cases,attaché cases,briefcases,school satchels,spectacle cases,binocular cases,camera cases,musical instrument cases,gun cases,holsters and similar containers traveling bags,insulated food or beverage bags,toiletry bags,knapsacks and backpacks,handbags,shopping bags,wallets,purses,map cases,cigarette cases,tobacco pouches,tool bags,sports bags,bottle cases,jewelry boxes,powder cases,cutlery cases and similar containers,of leather or of composition leather,of sheeting of plastics,of textile materials,of vulcanized fiber or of paperboard,or wholly or mainly covered with such materials or with paper 
trunks,suitcases,vanity cases,attaché cases,briefcases,school satchels and similar containers

avenues disagrees with the customs service classification of the folios,and contends that the merchandise is properly classifiable under subheading of the htsus at a rate of percent ad valorem.subheading provides 
heading registers,account books,notebooks,order books,receipt books,letter pads,memorandum pads,diaries and similar articles,exercise books,blotting pads,binders looseleaf or other,folders,file covers,manifold business forms,interleaved carbon sets and other articles of stationery,of paper or paperboard albums for samples or for collections and book covers including cover boards and book jackets of paper or paperboard 
binders other than book covers,folders and file 
avenues protested the customs service classification by filing a complaint in the court of international trade.after filing its answer,the government moved for summary judgment.
acting on the motion,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.after noting the parties arguments in its opinion,the court of international trade found that the goods in this case were substantially similar to the merchandises considered in avenues i.the trial court then reasoned that,to avoid summary judgment,avenues had to prove that our decision in avenues i was clearly erroneous.because it deemed avenues affidavit evidence insufficient to prove the requisite clear error,the trial court granted the government motion and entered final judgment against the importer.avenues timely appealed,vesting us with jurisdiction under a.
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.int l trade c see also lynteq,united states.in reviewing the court of international trade grant of summary judgment for correctness as a matter of law,we decide de novo whether genuine issues of material fact existed and whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.jvc of am.united states,citing carl zeiss,united states.if we determine that there is no dispute of material facts,our review of the classification of the goods collapses into a determination of the proper meaning and scope of the htsus terms that,as a matter of statutory construction,is a question of law.mead united states.
in this case,the court of international trade confused and confounded two related doctrines of repose.under the guise of stare decisis,the trial court improperly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel.we take this opportunity to delineate the difference between these two principles.
the merchandise in question in this case is similar to,although not exactly the same as,the merchandise correctly classified under subheading in avenues i.in this case,avenues seeks to establish that the goods in question are correctly classified,eo nomine,as binders other than covers,folders and file covers.however,in adjudicating this dispute,the court of international trade erroneously assumed that the similarity to the avenues i goods disposed of this classification dispute.
although the goods in question in this case are admittedly quite similar to the merchandise whose classification was finally adjudicated in avenues i,the doctrine of issue preclusion does not hold sway over classification disputes under customs law.long ago,in united states stone downer,the supreme court held that collateral estoppel does not prevent an importer from successive litigation over the classification of merchandise,even when the subsequent importations involve the same issue of fact and the same question of law.id.at.under the public policy adopted by the supreme court in stone downer,each new entry is a new classification cause of action,giving the importer a new day in court.see id.at.
although an importer is free to challenge anew a previous classification of merchandise under the rule of stone downer,we have decided that the importer is burdened by the doctrine of stare decisis.see schott optical glass,united states.in schott optical glass,an importer of filter glass used in optical instruments disagreed with the customs service over classification of the filter glass.the customs service classified the glass as other optical glass,and the importer argued for classification as colored or special glass or ordinary glass.the customs court determined that optical glass had a special meaning that encompassed the goods in question,and the court of customs and patent appeals one of our predecessor courts affirmed that decision.see schott optical glass,united states,aff,ccpa.
subsequently,additional imports of similar merchandise were classified as other optical glass.schott optical brought suit,alleging that the definition of optical glass in the previous adjudication was clearly erroneous and therefor
