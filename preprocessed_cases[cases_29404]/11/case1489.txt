three united airlines passengers,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,sued united under an international treaty known as the warsaw convention to recover the value of baggage lost on international flights.without reaching the question of class certification,the district court granted summary judgment against the three named plaintiffs,on the ground that each had entered into an accord and satisfaction with united by accepting a check from the air carrier in full and complete settlement of any and all claims.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in september,james curtin flew from cork,ireland to dulles airport in virginia.after landing at dulles,he reported that a bag of golf clubs,estimated to be worth,was missing.in january,margaret wombacher flew from london to chicago.one of her bags never arrived in chicago,and she reported a loss of.in the same month,david simmons flew from london to atlanta,connecting through chicago.his bag made it to chicago but not to atlanta,and he filed a claim for.
in response to the claims for compensation filed by curtin and wombacher,united sent each a letter stating 
because your itinerary involved an international destination,claim settlement is governed by the warsaw convention which limits our liability to due to loss,damage or delay.
at.it sent simmons a slightly different letter,which read 
as your trip involved international travel,payment for your loss is based on the weight of your checked bag.the maximum liability our company assumes is per pound,up to pounds per checked item unless excess valuation is declared and purchased prior to travel.our check for in settlement for the missing property,will be mailed to you shortly.

by endorsement of this check payee s agree that the amount shown is accepted in full and complete settlement of any and all claims which payee s may have against united air lines,its connecting carriers,their agents or employees for loss,damage or delay sustained by reason of an incident involving a united flight.

article of the warsaw convention,an international air carriage treaty ratified by the united states in,creates a cause of action against an air carrier for loss of or damage to a passenger checked baggage.note.article of the convention limits a carrier liability for such loss to a maximum of francs per kilogram,or per pound.see trans world airlines,franklin mint,d.united calculated its liability to each plaintiff as no more than amount it tendered by the maximum weight of a bag permitted on its flights was pounds.article of the convention,however,requires that baggage checks contain certain particulars,including the number and weight of the bags,and article states that if the baggage check does not contain those particulars the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of those provisions of the convention which exclude or limit his liability.it is undisputed that united did not record the weight of any of the plaintiffs bags.
in cruz american airlines,this circuit ruled that the plain language of article precludes an air carrier invocation of the liability limits of article when it has not recorded the weight of the baggage.cruz acknowledged that passengers are not prejudiced by an airline failure to note a bag weight if the carrier maximum weight allowance is used to determine the amount of its liability,and that in such circumstances the recording requirement makes little real sense.id.at.nonetheless,cruz concluded that the language of the convention is unyielding and we have no warrant to dispense with portions we might think purposeless.id.
this case was filed on november,five weeks after the decision in cruz.the first amended complaint was brought by curtin,wombacher,and simmons,as a class action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated the class was defined as all persons who checked baggage on an international united flight without the weight of that baggage having been recorded,and who received payment of less than what they claimed was the fair value of the loss of or damage to that payment being an amount usually which united asserted or believed was the limit of its liability for such baggage under warsaw article per pound liability limitation.first am.compl.plaintiffs proposed a class period beginning the two years prior to initiation of this suit and ending on march.id they claimed that they were entitled to recover the full value of their lost or damaged baggage,and that the warsaw convention liability limit was inapplicable because the weight of their baggage had not been recorded on their baggage checks.
united moved for summary judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,raising the defense of accord and satisfaction by virtue of plaintiffs endorsement and deposit of the checks that united had tendered in settlement of their claims.plaintiffs countered that there were no valid accords and satisfactions,and that even if there were,they should be rescinded on the grounds of mistake misrepresentation.plaintiffs also asked the district court to permit discovery and to rule on the issue of class certification before addressing defendant motion for summary judgment.the district court denied those requests and granted united motion.
we begin with two preliminary matters plaintiffs contentions that the district court erred by deciding united motion for summary judgment without permitting discovery and without ruling on the question of class certification.the first of these arguments is readily dispatched.although it is true that summary judgment ordinarily is proper only after the plaintiff has been given adequate time for discovery,first chicago int l united exch,plaintiffs briefs fail to identify any facts essential to opposing united motion as to which discovery is needed.moreover,at oral argument,plaintiffs agreed that in light of factual concessions made by united below,all the facts required to decide the summary judgment issue are already in the record and further discovery is unnecessary.see also appellants br.at.accordingly,there is no possible ground for reversing the district court denial of discovery.see moore united states,holding that a district court may deny discovery requests when additional facts are not necessary to resolve the summary judgment motion.f providing that the court may continue an application for summary judgment to give time for discovery if the opposing party can not present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party opposition.
the certification issue detains us only slightly longer.the plaintiffs assert that the district court was obliged to determine whether their suit could proceed as a class action before it could consider the merits of their individual claims,in light of federal rule of civil procedure c and the supreme court holding in eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.neither of these authorities,however,suggests that a court is barred from rendering an easy decision on an individual claim to avoid an unnecessary and harder decision on the propriety of certification.
we begin with rule c,which states only that the district court shall determine whether a case may be maintained as a class action a s soon as practicable after the commencement of the action.as the seventh circuit has noted,although a certification decision will usually be practicable before the case is ripe for summary judgment,that will not always be so,and the word practicable allows for wiggle room enough to make the order of disposition of motions for summary judgment and class certification a question of discretion for the trial court.cowen bank united of texas,cir see telfair first union mortgage,cir thompson county of medina,cir adamson bowen,cir christensen inv,cir wright schock,cir.
nor is eisen to the contrary.there,the court reversed a district court that had held a preliminary hearing on the merits of the case in order to decide whether the plaintiff should be required to bear the cost of notice to the members of the asserted class.we find nothing in either the language or history of rule,the court said,that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.eisen,at.at emphasis added nothing of the sort occurred here.the district court did not conduct a preliminary inquiry,but rather reached a final resolution on summary judgment moreover,it did so to determine not whether the case could be maintained as a class action,but rather whether any of the named plaintiffs had a viable claim on the merits.under such circumstances,nothing in eisen or rule c requires the district court to rule on class certification before granting or denying a motion for summary judgment.see thompson,at wright,at.
as plaintiffs note,it is often more efficient and fairer to the parties to decide the class question first.but that was not so in this case where,as we discuss below,the district court readily and correctly perceived fatal flaws in plaintiffs claims.reversing the usual order of disposition in such circumstances spares both the parties and the court a needless,inquiry into certification.see federal judicial center,manual for complex litigation third stating that w hen it is clear that the action lacks merit,dismissal before certification will avoid unnecessary expense for the parties and burdens for the court.
plaintiffs also observe that it is often more protective of the interests of defendants to begin with the issue of class certification,because only a merits decision made after certification will bind all members of the class.but here,the defendant itself sought an early decision on the merits and,needless to say,does not suggest that it was prejudiced by winning on that basis.nor do the named plaintiffs suggest any prejudice to their own interests traceable to the order in which the district court made its decision,rather than to the decision itself.the plaintiffs do contend that,due to the passage of time since the lawsuit began,when the suit is dismissed putative class members will be left holding a time barred claim.appellants br.at.that contention,however,is simply incorrect.the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class,and potential plaintiffs other than the three named in this case remain free to file their own suits against united.see crown,cork seal parker,d.they will,of course,face the problem of stare decisis at least in this circuit,but even so their legal position is better than it would be if the merits decision had been made after class which case they would face the bar of res judicata.
in sum,in circumstances like these,where the merits of the plaintiffs claims can be readily resolved on summary judgment,where the defendant seeks an early disposition of those claims,and where the plaintiffs are not prejudiced thereby,a district court does not abuse its discretion by resolving the merits before considering the question of class certification.
we now turn to plaintiffs challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of united on the ground that plaintiffs damage claims are barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction.we review the district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,and may affirm only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.borgo goldin,citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
plaintiffs contend that there were no valid accords and satisfactions in this case,and even if there were,they should be rescinded on the grounds of mistake misrepresentation.we consider each of these arguments below.plaintiffs maintain that we should look to federal common law to decide these issues,while united urges us to look to the law of each individual passenger domicile.that,however,is a dispute we need not resolve.both sides agree that the uniform commercial code and the restatement second of contracts provide the applicable legal standards regardless of which law governs and neither side cites any case to suggest that the choice of law would effect a difference in the interpretation of the relevant or restatement provisions.
is entitled accord and satisfaction by use of instrument.it provides,with exceptions not relevant here,that a claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that i that person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim,ii the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute,and iii the claimant obtained payment of the instrument.a.in addition,the instrument or an accompanying written communication must contain a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.b 
the district court held that united tender to each plaintiff of a check for,stamped with the legend that the payee endorsement would constitute acceptance in full and complete settlement of any and all claims which payee s may have against united air lines,became an effective accord and satisfaction when the plaintiff signed and deposited the check.see cmts,noting that an accord and satisfaction occurs when a seller deposits a check marked with the notation that it is in full satisfaction of a bill.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge relies only upon the second requirement that the amount of the claim be unliquidated.the restatement defines an unliquidated obligation as one that is uncertain or disputed in amount.cmt.plaintiffs contend that united correspondence conceded the carrier liability for,and thereby showed that united regarded each claim as an undisputed,liquidated claim for.appellants br.at.
at oral argument,plaintiffs agreed that,at least if considered in isolation,the legend stamped on united checks indicated united view that the amount in question was not undisputed,since it stated that endorsement would constitute settlement of all claims.nonetheless,plaintiffs contend that the clarity of the check legend was muddied by united earlier letters.those letters,plaintiffs assert,did not demonstrate an intention to compromise or settle,but instead flatly stated that united liability was limited to thus rendered that amount a liquidated claim.
this argument has two principal defects.first,the language of the letters that united sent to the plaintiffs is not materially different from the language on the checks.like the checks,all three letters used the word settlement to describe the nature of the transaction between the parties second,and more important,there is simply no question but that the parties did consider the amount of the claims to be in dispute,and hence that the figure was far from liquidated.the three plaintiffs clearly did not regard as the amount they were owed,since their demands were for,and.nor did united signal agreement that the amount it owed was in fact.rather,the carrier described as the limit or maximum of its liability.that figure was calculated solely on the basis of the maximum weight of plaintiffs luggage,and could have been reduced had united successfully challenged plaintiffs estimates of the value of the bags contents 
there is only one way in which the tendered by united could be considered evidence of a liquidated claim if it were the law that a debtor automatically turns a debt or a portion thereof into a liquidated sum simply by offering a fixed amount in settlement.but if that were the law,there would be no such thing as an accord and satisfaction every offer to settle a debt would liquidate the debt at least to the extent of the offer,rendering every such offer ineligible under a ii.in this case,in order to discharge a claim,united paid more than it conceded owing and plaintiffs accepted less than they conceded being owed.that is more than sufficient to satisfy a ii and the fact that the amount accepted was the same as the amount tendered no more justifies calling plaintiffs claims liquidated than it would those in any other dispute.accordingly,we conclude that the
