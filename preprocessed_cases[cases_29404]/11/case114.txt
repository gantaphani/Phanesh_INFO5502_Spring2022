this case requires us to apply the accrual and statute of limitations provisions of the uniform commercial code of massachusetts to breach of warranty claims brought by truck service against caterpillar.purchased,trucks powered by caterpillar engines.more than four and a half years after it took delivery of the trucks,filed suit against caterpillar,alleging breach of warranty,violation of massachusetts unfair trade practices act.laws ch,and negligence,arising from failures in the flywheel housings in a significant number of the trucks.accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court dismissed warranty and chapter claims as.caterpillar then won summary judgment on the remaining negligence count.we affirm.
we draw on the summary judgment record for the relevant background.in march,and sterling truck corporation prepared a specification proposal for,trucks that intended to purchase from sterling for use in oil delivery and dump trailer operations.the proposal called for installation of caterpillar model engines in each of the trucks.allegedly decided upon caterpillar engines after extensive conversations with caterpillar employees and agents regarding engine specifications and performance,the terms of the warranty,and which engine manufacturer would stand behind their warranty the best.as a witness testified at a deposition,caterpillar representatives bragged that engine up like there was no tomorrow.after finalizing the agreement,caterpillar shipped completely assembled engines to sterling for installation in the trucks.in december and january,took delivery of the trucks and put them into service.
by late,serious problems had begun to develop with the flywheel housing on the caterpillar engines in several of trucks.the housings loosened and cracked,leading to disruptions in the use of the trucks and repair efforts.caterpillar reimbursed for the cost of the repairs to the first six trucks that experienced these flywheel housing failures in and.when a seventh truck became inoperable,caterpillar refused to pay for additional repairs.since that time,avers that an average of six,and as many as ten,of the trucks have been inoperable at any given time due to issues.because business requires all of its trucks to operate six days a week,it has incurred operating losses as a result of the failure of the trucks.made repairs on the trucks,requiring it to hire additional mechanics,and in some instances performed the same repair procedure multiple times on the same truck engine.alleges that these engine problems have resulted in trucks leaking oil in violation of environmental laws.also alleges that the failures have lowered the resale value of the trucks and prevented from trading them in for newer vehicles as it normally would.
claims that the flywheel housing failures were caused by a major design defect in the engine,and that caterpillar knew or should have known of this defect.contends that the housing failures fell under the caterpillar warranty and that caterpillar should have rectified the problems.also avers that,at meetings in june and august,caterpillar acknowledged responsibility for the flywheel housing failures and promised to make whole.in august,apparently unpersuaded by this promise,filed this suit against caterpillar.
initial complaint alleged breach of warranty count i and violations of massachusetts general laws chapter count ii.its second amended complaint added a negligence claim count iii as well.caterpillar moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on the grounds that counts i and ii were and that count iii was barred by the economic loss doctrine.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the motion to dismiss as to counts i and ii and deny the motion on count iii.the district court accepted these recommendations over objections.motion to further amend its second amended complaint or alter the court dismissal order was subsequently denied as well.caterpillar then moved for summary judgment on the remaining negligence claim on the basis of a negligence disclaimer included in one of the caterpillar warranty documents.the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be granted and the district court agreed.the instant appeal ensued,with arguing error on each of the adverse rulings below.
we begin with the district court determination that counts i and ii of complaint are.we review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,accepting as true the factual allegations of the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.garita hotel.ponce fed.bank,cir.we affirm the dismissal if the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to establish a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.

scope of the record subject to review 
before proceeding to our substantive analysis of the applicability of the statute of limitations to counts i and ii of complaint,we must first clarify the scope of the record subject to our review.the controlling pleading is second amended complaint.appended to this complaint is a document titled vehicle engine extended service coverage hereinafter esc,which refers to in the complaint and in its opposition to caterpillar motion to dismiss as the caterpillar warranty that forms the basis of its claims.neither party disputes that the appended esc was incorporated into the complaint and properly considered at the motion to dismiss stage.
however,seeks to rely on several additional documents to defeat the motion to dismiss.first,appended documents to its opposition to caterpillar motion to dismiss,including excerpts of deposition testimony and affidavits that wished to use to establish that caterpillar should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations.after the magistrate judge recommended that caterpillar motion to dismiss be granted without considering the additional documents submitted by,objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation also included as an exhibit a copy of another document,titled caterpillar limited warranty.referred to this document as the warranty,and asserted,for the first time in its objection to the magistrate judge report,that this document formed the basis for an additional warranty claim that would not be barred by the statute of limitations.caterpillar promptly asked the district court to strike all of the additional documents submitted by.the district court deemed this motion moot because both the district court and the magistrate judge had explicitly disregarded the appended documents as outside the pleadings,and hence inapplicable to a rule b determination.
under rule b,the district court may properly consider only facts and documents that are part of or incorporated into the complaint if matters outside the pleadings are considered,the motion must be decided under the more stringent standards applicable to a rule motion for summary judgment.garita hotel,at.exhibits attached to the complaint are properly considered part of the pleading for all purposes,including rule b.c blackstone realty,at.additionally,we have noted that w hen a complaint factual allegations are expressly linked admittedly dependent document the authenticity of which is not challenged,that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b.beddall state bank trust,cir see also clorox.proctor gamble comm,cir holding that,in ruling on a rule b motion,a district court may properly consider the relevant entirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint,even though not attached to the complaint quoting shaw digital equip,cir.
at the discretion of the district court,a motion to dismiss may be converted to a motion for summary judgment if the court chooses to consider materials outside the pleadings in making its ruling.d garita hotel,at.however,if the district court chooses,as it did here,to ignore supplementary materials submitted with the motion papers and determine the motion under the rule b standard,no conversion occurs and the supplementary materials do not become part of the record for purposes of the rule b motion.garita hotel,at.we review a motion to dismiss using the same criteria that obtained in the court below.id.at.as a result,we review only those documents actually considered by the district court in its rule b analysis unless we are persuaded that the court below erred in declining to consider the proffered documents.see coyne cronin,cir.
does not argue in its opening brief that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to convert the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment nor that it erred by choosing to disregard the documents appended to opposition to the motion to dismiss or included as an exhibit to objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.instead,opening brief marshals these documents in support of its argument as if they had been part of the record considered by the court below in deciding the rule b motion.thus,rather than assigning error to the decision of the district court to disregard the supplemental documents,opening brief ignores that decision and,by doing so,misrepresents the state of the record.caterpillar forcefully argued this misrepresentation in its responsive brief.then,in reply brief and at oral argument,finally argued that the district court erred in refusing to consider these supplemental documents in its review and it argued that we should consider them in our review.that argument came too late.see pignons de mecanique polaroid,cir in preparing briefs and arguments,an appellee is entitled to rely on the content of an appellant brief for the scope of the issues appealed,and appellant generally may not preserve a claim merely by referring to it in a reply brief or at oral argument.accordingly,in our review of the motion to dismiss,we will consider,as the district court did,only the facts and inferences fairly gleaned from the text of second amended complaint and the esc appended thereto.
we pause further only to emphasize that,even if had not waived its argument on appeal,it was well within the discretion of the district court to refuse to consider the caterpillar limited warranty document,the warranty.complaint refers generically to the caterpillar warranty,but then directs the court only to the esc,which was attached as an exhibit.if also wished to base its allegations on the caterpillar limited warranty,should have also referred the court to it specifically and attached it to the complaint.then,the magistrate judge would almost certainly have treated the additional warranty as integral to the complaint,and she would have considered it.but did not submit that document to the magistrate judge.although was aware of the caterpillar limited warranty from the outset of the case,decided to omit it from the magistrate judge review 
the district court is permitted,at its discretion,to consider materials not before the magistrate judge.b.however,that discretion must be exercised sparingly.we have previously noted that it would be fundamentally unfair to permit a litigant to set its case in motion before the magistrate,wait to see which way the wind was blowing,received an unfavorable gears before the district judge.mun.wholesale,cir.moreover,s ystemic efficiencies would be frustrated and the magistrate role reduced to that of a mere dress rehearser if a party were allowed to feint and weave at the initial hearing,and save its knockout punch for the second round.id.accordingly,it was well within the district court discretion to decline to consider the caterpillar limited warranty document in deciding the motion to dismiss.
thus,in our review of the motion to dismiss,we are limited to the text of complaint and the language in the esc.we will not review the deposition testimony,affidavits,or additional warranty documents that were not considered by the magistrate judge and the district court.
future performance 
the uniform commercial code,as adopted in massachusetts,provides that an action for breach of warranty must be commenced within four years of the date when the cause of action accrues.laws ch.the code section then specifies when the cause of action accrues 
a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.
id.thus,the default rule in is that the cause of action for breach of warranty is if brought more than four years after tender of delivery.however,if the warranty explicitly extends to future performance,the clock begins to tick when the breach is discovered or should have been discovered,or when the explicit time period expires,whichever occurs first.barkley clark christopher smith,the law of product warranties.
complaint stated that accepted delivery of the trucks containing caterpillar allegedly defective flywheel housing in december and january.filed suit for breach of warranty in august.thus,on its face,complaint is not timely unless the warranty on which its claims are based is one that explicitly extend s to future performance of the goods and the circumstances are such that the discovery of the breach must await the time of the promised future performance see coady marvin lumber cedar,d,quoting raytheon helix tech,wl.
the supreme judicial court of massachusetts has not discussed the proper application of the future performance requirement in of the thus we must make an informed prophecy of what the court would do in the same situation.blinzler marriott int l,cir.in making such a prophecy,we look to analogous cases decided by other courts in the forum state,persuasive reasoning in cases from other states,and learned treatises.id.
to determine whether a warranty is one of future performance,we must look to the language of the warranty itself to determine whether it explicitly guarantees the future performance of the goods.see coady,d at in determining whether a warranty explicitly extends to future performance,courts have emphasized the word explicitly.for example,if a warranty states that the product would be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of five years,it explicitly extends to the future performance of the goods.see,grand island exp.timpte,cir std.alliance,black clawson,cir see also clark smith,supra.if,on the other hand,the warranty states we promise to repair the product if it malfunctions within the first five years,it does not explicitly guarantee the future performance of the goods.clark smith,supra,new eng.power riley stoker.this type of repair promise warrants the future performance of the warrantor,not the goods.clark smith,supra.the warrantor has not guaranteed that the goods will not malfunction in the future,but rather that the warrantor will remedy any problems that arise in a particular way for a limited period of time.see.popcorn,wing,a warranty to repair or replace does not guarantee proper performance.rather,it anticipates potential defects and specifies the buyer remedy during the stated period.flagg energy dev.general motors,repair or replacement clause provides buyer only the relief expressly promised and is not a promise of future performance of the goods tittle steel city oldsmobile gmc truck,so d,repair or replace language does not guarantee that goods will perform free of defects rather it anticipates that defects will occur.
the only warranty language properly before us in considering caterpillar motion to dismiss is contained in the vehicle engine extended service coverage esc document,which was appended to complaint.the esc states this service contract provides full components and labor coverage for covered components failures due to defects in caterpillar materials or workmanship under normal use.the esc guarantees that caterpillar will pay of the components and labor charges for covered failures,with no deductible charges for failures occurring within the first months or miles.it specifies caterpillar responsibility to restore the engine to its operating condition prior to failure by only the defective components and consequential damaged components necessary to the defective components.
the esc thus never guaranteed that caterpillar engines would not fail it merely warranted that caterpillar would pay to repair them if they did fail.as such,the warranty provided in the esc is not a warranty that explicitly extends to the future performance of the goods,and the later accrual date specified in does not apply.thus,claims are by the statute of limitations that began to run on the date of delivery of the trucks.
in reaching this conclusion,we note that some courts have interpreted a vehicle manufacturer promise to repair or replace defective parts as capable of being breached,not at tender of delivery,but only in the event that the promised repairs are refused or unsuccessful.see,mydlach daimlerchrysler,holding that a promise to repair is not an express warranty and thus accrual for breach of a repair promise is not governed by,which applies only to breach of warranty.these courts have held that the cause of action for breach of a repair promise accrues when the promisor fails to or refuses to repair the defects.id.however,this view does not prevail in massachusetts in new england power,the appeals court of massachusetts rejected the position that a promise to repair or replace should be viewed as an independent or separate warranty.at.instead,the court said that such promises are generally viewed as specifications of a remedy and that if the promise to repair is not fulfilled,then the cause of action is the underlying breach of warranty.id.the court describes as a fallacy the argument that by failing to remedy its first breach,the defendant committed a second breach,giving rise to a brand new cause of action and starting anew the limitations period.id.thus,the court held that the promise to repair had no effect on the statute of limitations for the breach of warranty.see id.at.
the esc appears to be framed as a separate service contract,rather than a limitation of remedy on a warranty,and could perhaps be treated as such.however,styled its complaint as a claim for breach of warranty under the,not for breach of a service contract as such,claim is subject to analysis under,the statutory provision regarding the accrual of a claim for breach of warranty.because does not allege or even argue that the esc is a separate service contract,rather than a express warranty,we will not treat it as such for the purposes of our analysis.cosman ford motor,d,dismissing a count framed in terms,but sustaining claim for breach of a promise to repair brought under the act because such a claim can not ripen until the promise is broken and has nothing to do with the inherent quality of the goods or their future performance as a result,any breach of which is complaining must stem from an underlying warranty on the engines themselves.has not identified,within the record properly before us,any underlying warranty guaranteeing the future performance of the goods themselves.the claim for breach therefore accrued on the date of delivery of the goods and suit,which was filed more than four years after delivery of the trucks,is.
equitable estoppel 
if is to escape the consequence of its lack of diligence in bringing this action,it must do so by averring that caterpillar lulled into the delay.see new eng.power,at.where it appears from the dates and facts recounted in the complaint that the statute of limitations has run,the plaintiff has an affirmative burden to plead in its complaint the facts required to establish estoppel.lachapelle,at.under massachusetts law,estoppel would require proof that the defendants made representations they knew or should have known would induce the plaintiffs to put off bringing a suit and that the plaintiffs did in fact delay in reliance on the representations.white peabody const.h onest,genuine repair efforts,standing alone,are not a sufficient basis for application of the doctrine of estoppel.new eng.power,at.complaint does not allege any representations made by caterpillar that induced to delay filing suit,nor does the complaint allege that caterpillar efforts to repair the trucks were insincere or pretextual.instead,the complaint alleges only that they were unsuccessful see id.
having failed to allege any facts predicate to the estoppel claim in its complaint,premises its claim on the deposition transcripts and affidavits attached to its opposition to caterpillar motion to dismiss and its objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.as we noted above,waived its argument that the magistrate judge and the district judge should have considered these documents,either by deeming them integral to complaint or by converting caterpillar motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.thus,the documents are not properly before us and we will not consider them.as a result,estoppel argument fails 
count claim 
count ii of complaint alleges that,by breaching its warranty obligations to,caterpillar engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of massachusetts general laws chapter.the accrual date of the chapter claim is the same as the accrual date for the underlying action.hanson housing auth.dryvit.accordingly,the statute of limitations applicable to chapter actions.laws ch,had expired when filed suit in august.
following the magistrate judge recommendation that caterpillar motion to dismiss be granted,filed a motion to amend the pleadings,which the magistrate judge denied.we review the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings under an abuse of discretion standard.hyatt hotels,cir.
argues that the magistrate judge erred by failing to apply the liberal amendment policy set forth in federal rule of civil procedure a,which provides that pleadings may be amended with court approval and that t he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.see.a.however,as the magistrate judge correctly noted,rule b establishes a different standard when a motion to amend comes late in the case.rule b requires that the district court enter a scheduling order setting the deadlines for subsequent proceedings in the litigation,including amendment of the pleadings.b,a.one purpose of the rule is to assure that at some point the pleadings will be fixed,at quoting comm.notes to amends.to.b.the deadlines established in the scheduling order may be extended on a showing of good cause.id.our case law clearly establishes that rule b good cause standard,rather than rule a freely give n standard,governs motions to amend filed after scheduling order deadlines.id.at.
here,filed its motion to amend eleven months after the deadline established by the scheduling order.although seeks to justify its delay by pointing to information discovered at various depositions,none of that information is relevant to the estoppel theory or the future performance warranty theory that could allow claims to survive the motion to dismiss.the allegations that seeks to add to its amended complaint are based on information that had or should have had from the outset of the case the explanation for the delay seems to be simply that thought that it would prevail on the motion to dismiss without any need to further amend.in that,its calculations were wrong.nonetheless,must be bound by the consequences of its litigation strategy.see james watt,cir t he pleadings in this case were drawn as part of a litigating strategy and plaintiffs showed the district court no reason why they should not be bound by the consequences of that strategy.accordingly,motion to amend was properly denied 
next,we turn to challenge to the di
