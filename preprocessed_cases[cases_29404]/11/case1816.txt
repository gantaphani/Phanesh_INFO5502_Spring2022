a default judgment was entered against defendant scott mueller in this action in june of.that judgment became final.some two years later,mueller began negotiations with timothy walton,the judgment creditor,to satisfy the judgment.although mueller contends that they reached an agreement to fully satisfy the judgment by mueller paying walton,walton disputes that such a contract was ever formed.without actually having paid anything,mueller filed a motion to enforce the alleged settlement,purportedly under code of civil procedure section which,under certain conditions,provides for entry of judgment in conformance with a settlement in pending litigation.the trial court denied the motion,finding that no settlement agreement was ever reached.regardless of whether an agreement was reached,we conclude that section does not apply after a judgment has become final in an ordinary civil action because at that point,litigation is no longer pending as expressly contemplated by the statute.we accordingly affirm.
statement of the case 
walton,a lawyer representing himself,initiated this action by filing his complaint for damages and injunctive relief against defendants other than mueller on december.it alleged violations of the consumers legal remedies act,et for a first cause of action and a second claim based on california restrictions on unsolicited commercial advertisers under business and professions code section.the factual basis of the claims was that the defendants had allegedly sent walton numerous unsolicited commercial containing deceptive and false information and advertisements.the complaint was amended twice,among other things adding mueller,a florida resident allegedly doing business as acceleratebiz incorporated,as an individual defendant.mueller was alleged in the operative third amended complaint to have sent walton unsolicited,for each of which walton sought,among other things,in statutory liquidated damages under business and professions code section,subdivision b b ii.
default was entered against mueller on january.a default judgment against him was entered by the court on august,for,supported by walton declaration as to having received the unsolicited commercial from mueller 
two years later,in august,mueller counsel orally proposed to walton that he accept from mueller,payable in three installments over months,in full satisfaction of the judgment.this offer was confirmed by mueller counsel by to walton on august.walton countered that offer on september,by orally proposing that mueller pay him in installments over months.mueller,through counsel,then orally countered the next day with an offer to pay walton in installments over nine months.on october,this offer was communicated to walton by letter,after walton requested that the discussions be reduced to writing.
at that point,walton was simultaneously in the process of executing on the judgment by levy against one of mueller bank accounts,though walton did not apprise mueller counsel of this.but after the bank account was levied,mueller told his lawyer,who wrote to walton on october,demanding that execution efforts cease while they finalize settlement documentation.the letter did not mention the terms of any specific settlement.walton responded by letter dated october,to mueller counsel,stating that he would not cease executing on the judgment,as was his right.the letter also impliedly rejected mueller last settlement offer of payable over nine months and said,am i to understand that you now seek settlement on no conditions other than payment of money if so,and you have no other proposed settlement terms that you wish to include,please send a check in the amount proposed,and we will cease any further proceedings in regard to execution of the judgment.
on october,mueller counsel responded by letter to walton.among other things,he asserted that a binding contract had been reached in settlement of the judgment on the terms relayed in mueller last offer payable over nine months.but,he continued,n otwithstanding that agreement,the attorneys working on your behalf have apparently filed an execution lien against mueller bank account.in view of that action,mueller offers to pay the sum of to settle this litigation.said money to be paid directly to you from the account that is presently subject to the execution lien.obviously,your enforcement efforts preclude him from writing a check against that account at the present time.the offer stated in this letter is without prejudice and with a full reservation of rights to enforce the earlier binding settlement agreement between you and mueller 
on october,walton again wrote to mueller counsel.he denied that a settlement had been reached and stated his position that negotiations had not resulted in the formation of any contract.he further requested mueller counsel to reduce any proposed settlement to a complete written draft of an agreement containing all terms and conditions so that he could fully understand and evaluate it.
on october,on mueller application,the court issued an order to show cause why enforcement of the judgment should not be stayed on account of the alleged settlement agreement composed of payment by mueller to walton of over nine months.but on november,the court denied mueller motion to stay enforcement,specifically finding that the parties did not reach any settlement agreement.
on november,mueller himself wrote to walton,stating,in response to your letter of october,i accept your offer to settle this lawsuit in exchange for a lump sum payment.i hereby tender the settlement payment of.enclosed with the letter was a copy of a cashier check payable to walton,but no actual check.
in response,walton wrote to mueller counsel on december.he stated his position that his october offer to accept a check for in full satisfaction of the judgment had been rejected by mueller counsel letter of october,which had offered to fully satisfy the judgment by payment of directly from mueller bank account that was subject to the execution levy rather than by separate check.this would necessarily have required walton to release the levy before receiving payment.walton then offered to agree to a confidential settlement for.once i have the check for,i will cease enforcement actions.
on january,mueller filed a motion to enforce what he contended was a binding settlement,as evidenced by walton offer of october to accept a check for in full satisfaction of the judgment and mueller letter of november enclosing the copy of a cashier check.the motion was brought under section,on the ground that the parties had agreed to the terms of a settlement in writing.walton opposed the motion,reiterating his contention that no contract had been formed.the court denied the motion from the bench,stating that it did not believe there was a valid settlement agreement entered into.
discussion 
appealability 
there are two issues relating to appealability.
first,is the order appealable ordinarily,an order denying a motion to enforce a settlement in pending litigation under section is not appealable,as judgment has not yet been entered and there are accordingly issues left in the trial court for consideration.doran magan th,d the denial of the motion,rather than finally disposing of the action,expressly leaves it open,viejo bancorp,wood d.viejo bancorp order granting motion is appealable as the intended substance and effect of the judgment is to finally dispose of the action.but here,because the motion concerned an alleged settlement to satisfy a judgment,the motion was necessarily brought after judgment had been entered.apart from the question of the motion propriety at that juncture,its denial nevertheless resulted in an order after judgment that is arguably appealable under section,subdivision a as an order made after an appealable judgment.we will accordingly treat the order denying the section motion as such in these narrow circumstances,particularly because there are no issues left for the trial court consideration,a hallmark of an appealable order or judgment doran magan,supra,th at,d.
the second issue relating to appealability in this case is whether the appeal is premature as no written order was entered denying the motion.the minute order reflecting that the motion was denied was not included in the record but we obtained it from the superior court and have augmented the record on our own motion to include it.the minute order does not provide for or require that a written order be prepared for entry.it is therefore appealable even though it is not a formal,signed order.in re marriage of lechowick th,d unsigned minute order appealable unless it recites that formal order is to be prepared,criticized on another point by nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,fn,d.and for purposes of determining the time for filing a notice of appeal,the minute order was filed or entered on the date it was entered in the permanent.cal.rules of court,rule d strathvale holdings th,d.the order was timely appealed on march.the appeal is therefore not premature and we proceed to the merits.
ii.the trial court properly denied the section motion 
the parties assumed the application of section and focused their briefing on whether or not an enforceable contract was reached.but we question the applicability of section to the circumstances presented here,even if a binding contract was formed 
section makes available a summary procedure by which a trial court may specifically enforce an agreement settling pending litigation without requiring the filing of a second lawsuit or a supplemental pleading in the existing case on which a party may move for summary judgment to enforce a settlement.kirby southern cal.edison th,d kirby,citing weddington productions,flick th,d.the statute provides in pertinent part that i f parties to pending litigation stipulate,in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,for settlement of the case,or part thereof,the court,upon motion,may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
the threshold and dispositive issue presented here is whether section can be applied to enforce an alleged settlement that occurs after a judgment has already become final in a civil action.at that point,is the litigation pending such that section may be applied,particularly when the only remedy made available by the statute is entry of judgment pursuant to the settlement this question involves construction and application of the statute,to which we apply independent review.williams saunders th,d.in doing so,we review the court ruling and not its rationale.davey southern pacific cal,perlin fountain view management,th,d.
our primary task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.because the statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent,we must begin by examining the words of the statute itself citation,giving those words their plain meanings citation.when the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citation.kirby,supra,th at,d.
previous cases analyzing the applicability of section have addressed in other contexts the meaning of the phrase pending litigation.in viejo bancorp,for example,parties to the action had agreed to a settlement of the case,and the action was dismissed.viejo bancorp,supra,d at.after problems implementing the settlement arose,one of the parties then filed a new action.the party then successfully moved in that action under section to enforce the earlier settlement by entry of judgment in the new action pursuant to the settlement of the previously dismissed one.viejo bancorp,at.the court of appeal reversed,holding that a section motion can not be made in a separate action to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of a settlement in a prior action.viejo bancorp,at.in so concluding,the court considered the issue one of subject matter jurisdiction.it observed that b y its very terms,section is limited to settlements reached in pending litigation and that the statute requires an action to be pending when the parties enter into the agreement.id.at.
in kirby,the plaintiff filed a wrongful death action.the defendant asserted in its answer that a settlement had been reached before litigation had even begun.the defendant moved to enforce that settlement under section and the trial court granted the motion,dismissing the action.kirby,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that the summary procedures of section do not apply to a settlement agreement made before litigation was actually pending.the court reasoned that the statutory language refers to settlements by parties to pending litigation who stipulate for settlement of the case and that this language is clear and unambiguous in its requirement that parties be litigants who settle while litigation is pending.id.at,d.the court further observed that the statute legislative history reinforced its requirement that litigation be pending,as the problem the legislature had targeted was that of parties to a settlement reached at a pretrial conference changing their minds after the case had been taken off problem that does not exist outside the context of pending litigation.id.at,d.
in housing group united nat.ins.th,d housing group,parties to an insurance dispute participated in private mediation and reached a settlement.no lawsuit was pending at the time.the parties stipulated to the appointment of a judicial referee or judge pro tem in an attempt to secure that their settlement was enforceable under section.they filed a stipulated petition in the superior court for the appointment of a judge pro tem to preside over the entry of a settlement.housing group,at,d.the court appointed a judge pro tem and the parties recorded a settlement at a hearing before him.one of the parties later moved in the superior court under section to enforce the settlement.the court granted the motion and entered a partial judgment.housing group,at,d.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,despite the parties attempt to confer it by stipulation,because they did not seek the reference in litigation pending before the court.no complaint alleging a dispute had ever been filed,and the section authorizing the reference,section,did not by itself confer subject matter jurisdiction to render the settlement enforceable by the court under section.housing group,at,d.
these three cases all address the pending litigation requirement of the statute by narrowly construing this term on its face,which is a starting point in the construction of the statute.but none of them presents the circumstance in which section was invoked after a judgment had already been entered.in re marriage of armato th,d armato is the only published case to address section application to a postjudgment circumstance.there,the parties marriage was dissolved by a judgment of dissolution that included provisions relating to husband payment of monthly child support.the judgment also provided that the court would retain continuing jurisdiction to effectuate the terms of the judgment and that no separate proceedings would be required in order to do so.armato,at,d.at one point,pursuant to motion,the court modified child support.later,the parties on their own agreed to another modification by which husband would pay higher support and they reduced their agreement to a writing that both of them signed.husband made the higher payments for some time but then reduced his payments to the old amount based on his assertion that due to other circumstances between the parties,he could no longer afford the higher payments.id.at,d.wife brought a motion under section to enforce their written agreement.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that husband and wife were parties to pending litigation as required by the statute inasmuch as there was continuing jurisdiction to modify a support order in a family law case.id.at,d.
faced with the question whether the meaning of pending litigation as used in section applies to child support matters,the court of appeal first noted as important that the judgment in that case itself provided for continuing jurisdiction to
