appellee bae systems information and electronics systems integration,bae alleges that appellant spacekey components,spacekey wrongfully withheld payment for gate array fpga s,which are semiconductor integrated circuits that perform certain logic functions and which are often used in satellites and other space equipment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bae.for the reasons given below,after de novo review,we affirm.
facts background 
bae is a delaware corporation with its corporate office in nashua,new hampshire.bae manufactures and distributes specialized products for use in the defense,security and aerospace industries.spacekey is a virginia corporation with its principal place of business in virginia.
in,bae entered into an agreement with spacekey the consultant agreement under which spacekey agreed to identify buyers for bae products in connecticut,maryland and virginia.the consultant agreement provides that it shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new hampshire.the consultant agreement incorporated by reference bae terms of sale tos,which bae would update periodically over time.in november,bae updated its tos the tos.under the tos,the parties agreed that spacekey only remedies for breach of warranty would be the repair or replacement of nonconforming goods,or the refund of the purchase price at bae option.
in,bae acquired the rights to manufacture and sell a particular fpga known as the,which bae designated to signify bae version of the product.the flight versions of the were intended for use in space and,therefore,required a certain degree of radiation resistance measured in rads.bae warranted that t he offers a total dose radiationhardness in excess of rads si,the standard for a majority of applications the krad specification.
in august,bae provided new terms of sale the tos.the only relevant difference between the tos and the tos is that the available remedies for breach of warranty under the tos included credit,repair and replacement.under the tos,payment was not due until the earlier of thirty days from the date of invoice or upon delivery.
operating under the terms of the consultant agreement,spacekey found customers for fpgas in india and russia to whom spacekey communicated bae warranty.beginning in january,spacekey submitted purchase orders for fpgas,including purchase order c,the order at issue in this case.by may,bae had informed spacekey that the would not meet the krad specification.as bae forewarned,the failed to meet the krad specification some of the goods had a radiation resistance of krad,while others had a radiation resistance of krad.nevertheless,spacekey accepted delivery of the fpgas,and although it asserts that it did so under the assumption that bae would later reduce the price,spacekey was able to resell the goods to its customers.
bae sent spacekey seven invoices arising out of spacekey purchase orders.although spacekey paid some invoices,it refused to pay an outstanding balance of as compensation for accepting nonconforming goods and bae breach of warranty.after spacekey announced its intention to withhold payment,bae terminated the consultant agreement on december,effective january.
bae sued spacekey on august.after bae amended its complaint,seeking multiple declaratory judgments and asserting claims of an account stated,breach of contract,quantum meruit and unjust enrichment,spacekey filed counterclaims on december,asserting claims of breach of contract,misrepresentation,breach of warranty and a violation of the new hampshire consumer protection act.ann.a.whereas bae alleged in part that spacekey was in breach for failing to pay for the goods it had purchased,spacekey alleged,inter alia,that bae improperly terminated the consultant agreement,misrepresented the performance characteristics of the and its delivery schedule and breached its express warranty regarding the performance characteristics of the.
on july,bae moved for summary judgment on spacekey counterclaims for misrepresentation count iii and breach of express warranty count iv,contending that spacekey could not succeed on its counterclaims because it had not pursued its limited remedies under the tos,return of the goods for repair or replacement or for a refund of the purchase price.three weeks later,on july,bae filed a second motion for summary judgment,contending that it was entitled to judgment on its breach of contract claim and claim for an account stated because spacekey had withheld payment on the fpgas and although it was entitled to limited remedies for breach of warranty under the tos,by withholding payment,sought a remedy of either setoff or recoupment,for which the parties had not contracted on october,the district court denied the first motion,ruling that the remedy limitations did not preclude spacekey claims for nonconformity and alleged breach of warranty by bae,and the second motion in relevant part,concluding that if spacekey prevailed on its breach of warranty counterclaim,it could provide a legal excuse to defeat bae breach of contract claim.
on october,bae filed a third motion for summary judgment on counts i and ii of its amended complaint and counts i and ii of spacekey counterclaims,asserting that its termination of the consultant agreement was proper.the district court granted this motion in part,concluding that bae was entitled to summary judgment on counts i and ii of its amended complaint and count i of spacekey counterclaims,but not on count ii of spacekey counterclaims.
in each of these three motions for summary judgment,bae asserted that the tos applied to its purchase orders.in spacekey opposition to bae third motion for summary judgment,spacekey disputed bae initial contention that the tos were applicable,and asserted instead that the tos were applicable.on october,bae filed a motion for leave to file a fourth motion for summary judgment.in this motion,bae acceded to spacekey assertion regarding the tos.in addition,bae argued that because the tos required spacekey to avail itself of the limited remedies for breach of warranty within sixty days,spacekey warranty claims were precluded.
although the district court initially denied bae motion for leave,on january,on the eve of trial,it issued an order to show cause why a proposed judgment in bae favor should not enter on bae breach of contract claim and on spacekey breach of warranty counterclaim.in this order,the district court reasoned that the tos had limited spacekey remedies for breach of warranty to credit,repair or replacement exercised within sixty days of delivery,and although neither repair or replacement were feasible on the undisputed facts,the credit remedy had not failed of its essential purpose under the new hampshire iteration of the uniform commercial code ucc.ann.a.after briefing,the district court granted summary judgment in bae favor on april,and denied spacekey motion for reconsideration on july.this appeal followed.

we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,ayala sepúlveda municipality of san germán,cir,drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant favor,lockridge of me,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mcardle town of dracut,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
spacekey first contends that summary judgment was inappropriate because there is a dispute over which tos governed purchase order c.although bae asserts that the tos apply,spacekey contends that the tos apply.both parties represented to the district court that the tos governed the purchase order until spacekey disputed bae contention that the tos applied,positing that was subject to the august tos revision,in its opposition to bae third motion for summary judgment.in its fourth motion for summary judgment,bae did not take issue with spacekey assertion that the tos applied.in response to the district court show cause order,spacekey did not object to the district court characterization of which tos applied.that is,although spacekey enumerated a number of factual disputes that precluded entry of judgment in bae favor in its response to the show cause order,spacekey did not dispute the district court agreement with spacekey position that the tos applied to the transaction at issue here,nor did it dispute the same in its motion for reconsideration.accordingly,there was never any genuine dispute of material fact over which tos applied to purchase order c.
spacekey argues that bae representations throughout the litigation that the tos applied to c should bar bae contrary position on appeal.but spacekey does not dispute that bae revised the terms of sale in august.notwithstanding spacekey attempt to decline bae concession and attribute to it a position it no longer holds,there is simply no dispute as to applied.
even if there were a colorable dispute over which terms of sale governed purchase order c,spacekey would have waived this argument on appeal.it is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court can not be surfaced for the first time on appeal.mccoy.inst.of,cir.although it is true that spacekey,like bae,assumed that the tos applied to purchase order c until spacekey asserted the applicability of the tos during the litigation below,there is nothing in the record to suggest that,once the later terms of sale were introduced,spacekey ever asserted that the earlier tos applied.accordingly,it can not even be said that spacekey mention ed a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.harriman hancock,cir citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
having resolved that the tos governs,the heart of this dispute is whether the limited remedies for breach of warranty outlined in the tos fail ed of their essential purpose under ucc.the ucc,including as adopted by new hampshire,permits parties to commercial transactions to modify or limit the remedies available for breach of warranty.xerox hawkes,citing.ann.a.however,where the remedy fails of its essential purpose,the aggrieved party may seek relief as provided in this chapter,ucc,meaning that if in any case,the aggrieved party can not as a practical matter avail itself of the benefit of the enumerated remedy,it is entitled to the full array of remedies provided by the ucc.figgie,destilería serralés,cir here,the tos limited spacekey remedies for breach of bae warranty that the fpgas would conform to their published specifications to return for credit,repair or replacement at bae systems sole option.yet it is undisputed that spacekey preemptively withheld payment in response to bae alleged breach of warranty.that is,spacekey appeared to claim damages under either ucc or,remedies outside the tos.the parties dispute whether this remedy should be considered or recoupment.whatever the appropriate terminology,it is apparent that it was spacekey intent to claim a remedy outside the scope of the tos.accordingly,unless the enumerated limited remedies in the failed of their essential purpose,spacekey was in breach.
as the district court stated,p lainly,the essential purpose of a repair or replacement remedy is to put conforming goods in the hands of the buyer.a repair remedy fails of its essential purpose when the seller is unwilling or unable to repair the defective goods within a reasonable period of time.the parties assume,as the district court did,that both repair and replacement were impracticable as bae was not in a position to provide spacekey with conforming goods.our review thus focuses on whether the credit remedy failed of its essential purpose.
our inquiry into whether a remedy has failed of its essential purpose takes place in two steps first we must identify the essential purpose of the limited remedy,and second,we must determine whether the remedy in fact failed to accomplish such purpose.cooley big horn harvestore,citing milgard tempering,selas,cir chatlos,cash register,cir in determining whether remedies fail of their essential purpose,courts also consider whether the circumstances of the transaction,including the seller breach,cause the limitation to be inconsistent with the intent and reasonable commercial expectations of the parties.kearney trecker master engraving.
bae argues that,under these circumstances,the credit remedy operated as a refund.bae points to the payment terms of the tos,which provided that spacekey was not obligated to pay until thirty days from the date of invoice or upon delivery and posits that spacekey knew of the of the prior to either operative date.accordingly,bae argues,spacekey could have invoked the credit remedy before it even paid,rendering the credit,for all intents and purposes,a refund.indeed,the district court devoted pages of its opinion to an explanation of why the refund remedy did not fail of its essential purpose,rather than focusing exclusively on cases that discussed only credits.ultimately,recognizing that under many circumstances,credits will not operate as refunds,we need not reach the issue of whether the credit remedy operated as a refund here.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that there are other bases to affirm the district court determination that the credit remedy did not fail of its essential purpose.
spacekey argues that the limited remedies did fail,because the purpose of a credit remedy is not to give the aggrieved party the value of the bargain,but rather to provide the buyer with conforming goods,the benefit of the bargain.its principal support for this principle of law is eng g cincinnati milacron mktg,cir unpublished,which states that 
the essential purpose of a refund remedy does not differ from the essential purpose of a remedy that provides for either refund or replacement.both are intended to ensure that the buyer will receive a conforming product within a reasonable time,whether the seller repairs the nonconforming product,replaces it,or refunds the purchase price so that the buyer can obtain a conforming product elsewhere.
id.at,a refund case,clearly does not apply to this case,in which the contract provided no refund remedy for the type of breach at issue.rather,the subject of our inquiry here is a credit remedy,the purpose of which can not have been to enable the purchase of conforming goods elsewhere.that the parties knew that conforming goods did not even exist elsewhere makes acutely clear the conclusion that they could not have shared an expectation that the remedy would enable spacekey to procure such goods if bae could not supply them.rather,the parties clear expectation,as made manifest in their contract,was that spacekey could return the goods within a limited period of time and claim a credit,or could keep the goods and pay,receiving the value of the bargain that those options did not provide for spacekey the full range of remedies that might otherwise have been available is simply the result of the fact that commercial parties retain the freedom to limit by agreement their available remedies in the event of a breach.see james white and robert summers,uniform commercial code,ed.
spacekey argues that the limited remedies did fail because it did not foresee that bae would produce goods that were usable and functional,albeit at a reduced level of.but the tos explicitly provided for limited remedies in the event that bae delivered goods,and spacekey offers no reason why the details of the fpgas nonconformance cause bae breach to fall outside that agreement.moreover,to the extent that spacekey argument relies on an assertion that its choice about whether to keep the fpgas was made more difficult by the fact that they were not entirely unsuited to the purpose for which they were intended,we fail to see why spacekey should stand in a stronger position than the one in which it would have found itself had the delivered items been less useful 
moreover,we note that this is not a case where spacekey was without options.spacekey could have returned the items and sought a credit,as the tos prescribed.had spacekey complied with the procedure for obtaining a remedy,a court evaluating a later dispute would likely have found itself in a position to consider whether that remedy had been
