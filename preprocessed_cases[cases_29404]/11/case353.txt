background 
i.the parties 
this appeal arises out of the bankruptcy of three limited partnerships formed to facilitate the development of nob hill ridge,a unit rental housing complex located in elmsford,new york.nob hill ridge was developed in three i,ii,and iii.at the time in which the events relevant to this appeal occurred,each section was owned by one of the partnership debtors,and each of the debtors was owned and controlled by the same bruschi,david peipers,henry reiter,and the late albert myers.the partnerships that owned and developed nob hill ridge were elm ridge associates era,which developed section i,elm ridge associates ii,which developed section ii,and,which developed section iii.
was a contractor on the nob hill ridge project,supplying housing for sections ii and iii.on section iii,the portion at issue in this appeal,contract price for manufacturing,delivering,and erecting and twenty modular housing units was,of which has been paid all but.on april,filed a mechanic lien in the amount of the unpaid balance in the office of the westchester county clerk.
nebf is the jointly managed pension fund of the international brotherhood of electrical workers and the national electrical contractors association.nebf financed the entire nob hill project,lending about million to,virtually all of which remains unpaid.nebf filed a claim in the bankruptcy for,representing principal,interest,fees,and expenses owed to it by.
purchased most of the section iii real estate from cross westchester development corporation cross westchester,and a smaller portion from herb and lucette besson.entered into a written contract with cross westchester on december,and fee title passed to on or about february.
the entire nob hill ridge complex is located on one site.thus,sections i,ii,and iii share certain essential infrastructure.at some time during,the developers of sections ii and iii concluded that certain basic structural work should be completed on the section iii site,even though had not yet taken title to the site.this work,the common site work,included basic earthwork,including clearing and grubbing,rock excavation,and rough grading retaining wall work street widening and the creation of sidewalks and curbs the installation of a water supply system connecting the water main to the municipal water supply installing fire hydrants and valves creating storm water management systems installing a sanitary sewer system and installing the mains,cables,and wiring necessary for gas,electric,telephone,and cable television service.because the section iii construction loan was not yet in place,the developers decided that would pay for portion of the common site work,and that would reimburse when it received the proceeds of the section iii construction loan.and entered into a separate written agreement with respect to reimbursement for this infrastructure work.
ii.the loan and related filings 
on or about february,days after took title to the and nebf entered into a building loan contract,pursuant to which nebf agreed to loan to an amount not to exceed for use in the construction of section iii in connection with this loan,and nebf executed a building loan contract that included two statements required by the new york lien law and intended to establish nebf priority over subsequent creditors.first,in accordance with the requirements of new york lien law paragraph of the building loan contract states that will hold the advances it receives or has a right to receive as a trust fund for the purpose of acquiring the real estate and paying the costs of construction of the improvements.it further provides that the funds will be applied to those purposes ahead of all other purposes.
at the same time that it filed the building loan contract and recorded its mortgage,nebf filed an affidavit sworn to by henry reiter,the manager of the corporation that was the general partner of.reiter affidavit was filed for the purpose of complying with new york lien law.that provision requires that the parties to a building loan contract file a certified statement setting forth,inter alia,the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement in the clerk office in the county in which the property is located.lien law.the section affidavit filed in connection with the section iii construction loan states that the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement is.
the loan closed on february.at the closing of the loan,nebf advanced to for the project.the advance included to reimburse for the common site work,million for land acquisition,and approximately for title fees,legal fees,and other costs.immediately after the closing,nebf perfected its security interest in section iii by filing the building loan contract and recording the mortgage in the westchester county clerk office.
in december of,nebf increased its loan commitment to by an additional,raising the total amount available under the loan to million.in connection with the increased loan commitment,another section affidavit was filed in the westchester county clerk office stating that an additional was available to the borrower for the improvement.thus,the two affidavits together stated that the total sum available to the borrower for the improvement was.
iii.the bankruptcy court proceedings 
on may,commenced an adversary proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.complaint asserted that its mechanic lien was entitled to priority over nebf mortgage lien for three reasons averred that henry reiter section affidavit misstated his title as manager of the corporate general partner of,rather than of argued that a portion of the loan proceeds received from nebf for section iii were utilized for section ii and that this fact warranted subordination of nebf lien and asserted that nebf lien should be subordinated to its own under principles of equitable subordination.
after rejecting misidentification of the borrower argument at a hearing on march,the bankruptcy court rendered its decision on the other issues on may.at the outset of its opinion,the bankruptcy court noted that the sole issue for determination was whether the section lien law affidavit correctly stated the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement,and if not,the legal consequence of such failure.i,at.the bankruptcy court further observed that this issue depends solely on the question whether the reimbursement of can be deemed part of the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement.id.
on that issue,the bankruptcy court concluded that the money expended on the reimbursement was not available to the borrower for the improvement.see id.at.specifically,the court ruled that because the money spent on the common site work did not fit the statutory definition of the term cost of improvement,as set forth in section of the lien law,payment to,although labeled a reimbursement,was actually part of the purchase price paid for the land.id.the bankruptcy court then subtracted the reimbursement from the aggregate amount made available for the improvement,arriving at a figure of approximately million see id.at.because this amount was about million less than the million claimed in the two section affidavits,the bankruptcy court ruled that those affidavits were materially false.see id.
next,the bankruptcy court concluded that nebf had knowingly filed a materially false statement when it filed the first section affidavit.see id.at.according to the bankruptcy court,nebf was aware when it filed the statement of both the agreement to make the reimbursement and that approximately million of its section iii loan was used to make that reimbursement.see id.in the bankruptcy court view,this was sufficient to put nebf on notice of what it had already determined to be the material defect in the initial section affidavit.id.
finally,the bankruptcy court ruled that reliance or upon nebf section affidavit was irrelevant to the issue of whether its mechanic lien would be deemed superior to nebf previously filed mortgage lien.see id.at.the bankruptcy court therefore subordinated nebf mortgage lien to lien.see id.additionally,after a telephone conference with the parties,the bankruptcy court fixed the value of mechanic lien at,plus interest and costs.because the court held that lien was superior to nebf pursuant to lien law,the court did not address equitable subordination argument.
iv.the district court decision 
the district court reversed the bankruptcy court judgment and held that nebf rightfully included the reimbursement as part of the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement under section.see ii,at.for the district court,this case presented the same issue identified by the bankruptcy court whether the approximately million reimbursement should be viewed as part of the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement under section.see id.the district court determination on that issue was informed by its reading of lien law,which defines the term improvement for lien law purposes.see id.at.section defines improvement to include the demolition,erection,alteration or repair of any structure upon,connected with,or beneath the surface of,any real property and any work done upon such property or materials furnished for its permanent improvement.lien law.noting that the common site the reimbursement paid the grading of the site and the building of such amenities as roads,sewer connections,stormwater management systems and utilities,the court found that the reimbursement f e ll within section definition.ii,at.accordingly,the court held that the approximately million reimbursement was correctly included as part of the funds available for the improvement in the section affidavit.see id.at.
the bankruptcy court decision,on the other hand,rested in large part on its view that lien law,which defines c ost of improvement,was the proper source of guidance for determining what constitutes the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement under section.see i,at.the district court found the bankruptcy court reliance on section to be misplaced.because s ection quite explicitly uses the term improvement,not cost of improvement,the court stated that whether the building loan contract complies with s ection is irrelevant to the relative priority of and nebf loans.see ii,at.with respect to claim of equitable subordination,the district court held that the statutory remedy of section was the only basis upon which subordination could be obtained,and therefore that the doctrine of equitable subordination was inapplicable to case see id.at.this appeal followed the entry of the district court judgment reversing the judgment of the bankruptcy court.
discussion 
in this diversity action,we must determine whether,under new york lien law,a borrower affidavit that includes in the statement of the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement amounts used by the borrower to reimburse another for work that was completed prior to the procurement of the construction loan is rendered materially false by that inclusion.we review the district court determination of this state law issue de novo.see maska,kansa ins,cir.in determining the new york law on this issue,we look to the provisions of the lien law itself as well as new york case law.see state of new york blank,cir.where the law of the state is uncertain or ambiguous,the job of the federal courts is carefully to predict how the highest court of the state would resolve the uncertainty or ambiguity.id.quoting travelers ins.third,cir alteration in original.in so doing,the decisions of the new york court of appeals are of the utmost importance to us.see id.but where there is no decision by the new york court of appeals then we must apply what we find to be new york law after giving proper regard to relevant rulings of other new york courts.id.quoting commissioner of internal revenue estate of bosch,d internal quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,argues that the district court ruling that nebf mortgage lien was superior to mechanic lien was in error for two reasons.first,contends that allowing borrowers to include amounts used to reimburse contractors and others for work completed prior to the procurement of a construction loan by the borrower is contrary to the legislative intent underlying lien law.alternatively,argues that section must be read in tandem with section,and that the two provisions taken together require that when the proceeds of a construction loan are to be used by a borrower to reimburse another for work completed prior to the construction loan,that work must be specifically outlined in the building loan contract.
i.the effect of including funds used to pay costs incurred prior to procuring a construction loan in the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement 
section of the new york lien law requires that all building loan contracts contain a true statement under oath,verified by the borrower showing,inter alia,the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement.lien law.if the statement is not filed,section states that the interest of each party to the building loan contract in the real property affected thereby,is subject to the lien and claim of a person who shall thereafter file a notice of lien under this chapter.id.thus,the statute express terms require that a lender that fails to file an affidavit suffers a loss of priority.in addition,the new york court of appeals has held that a lender lien may also be subordinated if the lender knowingly files a materially false statement.nanuet bank eckerson terrace.while loss of priority in this circumstance is not compelled by the literal terms of section,the nanuet court based its holding on the legislative intent underlying the provision.on the issue of legislative intent,the court explained that the section affidavit requirement exists to readily enable a contractor to learn exactly what sum the loan in fact made available to the owner of the real estate for the project.id.at.consistent with this overriding legislative objective,the court held that a lender interest should be subject to the subordination penalty if it knowingly files a materially false statement.id.at.
here,argues that for the new york legislature intent to be completely effectuated,we must find that a section affidavit is materially false when there is included in the statement of sums available to the borrower funds used as reimbursement for work completed prior to the construction loan.contends that a holding in favor of nebf would be contrary to the legislative intent underlying section and the rationale of the new york court of appeals in nanuet because the approximately million that went
