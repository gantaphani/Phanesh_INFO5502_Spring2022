mariam maronyan brought suit against toyota motor sales,when the new car that she leased developed mechanical problems during the warranty period and toyota failed to repair them to her satisfaction.in addition to several california state law claims,she alleged breach of warranty under the magnuson moss warranty act mmwa.the district court granted toyota motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that maronyan did not before filing suit in civil court pursue her claims through the california dispute settlement program cdsp that toyota maintained and specified in its warranty.
maronyan appeals.she argues that her failure initially to resort to the cdsp provides toyota an affirmative defense to her warranty claims under the mmwa,but does not defeat subject matter jurisdiction.we review de novo whether the district court properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.bnsf ry,cir.neither party disputes that a of the mmwa imposes a requirement on prospective consumer claimants seeking recovery in court.the mmwa provides that if 
a a warrantor establishes a dispute settlement procedure,
b such procedure,and its implementation meets the requirements of the ftc rules under paragraph,and 
c he incorporates in a written warranty a requirement that the consumer resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedy under this section respecting such warranty,
then the consumer may not commence a civil action other than a class action under subsection d of this section unless he initially resorts to such procedure 
a.the only question before us is whether maronyan failure to comply with the mmwa requirement that a consumer resort to an informal dispute settlement procedure before filing a civil action deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.we hold that it does not.
most exhaustion requirements established by congress do not result in a loss of subject matter jurisdiction.see pension fund benefit plan stockton tri,only when congress states in clear,unequivocal terms that the judiciary is barred from hearing an action until the administrative agency has come to a decision has the supreme court held that exhaustion is a jurisdictional prerequisite.rather,statutorily created exhaustion requirements ordinarily constitute prudential affirmative defenses that may be defeated by compelling reasons for failure to exhaust.see weinberger salfi,distinguishing prudential exhaustion,a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion,from jurisdictional exhaustion which requires sweeping and direct language which states that no action shall be brought under the statute at issue,not merely that only those actions shall be brought in which administrative remedies have been exhausted.
a consumer failure to exhaust an administrative or other remedy deprives federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction only in those cases in which congress makes plain the jurisdictional character of the exhaustion requirement in question.consistent with the supreme court guidance in weinberger,we have rarely found exhaustion statutes to be a jurisdictional bar.mcbride cotton and cattle veneman,cir.f ailure to exhaust does not deprive a federal court of jurisdiction when the exhaustion statute is merely a codification of the exhaustion requirement,unless congress uses sweeping and direct language that goes beyond a requirement that only exhausted claims be brought.id.at quoting weinberger,at.
that a failure to satisfy a statutory prerequisite to filing suit deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction only when congress provides a sweeping and direct jurisdictional mandate helps to explain why none of the cases on which toyota relies concludes that the statutory provision at issue operates as a jurisdictional bar.see reed elsevier muchnick.holding that a copyright holder failure to comply with a registration requirement does not restrict a federal court jurisdiction over copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works arbaugh y h,holding that title vii requirement,which requires potential defendants to maintain at least fifteen employees,does not limit a court jurisdiction kontrick ryan,holding that a bankruptcy rule that allows a creditor sixty days to object to a debtor discharge was not a jurisdictional bar to considering an untimely objection mcbride,at holding that the exhaustion requirement of e is not jurisdictional.
most recently,the supreme court in henderson shinseki,unanimously held that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the veterans court was not jurisdictional because congress,in enacting the statute,did not mandate that it was.id.at.the court explained 
because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic,we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.other rules,even if important and mandatory,we have said,should not be given the jurisdictional brand under arbaugh,we look to see if there is any clear indication that congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional.
id.at citations omitted.arbaugh emphasized that filing requirements restrict a court subject matter jurisdiction only i f the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional.at emphasis added.in an explanatory footnote immediately following this passage,the court noted that congress has exercised its prerogative to restrict the jurisdiction of federal district courts based on a wide variety of factors,and lists a number of jurisdictional criteria,such as restrictions on the classes of plaintiffs empowered to bring a civil action or defendants potentially subject to liability.none of these considerations resembles the mmwa requirement that a plaintiff exhaust remedies before bringing an action.id.at.
the court has chastised lower courts for their overly zealous application of the term jurisdictional to what are accurately understood as rules or elements of a plaintiff claim.reed elsevier.at.a unanimous court in arbaugh restated the necessity of a clear congressional mandate to elevate a statutory requirement to a jurisdictional prerequisite,emphasizing that i f the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.at.although the court has acknowledged that congress is free to attach the jurisdictional label to a rule that the courts would prefer to call a rule,henderson.at,it has cautioned lower courts to refrain from capriciously assigning the jurisdictional label when congress has failed to clearly provide the requisite mandate,see reed elsevier.at cautioning courts against engaging in jurisdictional rulings.
the mmwa requirement that a consumer may not commence a civil action unless he initially resorts to an informal dispute settlement procedure,a,is similar in all material respects to the requirements in two other statutes that we have examined previously in both cases,we held that the exhaustion requirements do not deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.first,in rumbles hill,cir,we reviewed the exhaustion requirement of a 
no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
we held that the exhaustion of remedies under a was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit under.see rumbles,at second,in mcbride,we held that a failure to comply with e requirement that a person shall exhaust all administrative appeal procedures established by the secretary or required by law before the person may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction,did not result in loss of subject matter jurisdiction.we held,rather,that the provision constituted merely a codification of the exhaustion requirement.at for the same reason that we held in mcbride and rumbles that the virtually identical exhaustion requirements of e and a were not jurisdictional in character,we hold that a does not strip the district court of subject matter jurisdiction in the case before us.
toyota urges us to conclude that congress has clearly mandated that the mmwa exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional based on its aggregation of three scattered pieces of ambiguous and indirect statutory language.toyota apparently perceives a clear mandate in a later subsection of the mmwa whose provisions are made subject to subsection a and includes jurisdiction as one among several other subheading labels the same later subsection,which merely refers to and by no means incorporates the exhaustion requirement in a,and states that any court of competent jurisdiction may hear mmwa claims and that same subsection which identifies the class of cases that fall within courts adjudicatory authority under the mmwa.no serious analysis is required to explain why such obscure references to jurisdiction elsewhere in the statute do not constitute the kind of sweeping and direct language necessary,weinberger,u.at,to demonstrate that congress clearly state d,arbaugh,at,its intention to mandate that a consumer failure to comply with a exhaustion requirement deprives the district court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear his warranty claims.henderson.at.
to the contrary,the statute plain language reflects that its provision for the use of dispute settlement procedures before filing suit is not a jurisdictional bar but rather a prudential exhaustion requirement.neither a nor a even mentions subject matter jurisdiction.elsewhere,the statute prompts warrantors to include i nformation respecting the availability of any informal dispute settlement procedure and a recital that the purchaser may be required to resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedies in the courts.a.moreover,the agency to which congress expressly delegated authority to interpret the mmwa explained shortly after its enactment that it seeks to ensure that the consumer is not deceived into believing that prior resort to the mechanism is required in all instances.ftc rules,regulations,statements,interpretations under magnuson moss warranty act,codified at.none of these subsections mention jurisdiction or otherwise speak in jurisdictional terms.arbaugh,at quoting zipes trans world airlines.while they do employ mandatory language,the court has repeatedly held that a statutory condition that requires a party to take some action before filing a lawsuit is not automatically a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.reed elsevier.at quoting zipes,at.see also henderson.at arbaugh at.in light of the supreme court current and continuing precedent,we can not accept toyota argument that the statutory language used to establish mmwa exhaustion requirement evinces a clear congressional mandate to bestow jurisdictional status on a prerequisite that is properly deemed an affirmative defense.
to summarize,the mmwa exhaustion requirement does not use sweeping and direct language demonstrating clear congressional intent to mandate loss of subject matter jurisdiction.nor does toyota rely on a single case in which a court dismissed an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of a plaintiff failure to exhaust a statutory prerequisite to filing suit.in the only two cases in which we have considered statutory provisions similar to the mmwa exhaustion requirement,we held that a failure to exhaust requirements does not strip a district court of its subject matter jurisdiction,a conclusion almost unanimously approved by the other circuits.supra at nn.
for the reasons explained above,we hold that a prerequisite that a consumer may not commence a civil action unless he initially resorts to an informal dispute settlement procedure is merely a codification of the mmwa exhaustion requirement and does not operate as a jurisdictional bar.accordingly,we reverse and remand so that the district court may consider,in light of this opinion,how to proceed with the instant action,including the issues 
reversed and remanded for further proceedings in light of this opinion.
the supreme court recently explained in henderson ex.rel.henderson shinseki that congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a n exhaustion rule that we would prefer to call a rule,emphasis added.because congress incorporated the exhaustion requirement of the magnuson moss warranty act,et mmwa into the statute provisions,we must defer to congress treatment of this provision as jurisdictional.see henderson.at.therefore,i must dissent from the majority conclusion that the mmwa exhaustion provision is merely procedural.
additionally,the majority errs in declining to address a critical question of law properly raised on appeal whether courts rather than the federal trade commission should decide challenges to a mechanism compliance with federal regulations.under the mmwa,courts no longer have authority to decide compliance issues,because congress vested authority to decide those issues in the first instance with the ftc.on the other hand,even if the judiciary retained authority to address these issues,courts should defer to the ftc unique expertise in mechanism compliance under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.
mechanism exhaustion under the mmwa is a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing suit 
judicial interpretation of the mmwa begins with the plain language of the statute.if the text of the statute is clear,this court looks no further in determining the statute meaning.k n eng g,bulat,cir citation omitted.the key question in this case is whether congress mandated that the exhaustion provision be jurisdictional.henderson.at.emphasis added.the henderson court reiterated the readily administrable bright line test from arbaugh y h for deciding such questions we look to see if there is any clear indication that congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional.at quoting arbaugh.to indicate such a preference,congress can speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district court.id.at quoting zipes trans world airlines,accord arbaugh,at.congress,of course,need not use magic words in order to speak clearly on this point.henderson.at.the analysis might also turn on the legal character of the requirement,which we discern by looking to the condition text,context,and relevant historical treatment.reed elsevier,muchnick,citations omitted see kontrick ryan,l itigants should use the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.emphasis added.
section d of the mmwa ties mechanism exhaustion to the jurisdiction of the courts by expressly incorporating a 
d civil action by consumer for damages,jurisdiction recovery of costs and expenses cognizable claims 
subject to the exhaustion requirement in a of this section,a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter,or under a written warranty,implied warranty,or service contract,may bring suit for damages and other legal and equitable relief 
a in any court of competent jurisdiction in any state or the district of columbia or 
b in an appropriate district court of the united states,subject to paragraph of this subsection.
d emphasis added.there is no doubt that section d is a provision,because the subsection heading includes the label jurisdiction,d it speaks in jurisdictional terms by specifying which courts may hear mmwa claims,arbaugh,at and it identifies the classes of cases that fall within courts adjudicatory authority under the mmwa,see kontrick,at.therefore,because congress incorporated a exhaustion requirement into the jurisdictional provisions of d,the exhaustion provision must be treated as jurisdictional 
the majority correctly notes that the mmwa exhaustion provision providing that a consumer may not commence a civil action unless he initially resorts to an informal dispute settlement procedure,a is not,standing alone,jurisdictional in character.op.at.however,the majority ignores the fact that toyota never made this argument,and the district court,therefore,did not address it.instead,toyota argued that congress imbued a with jurisdictional character by incorporating the exhaustion provision into a clearly of the statute.the majority dismisses this argument as requiring n o serious analysis,because the incorporation is not sufficiently sweeping and direct to convey an intent to tie exhaustion to jurisdiction.op.at.one can reach this conclusion only by ignoring the supreme court most recently elucidated indicia of congressional intent speak ing in jurisdictional terms,or refer ring in any way to the jurisdiction of the courts.henderson.at quoting zipes,at.nowhere in its opinion does the majority employ this readily administrable bright line rule id.at quoting arbaugh,at.when this standard is applied,it becomes clear that incorporating the exhaustion requirement into a subsection that both speaks in jurisdictional terms and refer s in some way to the jurisdiction of the courts,conveys an intent to tie exhaustion to jurisdiction.
in sum,congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label at its discretion,even in cases where we would prefer to call the provision a rule.id.this attachment need not be consistent with other statutes.our inquiry simply turns on whether congress has tied jurisdiction to the exhaustion requirement in this case,it clearly has.i would therefore affirm on this issue and hold that the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider maronyan claims until she exhausts toyota mechanism.
ii.the federal trade commission must decide challenges to a mechanism regulatory compliance 
regardless whether toyota dispute settlement program is a jurisdictional or procedural prerequisite to filing suit,maronyan contends she was not required to exhaust the program.she argued to the district court that toyota program does not qualify as a mechanism pursuant to certain mmwa and ftc regulations and courts,rather than the ftc,should determine a mechanism regulatory compliance before making exhaustion a prerequisite to filing suit.toyota argued to the district court that state and federal agencies have authority to assess mechanism compliance,agency decisions should be conclusive,and litigating mechanism compliance in every instance will produce inconsistent results.the district court granted toyota summary judgment on the assumption that courts have authority to review a mechanism compliance with federal regulations and toyota program was,in fact,sufficiently compliant to require exhaustion.although the issues of a court authority to decide mechanism compliance and the propriety of making such decisions were properly raised on appeal,the majority opinion curiously declined to address them.because i believe these questions of law should have been answered by our court,i address each in turn below.
courts no longer have authority under the mmwa to review mechanism compliance 
the text and structure of the mmwa reveal that the ftc should determine a mechanism compliance with federal law in the first instance.the statute assigns several clear responsibilities to the ftc establish the minimum requirements for mechanisms,id.a on its own initiative,it may review mechanism operations for compliance,id.a upon written complaint,it must review mechanism operations for compliance,and it may take appropriate remedial action against programs,id the role of the courts apparent from the text of the statute is simply to invalidate any procedure that is unfair until the ftc adopts its own certification regulations.a.maronyan argues that,because mechanisms operate as s to pursuing a legal remedy under a b,the mmwa impliedly authorizes courts to determine whether mechanisms comply with ftc regulations when consumers bring claims under the statute.she supports this argument with an excerpt from a senate conference report stating 
this is not intended to exclude the courts from reviewing the fairness,and compliance with ftc rules,of such procedures even where the ftc has not acted to disapprove them.in this connection the conferees recognize the limited resources of the commission and the fact that its other responsibilities may preclude it from acting in some cases where private dispute settlement procedures may not comply with the legislation or the commission rules thereunder.accordingly,the courts would be free to determine that a given dispute settlement procedure need not be exhausted because it was not fair,had no provision for governmental or consumer participation,or did not comply with ftc rules.

this legislative history is not persuasive.as the supreme court observed in puerto rico department of consumer affairs isla petroleum,courts never search for congressional intent in a vacuum,unrelated to the giving of meaning to an enacted statutory text u nenacted approvals,beliefs,and desires are not laws.a legislative report may simply be precatory where the actual text of the statute does not support the language of the report.sec y of the interior california.thus,legislative history is only persuasive to the extent it finds textual support in the statute.shannon united states,the court will not give authoritative weight to a single passage of legislative history that is in no way anchored in the text of the statute isla petroleum,at.
here,the statute identifies one instance in which courts should play a role in the mechanism qualification process invalidat ing any such procedure if it finds that such procedure is unfair,but only until ftc rules take effect.a emphasis added.because the ftc adopted rules in,see promulgation of rule,courts no longer have statutory authority to decide a procedure fairness or compliance with ftc rules.if congress intended courts to continue playing this role,it should have omitted the limiting qualification until ftc rules take effect,or included similar authorizing language elsewhere in the statute,such as a or.thus,the intent of the senate report authors that courts continue playing a role in the review of mechanism compliance did not bear out in the statutory language ultimately approved by congress.
instead,congress vested the ftc with authority to promulgate rules,monitor mechanism compliance,and take remedial action against programs.id.a.significantly,congress also established the process by which consumers should challenge the compliance of a mechanism the commission upon written complaint filed by any interested person shall review the bona fide operation of any mechanism for compliance with ftc rules.id.a.as this provision suggests,the proper way to challenge a mechanism compliance with federal regulations is to lodge a written complaint with the ftc.see wolf ford motor,cir t he mmwa mandate that the ftc prescribe minimum requirements for such mechanisms,evince a congressional intent to reserve to the federal regulatory body the authority to supervise whether the mechanisms are created and operated fairly.id.at a ny attack on the fairness or legitimacy of a dispute settlement mechanism must be through administrative channels.see also harrison nissan motor,cir stating in dicta that whether the bbb auto line mechanism is in compliance with the ftc regulations is for the ftc,and not this court,to decide.
maronyan also claims the ftc renounced this role in an action statement,suggesting mechanism compliance is an issue for litigation.see interpretations of magnuson moss warranty act,fed.trade comm.this is inaccurate.in that action,the ftc declined auto manufacturers request to establish a national prior approval certification program that would determine mechanism compliance with rule before mechanisms became effective and preempt certain state certification standards.id.at.the manufacturers suggested a federal certification program would eliminate the uncertainty of conflicting state certification standards diminish the risk of litigation over a mechanism compliance with federal rules and encourage more warrantors to establish mechanisms by diminishing the cost of compliance with unified standards for mechanism certification.id.at.the commission recognize
