background 
farm credit is an instrumentality of the united states pursuant to the farm credit act and has its principal office located in omaha,nebraska.american is a financial institution incorporated in iowa with its principal place of business in sioux center,iowa.wayne kooistra maintained accounts at both american and farm credit,through which he perpetrated an elaborate scheme.kooistra use of his accounts resulted in the liability that is the subject of this litigation.
farm credit extended kooistra,and entities owned and controlled by kooistra,a line of credit to finance his cattle business.kooistra accessed this line of credit through the use of drafts which were drawn on farm credit and payable through wells fargo.to secure this line of credit,farm credit maintained a security interest in the cattle and the proceeds from the sale of the cattle.
kooistra also maintained a checking account in his name at american.this account was used as a clearing account in connection with funds advanced from farm credit.kooistra deposited farm credit drafts representing advances from his line of credit into his checking account at american and then issued checks from his american account to purchase cattle and other assets subject to farm credit security interest when kooistra would sell cattle or other interests subject to farm credit security interest,proceeds from the sale would first be deposited into kooistra account at american.
on august through august,drafts executed by kooistra,drawn on farm credit and wells fargo,were deposited by kooistra into his american checking account.the drafts at issue total over six million dollars.kooistra deposited the drafts with american on august,and.the daily total for the seven drafts drawn on august was the daily total for the eight drafts drawn on august was and the daily total for the eight drafts drawn on august was.american forwarded the drafts to wells fargo,and wells fargo received the drafts on august,and,respectively.wells fargo forwarded the drafts to farm credit,and farm credit received the drafts on august,and,respectively.farm credit sent the drafts back,en masse,to wells fargo,and wells fargo received them on august.in turn,wells fargo sent the drafts back en masse to american on august.therefore,american had notice of the return from wells fargo on august.this was five,four,and three business days after wells fargo had first received the drafts on august,and.american returned the drafts to farm credit alleging a late return of the items.
farm credit filed suit against american asserting three causes of action.first,farm credit claimed american made a wrongful claim of late return.second,farm credit alleged conversion against american for the wrongful claim of late return.finally,farm credit claimed american was unjustly enriched from the wrongful claim of late return.american moved to dismiss the complaint on separate grounds.american argued the complaint was barred by regulation cc,part,because wells fargo notice of nonpayment to american did not comply with the time requirements of the regulation.in addition,american claimed the complaint was barred by the uniform commercial code.farm credit opposed the motion to dismiss and argued that compliance with the deadlines was sufficient,that regulation cc is optional,and that it had the right to make provisional settlements either as a bank or a drawee.
the district court held that farm credit had no basis for a wrongful claim of late return action against american because wells fargo did not provide timely notice of nonpayment to american as required by the deadline imposed by a.in addition,the district court rejected farm credit argument that compliance with regulation cc was optional and that compliance with the midnight deadline was sufficient.

the three institutions involved in kooistra scheme each executed a different role,and thus had different duties under the regulations.american was the depositary bank,that is,the bank which received the deposits.farm credit is the drawee,from which kooistra accessed a ready line of credit.as the drawee,farm credit made the ultimate decision whether to honor the drafts wells fargo,the bank,was the paying bank for purposes of regulation cc.see z paying bank means the bank through which a check is payable and to which it is sent for payment or collection,if the check is not payable by a bank.the rationale behind this treatment is to speed the return of checks that are a bank to the depositary bank

if a paying bank determines not to pay a check in the amount of or more,it shall provide notice of nonpayment such that the notice is received by the depositary bank by local time on the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank.if the day the paying bank is required to provide notice is not a banking day for the depositary bank,receipt of notice on the depositary bank next banking day constitutes timely notice.notice may be provided by any reasonable means,including the returned check,a w
