five lessors of copier equipment collectively newcal appeal the dismissal of their complaint for failure to state viable sherman act antitrust,lanham act,and rico claims against defendant ikon we reverse.
newcal and ikon compete to lease copier equipment to commercial customers they also compete to provide service contracts for the maintenance of that equipment during the term of the lease.when a lease approaches the end of its term,a new competition begins for the lease of upgrade equipment.similarly,when a service contract approaches the end of its term,a new competition begins to buy out the service contract and to provide services.
newcal alleges that ikon engaged in an ongoing scheme to defraud ikon customers by amending those customers lease agreements and service contracts without disclosing that the amendments would lengthen the term of the original agreement.the purpose of extending the contracts was to shield ikon customers from competition in the aftermarkets for upgrade equipment and for services.that is,by extending the term of the original contract,ikon was able to raise the contract value,which in turn raised the price to newcal and other competitors of buying out that contract in the aftermarkets for equipment upgrades and services.
ikon,it is alleged,obtained lease extensions from its customers without disclosing that the contract amendments the customers signed would result in an extension on the term of the original lease or service agreement.in fact,ikon allegedly deliberately misled its customers to believe that the contract amendments would not affect the original contract term.
newcal,which competes with ikon both in the primary market for equipment leases and in the aftermarket for equipment upgrades,brought claims under the sherman act,alleging antitrust violations,under the lanham act,alleging false advertising,and under rico,alleging racketeering activity predicated on mail and wire fraud.newcal also requested a declaration under the declaratory judgment act,that ikon fraudulently procured contracts were invalid.
on december,the district court dismissed the declaratory complaint and denied newcal request for leave to amend that complaint.the district court held that newcal lacked standing to request a declaration of third parties contractual rights,and it concluded that amendments to the declaratory complaint would be futile.in the same order,the district court dismissed all other claims under rule b,but it granted newcal request for leave to amend those claims.
newcal filed a first amended complaint,pleading its fraud allegations with greater specificity and adding greater detail to its antitrust and lanham act claims.ikon again moved to dismiss under rule b,and the district court granted the motion,holding that newcal had failed to allege a legally cognizable relevant market under the sherman act,that it had failed to allege any false statement of fact under the lanham act,and that it had failed to meet rico standing requirements.the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.this timely appeal followed.
the first question we must address is whether newcal antitrust claims allege any legally cognizable relevant market.we conclude that they do,and we therefore remand those claims to the district court.
in order to state a valid claim under the sherman act,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant has market power within a relevant market.that is,the plaintiff must allege both that a relevant market exists and that the defendant has power within that market 
there is no requirement that these elements of the antitrust claim be pled with specificity.see cost management services,washington natural gas,cir.an antitrust complaint therefore survives a rule b motion unless it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the alleged market suffers a fatal legal defect.and since the validity of the relevant market is typically a factual element rather than a legal element,alleged markets may survive scrutiny under rule b subject to factual testing by summary judgment or trial.see high technology careers san jose mercury news,cir holding that the market definition depends on a factual inquiry into the commercial realities faced by consumers quotations omitted.
there are,however,some legal principles that govern the definition of an antitrust relevant market,and a complaint may be dismissed under rule b if the complaint relevant market definition is facially unsustainable.see queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir.
first and foremost,the relevant market must be a product market the consumers do not define the boundaries of the market the products or producers do.brown shoe united states,d.second,the market must encompass the product at issue as well as all economic substitutes for the product.id.as the supreme court has instructed,the outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.id.as such,the relevant market must include the group or groups of sellers or producers who have actual or potential ability to deprive each other of significant levels of business.thurman industries,pay n pak stores,cir.
third,although the general market must include all economic substitutes,it is legally permissible to premise antitrust allegations on a submarket.that is,an antitrust claim may,under certain circumstances,allege restraints of trade within or monopolization of a small part of the general market of substitutable products.in order to establish the existence of a legally cognizable submarket,the plaintiff must be able to show but need not necessarily establish in the complaint that the alleged submarket is economically distinct from the general product market.in brown shoe,the supreme court listed several practical indicia of an economically distinct submarket industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,sensitivity to price changes,and specialized vendors.at.
in its first amended complaint,newcal listed four product markets replacement copier equipment for ikon and ge customers with flexed ikon contracts,copier service for ikon and ge customers with flexed ikon contracts,copier service for canon and ricoh brand copier equipment,and copier equipment.
the district court held that the last two of those markets failed to support newcal claims because newcal nowhere alleged that ikon holds market power in the nationwide market for copier equipment leases or in the nationwide market for canon and copier equipment service.we agree with that conclusion.newcal does not allege that ikon holds power within those markets.
the district court also concluded that the first two markets were not legally cognizable,finding that the boundaries of those markets impermissibly depended on a group of consumers.relying primarily on the third circuit opinion in queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir,and secondarily on this court opinion in forsyth humana,cir,the district court held that such a group can not constitute a relevant market for antitrust purposes.
newcal responds to the district court analysis by arguing that queen city pizza and forsyth are inapposite to its claims and that the more analogous case is eastman kodak image technical services,d,which permitted an antitrust plaintiff to restrict its alleged market to consumers of products.
we agree with newcal.under eastman kodak,newcal market definition does not fail as a matter of law,at least on a rule b motion.
in queen city pizza,the third circuit confronted an antitrust complaint against domino pizza,brought by a group of domino franchisees.at.as part of their franchise contract,the franchisees had specifically agreed to make their pizzas with only domino approved ingredients and supplies,and they had agreed to purchase those inputs only from the domino corporation or from a domino approved supplier.applying these contractual provisions,domino purchased approximately percent of its franchisees inputs from external suppliers and sold them to its franchisees at a markup.id.at.
the franchisees sued domino for monopolization of the market for pizza ingredients.they restricted the relevant market definition to the market for domino approved inputs,excluding from their market definition many substitutable brands of dough,tomato sauce,and paper cups.they further restricted the relevant market to domino franchisees,alleging that the franchisees constituted a cognizable submarket of the general market for domino approved inputs.id.at.
the third circuit held that the franchisees market definition was legally deficient because the boundaries of the submarket depended on a contractual obligation.id.at.the third circuit noted that market boundaries must be based on economic substitutability of the relevant product,and the only thing that prevented franchisees from substituting other brands for domino approved pizza ingredients was an explicit contractual provision that the franchisees knowingly and voluntarily signed.id.that contractual provision did not change the fundamental nature of the inputs,which remained economically substitutable with other brands of the same inputs the provision merely changed the plaintiffs legal freedom to choose substitutes.the third circuit held that the contractually created difference among products was insufficient to create an economically distinct antitrust submarket.id.
the third circuit also grounded its holding in the fact that the primary market for franchise agreements is a competitive market.id.at.the court reasoned that the franchisees should have been aware,at the time that they chose to enter a domino franchise rather than,say,a pizza hut franchise,that domino would retain exclusive rights to provide them with ingredients.id.that reasoning was particularly relevant in that case,as the court noted,because the product itself was a contractual framework in which the franchisees rights and obligations were clearly defined.id.in other words,because the product was a written agreement that was intended to regulate rights and obligations for the foreseeable future and because there was a competitive market for substitutable written agreements that might have contained different rights and obligations,the franchisees must have made a conscious and voluntary choice to bind themselves to domino aftermarket restrictions.the implication of that reasoning was that competition in the primary market for franchise agreements sufficed to discipline conduct in the aftermarket for pizza supplies.if domino abused its contractual rights,it would lose business in the primary market fewer people would choose to enter a domino franchise.
based on this reasoning,the third circuit held that the alleged submarket of domino franchisees must fail.the only thing that segregated the members of the submarket from the members of the general market was an explicit contractual provision that the franchisees knowingly and voluntarily signed,and domino ability to abuse that contractual power would be restrained by competition in the primary market for franchise agreements.
the other case cited by the district court was forsyth humana,cir.in that case,we applied reasoning similar to the reasoning in queen city pizza to affirm summary judgment against an antitrust plaintiff.consumers of humana health insurance policies sued humana,claiming that the insurance company obtained discounts from acute care hospitals without passing those discounts to consumers in the form of lower premiums.id.at.the antitrust theory was a monopolization claim,in which the plaintiffs alleged that humana colluded with the relevant hospitals to give the hospitals a monopoly over the market for humana insureds.id.at.similar to the franchisees claim in queen city pizza,the insureds antitrust claim defined the relevant market to include only those hospital consumers who had humana insurance policies.in other words,the plaintiffs claimed a submarket whose boundaries depended entirely on a written contract.id.at.and just as the third circuit had done in queen city pizza,we rejected that market definition,holding that explicit contractual provisions limiting humana insureds to certain hospitals could not form the boundaries of an antitrust submarket.id.
we also concluded that contractual obligations were not a cognizable source of market power.in other words,the relevant hospitals lacked market power in the general market for all economically substitutable hospital care the only reason that they had a monopoly over humana insureds was that the humana insureds had signed a contract explicitly granting the hospitals that power.id.the antitrust claim therefore failed.
the supreme court opinion in eastman kodak image technical services,d,has some characteristics in common with queen city pizza and forsyth,but it also has some critical differences.the general market at issue in eastman kodak was the market for service contracts to maintain durable equipment,such as photocopiers and micrographic equipment.id.at.the kodak corporation manufactured such equipment,but it also offered replacement parts and service agreements.
the antitrust plaintiffs in eastman kodak did not allege that kodak held power in the general market for all such services they alleged market power only in a submarket consisting of those customers that had already purchased equipment and that needed replacement parts and services for that particular equipment.id.at.the antitrust theory was that kodak was engaging in illegal practices to prevent independent service companies from competing with kodak in the aftermarket for service of equipment.owners of equipment,the plaintiffs alleged,were forced to purchase replacement parts and services only from the kodak corporation.
as in queen city pizza and forsyth,the alleged market was limited to consumers of a particular brand it included only those consumers who had knowingly and voluntarily purchased kodak equipment.the boundaries of the relevant market,therefore,depended on the consumers prior decision to purchase a product,just as the market boundaries in queen city pizza depended on the consumers prior decision to enter a domino franchise agreement and the market boundaries in forsyth depended on the consumers prior decision to purchase a humana insurance policy.nevertheless,the supreme court held that the definition of the relevant market in eastman kodak was acceptable.id.at.
the critical distinction between eastman kodak and the two circuit court opinions was that the kodak customers did not knowingly enter a contract that gave kodak the exclusive right to provide parts and services for the life of the equipment.in other words,the simple purchase of equipment unlike the signing of a domino franchise agreement or the purchase of a humana insurance policy did not constitute a binding contractual agreement to consume kodak parts and services in the aftermarket.equally critically,the supreme court found that market imperfections,including information and switching costs,prevented consumers from discovering,as they were shopping for equipment,that the kodak brand would include a de facto commitment to consume only supracompetitively priced service contracts.id.at.the supreme court specifically discussed and rejected the possibility that a consumer decision to purchase equipment in an indisputably competitive equipment market was functionally equivalent to the signing of a contractual provision that gave kodak the exclusive right to service its equipment.the court rejected that analogy on the ground that the consumers could not,at the time of purchase,reasonably discover that kodak monopolized the service market and charged supracompetitive prices for its service.id.kodak market power in parts and services,therefore,did not arise from a knowing contractual or arrangement.
taking these cases together,three relevant principles emerge.first,the law permits an antitrust claimant to restrict the relevant market to a single brand of the product at issue as in eastman kodak.second,the law prohibits an antitrust claimant from resting on market power that arises solely from contractual rights that consumers knowingly and voluntarily gave to the defendant as in queen city pizza and forsyth.third,in determining whether the defendant market power falls in the queen city pizza category of market power or in the eastman kodak category of economic market power,the law permits an inquiry into whether a consumer selection of a particular brand in the competitive market is the functional equivalent of a contractual commitment,giving that brand an right to monopolize its consumers in an aftermarket.the law permits an inquiry into whether consumers entered into such contracts knowing that they were agreeing to such a commitment.
in determining whether this case is more like queen city pizza and forsyth or more like eastman kodak,there are four relevant aspects of the complaint.
the first relevant aspect of the complaint is that it alleges the existence of two separate but related markets in intrabrand copier equipment and service.the first market is an initial market for copier leases and copier service,which as the district court correctly found is a competitive market in which ikon has no significant market power.the second market is a derivative aftermarket for replacement equipment,which includes markets for lease buy outs and for service.as in all three of the cited cases,the relevant market here is not the indisputably competitive market in which the consumers first shop for the primary product.it is an aftermarket in which the consumers claim that they should be able to shop for a secondary product in this case,the primary product is the equipment lease and initial service contract,and the secondary product is the replacement equipment and the service contract.the complaint alleges that suppliers go through a different economic calculus when competing for consumers of replacement equipment and service than they do when competing for consumers of initial equipment leases and service contracts.
as noted,all three of the cases involve aftermarkets.the alleged aftermarket in this case,however,is more like the aftermarket in eastman kodak than the aftermarket in queen city pizza and forsyth in one critical respect the aftermarket here is wholly derivative from and dependent on the primary market.the markets for pizza ingredients and paper cups would exist whether or not there was a market for pizza chain franchises,and the market for acute care hospitals would exist whether or not there was a market for health insurance.but the market for durable micrographic equipment parts and services would not exist without the market for durable micrographic equipment,and the market for replacement copiers and services would not exist without the market for copier leases and copier services.
the relevance of this point to the legal viability of newcal market definition may not be intuitively obvious,but it is nevertheless significant.one of the primary considerations in eastman kodak was the uniqueness of replacement parts and the resultant power that kodak gained in the derivative services market.in other words,kodak held a natural monopoly in the submarket for replacement parts,which gave it a unique position in the wholly derivative aftermarket for service contracts.kodak was then able to exploit that unique position to gain monopoly power in the derivative services market as well,even though its monopoly power in services was neither naturally nor contractually created.similarly,here,ikon has a monopoly over services provided under original ikon contracts.that monopoly which,under queen city pizza,is the power that does not count as market power for sherman act purposes then gives ikon a unique relationship with those consumers,and the contractual relationship gives ikon a unique position in the wholly derivative aftermarket for replacement equipment and services.the allegation here is that ikon is,like kodak,exploiting its unique unique contractual gain monopoly power in a derivative aftermarket in which its power is not contractually mandated.
the second relevant aspect of the complaint is that its allegations of illegal restraints of trade and illegal monopolization relate only to the aftermarket,not to the initial market.newcal does not allege that ikon has restrained trade in the market for initial leases and service agreements,nor does it allege that ikon holds power in the primary market.newcal alleges that the deceptive and fraudulent flex agreements restrain competitors ability to compete in the derivative aftermarkets for replacement equipment,lease,and services.critically,those flex agreements are not part of the initial market as they were in queen city pizza.ikon obtains the flex agreements only after obtaining an initial lease or contract.the flex agreements,therefore,are allegedly part of the separate and derivative aftermarket.
the third relevant aspect of the complaint is its description of the source of ikon market power.according to the complaint,ikon does not achieve market power in the aftermarket through contractual provisions that it obtains in the initial market.rather,as noted,its market power allegedly flows from its relationship with its consumers.the contractual relationship not any contractual provision gives ikon special access to its consumers,and ikon leverages that relationship to gain flex agreements and lease extensions.in other words,no provision of ikon initial contract gives it the power to provide replacement equipment,to extend the contract beyond months,to foreclose competitors buy outs,or to prevent competition in services.the alleged market power,therefore,is not a contractual power in the same sense that the alleged market power in queen city pizza and forsyth was a contractual power.
the fourth relevant aspect of the complaint is that it alleges that market imperfections,as well as ikon fraud and deceit,prevent consumers from realizing that their choice in the initial market will impact their freedom to shop in the aftermarket.just as the plaintiffs had in eastman kodak,newcal offers factual allegations to rebut the economic presumption that ikon consumers make a knowing choice to restrict their aftermarket options when they decide in the initial competitive market to enter an ikon contract.competition in the initial market,therefore,does not necessarily suffice to discipline anticompetitive practices in the aftermarket.
in the end,then,we find that newcal allegations are more like the allegations at issue in eastman kodak than those at issue in queen city pizza.this case is not a case in which the alleged market power flows from contractual exclusivity.ikon is not simply enforcing a contractual provision that gives it the exclusive right to provide replacement equipment and services.rather,it is leveraging a special relationship with its contracting partners to restrain trade in a wholly derivative aftermarket.we therefore reverse the district court holding that queen city pizza and forsyth render newcal complaint legally invalid.
that holding,however,does not quite end the matter.in considering the legal validity of newcal alleged market,we must also determine whether ikon customers constitute a cognizable subset of the aftermarket,such that they qualify as a submarket not only under the general principles from eastman kodak but also under the specific brown shoe standard.that is,we have thus far concluded only that there is no per se rule against recognizing submarkets and that such submarkets are potentially viable when the market at issue is a wholly derivative aftermarket.even when a submarket is an eastman kodak submarket,though,it must bear the practical indicia of an independent economic entity in order to qualify as a cognizable submarket under brown shoe.in this case,newcal complaint sufficiently alleges that ikon customers constitute a submarket according to all of those practical indicia.newcal has therefore done enough to survive a rule b motion.
of course,nothing we have said here guarantees even speaks to complaint will survive a summary judgment motion.the actual existence of an aftermarket for replacement equipment,lease,and services is a factual question.the actual existence of a separate economic entity a submarket that includes only ikon customers is a factual question.the actual existence of ikon market power within the alleged submarket is a factual question.ikon actual leveraging of its contractual relationships and resultant market power to foreclose competition in the derivative aftermarket is a factual question.the initial market actual ability,through of demand,to discipline conduct in the aftermarket is a factual question.all of these questions remain open for for or against remand,and all of these questions are appropriate matters for resolution on summary judgment if newcal fails to discover and present evidence to support its allegations.we conclude only that newcal allegations state a claim upon which relief could be granted,and we remand on that basis only.
in addition to arguing that newcal failed to allege a relevant market,ikon asks us to affirm the district court dismissal order on the alternative ground that newcal failed to state claims based on exclusive dealing,tying,restraint of trade,and attempted monopolization.ikon arguments,however,all hinge on factual disagreements rather than legal deficiencies,such that the arguments do not support affirmance of the rule b dismissal.
first,ikon argues that newcal failed to state a claim for exclusive dealing on the ground that the ikon contracts do not,in fact,contain exclusive dealing provisions.this assertion hinges on a factual question,namely the precise terms of the ikon contracts.newcal complaint alleges that ikon and ge have entered into exclusive dealing arrangements with their ikon contracts,ikon amendments and flexed ikon contracts.that allegation,which we must accept as true,is enough to survive dismissal under rule b.
second,ikon argues that newcal failed to state a claim for tying because it failed to allege that ikon forces its consumers to accept the tied product.newcal specifically alleged,however,that ikon has been able to force purchasers of the tying product who are locked in at the end of the original term of the lease by the flexed ikon contract to buy the tied product.once again,that allegation suffices to survive a motion to dismiss.ikon further argues that no set of facts will be available to demonstrate that ikon has the ability to force ties on its consumers because it lacks market power in the tying product,namely the replacement copier equipment.in support of that point,ikon cites illinois tool works,independent ink,d,for the proposition that a plaintiff must prove market power in the tying product in order to establish a tying claim.id.at.ikon is undoubtedly right that newcal must prove market power in the tying product,but the existence or of that market power is a factual question.in fact,in illinois tool works,the supreme court eliminated a legal rule that patent holders would be presumed to hold market power in patented products.the court held that a finding of monopoly must be supported by proof of power in the relevant market rather than by a mere presumption thereof.id.at.the court reasoning,thus,supports the conclusion that market power is in this case a factual question.resolution of the market power question on a rule b motion is therefore inappropriate in this case.
third,ikon argues that newcal generic restraint of trade claim should be dismissed.ikon argument on this point simply reiterates its assertion that newcal failed to allege any viable market.we have already addressed and rejected that argument ikon offers no independent reason to dismiss newcal generic restraint of trade claim.
fourth,ikon argues that newcal failed to state its claims of conspiracy to monopolize and attempted monopolization.once again,this argument simply reiterates the market arguments without providing any independent reason to dismiss the claims.
in sum,newcal antitrust claims do not fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
the second question on appeal is whether newcal sufficiently alleged false or misleading statements of fact to support its lanham act claim.the district court found that all five of the statements identified in newcal complaint were insufficient to support the claim.because the district court conclusions with respect to four of those five statements rested on factual findings rather than legal conclusions,we reverse the rule b dismissal and remand newcal lanham act claim.
under the lanham act,a prima facie case requires a showing that the defendant made a false statement either about the plaintiff or its own product the statement was made in commercial advertisement or promotion the statement actually deceived or had the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience the deception is material the defendant caused its false statement to enter interstate commerce and the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the false statement,either by direct diversion of sales from itself to the defendant,or by a lessening of goodwill associated with the plaintiff product.jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir.
newcal alleged all elements of a lanham act violation,specifically listing the following five false or misleading statements of fact a that ikon would deliver flexibility in their contracts and that they would lower copying costs for consumers b that ikon would deliver service in their ikon contracts c that original ikon contracts were intended by ikon to be for a fixed term of sixty months and would expire at the end of that term d that ikon amendments for sixty months applied only to the changes on the amendment,not to the entire fleet of ikon copier equipment of the consumer and e that ikon flexing practices had been declared legal by the district court in its opinion of december.
the district court concluded that statement a constituted puffing,that statements b and c were not false or misleading representations of fact at the time they were made,and that statements d and e could not reasonably be said to have been made in a commercial advertisement or promotion.
first,we agree with and affirm the district court conclusion that statement a constitutes puffing.in cook,perkiss,liehe northern california collection service,cir,we concluded that the determination of whether an alleged misrepresentation is a statement of fact or is instead mere puffery is a legal question that may be resolved on a rule b motion.a statement is considered puffery if the claim is extremely unlikely to induce consumer reliance.ultimately,the difference between a statement of fact and mere puffery rests in the specificity or generality of the claim.id.at.the common theme that seems to run through cases considering puffery in a variety of contexts is that consumer reliance will be induced by specific rather than general assertions.id.thus,a statement that is quantifiable,that makes a claim as to the specific or absolute characteristics of a product,may be an actionable statement of fact while a general,subjective claim about a product is puffery.id.in this case,statement a is not a quantifiable claim and does not describe or misdescribe any specific or absolute characteristic of ikon service.rather,it is a general assertion that ikon provides its customers with low costs and with flexibility.that kind of general assertion is classic puffery.the district court,therefore,was correct to conclude that statement a could not support newcal lanham act claim.
the second question we must address is whether statements b and c were false or misleading statements of fact at the time they were made.with respect to statement b,the question of whether ikon does or does not actually deliver service in their ikon contracts as well as the question of whether it actually had a rate of service at the time that ikon made that factual questions.our review is limited to facts alleged in the complaint.the complaint alleges that this statement was false when made,and so it survives b scrutiny.
with respect to statement c,ikon correctly points out that other parts of newcal complaint allege that initial ikon contracts were limited to months,which would support the inference that statement c that original ikon contracts were intend
