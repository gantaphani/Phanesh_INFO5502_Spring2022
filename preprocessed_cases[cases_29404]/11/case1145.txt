the city of los angeles city appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of world wide rush and insite outdoor works la collectively wwr and the entry of injunctions in favor of wwr and wilshire center,jamison,and sky tag collectively sky tag enjoining enforcement of certain billboard regulations.we must decide whether the district court erred in concluding that the city freeway facing sign ban is an unconstitutionally underinclusive restriction on commercial speech and the city supergraphic and off site sign bans are unconstitutional prior restraints on speech.because the city exceptions to the freeway facing sign ban do not undermine the city asserted interests in enacting the ban,and because the city council authority to create exceptions to the supergraphic and off site sign bans is a permissible aspect of its inherent legislative discretion,we reverse.
the city also appeals the district court order finding it in civil contempt of the injunction against enforcement of the freeway facing sign ban and the supergraphic and off site sign bans as to wwr billboards.because we vacate the injunction,we also reverse the contempt order.
finally,we affirm the district court decision to allow just one round of amendments to the pleadings as a proper exercise of its discretion.
background 
the story of billboards in america is characterized by an ongoing struggle between an expanding industry and a resistant public.david burnett,note,judging the aesthetics of billboards,pol.one of the first chapters in this story played out in saint louis in,when the missouri supreme court was called upon to decide whether cities had the power to regulate billboards at all.see louis gunning adver.city of louis.at that time,billboards were temporary affairs constructed from upright timbers,or posts set in the ground and braced from the rear,with stringers running from one to the other.id.at.they were described as inartistic and unsightly monstrosities that were liable to be blown down and to fall upon and injure those who may happen to be in their vicinity.id.it was even said that they were hiding places and retreats for criminals and all classes of miscreants.id.the missouri supreme court had little trouble concluding that this class of advertising as now conducted was subject to control and regulation by the police power of the state.id.at.
of course,not everyone shared this view.one author described billboards of that era as thing s of beauty that bore work of artistic and pleasing character,framed in a structure of tasteful design.frank presbrey,the history and development of advertising.decades later,in an essay detailing the history of outdoor advertising,the president of the outdoor advertising association of america described billboards as an important business tool and emphasized that their influence reaches the people in every city and town without getting in their way.phillip tocker,standardized outdoor advertising a history,economics and self regulation,in outdoor advertising history and regulation.he even argued that billboards assisted communities in beautifying areas.id.at.all that the billboard industry asks in return,he pleaded,is to continue to do business where others do business,under the same freedoms and limitations.id.at.
these appeals present the latest chapter in the story of billboards.no longer tied to wooden posts protruding from holes in the ground,in cities such as los angeles,today billboards may be projected onto or hung from the sides of skyscrapers or strategically located near main traffic arteries so that they are visible from great distances by masses of consumers.their labels alone,supergraphic signs conjure up a setting far removed from saint louis in the early.as the nature of billboards has changed,so too has the nature of the legal problems they present.the question of the day is no longer whether cities may regulate billboards at all,but is instead the extent to which they may do so consistent with the first amendment guarantee of freedom of expression.
i.the city sign regulations 
the city regulates signs,including billboards,through chapter i,article of the los angeles municipal code lamc.article stated purpose is to promote public safety and welfare by provid ing reasonable protection to the visual environment and by ensuring that billboards do not interfere with traffic safety or otherwise endanger public safety.lamc.article prohibits some types of billboards and restricts the size,placement,and illumination of others.these appeals arise from first amendment challenges to certain provisions of article the freeway facing sign ban and the supergraphic and offsite sign bans.
freeway facing sign ban 
article freeway facing sign ban prohibits billboards located within feet of and viewed primarily from a freeway or an.lamc a.notwithstanding the freeway facing sign ban,the city has permitted billboards in some circumstances,two of which are applicable here first,in,the city adopted an ordinance authorizing billboards near the staples center,a sports and entertainment complex that was developed to eliminate blight and dangerous conditions in downtown los angeles.see los angeles,ordinance.the city asserted that the nature of the staples center use,coupled with its location in the center of a highly urbanized area,required billboards that could effectively communicate information.id.today,there are several freeway facing billboards near the staples center,including some that use flashing displays and frequently changing digital content.
the city made another exception to the freeway facing sign ban in,when it undertook plans to renovate santa monica boulevard with the aim of improving the flow of traffic between the freeway and the beverly hills border.see los angeles,ordinance.however,the targeted traffic corridor was home to sixteen billboards,the outright elimination of which might have triggered the city obligation to compensate the billboards owners under california eminent domain law.see cal.bus.to avoid the requirements of takings law,including the obligation of just compensation,the city agreed with the billboard owners that four sign faces could be relocated to a newly created special use district sud near fifteenth street.while the relocated billboards would face a freeway,the fifteenth street sud resulted in a net reduction of billboards in the city.
supergraphic and off site sign bans 
supergraphic billboards are signs projected onto or hung from building walls.see lamc.they are often made of large vinyl or mesh canvasses,which are hung with cables from the sides of buildings.id.billboards display messages directing attention to a business or product not located on the same premises as the sign itself.id.for example,a billboard promoting the latest blockbuster movie,but attached to a furniture store,is an sign.the same billboard,when attached to a theater playing the movie,is an sign.article contains the supergraphic and off site sign bans,which prohibit these types of billboards.id.b.
however,the supergraphic and off site sign bans exempt signs that are specifically permitted pursuant to a legally adopted specific plan,supplemental use district or an approved development agreement.id.a specific plan is a land use plan that provides details for the implementation of the city general land use plan.see id.a a specific plan shall provide by ordinance regulatory controls or incentives for the systematic execution of the general plan.see also cal.gov t code.a sud is a land use planning device employed to regulate and restrict the location of certain types of uses whose requirements are difficult to anticipate and can not adequately be provided for in the city general zoning plan.lamc s a.sign districts,like the fifteenth street sud discussed above,are among the recognized types of suds.id.finally,a development agreement is a mechanism by which the city may provide a developer with certainty that existing rules,policies,and regulations will continue to govern his project once it has been approved.see cal.gov t code.
the supergraphic and off site sign bans do not specify the circumstances under which any of these exceptions may be invoked,but other laws provide that suds and development agreements must not conflict with specific plans,which,in turn,must not conflict with the city general plan.see cal.gov t code specific plans id.b development agreements lamc c suds.the authority to employ each exception to the supergraphic and off site sign bans derives,not from article,but from the city legislative power to control local land use.see cal.gov t code a development agreements lamc a specific plans id.land use legislative actions id.b suds los angeles,city charter procedures for adoption of land use ordinance.
ii.procedural history 
wwr sued to enjoin enforcement of the freeway facing sign ban and the supergraphic and off site sign bans.first,relying on central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d,wwr argued that the freeway facing sign ban is an unconstitutionally underinclusive restriction on commercial speech because the city had,in fact,permitted some freeway facing billboards despite the ban.second,wwr challenged the supergraphic and off site sign bans as facially unconstitutional prior restraints on speech.it argued that the exceptions to the bans vest the city council with unbridled discretion to select among preferred speakers because those exceptions lack objective criteria for their application.
wwr did not assert a central hudson challenge to the supergraphic and off site sign bans even though the district court granted leave to amend the complaint more than one year into the litigation and several months after the scheduling order deadline.in granting leave at that late juncture,the district court warned that it would not entertain any further amendments to the pleadings,which should have been settled long ago.after that,wwr did not seek leave to raise new legal theories.
the district court granted wwr summary judgment on its first amendment claims.see world wide rush,llc city of los angeles,d world wide rush i.it concluded that the freeway facing sign ban violates the first amendment because the city decisions to allow freeway facing billboards at the staples center and in the street sud undermine its stated interests in safety and aesthetics.id.at.it ruled that preserving even one sign was fatal to the freeway facing sign ban.id.the district court also concluded that the supergraphic and off site sign bans violate the first amendment because the city can avoid the blanket ban on and supergraphic signs simply by enacting a specific plan in a certain area,but there are no standards that would prevent the city from enacting a specific plan because it wishes to approve particular speech or a particular speaker.id.at.further,it found that the requirement that suds and development agreements conform to specific plans is a loophole that eviscerates the standards governing suds and development agreements.id.at.the district court concluded,the city has set up a system that allows it to eliminate speech based on content.id.accordingly,the district court entered an order enjoining the city from enforcing the freeway facing sign ban and the supergraphic and off site sign bans as to wwr billboards.
the city thereafter decided that several of wwr supergraphic billboards violated other article provisions not covered by the district court injunction.for instance,the city cited wwr for violations of article regulations restricting the size of wall signs and for failing to obtain proper permits for several billboards.faced with the new citations,wwr returned to the district court,arguing that the city was using other provisions of article to circumvent the district court order and that it could not obtain the necessary permits because the city continued to enforce the invalidated provisions.the district court concluded that the city improperly had denied wwr permits and issued wwr citations under the guise of other article provisions,when,in fact,the city was continuing to enforce the supergraphic and off site sign bans in contravention of the injunction.world wide rush,llc city of los angeles,d,world wide rush ii.the district court found the city in civil contempt and required it to discharge certain citations.id.at.
meanwhile,other billboard companies got in on the action.as the district court explained,not long after issuance of the world wide rush i injunction,numerous billboard companies began putting supergraphic signs up all over los angeles as a result,thoroughfares that contained any sort of sizable building were soon pockmarked with supergraphic signs.id.at.the city responded in kind by adopting a complete moratorium on new supergraphic and signs.see los angeles,ordinance.some billboard companies,including sky tag,filed copycat lawsuits,in which they sought injunctions to protect their own billboards from city enforcement efforts.for the reasons announced in the world wide rush i opinion,the district court enjoined the city from enforcing the supergraphic and off site sign bans as to certain of sky tag billboards.see world wide rush ii at.

discussion 
constitutionality of the sign regulations 
courts have often faced the problem of applying the broad principles of the first amendment to unique forms of expression each method of communicating ideas is a law unto itself and that law must reflect the differing natures,values,abuses and dangers of each method.we deal here with the law of billboards.metromedia,city of san diego,d citations,footnote,and internal quotation marks omitted.
freeway facing sign ban 
in central hudson,the supreme court announced a test for assessing the constitutionality of a restriction on commercial speech if the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity,then it merits first amendment scrutiny as a threshold matter in order for the restriction to withstand such scrutiny,t he state must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved and it must not be more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.metro lights,city of los angeles,cir quoting cent.hudson,at,cert.denied,d.t he last two steps of the central hudson analysis basically involve a consideration of the fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.rubin coors brewing,d internal quotation marks omitted.
as a general matter,there is no question that restrictions on billboards advance cities substantial interests in aesthetics and safety.metromedia,at.metro lights,at.however,a city may diminish the credibility of its rationale for restricting speech in the first place where it exempts some speech from the general restriction.metro lights,at internal quotation marks omitted.the critical question is whether the city denigrates its interest in safety and beauty and defeats its own case by permitting freeway facing billboards at the staples center and in the fifteenth street sud while forbidding other freeway facing billboards.metromedia,at.to put it in the context of the central hudson test,a regulation may have exceptions that undermine and counteract the interest the government claims it adopted the law to further such a regulation can not directly and materially advance its aim,and is,therefore,unconstitutionally underinclusive.metro lights,at quoting rubin,at.see also greater new orleans broad.ass n,united states,d a regulation may be unconstitutionally underinclusive if it is so pierced by exceptions and inconsistencies that it can not advance the government interest in the regulation.
here,the city exceptions to the freeway facing sign ban do not undermine the city interests in aesthetics and safety.indeed,the exceptions were made for the express purpose of advancing those very interests.allowing billboards at the staples center was an important element of a project to remove blight and dangerous conditions from downtown los angeles.similarly,the fifteenth street sud was an outgrowth of the city efforts to improve traffic flow,and thereby safety,on santa monica boulevard.not only did the agreement to allow signs in the fifteenth street sud advance that project,it also resulted in a net reduction of billboards in the city.ironically,the most significant denigration to the city interests in traffic safety and aesthetics might result,not from allowing the freeway facing billboards at the staples center and in the fifteenth street sud,but instead from strict adherence to the freeway facing sign ban,which might have severely hampered,if not completely defeated,both projects.
the district court took an approach to its constitutional analysis of the freeway facing sign ban,stating that to preserv e even one sign undermines the city stated interests in traffic safety and aesthetics.world wide rush i,d at.our first amendment jurisprudence,however,contemplates some judicial deference for a municipality reasonably graduated response to different aspects of a problem.metro lights,at.as the supreme court has explained,it does not follow from the fact that the city has concluded that some commercial interests outweigh its municipal interests in this context that it must give similar weight to all other commercial advertising.metromedia,at.moreover,exceptions to the freeway facing sign ban must be considered holistically,not in isolation.again,the supreme court has explained,t he effect of the challenged restriction on commercial speech ha s to be evaluated in the context of the entire regulatory scheme,rather than in isolation.greater new orleans,at.see also metro lights,at w e must look at whether the city ban advances its interest in its general application,not specifically with respect to metro lights.
e valuated in the context of the entire regulatory scheme,the challenged exceptions to the freeway facing sign ban do not render the ban so pierced by exceptions and inconsistencies as to be unconstitutionally underinclusive.greater new orleans,at.the city reasonably may have concluded that,on balance,safer and more attractive thoroughfares would result from renovations to santa monica boulevard and a reduction in the city total number of billboards,even if this required installation of some freeway facing billboards along fifteenth street.the city also reasonably may have concluded that the benefits of redeveloping and attracting people to an otherwise dangerous and blighted downtown area outweighed the harm of additional freeway facing billboards restricted to that area.see,metro lights,at even with some exceptions,sign ban went a long way toward cleaning up the clutter,which the city believed to be a worthy legislative goal.
in concluding otherwise,the district court relied on the supreme court decision in greater new orleans.there,the court concluded that a federal regulation prohibiting advertisements for gambling in private casinos but allowing advertisements for gambling on reservations violated the first amendment.greater new orleans,at.greater new orleans is inapposite,however,because the regulatory distinction between the two types of casinos counteracted the government purported interest in minimizing gambling.as the greater new orleans court explained,allowing one type of advertising while prohibiting the other would merely channel gamblers to the reservations,thus rendering the regulation squarely at odds with the governmental interests asserted in this case.id.the freeway facing sign ban is not a means by which the evil sought to be prohibited is simply channeled elsewhere,at odds with the asserted governmental interests.rather,the city submitted a convincing rationale which is entirely consistent with its asserted governmental interest for exempting some freeway facing signs from its ban.
the other cases upon which wwr relies are similarly inapposite.in each of those cases,the government created a distinction between permissible and prohibited forms of commercial speech,and,in each case,the distinction undermined the government asserted interests in the regulation as a whole.see rubin,at.there is little chance that e can directly and materially advance its aim,while other provisions of the same act directly undermine and counteract its effects.city of cincinnati discovery network,d no reasonable fit between government interests and regulation which required removal of newsracks but allowed to to remain ballen city of redmond,cir exceptions to sign ban compromise the city interests in traffic safety and aesthetics.here,by contrast,the city permitted billboards at the staples center and in the fifteenth street sud precisely because of its interests in safety and aesthetics.in addition,the exceptions to the freeway facing sign ban are,whereas the distinctions employed in greater new orleans private casinos versus reservation casinos,rubin beer labels versus wine labels,discovery network commercial newsracks versus newsracks,and ballen exceptions to ban implicated the messages communicated by the signs at issue.see metro lights,at a regulation can be unconstitutional if it in effect restricts too little speech because its exemptions discriminate on the basis of the signs messages.internal quotation marks omitted ballen,at t he city use of a ban rather than a valid time,place,or manner restriction indicates that the city has not carefully calculated the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its discriminatory,prohibition.
our recent decision in metro lights,in which we rejected a central hudson challenge to an lamc provision banning signs generally,but permitting them on bus shelters,is more analogous metro lights,at.relying on metromedia,we approved the city justification for the bus shelter advertisement exception that proliferation of offsite advertising by numerous and disparate private parties creates more distracting ugliness than a single,controlled series of advertisements on city property over which the city wields contractual supervision.id.at.we concluded that the specific exception in question here does not weaken the direct link between the city objectives and its general prohibition of offsite advertising.see also outdoor,city of mesa,cir t here is a reasonable fit between the sign codes and the interests they seek to achieve.clear channel outdoor,city of new york,cir the city may legitimately allow limited and controlled advertising on street furniture,while also reducing clutter on city sidewalks.allowing some signs does not constitutionally require a city to allow all similar signs.here,as in metro lights,the city decision to permit some freeway facing billboards at the staples center and in the fifteenth street sud does not break the link between the freeway facing sign ban and the city objectives in traffic safety and aesthetics.
