the,ilan golan golan,seeks review of the final judgment of the united states district court for the central district of california granting summary judgment to the,pingel enterprise,wayne and donna pingel,and arlen ness together pingel,on golan federal and state antitrust and unfair competition claims,and state tort claims.the district court determined that none of golan claims could survive pingel motion for summary judgment because pingel made no actionable false or misleading statements.we affirm the grant of summary judgment dismissing the federal and state antitrust claims because golan failed to show pingel possessed monopoly power in the relevant market.we also affirm the grant of summary judgment dismissing the federal and state unfair competition claims and state tort claims because golan has not presented clear and convincing evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude pingel acted in bad faith.finally,because the district court applied the wrong law to the statements relating to trademark infringement,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with our opinion herein.
background 
pingel manufactures motorcycle fuel valves,also called petcocks,for motorcycles.petcocks regulate the flow of fuel between the fuel tanks and the engine.pingel sells its petcocks under the unregistered trademark,and owns utility and design patents relating to motorcycle fuel valves.
golan also manufactures products for motorcycles.golan product line includes a fuel filter,and a fuel valve.golan markets both the filter and the valve under the trademark peak flow.through distributors,golan advertised the peak flow filter as early as.the peak flow fuel valve became available sometime in.the record contains evidence that golan showed a prototype of the peak flow fuel valve at a trade show in february,but both golan and pingel represented to the district court that golan first sale of the peak flow valve was in october.
in,one distributor,rivera engineering rivera,issued a promotional brochure advertising golan peak flow filter.pingel received this brochure,which advertised that the peak flow filter was flow rated gallons per minute,and requested a sample peak flow filter from golan.golan provided the sample.wayne pingel testified that he tested the peak flow filter and found that it failed to exhibit the advertised flow rate.pingel then faxed a handwritten note to rivera,on september.this facsimile,addressed to distributor,indicated that wayne pingel had tested the filter,and stated 
i do recommend these filters with my or stock hd valves.do be mislead sic,they will not flow gal.per minute on any gravity system.
the district court found that in response,rivera apparently ignored pingel warning and continued to carry the fuel filter.
in late,pingel became aware that golan was selling the peak flow fuel valve.pingel obtained a sample of the valve,and consulted his attorney.the district court found that i n consultation with his patent attorney,pingel determined that golan valve infringed a pingel utility patent,a pingel design patent,and pingel trademark for petcock valves.
through his patent attorney,pingel sent a letter to golan.the letter,dated october,accused golan of infringing united states patent the patent,united states patent no.des.the design patent,and pingel mark for petcocks.the letter demanded that golan immediately cease and desist all manufacturing and all sales of golan petcock.the letter also warned that failure to terminate manufacturing and selling of the valves will result in legal action for patent and trademark infringement.wayne pingel testified that at the time this letter was sent,pingel was contemplating a lawsuit against golan.
on november,several days after sending the letter to golan,pingel sent a letter to each of its distributors.this letter stated 
the purpose of this letter is to alert our distributors that a petcock manufactured and distributed by golan products,sic infringes patents and a trademark held by pingel enterprise.we are taking immediate action to halt the production and sale of this product.
if you are approached to distribute a petcock for golan products,or if you have any questions or comments,please call me 
pingel letter to the distributors failed to specify which patents and trademark golan fuel valve allegedly infringed.golan presented evidence that subsequent to receiving this letter,one distributor,custom chrome,cancelled a purchase order for golan valves that had already been filled and paid for.
the record contains evidence that just before february,wayne pingel called mel magnet,president of rivera.pingel allegedly opened this conversation by asking,i s one fuel valve enough,and stating that golan valve infringed pingel valve,and that it would be a pleasure to take you down.on february,pingel,through its attorney,sent a letter to mel magnet of rivera demanding that rivera cease and desist all sales of golan petcock.pingel attorney also sent a letter requesting that golan attorney agree to accept service of a summons and complaint for infringement on golan behalf.
during his deposition,pingel attorney,white,admitted that when he sent this letter,pingel had not authorized him to file an infringement suit.additionally,pingel testified that he had not authorized white to initiate litigation against golan and that he had no intention of suing rivera when he sent rivera the letter demanding that rivera cease and desist selling golan valve.
after sending these letters,pingel contacted at least two additional outside attorneys in order to assess the likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its infringement claims.both outside attorneys told pingel the litigation would be expensive and that the issues were close.the first outside attorney issued one opinion orally.the second outside attorney sent pingel a letter on march,stating that whether pingel would prevail on any of its potential claims is a close issue.the letter also informed pingel,albeit incorrectly,that t he patent expires april,which is years from after the filing of its application.the letter also advised pingel to engage an independent intellectual property attorney to formally evaluate these claims and offer an opinion as to whether there is infringement.pingel did not initiate patent or trademark infringement litigation against golan.
in march,less than five months after pingel letter,golan initiated the present action.golan sought declaratory judgment of noninfringement for the trademark and for several patents owned by pingel,including the two patents referenced in the letter.golan also alleged federal and state antitrust claims,federal and state unfair competition claims,and state law business tort claims.
pingel filed an answer and counterclaims.pingel answer alleged that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the absence of a case or controversy regarding the patents other than the design patent and the patent.pingel counterclaims included trademark and unfair competition claims pertaining to the mark,and infringement of the design patent.although pingel did not counterclaim for infringement of the patent,neither did it represent that the court lacked jurisdiction for want of a case or controversy regarding that patent.rather,pingel admitted that the patent expired on may,but stated that the defendants lacked knowledge regarding when golan peak flow petcock was first offered for sale.
golan moved for partial summary judgment of noninfringement of the design patent and of the patent.golan filed its motion regarding the patent on august.pingel filed an opposition to golan motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent on october.the opposition stated,for the first time,that there was no case or controversy because the patent had expired,that golan testified he first sold the peak flow petcock after the expiration of the patent,and that pingel had asserted no claim of past or present infringement.the opposition acknowledged that the october,letter from pingel counsel to golan was sent after the patent expired.in addition to its opposition,pingel also filed a statement of nonliability,in which pingel covenanted not to sue golan or any of its customers for infringement of the patent.
the district court granted golan motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the design patent.golan pingel,no.cv,memorandum of decision granting partial summary judgment.the court dismissed golan claim for declaratory judgment of noninfringement of the patent as moot.golan pingel,no.cv,order dismissing motion as moot.
pingel then moved for summary judgment on golan tort,unfair competition,and antitrust claims.the district court found that these claims rested entirely on one or both of two activities pingel communications with rivera regarding the flow rate of golan filter,and pingel communications with golan and pingel distributors regarding golan alleged patent and trademark infringement.the district court held that neither activity is actionable.pingel facsimile communication with rivera,it determined,was not actionable because golan provided no evidence to show that the assertion contained in the facsimile that golan filter failed to flow at the advertised gallons per minute in a gravity system was untrue pingel communications regarding golan alleged infringement,the district court determined,were not actionable because golan provided insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that pingel made the claims in good faith.consequently,the court granted summary judgment on golan tort,unfair competition,and antitrust claims 
golan appeals,contending that issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on his tort,unfair competition,and antitrust claims.
ii.jurisdiction 
although pingel counterclaims requested direct coercive relief under the patent laws,in holmes group,vornado air circulation,d,the supreme court held that a authorizes us to exercise appellate jurisdiction over only those appeals in which the complaint authorized the district court to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.after vornado,we may no longer rely solely on counterclaims arising under the patent laws to establish our appellate jurisdiction.
nevertheless,we have jurisdiction over this appeal because golan complaint sought declarations of patent noninfringement.consequently,the complaint arose,in part,under.this is so because,as the supreme court directed in vornado,the complaint rule governs district court patent jurisdiction under to the same extent that it governs the existence of general federal question jurisdiction under.id.at.at l inguistic consistency requires us to apply the same test to determine whether a case arises under a as under.quoting christianson colt indus.operating,d see also christianson,at.holding that jurisdiction exists under only in those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.

this court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo,reapplying the summary judgment standard to determine whether it was appropriately granted.pickholtz rainbow,paragon podiatry,klm.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.evidence,and any inferences to be drawn therefrom,must be viewed in the light most favorable to the.id.at.where the party opposing summary judgment bears the burden of proof at trial,however,it must show more than a mere metaphysical doubt regarding the material facts.celotex catrett,d.nor will the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence suffice.anderson,at.rather,the must show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact,which exists only if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could reach a verdict in its favor.id.

iv.discussion 
on appeal,golan contends that disputed issues of material fact require this court to reverse the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing each of golan claims.in particular,golan points to evidence in the record indicating that pingel made false or misleading statements regarding the performance characteristics of the peak flow valve,and regarding infringement of pingel patents and trademark,and that pingel made these statements in bad faith.pingel contends that this court should affirm the grant of summary judgment on all claims because the record contains no evidence that its statement regarding the flow rate of golan valve was untrue,or that it alleged infringement in bad faith.in the alternative,pingel contends that this court should affirm the grant of summary judgment because the record is devoid of evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding other elements of each of the asserted claims.
federal and state antitrust claims 
we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing golan state and federal antitrust claims on alternate grounds.these claims can not proceed because golan failed to provide evidence that pingel possessed monopoly power in the relevant market.
under of the sherman act,t he offense of monopoly has two elements the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.united states grinnell,d.d efining the relevant market is indispensable to a monopolization claim under of the sherman act.thurman,pay n pak stores,cir.the relevant market has two dimensions,the relevant product market which includes a determination of the lack or presence of readily available substitutes and the relevant geographic market when the competition is geographically confined.brown shoe united states,d kodak image technical,d stating that the relevant market is determined by choices available to purchasers and is composed of products with reasonable interchangeability citing united states du pont de nemours.see also intergraph intel.california state antitrust statute,the cartwright act,is patterned after the sherman act,and sherman act decisions are applicable to cases under the cartwright act.see cal.bus,et mts,d.
golan antitrust claims can not survive summary judgment because golan failed to satisfy the summary judgment requirement of proffering sufficient evidentiary support to establish,prima facie,the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market.
indeed,golan antitrust claims fail for at least two reasons.first,golan failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a relevant market.golan offered only conclusory allegations that the relevant market is the high end motorcycle fuel valve market for harley davidson motorcycles without further supporting evidence.pingel presented uncontroverted evidence that its fuel valves compete against lower priced valves that are interchangeable substitutes,and that it lacked monopoly power and could not control prices.golan presented no expert testimony regarding monopolization or the relevant market,nor did golan present evidence sufficient to raise a question of material fact regarding the existence or nonexistence of interchangeable substitutes.although golan presented declarations of dealers in the motorcycle fuel valve industry stating that golan and pingel valves are the only products in the high end high performance aftermarket motorcycle fuel valve market for harley davidson motorcycles,these conclusory statements are insufficient to exclude lower priced interchangeable substitutes from the relevant market.high end,and high performance are irrelevant if lower end,and lower performance valves are interchangeable substitutes.pingel testimony regarding interchangeability is therefore uncontroverted.
second,even assuming the relevant market is as narrow as golan suggests,golan failed to prove that pingel had acquired monopoly power in this relevant market.golan offered no evidence of market share,barriers to entry,or any other commonly accepted evidence showing monopoly power.from the record before us,the evidence at best shows there were two competitors in this limited market.without proof of monopoly power golan antitrust claims must fail.
we therefore affirm the dismissal of golan antitrust claims because golan failed to satisfy the summary judgment requirement of proffering sufficient evidentiary support to establish,prima facie,the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market.
federal and state unfair competition claims state tort claims 
with regard to the remaining claims,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in pingel favor.the district court analyzed the challenged statements under the following two categories pingel communications with rivera regarding golan fuel filter and pingel allegations of patent and trademark infringement.
pingel communications with rivera regarding golan fuel filter 
we agree with the district court that pingel facsimile statement to rivera regarding the flow rate of the peak flow filter was not itself actionable.this statement represented that pingel tested the filters and that they would not flow at the advertised six gallon per minute rate in a gravity system.wayne pingel testified that he tested golan filter and it failed to flow at the advertised gallons per minute rate.golan argument that this statement is false rests on the contention that it is entirely possible that a reasonable jury could find that pingel had made false or misleading descriptions of the filter element found in the golan fuel filter applnt br.at emphasis added.we disagree.the facsimile plainly refers to the flow rate of the fuel filter in a gravity system,not to any limited element thereof.because golan argument rests on a strained and implausible reading of the challenged statement,we agree with the district court that golan failed to present evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that this statement was false or misleading 
pingel allegations of infringement 
the district court considered the allegations of patent infringement and trademark infringement as a single issue.for the reasons discussed below,we address the allegations separately.
patent infringement allegations 
in general,federal patent law bars the imposition of liability under federal or state law for publicizing a patent in the marketplace unless the plaintiff can show that the patent holder acted in bad faith.zenith elecs.exzec,quoting hunter douglas,harmonic design.a patent owner has the right to enforce its patent,and that includes threatening alleged infringers with suit.concrete unlimited,cementcraft,uspq.
in mikohn gaming acres gaming,this court articulated a federal standard applicable to all torts,state or federal,based on a patentee statements about patent infringement to a potential infringer and the industry.we explained that 
communication to possible infringers concerning patent rights is not improper if the patent holder has a good faith belief in the accuracy of the communication.although bad faith may encompass subjective as well as objective considerations,and the patent holder notice is not irrelevant to a determination of bad faith,a competitive commercial purpose is not of itself improper,and bad faith is not supported when the information is objectively accurate.in general,a threshold showing of incorrectness or falsity,or disregard for either,is required in order to find bad faith in the communication of information about the existence or pendency of patent rights.indeed,a patentee,acting in good faith on its belief as to the nature and scope of its rights,is fully permitted to press those rights even though he may misconceive what those rights are.
id.moreover,in bard,we explained that 
the law recognizes a presumption that the assertion of a duly granted patent is made in good faith,see virtue creamery package.this presumption is overcome only by affirmative evidence of bad faith.
consequently,patentees do not violate the rules of fair competition by making accurate representations,and are allowed to make representations that turn out to be inaccurate provided they make them in good faith.see mallinckrodt,medipart.nevertheless,if the party challenging such statements under state or federal law presents clear and convincing evidence that the infringement allegations are objectively false,and that the patentee made them in bad faith,with knowledge of their incorrectness or falsity,or disregard for either,the statements are actionable and are not protected by the existence of a patent.to survive summary judgment,the party challenging such statements must present affirmative evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the patentee acted in bad faith,in light of the burden of clear and convincing evidence that will adhere at trial.
in zenith electronics,we explained that the law regarding proof of bad faith is.in certain cases,bad faith may be clear 
exactly what constitutes bad faith remains to be determined on a case by case basis.obviously,if the patentee knows that the patent is invalid,unenforceable,or not infringed,yet represents to the marketplace that a competitor is infringing the patent,a clear case of bad faith representation is made out.
to show bad faith in pingel actions,golan must offer clear and convincing evidence that pingel had no reasonable basis to believe that the gp petcock infringed pingel patents or that pingel knew it was enforcing an expired,and therefore unenforceable,patent.in this case,there is not clear and convincing evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude th
