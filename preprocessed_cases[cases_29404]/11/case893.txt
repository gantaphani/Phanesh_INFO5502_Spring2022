michael turner embezzled a significant amount of money from his employer,allstate insurance company turner was a field claims adjuster for allstate,and he worked out of his home in suburban northeast illinois.as part of his duties as an adjuster,turner was authorized to write settlement checks on behalf of allstate.turner wrote eighteen company checks payable to his own order and deposited the checks in his personal bank account the government indicted turner on five counts of embezzlement,and the other thirteen uncharged checks were considered during sentencing.
in this appeal michael turner argues that is unconstitutional as congress has exceeded its authority to legislate under the commerce clause.first,turner asserts that the district court erred in classifying the statute as regulating instrumentalities or things in interstate commerce.second,turner avers that neither he nor allstate insurance company are instrumentalities or things in interstate commerce and that his actions were wholly intrastate.finally,turner argues that,in the alternative,his activity is only tangentially related to and did not have a substantial affect on interstate commerce.hence,turner asserts that congress can not regulate embezzlement in a small locality any more than it can regulate shoplifting in northbrook,illinois.he asserts that there must be limits on congress power because nearly every individual mundane commercial activities,such as shopping at the local grocery store,may,in some way,affect a company which is involved in interstate commerce.for the reasons that follow,we find that does not exceed congress power under the constitution to regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.
background 
initially,turner moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing congress had exceeded its authority under the commerce clause by enacting b a.the district court denied the motion,and turner decided to plead guilty,reserving the right to appeal the commerce clause issue.the district court sentenced turner to five months confinement recommending the sentence be served in a house,and three years supervised release with the first five months to be served in home confinement.turner remains out on bond,pending the resolution of this appeal.
we review the determination of a federal statute constitutionality de novo.united states black,cir.tuner asserts that which makes it illegal for employees to other insurance companies exceeds congress power under the commerce clause,criminalizing a wholly intrastate activity.turner specific argument is that criminal acts are not encompassed within the commerce clause power,and even though insurance affects interstate commerce,his conduct,which merely affected the insurance company,did not directly affect interstate commerce and can not be regulated.
a.the power to regulate interstate commerce 
the court has enunciated three broad categories of activities that congress may regulate using the power delegated to it in the commerce clause,united states lopez,d.first,congress may regulate the channels of interstate commerce.id.channels refer to the transportation of a commodity or travel in interstate commerce.see,heart of atlanta motel,united states,d interstate travel and places of public accommodation united states darby.shipment of manufactured goods caminetti united states.women and girls transported for immoral purposes lottery case champion ames.lottery tickets.second,congress may regulate and protect the instrumentalities,persons,or things in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.lopez,at.instrumentalities,persons,or things in interstate commerce include railroads,aircraft,and trucks.see,mitchell zachry,d describing railroads,truck companies and airlines as instrumentalities of interstate commerce shreveport rate cases.railroad shipping rates.third,congress may regulate activities having a substantial relation to or substantial affect on interstate commerce.lopez,at.an activity substantially affects interstate commerce either directly or when considered with other similar activities in the aggregate.see,hodel virginia surface mining reclamation,d coal mining perez united states,d loan sharking wickard filburn.growing of wheat on a local farm solely for personal consumption.
as the district court found that congress did not exceed its authority because it was regulating an instrumentality or thing in interstate commerce,we must first determine whether this conclusion is correct.the statute at issue,provides,in relevant part as,or being an officer,director,agent,or employee of,any person engaged in the business of insurance whose activities affect interstate commerce willfully embezzles,abstracts,purloins,or misappropriates any of the moneys,funds,premiums,credits,or other property of such person so engaged shall be punished as provided in paragraph.b emphasis added the statute repeatedly refers to the business of insurance whose activities affect interstate commerce.a,b a,c,d,e b see also f defining interstate commerce as used in the statute.furthermore,the report from the house judiciary committee,to whom the bill was referred,also indicates that congress enacted the law relying upon the third category of authority.the stated purpose of the law was to deal with interstate insurance fraud schemes that congress felt were too complex and that current laws,state and federal,were inadequate to deal with the problem.emphasis added.
turner inferentially bases his argument on the act,where congress explicitly allowed the states to continue regulating insurance despite the interstate effects of such regulation.b prudential ins.benjamin.turner argument is that insurance and criminal acts such as embezzlement are the province of the states to regulate.despite the concurrent jurisdictional grant in and,thereby,the recognition that insurance has intrastate and interstate effects,the business of insurance can and does affect interstate commerce.see united states underwriters ass n.united states robertson,cir.as the business of insurance does affect interstate commerce,congress may choose to regulate it,in whole or part,and those activities that affect the business.
although congress chose the affects interstate commerce rationale to support this legislation and we agree that insurance does affect interstate commerce that does not mean insurance may not also be a channel from which interstate commerce flows.banks are generally considered vehicles through which interstate commerce emanates,as banks conduct innumerable transactions with persons,companies,and banks in other states and countries,united states watts,cir weir united states,cir.similarly,when a person purchases insurance from a company,the company holds the money in a pool with the money of other insured persons,and later the company pays claimants.hence,insurance companies provide a vehicle through which premiums from the insured and payments to claimants flow in interstate commerce.black,at finding that child support payments regularly travel in interstate commerce cas.fed.trade comm n,cir noting the mccarran act gave the ftc the authority to regulate insurance on the grounds that insurance was part of the channels of commerce.
whether we characterize the business of insurance as affecting interstate commerce or being a channel of commerce,we conclude congress may regulate the insurance industry pursuant to article i,clause.the question remaining is whether the prohibited activity,embezzlement from insurance companies,is included within this grant.turner asserts that his actions do not touch upon interstate commerce and are outside the scope of congress authority.
b.the scope of the interstate commerce power 
during the early years of the infant republic,congress enacted little commercial legislation,and the supreme court reviewed few such enactments.gibbons ogden,wheat,marked the first major consideration of the scope of the commerce clause.in the majority opinion,chief justice john marshall noted that congress commerce power,like all others powers vested in congress,is complete in itself,may be exercised to its utmost extent
