this is a trade case in which we are required to assess the propriety of merchandise classifications employed by united states customs and border protection customs when setting duty rates on certain products imported into the united states by lemans corporation lemans.lemans appeals the decision of the court of international trade cit upholding customs classification of lemans motocross jerseys,motocross pants,and motorcycle jackets collectively,the subject merchandise as apparel under chapters and of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus.lemans contends that the subject merchandise should be classified as sports equipment under chapter of the htsus because the articles are necessary,useful,or appropriate for a sport and are specifically designed for use in a particular sport.because we find that customs correctly classified the subject merchandise as apparel and,thus,properly set duty rates for these lemans imports,we affirm.
background 
a.the subject merchandise 
lemans imported the subject merchandise into the united states through the ports of chicago and los angeles between july,and september.the merchandise consists of five different models of motocross jerseys six different models of motocross pants and four different models of motorcycle jackets.the differences in the specific models are neither significant nor relevant for this analysis,and we treat the merchandise in three broad categories motocross jerseys,motocross pants,and motorcycle jackets.below are the relevant features of each of the categories of articles as found by the cit and according to the record,which are not in dispute 
motocross jerseys 
lemans motocross jerseys are made of s ynthetic,mesh and ventilated knit patterned fabric,which also wicks away moisture.lemans united states,d.int l trade cit decision.they have padded elbows for abrasion and impact protection and form an integrated protection system with the use of a tacky silicon print on the lower back to keep the jersey tucked into the motocross pant when riding.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.the record shows that the weight of the pads constitutes approximately ten percent of the entire weight of the jersey.
motocross pants 
lemans motocross pants are made of 
h nylon that provides riders with impact and abrasion protection,and the pants contain additional comfort features,such as mesh panels for venting,heat resistant inner leg areas made of leather or fibers to prevent burns from the engine and exhaust pipe,and spandex and stretch panels to allow freedom of movement and a fit in the legs,seat,and crotch area.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.the pants contain foam padding sewn into the knee and thigh areas as well as removable foam padding.the weight of the pads is just less than fifty percent of the total weight of the pants.
motorcycle jackets 
the jackets are made of h materials,such as heavyweight waxed cotton chassis,dynax nylon chassis,or knitted polyester mesh chassis,and contain molded rubber padding inserted into the elbows and shoulders as well as back pads.id.at.they are intended to provide protection to riders on public streets from impact and abrasion injuries that may occur in an accident during street motorcycle riding.id.the protectors in the jackets comprise roughly twenty to percent of the weight of the jackets.
customs classification 
customs classified all of the subject merchandise as wearing apparel under either chapter or of the htsus specifically,customs classified the motocross jerseys as sweaters,pullovers,sweatshirts,waistcoats vests and similar articles,knitted or crocheted of manmade fibers other under subheading of the htsus at a duty rate of ad valorem.it classified the pants as garments,made up of fabrics of heading,or other men or boys garments of fibers other under subheading of the htsus at a duty rate of ad valorem.and it classified the different models of motorcycle jackets in three separate provisions of heading of the htsus the airtex sport and merc models under subheading ad valorem the tarmac jacket under ad valorem and the super duty model under ad valorem.
lemans filed timely protests,claiming that its merchandise is properly classifiable under chapter of the htsus,either under subheading at a duty rate of ad valorem,or under subheading at a duty rate of ad valorem.customs denied the protests.
court of international trade decision 
lemans initiated a civil action in the cit contesting the denial of its protest under.following for summary judgment,the cit issued a decision affirming customs classification as to all goods.it did so under general rule of interpretation gri,which requires review of the headings and relevant section and chapter notes of the htsus.cit decision,at.
as for the jerseys,the cit looked to the common dictionary definition of sweater and pullover and the headings of to determine that the jerseys fit within the definition of those terms.id.at.it also reviewed the explanatory notes to heading en,which add that the heading encompasses a category of knitted or crocheted articles designed to cover the upper parts of the body,specifically including jerseys as an example.id.at quoting en.
as for the pants,the cit again looked to the common dictionary definition of garment to find that lemans motocross pants constitute an article of clothing that covers the human body,and that the pants are made up of materials under headings and heavy duty nylon mesh,heavy duty ballistic woven nylon fabric,heavy duty woven polyester,and keprotec.id.at.finally,the court affirmed customs classification of lemans motorcycle jackets as overcoats,finding that they fit within that general category and distinguishing them from men or boys suits under heading.id.at.
the cit also rejected lemans argument that its goods are prima facie classifiable as sports equipment under heading,which would require consideration of gri a to determine which heading more specifically describes the merchandise.the court looked to the dictionary definition of equipment and our decision in rollerblade,united states,in which we stated that equipment includes those articles that are necessary and specifically designed for use in athletics and other sports.id.at.based on these authorities and its review of the subject merchandise,the court found that,although lemans goods arguably constitute useful,if not necessary,articles to motocross and motorcycle riding,the explanatory notes to heading en demonstrate that the subject merchandise is not of the type typically classified as sports equipment.cit decision,at.those notes include,as examples of requisites for other sports,items such as snow skis,golf clubs,pingpong paddles,tennis rackets,basketballs,ice skates,hockey sticks,swings,and slides.see cit decision,at citing en b.although example b of the explanatory notes identifies p rotective equipment for sports or games,fencing masks and breast plates,elbow and knee pads,cricket pads,the court found that these examples center on nonclothing articles and do not describe apparel like the subject merchandise.id.at.
the court further found that note e to chapter,which excludes sports clothing of textiles,of chapter or from chapter,also supported its conclusion.id.at.finally,the cit distinguished our decision in bauer nike hockey usa,united states,a case in which we found that pants were classifiable as sports equipment,on grounds that bauer did not provide a broadly applicable definition of equipment and involved a gri a analysis,not a gri finding.cit decision,at.
lemans filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
standard of review 
we review the cit grant of summary judgment on tariff classifications de novo.cummins united states.we employ the same standard employed by the cit in assessing customs classification determinations.a classification decision involves two steps.the first concerns the proper meaning of the tariff provisions,which is a question of law reviewed de novo.id.the second step concerns whether merchandise falls within a particular heading,which is a question of fact we review only for clear error.id.where,as here,the nature of the merchandise is undisputed,the inquiry collapses into a question of law we review de novo.id.
discussion 
as noted above,lemans urges us to reject customs classification of the subject merchandise as wearing apparel.instead,it asks that we conclude that the merchandise is properly classified as sports equipment under chapter.lemans contends that,because its goods are so highly specialized for use during motocross or motorcycle riding,the wearing apparel aspects of the merchandise are only incidental to its primary purpose,placing these items outside of the classification as apparel.lemans asserts,moreover,that there can be no fair debate that the merchandise is both specially designed for and appropriate and useful for a sport,thus rendering it properly classifiable as sports equipment.lemans argues that,under these facts,our precedent commands reversal of the cit decision.as explained below,we find that the subject merchandise is properly classified as wearing apparel under chapters and and is not prima facie classifiable as sports equipment under chapter,and we find lemans characterization of our precedent overly broad.accordingly,we conclude that customs classification of the subject is not erroneous 
the proper classification of merchandise is governed generally by the gris of the htsus.bauer,at.gri requires classification according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.gri.if gri resolves the issue,the court is not to look to other gris.see mita copystar am.united states.we are first to look to headings,then subheadings,to determine the proper classification.bauer,at.absent contrary definitions in the htsus or legislative history,we construe the terms used in the headings and subheadings according to their common and popular meaning,which may be drawn from our own understanding,dictionaries and other reliable sources.id.quoting medline,united states.the world customs organization explanatory notes that accompany each chapter of the htsus,while not legally binding,are persuasive and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the tariff provision.drygel,united states.
when merchandise is prima facie classifiable under two or more headings or subheadings of the htsus,we apply gri to resolve the classification.bauer,at.gri a states that t he heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.gri a.under this rule of relative specificity,we look to the provision with requirements that are more difficult to satisfy and that describe the article with the greatest degree of accuracy and certainty.orlando food united states.
apparel under chapters and 
we first consider whether customs correctly classified the subject merchandise as various types of apparel under subheadings of chapters and of the htsus.on this point,lemans does not challenge the definitions the cit applied to the relevant terms,sweater,pullover,garment,and overcoat,nor does it challenge whether the subject merchandise falls within the ordinary meaning of those terms generally.rather,lemans asserts that the cit incorrectly concluded that the articles at issue constitute wearing apparel because its merchandise is so highly specialized that any features are incidental to the subject merchandise primary purpose as sports equipment.
in support of its argument,lemans relies on our decision in rubie costume united states,in which we found that customs appropriately classified certain costumes as festive articles under chapter rather than as wearing apparel under chapter.that case required us to consider note e to chapter,which provides that chapter does not include s ports clothing or fancy dress,of textiles,of chapter or.see id.at.pursuant to note e,if the costumes at issue constituted fancy dress,of textiles,of chapter and,which we held encompassed textile costumes classifiable as wearing apparel,they would be precluded from classification in chapter.id.
in rubie,we determined that the costumes at issue were not wearing apparel,such that they could not be considered articles of fancy dress that are excluded from chapter.id.in so deciding,we relied on the fact that the costumes were worn only on rare occasions,such as during halloween or at a costume party,included varieties,and were flimsy and lacking in durability.id.at.while acknowledging that the category of wearing apparel includes clothing worn for decency or comfort and adornment,we found that,to the extent the items at issue in rubie possessed those features,they were secondary or incidental to the costumes festive value.id.at citing antonio pompeo united states,cust.unlike the articles in rubie,the subject merchandise in this case shares more characteristics with ordinary apparel,coming in different sizes and having the durability to be worn repeatedly.in addition,whereas the comfort features of the costumes were secondary,lemans itself explains that all of the articles at issue here are designed to provide optimal fit and comfort while participating in the sport.appellant br.emphasis added.for these reasons,we find lemans reliance on rubie misplaced.
the government is correct that the headings and subheadings of chapters and do not distinguish between apparel designed for general or specific uses.the fact that articles are specialized or intended for specific purposes,such as for sports,does not alone remove them from the category of apparel.indeed,chapter includes heading for track suits,and swimwear other garments,which are,by their nature,items used in particular athletic activities.it is true,moreover,that v irtually all wearing apparel is to a degree often a high degree designed and worn to provide comfort and protection,often for very specific situations.daw,united states.despite lemans argument to the contrary,the merchandise in this case does not contain protective or specialized features to the same degree as the crash helmets used by motorcycle and auto racers in antonio pompeo,cust.at finding that crash helmets would not be considered in ordinary parlance to be wearing apparel.accordingly,because we find that the cit correctly applied the dictionary definitions of the terms in the headings and subheadings and then correctly concluded that the subject merchandise was wearing apparel,we agree that customs properly classified lemans goods under chapters and of the htsus.
sports equipment under chapter 
lemans contends that,even if the subject merchandise is properly classifiable as apparel,it is also prima facie classifiable as sports equipment,which requires resort to the guidelines set forth in gri a to determine which heading provides the most specific description.according to lemans,a gri a analysis requires classification of its goods under heading,which provides for a rticles and equipment for general physical exercise,gymnastics,athletics,others sports,rather than headings,and.as discussed below,because we disagree that the subject merchandise is prima facie classifiable as sports equipment,we resolve this matter under gri and do not consider lemans argument under gri a.
sports equipment 
the term sports equipment is not defined in the htsus,so we are to look to the common and popular meaning of the term.bauer,at.here,the cit correctly cited the dictionary definition of equipment to find that t o qualify as equipment for a sport,the good should generally provide what is necessary,useful,or appropriate for that sport.cit decision,at citing webster third new international dictionary.
we have employed this same definition for the term sports equipment in our prior decisions.see rollerblade,at bauer,at.in rollerblade,we accepted a definition offered for this term that includes those articles that are necessary and specifically designed for use in athletics and other sports.at.in bauer,we again considered the definition of sports equipment when we addressed the proper classification for pants.at.there,we found that the cit erred in applying our rollerblade decision too strictly when it found that equipment meant only articles that are indispensible to a sport or athletic
