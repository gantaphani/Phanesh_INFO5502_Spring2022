plaintiff maris distributing company maris brought this antitrust action against defendant,alleging in part that violated of the sherman act by prohibiting its distributors from being owned,in whole or in part,by the public.maris contended that this restriction,contained in distribution agreements,suppressed the price for equity ownership interests in beer distributorships,and in particular in the submarket of the purchase and sale of ownership interests in beer distributorships.after hearing the evidence at trial,the district court directed a verdict in favor on the issue of whether had market power,such that there was the potential for genuine anticompetitive effects on competition.however,the court allowed to go to the jury the issue of whether actual anticompetitive effects had been shown by the plaintiff.in response to special interrogatories,the jury then found that maris had established both a relevant market the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships and submarket the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships.however,the jury found that maris had failed to show actual anticompetitive effects as a result of the public ownership restriction.maris appeals the district court directed verdict on the issue of market power as well as several other issues related to the trial.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court actions were proper,and we affirm.
background 
distributes its brands of beer through a network of approximately authorized wholesale distributors,each with an assigned territory.maris was one of these distributors from and was exclusive distributor for the territory covering gainesville and ocala,florida.maris paid nothing to in exchange for this distributorship.
the relationship between and each of its distributors is governed by a written contract referred to as the equity agreement.upon becoming a distributor in,maris agreed as part of the equity agreement that had the right to approve any change in maris ownership.less than a year later,in,the equity agreement was amended to include a provision that precluded any public ownership either through sale to a company or via a public offering of stock of distributorships.it is this provision that is the subject of the instant lawsuit.maris did not object to the amendment when the provision was added in,and it also signed two subsequent versions of the equity in and one in of which contained similar prohibitions against public ownership.
the operative agreement between maris and at the time this lawsuit was filed was the equity agreement,paragraph i of which provided 
under no circumstances shall wholesaler or any owner of wholesaler have the right to transfer any ownership interest in the business of wholesaler if such transfer would result in wholesaler being owned in whole or in part,directly or indirectly,by the public.
the equity agreement provides,however,that distributors may sell distributorships,including the right to distribute products,to any entities,provided that they seek and obtain approval.another provision required the distributor to provide with notice of its intent to sell and to allow to have an exclusive right to negotiate for the purchase of the distributorship for days.
on august,following a meeting with,maris submitted a notice of intent to sell,pursuant to the terms of the equity agreement.during the subsequent negotiations,made two offers to purchase for million and one for million.maris did not accept these offers and made no.
after the required negotiation period with,maris indicated that it would seek to sell the business to a.maris had discussions with at least six potential buyers,but never submitted a proposed purchaser to.according to,maris lack of success in finding a buyer was in part because maris demanded an unreasonably high price because it acted unreasonably in its negotiations with potential buyers.also attributes some of maris difficulties to the fact that it employed a broker,irvin philpot,who says was a convicted felon and an otherwise unsavory character.
maris filed this lawsuit on january,challenging the equity agreement public ownership provision.on march,terminated the equity agreement with maris.ceased selling its products to maris,and assigned maris territories to two other distributors.maris asserted a sherman act antitrust claim alleging that the public ownership provision effected an unreasonable restraint in trade in the form of a,vertical restraint by suppressing prices in the relevant market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships,and in the relevant submarket for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships 
maris only claim that went to trial in this case was a rule of reason claim under sherman act,and the parties agree that in order to prevail on its claim,maris had to prove,inter alia,either that had market power in the relevant market or submarket such that the restraint had potential anticompetitive effects,or the restraint resulted in actual anticompetitive effects on the relevant market or submarket.see levine central florida medical affiliates,cir.
on the issue of market power,the evidence showed that only owned all or part of out of approximately distributorships and distributorships of all brands of beer.this indicates that market share in the alleged relevant market was less than,and that its share of the submarket was still only.nonetheless,maris argued that it could show market power based on the fact that had a market share in the manufacture of beer.
despite small market share in the relevant market and submarket,maris experts testified that in the case of vertical restraints,a defendant market share in manufacturing can result in market power in the relevant market for the purchase and sale of ownership interests in distributorships.these experts stated that when market share in the manufacture of beer is taken together with its contractual influence over the valuations and sales of distributors,and the contractual exclusion of all buyers,then it could be shown that had market power over distributors.
disagreed and argued that small market share in the relevant market precluded as a matter of a law a finding of market power.the district court agreed with and excluded maris expert testimony concerning market power,finding as a matter of law that market share could not be imputed to the alleged relevant market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests of beer distributorships from the separate market of the manufacture and sale of beer.the district court also agreed with that market power could not be shown by evidence of influence over entry and exit to the market because,the court found,such evidence only showed contract power and not market power.therefore,the court also excluded that evidence.after excluding this evidence,and in light of small market share in the relevant market and submarket,the district court entered a directed verdict in favor of on the issue of market power.
although the district court directed a verdict on the market power issue,the court allowed to go to the jury the issue of whether maris nonetheless had proven actual anticompetitive effects as a result of the public ownership restriction.maris attempted to prove several actual anticompetitive effects,including the suppression of the price at which beer distributorships are sold,a reduction in output sales of distributorships as a result of suppressed price,the creation of barriers to entry into the market,the creation of a barrier to exit the market,and harm to consumers in the form of higher beer prices as a result of decreased competition among distributors.
in its special verdict,the jury found in favor of on the issue of actual anticompetitive effects.based on this verdict,the district court entered judgment in favor of,and taxed maris with costs.
although maris raises several issues on appeal,only two of those issues merit extended discussion these are 
whether the district court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of on the issue of market power,and in excluding related evidence.
whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding certain costs related to discovery depositions and expedited trial transcripts.
iii.discussion 
directed verdict on market power 
maris primary claim on appeal is its contention that the district court erred by directing a verdict in favor on the issue of market power and excluding related evidence.maris argues that the ban on public ownership contained in distributorship agreements is an unreasonable vertical restraint in violation of of the sherman act.the parties are in agreement that maris claim was subject to the rule of reason,rather than per se antitrust analysis.in levine central florida medical affiliates,cir,we discussed the legal standards applicable to such a claim 
under the rule of reason,the test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.chicago bd.of trade united states.rule of reason analysis requires the plaintiff to prove an anticompetitive effect of the defendant conduct on the relevant market,and that the conduct has no procompetitive benefit or justification.
in order to prove an anticompetitive effect on the market,the plaintiff may either prove that the defendants behavior had an actual detrimental effect on competition,or that the behavior had the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.in order to prove the latter,the plaintiff must define the relevant market and establish that the defendants possessed power in that market.
id.at citations and quotations omitted.ultimately,in order to consider a rule of reason claim based on a vertical restraint,we have stated that a court must conduct a systematic comparison of the negative effects of the restraint on competition and compare that with the positive effects on competition stemming from the restraint.graphic products distributors itek,cir 
maris claimed,and the jury so found,that the relevant product market was the market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships,and that there was a relevant submarket for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships.the jury also found that the plaintiff had failed to prove an anticompetitive effect in the form of an actual detrimental effect on competition.see levine,at.the only issue before us involves whether the plaintiff made a sufficient showing of market power in the relevant market and submarket to present a triable issue on the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.id.
as maris points out,t he question of market power is a factual one,and it argues that the question of whether had market power should have been left to the jury.thompson metropolitan,cir.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court was correct in determining that,as a matter of law,was entitled to a directed verdict on the market power issue.
a district court may enter judgment as a matter of law if a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of that party on that issue.when considering such a motion,the court must evaluate all of the evidence,together with any logical inferences therefrom,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.carter decisionone,cir.see.we review de novo an order directing a verdict.id.at.
in arguing that the district court erred in directing a verdict on the market power issue,maris makes three different,but arguments.first,it argues that market share in beer should have been imputed to the alleged relevant market for the purchase and sale of ownership interests in beer distributorships.second,it maintains that even if such an imputation is not appropriate,share of the relevant market should be aggregated with the share held by all other parties to its distributor agreements,including all of distributors.finally,maris contends that the district court erred by finding that certain restrictions imposed by on its distributors evidenced only contract power,and not market power.as we shall explain,we find that none of these contentions has merit.
imputation of market share to relevant market 
as mentioned above,the district court determined,as a matter of law,that did not have market power in the alleged relevant market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships given its market share of in that market.maris,however,maintains that significant market share in the manufacture and sale of beer is sufficient to show market power in the relevant market and submarket.specifically,maris contends that i n cases involving vertical restraints imposed by a manufacturer on distributors,market power is determined by reference to the manufacturer share of products in the market,not its share of ownership in distributors.maris opening brief,at.in other words,maris maintains that a manufacturer market share in the market for its products should be imputed to the separate market for ownership interests in the manufacturer distributorships when a provision in the distributorship agreement is challenged.we disagree.
we begin by noting that maris position seems to be foreclosed by our precedent,unless maris is able to show some connection between the two different markets that would justify our consideration of market share in the beer market while considering maris claim.in manufacturing research greenlee tool,cir,we rejected the relevance to an antitrust claim of market power in a market other than the relevant market for the particular claim.in that case,which involved an attempt to monopolize claim,we considered a district court denial of discovery concerning the defendant sales of conduit benders in light of the court finding that the relevant market for the antitrust claims in that case was the market for cable benders.we affirmed the denial of discovery,reasoning that a showing of market power in the cable bender market did not show market power in the relevant market of conduit benders.id.at.in particular,we noted that this was true because the plaintiff had provided n o proof of any connection between greenlee conduct in the conduit bender market and that in the cable bender market.id.therefore,we held that a defendant market share in a market other than the alleged relevant market is irrelevant,and can not be imputed,at least absent a showing of some connection between two different markets that would provide a basis for such an imputation.
we have not been alone in reaching that conclusion.in intergraph intel,the federal circuit considered a monopolization claim brought by intergraph against its supplier intel,a business with a high market share in the market for high performance computer microprocessors.intergraph alleged in that case that the relevant market for its antitrust claim was the graphics subsystems market,a market in which intergraph and intel were competitors,but in which neither intel nor intergraph had market power.id.at.in rejecting intergraph claim that intel role in the microprocessor market supported its claim of monopolization in the graphics subsystem market,the court stated 
intel market power in the microprocessor market is irrelevant to the issues of this case,all of which relate to the effect of intel actions on intergraph position in its own markets.
id.therefore,the federal circuit also declined to impute market share from one market to another for purposes of determining whether a defendant had market power in the second market.
while urging us to accept its position that market share in the beer market should be imputed to the alleged relevant market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships,maris primarily relies on two supreme court opinion in continental,gte sylvania,d,and our decision in graphic products distributors itek,cir.sylvania is the supreme court seminal case concerning vertical,restraints.in that case,the supreme court noted as background that 
the traditional framework of analysis under of the sherman act is familiar and does not require extended discussion.section prohibits e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce.since the early years of this century a judicial gloss on this statutory language has established the rule of reason as the prevailing standard of analysis.standard oil united states.under this rule,the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.
sylvania,at.at.the supreme court then went on to explain that t he market impact of vertical restrictions is complex because of their potential for a simultaneous reduction of intrabrand competition and stimulation of interbrand competition,and that even though such restrictions may reduce intrabrand competition,v ertical restrictions promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of his products.id.at,at.therefore,the court held that,vertical restraints are subject to analysis under the rule of reason,rather than to per se treatment.id.at.at.
maris argues that sylvania supports its position that market share in the manufacture and sale of beer could show market power over the alleged relevant market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in distributorships because it maintains that sylvania indicates that it is a manufacturer market share in manufacturing that is relevant in judging a vertical restraint.maris notes that the supreme court spoke in terms of the defendant market share in sales of the manufacturer.see id.at.at noting that defendant market share in sales of televisions increased from to following imposition of vertical restraint.
we believe that the difference between sylvania and the instant case is patent and significant.the relevant market involved in sylvania was the market for television sets.therefore,of course the defendant market share in the manufacture and sale of those products was directly relevant to the issue of whether it had market power in the relevant market.nothing in sylvania offers any support,however,for the notion urged by maris that in the case of a restraint imposed by a manufacturer on its distributors,market share may be imputed from one market,beer to another market,equity ownership interests in distributorships in order to determine whether the defendant has market power in the second market.
we find equally unavailing maris reliance on our decision in graphic products distributors itek,cir.in that case,we also dealt with a claim concerning,vertical restraints,in the form of territorial restrictions on distributors,and stated that sylvania places the competitive effect of particular vertical restraints at the center of the analysis under the rule of reason.id.at.we noted that as a threshold matter under the rule of reason,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant had market power in a relevant market,and that m arket power is the ability to raise price significantly above the competitive level without losing all of one business.id.at.we also recognized that m arket share is frequently used in litigation as a surrogate for market power.id.at.
as maris points out,in graphic products,we did talk in terms of the defendant market share in the manufacture or sale of the.id.at.however,as was the case in sylvania,that was because the defined relevant market was the market for those.therefore,here again,this case does not provide any basis for imputing market power from one relevant market to another 
in an attempt to provide the type of connection that would justify the imputation of market share in the beer market to the market for distributorships,maris alludes to economic literature bearing on this question.maris states that its experts relied on economic literature on vertical restraints which supports the determination of the defendant manufacturer market power based on its market share in manufacturing.maris opening,at.other than the conclusory assertion of its experts,maris provides no economic rationale suggesting that alleged market power in the beer market should endow it with power in the different market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships.as points out,maris expert testified that he could not identify a single vertical restraint case in which a court had imputed market power from an entirely different market.
we have carefully reviewed maris arguments and its experts reports.we conclude that maris has not identified a valid economic reason why alleged market power in the beer market should create market power in the different market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships.we also pressed maris at oral argument in this regard,to no avail 
the relevant market share evidence reveals that possesses only one to three percent of the alleged relevant markets.under these circumstances,it is clear that market share in the relevant market is inadequate,standing alone,to permit a finding of market power.see retina assocs.southern baptist hospital of,cir holding that the defendants market share in the relevant market was insufficient as a matter of law to show market power for purposes of a claim,general electric,cir noting in context of claim that a or or share of a normal market does not imply power to raise prices by curtailing output.therefore,unless maris could show some other basis which would have permitted the jury to find that possessed market power in the relevant market,then the district court properly entered a directed verdict on this issue.we turn to maris efforts to make such a showing.
aggregation of market share 
in its second attempt to show that the district court erred by directing a verdict on the market power issue,maris argues that even if we reject its argument that market share in the beer market may be imputed to the relevant market in this case,as we have,then we should still find that had sufficient market share to show market power because we should aggregate the market share of all parties subject to distribution agreements containing the public ownership restriction.this approach would yield a market share somewhere around in the market of ownership interests in beer distributors,and of the submarket of beer distributorships.we conclude that aggregation is inappropriate for purposes of assessing market share in the type of case before us.
in support of its aggregation argument,maris primarily relies on the fifth circuit opinion in spectators communication network,colonial country club,cir.in that case,the plaintiff sued one member of an alleged conspiracy to boycott the plaintiff.the district court found that the defendant,who coincidentally was,could not be held liable under because it individually did not have market power.id.at.the fifth circuit reversed after finding that the market share of all of the should have been aggregated in order to determine whether market power was present,and stated 
a fter all,the reason for looking at market power is to determine whether the combination or conspiracy,not each individual conspirator,has the power to hurt competition in the relevant market.
we conclude that spectators is inapposite in that it deals with a conspiracy to boycott a business,rather than a vertical restraint imposed by a manufacturer on its distributors.if we were to aggregate the market share of all of distributors here,that would mean that aggregation of market share would always be required when reviewing vertical restraints.this approach would lose track of the fact that the vertical restriction was imposed by a single manufacturer seeking to regulate its distributors.requiring aggregation also would make it much more difficult for any manufacturer with a significant market share in the market for its products to agree with its distributors with respect to vertical we know can be.when plaintiffs are able to show that a manufacturer product constitutes a relevant submarket then aggregation would yield a market share of.we also believe that aggregation under these circumstances could threaten many franchise agreements,exclusive dealing agreements,and other arrangements traditionally reviewed under the rule of reason,by making market power seem to appear where it does not really exist.
but we need not concern ourselves with aggregation in the context of vertical restraints in general,the particular vertical restraint in the instant case is one that would appear to be of interest only to.maris has pointed to no evidence that other distributors have sought to prevent maris from selling to a publicly owned entity.nor has maris suggested any reason why other distributors might want to do so.unlike spectators,there is no agreement or conspiracy here that all distributors will refuse to deal with maris no distributor has agreed to do anything,or refrain from doing anything with respect to maris.instead,the agreement at issue only involves maris and.
we hold that it is not appropriate to aggregate market share with that of its distributors when determining whether has market power in the relevant product market for equity ownership interests in beer distributorships for purposes of assessing a claim that the ban on public ownership constitutes an illegal vertical restraint.
contract power versus market power 
finally,maris argues that the directed verdict was improper because the district court based part of its reasoning on the fact that actions were an exercise in contract power,rather than in market power.maris notes that claims always involve a contract or agreement,but that fact does not insulate them from antitrust liability.maris contends that the exercise of contract power,particularly where a plaintiff is locked in to the defendant product or business,may violate the antitrust laws.although maris argument has some intuitive appeal,in that clearly had some power over maris and its other distributors by virtue of the contractual provisions in its distribution agreements,we find the cases relied upon by maris distinguishable,and agree with the district court that exercise of its contract power over maris did not show that had market power in the relevant market.
we begin by noting what the relevant question before us is not.it is not whether the exercise of contract power can be an antitrust violation.contracts,and the exercise of contract power,may run afoul of the antitrust laws,as evidenced by the fact that of the sherman act prohibits any contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.emphasis added.therefore,if the district court had held that had not violated the antitrust laws simply because its actions were pursuant to a contract,that would have been incorrect.anticompetitive actions are not immunized by virtue of being memorialized in a contract.
the more interesting issue,and the one we think the district court was addressing when it spoke of contract power,is the relationship between contract power and market power.we believe,for the reasons that we discuss below,that the district court correctly recognized that,while a party who exercises contract power may have market power and may violate the antitrust laws under some circumstances,the mere existence and exercise of contract power does not show that a defendant had market power or violated the law.in other words,courts must attempt to ascertain a defendant economic position in the relevant market,rather than its power pursuant to a particular contract,when considering whether a defendant has market power.
in arguing that the district court erred with respect to the contract power issue,maris begins by pointing to the supreme court decision in eastman kodak image technical,d,the relevant part of which involved a tying claim.although kodak does not address the issue of when the exercise of contract power should be viewed as market power,it does address issues of market definition and market power in a context in which a plaintiff is locked in to a relationship with a defendant.in kodak,the plaintiffs had established triable issues of fact concerning the existence of a tying,whether kodak parts and service for kodak photocopy and micrographic equipment were distinct products subject to a tying analysis.id.at.at.the court noted that there was sufficient evidence that consumers viewed parts and service as separate products.id.the court also noted that parts for kodak equipment were unique and were not interchangeable with other manufacturers parts because only kodak parts would work on kodak machines.id.at.at.because of these factors,the supreme court held that a jury could find a tying arrangement between kodak parts the tying product,and kodak service the tied product.id.at.at.
the court then proceeded to consider whether there was sufficient evidence that kodak had market power in the market for kodak parts such that it could force unwanted purchases of the tied product service for kodak machines.id.at.at.kodak defended,arguing that the brisk competition in the original market for photocopy and micrographic equipment would prevent it from having market power in the aftermarkets for service and parts,even though it had a dominant share of those of the market for kodak parts.id.at.at.kodak argued that any attempt by it to charge supracompetitive prices for service or parts would inevitably lead to a reduction in sales of kodak equipment because consumers would buy,or switch to,competing equipment.id.at.at.among the factors undermining this argument by kodak,the supreme court pointed to the heavy initial cost for kodak equipment.id.at.at.the court concluded that this high switching cost served to lock in existing customers,inhibiting their taking advantage of the brisk competition in the equipment market by switching to competitors equipment.id.
maris argues that the same is true when a plaintiff,such as itself,is locked in by a distribution agreement with a manufacturer.therefore,maris urges us to find that this gave anheuser busch market power.
in addition to kodak,maris also seeks support from a case in which a franchisee brought antitrust claims against a franchisor challenging a provision in the franchise agreement,and a district court in our circuit found that the exercise of rights under a contract may run afoul of the antitrust laws.see collins int dairy queen.in that case,the court considered a tying claim brought by a franchisee,alleging that dairy queen requirement that food and supplies be purchased from it constituted an unlawful tying arrangement.dairy queen argued that it could not be held liable for tying because the restraint was simply part of the franchise agreement and that any power over the franchisee resulted from that agreement rather than market power.id.at.the district court rejected this argument,relying on a variation of the concept from the kodak decision 
plaintiffs have shown that dairy queen franchisees make significant initial investments in their franchises,which also provide them the option to open additional stores without paying another franchise fee.in addition,can terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement if a franchisee fails to carry the full authorized menu of food products or does not meet quality standards.because of the excessive costs and potential losses associated with purchasing another franchise,a dairy queen franchisee wishing to obtain products and supplies from alternative sources at lower costs may be locked in to the existing arrangement enjoyed by.based upon these cases,the court finds that plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence of economic loss,overpriced products,and refusal to consider alternative sources of comparable products to preclude the entry of partial summary judgment based on the existence of a relationship.
id.at.therefore,the court held that the franchisee might have a viable claim against the franchisor,even though the restriction of which it complained was contained in the franchise agreement to which it had agreed.
in tension with the district court holding in collins,several of our sister circuits have cautioned against placing too much weight on the existence of contract power when defining relevant markets and determining whether defendants possess market power.in a case involving facts similar to those in collins,the third circuit reached a different result.see queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir.in queen city the court considered a monopoly claim brought by a franchisee against a franchisor related to a requirement in the franchise agreement that the franchisee only purchase from the franchisor or approved suppliers.the franchisor,domino,argued that its 
p ower to force plaintiffs to purchase ingredients and supplies from them stemmed not from the unique nature of the product or from its market share in the fast food franchise business,but from the franchise agreement.for that reason,plaintiffs claims implicate principles of contract,and are not the concern of the antitrust laws.
id.at citations and quotations omitted.the district court agreed and dismissed the plaintiffs claim.
the third circuit agreed that the exercise of contract power resulting from the provisions of a franchise agreement did not raise antitrust concerns and that the franchisee failed to state a valid,relevant product market when it limited the alleged relevant market to parties who had entered into domino franchise agreements.id.at.the court stated 
a court making a relevant market determination looks not to the contractual restraints assumed by a particular plaintiff when determining whether a product is interchangeable,but to the uses to which the product is put by consumers in general.thus,the relevant inquiry here is not whether a domino franchisee may reasonably use both approved or products interchangeably without triggering liability for breach of contract,but whether pizza makers in general might use such products interchangeably.clearly,they could.were we to adopt plaintiffs position that contractual restraints render otherwise identical products for purposes of relevant market definition,any exclusive dealing arrangement,output or requirement contract,or franchise tying agreement would support a claim for violation of antitrust laws.perhaps for this reason,no court has defined a relevant product market with reference to the particular contractual restraints of the plaintiff.
id.in this regard,the third circuit also rejected a argument derived from kodak,noting that the challenged provision in the franchise agreement was part of the deal when the franchisee entered the agreement,and holding that the crucial fact driving the determination of the relevant product market was that domino approved supplies and ingredients were fully interchangeable with substitutes from other pizza suppliers.id.at.the court recognized that contracts always restrain and affect a party available choices,but that for purposes of determining a relevant product market,a court looks not to contractual restraints on a particular consumer,but rather to the uses to which the product is put by consumers in general and whether there are interchangeable substitutes.
the fifth circuit also took this approach when faced with a similar claim in united farmers agents,farmers ins.exchange,cir.the court stated that e conomic power derived from contractual agreements such as franchises or in this case,the agents contract with farmers,has nothing to do with market power,ultimate consumers welfare,or antitrust.id.at.the court looked for the insurance company market share in the market for insurance,rather than in a more specific market related to services required for the company agents.id.at.
likewise,in hack president and fellows of yale college,cir,the second circuit considered this issue in the context of a monopolization claim brought by students against their college based on the college requirement that the students live in dormitories for their freshman and sophomore years.citing queen city,the court rejected the plaintiffs market definition and affirmed dismissal of the claim,holding economic power derived from contractual arrangements affecting a distinct class of consumers can not serve as a basis for a monopolization claim.id.at.accord double d spotting,supervalu,cir holding that market defined by one contract was not relevant market for antitrust purposes.
we agree with the approach taken by our sister circuits on this issue,and conclude that the district court correctly distinguished between contract power and market power in determining that was entitled to a directed verdict as to part of maris claim the fact that had considerable power over many aspects of maris business by virtue of the provisions of the contract to which they agreed at least separate times reveals little about the issue of whether had market power in the broader,relevant market for the purchase and sale of equity ownership interests in beer distributorships.and there is no reason for us to believe that decision to exercise its rights under that agreement also were exercises of market power.
our conclusion is consistent with the decision of the former fifth circuit in kestenbaum falstaff brewing,cir in that case,a beer distributor brought a sherman act claim challenging,among other things,the manufacturer right to restrain the price at which the distributor could sell his distributorship.id.at.we concluded that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it would be a per se violation of the antitrust laws for the manufacturer to dictate the sale price of the plaintiff distributorship.id.at.we held that any such restriction was subject to rule of reason review,and noted that i t is beyond question that a manufacturer may legitimately restrict the class of persons with whom it would agree to continue a franchise,so long as such restriction was not artificially employed to further some unlawful practice.id.at.based on this right,the court continued 
it logically follows that falstaff has a right to restrict the sales price of one of its distributorship franchises to the reasonable value of that franchise in order to insure that the purchaser will have a chance to realize a reasonable return on his investment.falstaff clearly has a strong interest in the financial vitality of a new franchisee.if the purchaser of a franchise makes a bad bargain when he buys,then he can not give the distributorship the solid,concerned management which it must have to be successful for him and to enhance falstaff image and relative position in the market.
id.we also noted that this recognition of a manufacturer interest in the identity of its distributors and in the transfer of its distributorships had been recognized by an earlier case in which we had held that an automobile manufacturer possessed a limited privilege to approve or disapprove a prospective purchaser since it would deal with the purchaser in the future and would represent it to the public.id.citation omitted.although we did not directly address the issue in kestenbaum,it is clear from our discussion that we did not believe that the defendant contractual power under its distribution agreement with the plaintiff yielded market power.
consistent with the holdings of the third circuit in queen city,and the fifth circuit in united farmers agents,we believe that the supreme court decision in kodak is distinguishable from the instant case.as noted in our discussion of kodak above,that opinion did not address at all the issue in this,whether contract power is the equivalent of market power for antitrust purposes.moreover,the context of kodak is entirely different from the instant context.there is no argument in this case that brisk competition in one market would prevent a defendant from having market power in another market,despite the defendant dominant share in that market,because consumers would switch to competitors substitute products in the competitive market.unlike kodak,maris has not adduced sufficient evidence of a tying arrangement,coupled with a high market share in the relevant product market for the tying product.kodak,at.at.unlike kodak,the defendant in the instant case has not defended against an otherwise viable antitrust claim supported by sufficient evidence of the defendant high market share in the relevant market by arguing that market power was lacking,despite its high share of the
