background 
the merchandise at issue comprises textile costumes,which are made in toddler,child,and adult sizes traditionally worn in conjunction with the celebration of halloween or to costume parties.on july,rubie filed a request for information,seeking a tariff classification for five textile costumes witch of the webs,abdul sheik of arabia,pirate boy,witch,and cute and cuddly clown.see a.in response to rubie request,customs issued headquarters ruling letter hq,determining that the cute and cuddly clown would be classified as babies garments and clothing accessories with a duty rate of now percent ad valorem,while the other costumes imports or subject merchandise would be classified as festive articles,requiring entry under the general column one rate of duty.see hq june.
on july,rubie filed a domestic interested party petition,asserting classification of all imported textile costumes as articles of apparel in chapter or,htsus.see.rubie,the largest manufacturer of costumes in the united states,contended that virtually identical costumes to those manufactured by rubie were being imported into the united states and some of these textile costumes were being erroneously classified as festive articles,requiring treatment.customs published a notice of receipt of rubie petition and solicited written comments regarding the petition from interested parties.receipt of domestic interested party petition concerning tariff classification of textile costumes,see also a.the comment period closed on february,and customs received numerous comments in support of,and in opposition to,the reclassification.
in hq,customs denied rubie petition requesting reclassification and affirmed the classification in hq,in which four of the five textile costumes were classified as festive articles because they were found to be flimsy,and not normal articles of wearing apparel.see hq july.customs rejected rubie argument that imported costumes made of textiles should be classified under chapter or,htsus,as items of apparel.id.
hq reviewed the history of the classification of flimsy halloween costumes under both the htsus and its predecessor,the tariff schedules of the united states tsus.under the tsus,customs classified children costumes as toys and adult halloween costumes as wearing apparel.hq.this classification of adult costumes as wearing apparel was challenged by domestic importers in traveler trading united states.int l trade,which resulted in customs changing its position and classifying certain adult costumes as toys due to their flimsy construction and lack of utilitarian value.subsequent to the implementation of the htsus in,customs reversed its position and classified all textile costumes as wearing apparel.hq,see also hq,wl customs july.in september of,customs entered into a settlement agreement with traveler trading,settlement agreement,agreeing to classify all costumes of a flimsy nature and lacking in durability as festive articles.after entering into the settlement agreement,customs issued hq,classifying textile costumes of a flimsy nature and construction,lacking in durability,and generally recognized as not being normal articles of apparel as festive articles.hq,wl customs.

iii.discussion 
this case presents the question of whether hq,in which customs determined that textile costumes of a flimsy nature and construction,lacking in durability,and generally recognized as not being normal articles of apparel are classifiable as festive articles and hence qualify for treatment,merits skidmore deference because of its power to persuade.
the government and amicus curiae argue that hq should be accorded chevron deference,chevron natural res.def.council,d,because the classification ruling was published pursuant to a deliberative rulemaking process.in the alternative,the government argues that the court of international trade failed to afford hq skidmore deference by improperly substituting its own judgment for that of customs.specifically,the government argues that the imports are not fancy dress,of textiles,of chapter or emphasis added,because they are costumes of a flimsy nature and construction,lacking in durability,and generally recognized as not being normal articles of apparel.in contrast,the government contends note e refers to substantial costumes such as those worn by actors in the theater,formal wear worn to special events,or wearing apparel in the sense they are designed or constructed to be used for decency,comfort,adornment,or protection.
rubie responds that hq is entitled to minimal deference under skidmore,because note e,excluding fancy dress,of textiles,of chapter or from chapter,htsus,precludes classification of the imports as festive articles.specifically,rubie asserts that customs interpretation of the term fancy dress is erroneous because the term fancy dress is synonymous with the word costume.rubie,citing the explanatory notes to chapter,htsus,argues that the examples set forth as articles of fancy dress include only items that act as accessories to costumes but are not themselves fancy dress because they do not clothe the body.furthermore,rubie states that the durability of the costume is irrelevant to the determination whether a costume is an item of apparel.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that customs determination that imported textile costumes of a flimsy nature and construction,lacking in durability,and generally recognized as not being normal articles of apparel are classifiable as festive articles,merits deference under skidmore because of its power to persuade.
we first reject the argument of the government and amicus curiae that classification rulings published pursuant to a deliberative rulemaking process are entitled to chevron deference.the supreme court in mead considered the similar issue of whether a tariff classification ruling by the united states customs service deserves judicial deference.mead,at.in holding that classification rulings are entitled to skidmore deference,the court reasoned that customs classification rulings are best treated like interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines.they are beyond the chevron pale.id.at.quoting christensen harris county,d citation omitted.the court continued 
to agree with the court of appeals that customs ruling letters do not fall within chevron is not,however,to place them outside the pale of any deference whatever.chevron did nothing to eliminate skidmore holding that an agency interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form,given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to the agency,and given the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial understandings of what a national law requires.
id.at.quoting skidmore,at.citations omitted.
taking particular note of customs specialized experience in classifying goods,id.at,the court determined that a classification ruling may at least seek respect proportional to its power to persuade,id.quoting skidmore,at.citations omitted.the court stated that s uch a ruling may surely claim the merit of its writer thoroughness,logic and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.id.
although the classification ruling before the supreme court in mead was not issued in response to a domestic interested party petition,and therefore was not subject to a deliberative rulemaking process,we read the court holding as applying to all customs classification rulings.heartland,united states,see mead,at.the statutory changes requiring a period when customs determines that the matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of the domestic industry reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law,nor do they suggest any intent to create a chevron patchwork of classification rulings,some with force of law,some without.in sum,classification rulings are beyond the chevron pale.we therefore review hq,the classification ruling of the imports,in accordance with mead and skidmore.
mead indicates that the following factors are to be evaluated when determining the degree of deference to accord a customs classification ruling its writer thoroughness,logic and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.mead,at.those factors echo the factors set forth in skidmore for determining the weight to accord an administrative ruling,interpretation,or opinion 
we consider that the rulings,interpretations,and opinions of the administrator under this act,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.the weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give power to persuade,if lacking power to control.
at.applying these factors to the classification of the subject merchandise,we determine that hq is entitled to skidmore deference because of its power to persuade.
first,hq was adopted pursuant to a deliberative rulemaking process.customs published notice of rubie domestic interested party petition,with a description of the class of imported merchandise and the classification issue in dispute,in the federal register pursuant to.at.the notice provided the public with sixty days to comment on the classification issue raised by the petition and comments were received in response to the notice.at.thereafter,customs published a notice of denial in the federal register,specifically referencing and adopting hq,denying the petition for reclassification of the costumes as wearing apparel,and affirming their classification as festive articles.id.at.we therefore conclude that customs gave thorough consideration to hq.
second,we note that customs has specialized experience in classifying goods.mead,at.note e excludes fancy dress,of textiles,of chapter or from chapter,htsus.the relevant provision of the htsus,however,does not define the critical phrase fancy dress,of textiles,of chapter or.customs therefore had to interpret the phrase in order to distinguish between costumes of chapter festive articles and fancy dress of chapter or wearing apparel.see hq.customs determined that fancy dress of chapter or refers to elaborate or substantial costumes such as expensive,ballroom gowns,safari outfits,certain types of uniforms,and other adult garments.id.customs concluded that,while the imports have some characteristics of textile apparel,the flimsy and textile costumes whose principal intended use is for a one time festive occasion are distinct from wearing apparel which courts have held to be used for decency,comfort,adornment or protection.id.citations omitted.
because the htsus offers no definition for the term fancy dress,the court of international trade correctly consulted the common dictionary meaning of the term.see chems.united states.as the court of international trade found,the relevant definition of fancy dress is a costume as for a masquerade or party departing from conventional style and usu.representing a fictional or historical character,an animal,the fancy of the wearer,or a particular occupation.rubie costume,d at citing webster third new international dictionary.that the term fancy dress,as found by the court of international trade,includes costumes is plain enough however,a reading of the exclusion in note e to chapter,htsus,that focuses solely on the term fancy dress and turns a blind eye to the immediately following words of textiles,of chapter or construes the term fancy dress in disregard of the context of the exclusion as a whole.
fundamentally,courts interpret statutory language to carry out legislative intent.nippon kogaku usa,united states,ccpa.the first source for determining legislative intent is the statutory language.united states esso standard oil.the words in note e of textiles,of chapter or immediately following fancy dress,establish the context in which the term fancy dress is to be applied,and thereby circumscribe,qualify,and limit the type of fancy dress that was intended by the drafters to be excluded from chapter,htsus,to textile costumes falling within the purview of chapter or.thus,based on the common meaning of fancy dress and the ensuing language in note e,this court concludes that the exclusion to chapter,htsus,encompasses textile costumes that are classifiable as wearing apparel under chapter or.
an understanding of what is an article of apparel begins with the supreme court decision in arnold united states,where the court stated 
the term wearing apparel is not an uncommon one in statutes,and is used in an inclusive sense as embracing all articles which are ordinarily in general.
id.at.emphasis added.the customs court in antonio pompeo united states,cust,further developed this definition 
w earing apparel refers to clothes or coverings for the human body worn for decency or comfort and common knowledge indicates that adornment is also an element of many articles of wearing apparel.
cognizant of these definitions,customs classification ruling in hq is supported by a logical and explanation,a third factor lending further persuasiveness to its ruling.hq,as in hq,presents the correct classification as festive articles of flimsy,costumes having utility and used as well for festive occasions,based on functional or structural deficiencies as compared with the standard counterpart articles,wearing apparel.customs focused
