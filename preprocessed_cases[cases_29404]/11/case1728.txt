real party in interest and respondent eleven,eleven applied to the department of alcoholic beverage control department for a license to sell beer and wine at its store located within defendant and respondent city of lake forest city based on the number of other businesses that held liquor licenses in the area,the department would not act on the application without first receiving a determination from the city that public convenience or necessity would be served by issuance of the license to eleven.bus,subd.b.after investigating eleven application,the city determined issuing the license would serve public convenience or necessity,and the city forwarded its conclusion to the department.plaintiffs and appellants adam nick,sherry nick,and adam nick associates,collectively,nick filed the underlying action to obtain a writ of administrative mandamus compelling the city to set aside its public convenience or necessity decision.the trial court denied nick writ petition and entered judgment in favor of the city and eleven.
nick contends we must overturn the city public convenience or necessity determination for four reasons.finding each of nick reasons lacks merit,we affirm the trial court judgment.first,nick contends the city failed to make its determination within days of the department request as required by section,subdivision b,but the plain statutory language states the period begins when the city receives the request for a public convenience or necessity determination,not when the request is made.
second,nick contends the city resolution delegating authority to make the public convenience or necessity determination to the city planning commission and director of development services development director unconstitutionally changed the governing standard to public convenience and necessity.we do not interpret the resolution as changing the governing standard,and in any event reject this challenge because the resolution does not apply to the city council final determination.
third,nick contends the record lacks evidence showing issuance of the license to eleven would serve public convenience or necessity because eleven offers nothing different or unique in the sale of alcoholic beverages.nick misconstrues the governing legal standard.the city has broad discretion to determine what constitutes public convenience or necessity on a basis,and there is no single fact that must be established.the primary considerations are whether the city relied on reasonable factors based on the facts of the particular case,and whether substantial evidence supports its determination.because we conclude the city relied on reasonable factors supported by substantial evidence,we may not disturb its determination.
finally,nick contends the city denied him a fair hearing on his administrative appeals because the development director made the city initial public convenience or necessity determination and also acted as an advocate for eleven before the department.the record,however,shows the development director did not advocate on eleven behalf,but merely corrected erroneous information regarding the proximity of eleven store to a future public park site.
legal background 
the california constitution grants the department exclusive authority to issue licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages subject to any limitations the legislature enacts.cal,art.xx.the constitution further provides the department shall have the power,in its discretion,to deny,suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverage license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals ibid.
the department may not issue a liquor license if the issuance would result in or add to an undue concentration of licenses.issuance of a license to sell alcohol for consumption off the premises where it was sold,referred to as an license,results in an undue concentration when the ratio of retail licenses to population in the census tract or census division in which the applicant premises are located exceeds the ratio of retail licenses to population in the county in which the applicant premises are located,subd.a.
notwithstanding this prohibition,the department may issue a license that would result in an undue concentration of licenses if the local governing body of the area in which the applicant premises are located determines within days of notification of a completed application that public convenience or necessity would be served by the issuance,subd.b.the local governing body may delegate the public convenience or necessity determination to a subordinate officer or body.ibid.if the local governing body or its designee fails to act timely,the department may still issue the license provided it determines issuance would serve the public convenience or necessity.ibid.whether the local governing body or the department makes the public convenience or necessity determination,the ultimate decision to issue the license lies with the department.cal,art.xx,see,subd.b.
facts and procedural history 
eleven operates a convenience store in the city that sells grocery items,snack foods,beverages,including coffee,internet and video game cards,dvd,computer games,music,and paper and household goods.the store also features fresh baked foods prepared onsite,such as pizzas,chicken wings and tenders,potatoes,and hash browns.seeking to expand its offerings to include beer and wine,eleven applied to the department for an liquor license.
the department initially declined to act on eleven application because three other businesses operating in the same census tract already held liquor licenses,including a gas station and convenience store nick owned and operated across the street from eleven store.because issuing a license to eleven would result in an undue concentration of licenses,the department required eleven first to obtain a determination from the city that issuing the license would serve the public convenience or necessity.
the development director investigated eleven request and made the initial determination because the city previously passed resolution delegating all public convenience or necessity determinations either to the planning commission or the development director based on whether the applicant needed other city approvals.the development director concluded issuing the license to eleven would serve the public convenience or necessity.nick appealed to the planning commission.after conducting a public hearing,the planning commission also determined issuing the license would serve the public convenience or necessity.nick again appealed.
the city council conducted a public hearing on nick appeal.after considering the evidence submitted by nick and eleven,and public comments during the hearing,the city council voted to deny the appeal and independently decided that issuing the license was publicly convenient or necessary.nick then filed this action seeking a writ of administrative mandamus to overturn the city determination.the trial court refused to issue the requested writ,finding the record supported the city public convenience or necessity determination.the court entered judgment in the city favor and nick timely appealed.
discussiona.the city timely made its public convenience or necessity determination 
nick contends the city public convenience or necessity determination is void,meaningless,invalid,and ineffective because the city failed to act within the day time period established by section,subdivision b.according to nick,the day period began on june,when the department asked the city to make a public convenience or necessity determination on eleven license application,and therefore the city authority expired before the development director made the initial determination on october,we disagree.the statute plain language does not support his contention the day period commences when the department asked the city to make the determination.
interpreting section,subdivision b is a question of law we decide de novo.we begin by examining the words of the statute to determine the legislature intent.if unambiguous,the plain,commonsense meaning of those words controls.jenkins teegarden th.
contrary to nick contention,section,subdivision b day period does not commence upon the department ask ing the city to make a public convenience or necessity determination.that subdivision states,the day period shall commence upon receipt by the local governing body of a notification by the d epartment of an application for licensure,or b a completed application according to local requirements,if any,whichever is later.italics added.the record shows the city received eleven request on july,which is less than days before the city development director made the initial public convenience or necessity determination.the city treated eleven request as a completed application under its local requirements and therefore the day period began on july.
nick cites nothing in the record to show when the city received either the department notification of eleven application or eleven completed application under the city requirements.in his opening brief,nick claims the department furnished june,as the date on which it asked the city to make a public necessity or convenience determination for eleven application.not only is the department purported request not the trigger for the day period,but nick also fails to cite evidence in the record to show the department made any request to the city on june.we do not consider factual assertions lacking evidentiary support in the appellate record.lonely maiden productions,llc goldentree asset management,lp th,appellate court may treat factual assertion as waived if appellant fails to support it with record citations.
in his reply brief,nick abandons june,as the date on which he contends the day period commenced,and instead argues the evidence shows the city was considering eleven request for a public convenience or necessity determination long before july.to support this contention,nick asks us to augment the appellate record with four documents he obtained from the department through a request under the california public records act,et.we deny nick request to augment the record because he makes the request to support an argument he improperly asserts for the first time in his reply brief.see larson uhs of rancho springs,th,argument is forfeited where it is raised for the first time in appellant reply brief without a showing of good cause.
we also deny nick request to augment on the merits because the documents are irrelevant.the documents fail to show when the city received either notification from the department of eleven application or eleven completed application under the city requirements.instead,the documents relate to miscellaneous communications between the city and the department concerning an earlier application eleven submitted.
a few months before eleven applied for the liquor license at issue in this case,eleven submitted a separate liquor license application for the same convenience store,but incorrectly listed its street address.both the department and the city required eleven to submit a new application using the correct store address.based on this application,eleven requested a public convenience or necessity determination that the city received on july,and used as the trigger for the day period.nick presents no evidence or authority showing the city failed to timely act.fukuda city of angels cal th,administrative action is presumed correct under evidence code section,and therefore party challenging action has burden of producing evidence showing action was incorrect.
our conclusion the city timely made the public convenience or necessity determination on eleven application eliminates the need to address nick contention the expiration of the day period deprived the city of jurisdiction to make the determination,and also the city contention nick waived his timeliness challenge by failing to assert it in the trial court.
resolution is constitutional and does not affect the city final public convenience or necessity determination 
nick contends the city lacked legal authority to make the public convenience or necessity determination on eleven application because resolution unconstitutionally delegated to the planning commission and development director the authority to make that determination.according to nick,state law preempts resolution because the resolution changed the governing standard from public convenience or necessity to public convenience and necessity.we disagree.nick misinterprets the city resolution and fails to recognize the resolution had no impact on the city council adherence to the governing standard in ultimately deciding whether issuing a liquor license to eleven served the public convenience or necessity.
interpreting resolution is a question of law we independently review subject to the ordinary rules of statutory construction.county of humboldt mckee th,city of vista sutro th.our fundamental task is to ascertain the local governing body intent in adopting the resolution so we may effectuate the resolution purpose.mckee,at.we begin by examining the resolution language and adopt its plain meaning if the language is clear and unambiguous.people cruz cal th.the language is clear and unambiguous if the meaning assigned to it is not in conflict with other language in the same resolution.dubins regents of university of california th.when the language is ambiguous we employ the rules of statutory construction and extrinsic aids to ascertain the most reasonable interpretation.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,hughes.in doing so,we consider the resolution as a whole and accord prime consideration to the resolution objective.dubins,at.
we conclude resolution is ambiguous because it directs either the planning commission or the development director to determine whether issuing the liquor license would serve the public convenience and necessity,rather than the public convenience or necessity we therefore apply the rules of statutory construction to determine the city intent in passing resolution.other than the change in phrasing,nothing on the resolution face suggests the city intended to change the determination required by section,subdivision b.to the contrary,the resolution repeatedly declares the city intended to delegate the determination in a manner consistent with subdivision b.in making their determinations concerning eleven application,both the planning commission and the development director interpreted resolution as delegating to them the authority to make a public convenience or necessity determination.see smith superior court cal th,although not necessarily controlling,the contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by those charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight county of santa barbara connell th,courts give great weight and respect to the administrative agency interpretation of a statute governing its powers and responsibilities.
moreover,local enactments that conflict with state law are typically preempted and therefore void.a local enactment conflicts with state law when it duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.citations.city of stockton cal th,italics omitted.if the city intended to require a determination of public convenience and necessity,resolution would contradict and therefore conflict with state law.in interpreting the resolution,however,we must presume the city intended to act within the scope of its constitutional powers,and interpret the resolution in a manner,consistent with its language and purpose,that eliminates doubts as to the resolution constitutionality.hughes,cal th at bayscene resident negotiators bayscene mobilehome park th,if reasonably possible,legislation should be construed to preserve its constitutionality.accordingly,we reject nick contention and interpret resolution as delegating the authority to determine whether issuing a liquor license was a public convenience or necessity.interpreted in this manner,resolution is consistent with state law and all actions taken under its delegation are valid.
even if we interpreted resolution as conflicting with state law by modifying the governing standard under section,subdivision b,resolution did not affect the validity of the city final public convenience or necessity determination.resolution solely delegated authority to the planning commission and development director to make the section,subdivision b determination that otherwise would have rested with the city council as the city governing body.the resolution did not address the city council authority to make the public convenience or necessity determination,and did not impact the standards the city council applies in making that determination.under the city municipal code,the development director determination may be appealed to the planning commission,and the planning commission determination may be appealed to the city council.lake forest.on appeal from the planning commission decision,the city council conducts a de novo review and independently decides the matter.see id.at.accordingly,once nick appealed the planning commission public convenience or necessity determination to the city council,resolution became irrelevant.the city council independently made the public convenience or necessity determination under section,subdivision b.indeed,the city council resolution states it was deciding the appeal de novo and independently determined public convenience or necessity is served by issuance of an beer and wine license to eleven.capitalization omitted.any purported invalidity of resolution therefore does not affect the city final public convenience or necessity determination.
c.the city acted within the scope of its discretion and substantial evidence supports its public convenience or necessity determination 
nick contends we must overturn the city determination because the record lacks evidence showing the issuance of a liquor license to eleven would serve either the public convenience or necessity.we disagree.
as explained above,the california constitution confers broad discretion on the department in determining whether to issue a liquor license.cal,art.xx,department of alcoholic bev.control alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d,diez.that discretion extends to the determination whether issuance of a license would serve the public convenience or necessity.sepatis alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d,sepatis.
any factual findings the department makes to support a public convenience or necessity determination are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.sepatis,supra,d at.the department exercise of its discretion based upon its factual findings is reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard t he d epartment exercises a discretion adherent to the standard set by reason and reasonable people,bearing in mind that such a standard may permit a difference of opinion upon the same subject where the decision is the subject of choice within reason,the d epartment is vested with the discretion of making the selection which it deems proper its action constitutes a valid exercise of that discretion and the appeals board or the court may not interfere therewith.citations.where the determination of the d epartment is one which could have been made by reasonable people,the appeals board or the courts may not substitute a decision contrary thereto,even though such decision is equally or more reasonable in the premises.citations.citation.see department of alcoholic bev.control alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d,kolender diez,supra,d at.
the foregoing cases address the broad discretion vested in the department when it makes a public convenience or necessity determination,and the standard of review applicable to the department decision.the parties have not cited,and our research has not uncovered,case law addressing the standard a local governing body employs when making a public convenience or necessity determination.when the foregoing cases were decided,section required the department rather than the local governing body to determine whether issuance of a liquor license would serve the public convenience or necessity.sepatis,supra,d at.the legislature amended the business and professions code in to add section,which requires the local governing body to make the public convenience or necessity determination.stats,ch.because the city made its determination in aid of the department exercise of its discretion to decide whether to issue a liquor license,we conclude the city may exercise the same level of discretion as allowed to the department in the foregoing cases,and therefore the city exercise of that discretion is subject to the same standard of review.
section does not define the phrase public convenience or necessity,and therefore the discretion to make that decision includes the discretion to determine the relevant factors on a basis.sepatis,supra,d at.provided the decision maker does not act arbitrarily or rely on factors that are not supported by substantial evidence,the determination of what constitutes public convenience or necessity will not be disturbed.id.at see kolender,supra,d at diez,supra,d at.
for example,in sepatis,a business owner applied to the department for a liquor license to operate a bar in an area unduly concentrated with other bars.the proposed bar differed from the other bars because it was housed in a renovated victorian building with large windows and the owner planned to operate it as a fern bar marked by an ambience of ferns and other plants.sepatis,supra,d at.the department issued the license,finding the proposed premises will appeal to all segments of the community including many residents and business people in the area who are presently reluctant to enter other bars in the vicinity,and that it would thus serve public convenience or necessity.ibid.the alcoholic beverage control appeals board appeals board reversed and denied the application because,in determining the existence of public convenience or necessity the d epartment may not concern itself with the physical appearance of the structure housing a licensed premises nor the esthetic features thereof and it is not appropriate to consider the fact that an applicant would cater to a particular segment of the public or that a certain group of persons does not feel comfortable in the presence of some other group of persons at other licensed premises.id.at.
the court of appeal reversed the appeals board decision and reinstated the department decision based on the broad discretion vested in the department to determine what constitutes public convenience or necessity.the sepatis court concluded the department was free to consider any reasonable factor under the circumstances and supported by substantial evidence the department finding that the proposed premises will appeal to all segments of the community including many residents and business people in the area who are presently reluctant to enter other bars in the vicinity is supported by substantial evidence on this record,and we can not say that the department abused its constitutional or statutory discretion in considering that fact as an aspect of public convenience sepatis,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
here,the city concluded issuing the license to eleven would serve the public convenience or necessity because eleven business is consistent with applicable zoning regulations eleven provides a wide variety of items for sale in addition to alcohol and will provide a convenient location for the public to shop for necessities while also purchasing alcohol the store location and design prevent unviewed loitering eleven has developed and implemented effective crime deterrence programs eleven is an experienced convenience store operator with more than locations nationwide eleven provides the latest trend of online video games,dvd,computer games and compact discs eleven offers its exclusive private label line of products that allows customers to purchase products at a lower cost,which is a substantial benefit given the current economic downturn and the local police concluded issuing the license would not create a law enforcement problem.
substantial evidence supports each of these findings and we see nothing arbitrary in the city basing its public convenience or necessity deter
