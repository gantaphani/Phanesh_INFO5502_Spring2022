background 
a.the parties 
this case involves three corporations,the first of which,appellee nls,is both incorporated and has its principal place of business in new hampshire.miles russell is the president and owner of nls,which is in the business of distributing laminate components for printed circuit boards.the second corporation,american board companies abc,was a manufacturer and fabricator of printed circuit boards.abc was incorporated in new york,and maintained a manufacturing facility in vestal,new york.abc was an affiliate by common ownership of the third corporation involved,the matco electronics group matco,a delaware corporation.matco was an administrative and materials procurement corporation,the subsidiaries of which included contract manufacturers,designers,and assemblers of printed circuit boards.at all relevant times,appellant davis,an individual who resides in vestal,new york,served as secretary,treasurer,chief financial officer,and director of matco and all of the matco affiliates including abc.
b.the relevant contacts 
on or about january,nls and matco entered into an agreement pursuant to which nls furnished laminate components to abc.the components were shipped nls new hampshire facility,with invoices providing that new hampshire law governed.under the terms of the agreement,nls would transport the components to the abc manufacturing facility in new york,where nls would keep,maintain,and periodically replenish the stock of components.abc,on an basis,would draw its raw materials from that stock and issue corresponding purchase orders.nls would then,in turn,prepare and issue invoices to abc.the payment terms of the agreement required that abc issue weekly checks to nls in new hampshire satisfying all invoiced charges that were or more days old.
september meeting in new york 
concerned over increasingly delinquent payments by abc to nls,nls president miles russell faxed a letter on september,to james matthews,the president and sole shareholder of matco,abc,and the matco affiliates,requesting a meeting to discuss abc financial condition.russell concluded the letter by stating w ithout such a meeting,i must inform you that i will need to significantly alter the terms with which our two organizations currently conduct business.russell copied davis on the letter.
in response,davis invited russell to meet with him at matco new york offices on september,russell drove from new hampshire to new york to meet with davis as arranged.at the time of the meeting,the balance owed by abc to nls was.during the meeting,russell claims that davis made six relevant representations matco was committed to the support of abc matco would be willing to guarantee abc payment of debt obligations owed to nls the abc payment delinquencies were not cash flow related,but rather were occasioned by logistical problems,including centralization of administrative functions,understaffing in the department charged with addressing accounts payable,and the relatively small size of the vendor nls matco and its affiliates on a consolidated basis were profitable matco and its affiliates on a consolidated basis were rapidly growing and davis,as treasurer of matco,would furnish nls with consolidated financial statements for matco and its affiliates within a period of a few weeks following the meeting.
at the end of the meeting,davis gave russell a check in the amount of,which reduced the outstanding balance owed to nls from to,and as a result of what had transpired,russell agreed that nls would continue to provide abc the laminate components pursuant to their agreement.
at trial,russell claimed that davis failed to disclose during their meeting that matco and its affiliates including abc had liabilities that vastly exceeded their assets had suffered millions of dollars in losses during the preceding three years were in rapid financial decline had negative working capital had almost no available cash and had,for the preceding four months,stood in default of a fifty million dollar line of credit that was secured by all of the companies assets,including their inventory,cash,receivables and equipment and that a fourth forbearance agreement was due to expire on the day following the september meeting 
unaware of this impending financial doom,after the september meeting,nls continued to extend credit to abc.
september letter from davis to russell 
on september,as a to the september,meeting,davis sent a letter from new york to nls in new hampshire,reiterating his commitment to meet nls payment terms and assur ing nls that matco stands behind this commitment and all confirmed obligations of abc to nls.davis then concluded the letter if there is ever a n issue with payment,simply send me an 
on october,matco lender,national bank of canada,notified davis via telephone followed up by an october faxed letter that a subsequent forbearance agreement would not be renewed and that no further forbearance would take place.davis never notified nls of the lender intentions,and abc continued to draw raw material from nls stock.then,an abc check in the amount of,payable to the order of nls and dated october,was returned to nls unpaid with a return to maker stamp dated october.
on october,russell took davis up on his invitation in the september letter to send him an if there is ever a n issue with payment in the,sent by russell in new hampshire to davis in new york,russell stated that c urrently,we have not seen a check in three weeks and the last check we did receive has been returned to nls with a return to maker marking our agreement calls for a weekly check paying all invoices days old or older.currently is due through next monday,including the amount of the check that has been returned.russell went on to note that davis accounts payable staff had indicated to him that matco has encountered a problem with its line of credit facility and that this problem should be cleared up by the end of the week.russell then asked that davis update russell on the situation and told davis that he had not yet received the financial statements that davis agreed to forward following the september meeting.
on november,davis responded to russell in new hampshire by an sent from new york.in that,davis stated that a bout two weeks ago,our bank group disallowed a substantial receivable,which backed us into an overadvance.they then began returning checks and to date have only allowed us to fund payroll.we are working very hard to correct this situation.he then stated i assure you this situation was totally unexpected and we are doing everything possible to protect our suppliers.
russell testified that as a result of this,he sent a memorandum by facsimile to davis informing him that the consignment stock was not to be used and that it was to be returned to nls as soon as possible the balance due to nls upon termination of the consignment relationship was.
subsequent to the termination of the consignment relationship,nls did not receive any further payments from abc or matco on the past due amount,nor any explanation for the lack of payment from davis.nls attempted on numerous occasions to telephone davis with no success.on november,nls sent an from new hampshire to davis in new york,stating y ou ignored numerous telephone calls.i would appreciate an update on matco situation positive or negative.
in response,davis that he had not intentionally ignored russell calls,and that he had been working diligently on solutions.he said that w e have a consulting team now involved and our focus has been on our options,including equity,refinancing.we will be presenting our cash plan to our current bank group next week.hopefully they will free up advances to our vendors.again,we are trying to do all posible sic to protect our exposure.
c.the proceedings 
after receiving davis last,russell testified that davis language,for the first time,suggested that matco and abc were in serious financial trouble.in response,nls filed suit against matco and abc in rockingham county new hampshire superior court,and matco removed the case to the district court of new hampshire.see northern laminate sales,matco elecs.group,civil action.chief judge barbadoro entered an order of judgment on february,in favor of nls in the amount of plus interest in accordance with a stipulation for judgment.abc initially made installment payments to nls pursuant to the judgment totaling,but then stopped making payments.on january,nls commenced suit against matco for the balance.see northern laminate sales,matco elecs.group,civil action.matco failed to plead or otherwise defend the suit within the time permitted by federal rule of civil procedure a a and a default judgment was entered against matco.matco did not make any payments on the judgment,and on february,several other matco creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against matco and its affiliates.in an attempt to collect the balance due from abc,nls filed the instant suit against davis personally,alleging that nls suffered its financial damages as a result of davis fraudulent negligent misrepresentations concerning the creditworthiness of matco and abc davis filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction,which the district court denied.
nls case against davis went to a jury,which found for nls on the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims and awarded damages in the amount of.this amount represents the difference between the amount due on the account at the time nls stopped providing goods to abc and the amount collected through the prior legal proceeding against matco and abc.
davis filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b or in the alternative for a new trial,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule.the district court denied davis motion,and davis filed this timely appeal claiming that the district court erred in finding jurisdiction over his person and that the jury incorrectly calculated the amount of damages.we address each claim in turn.
ii.personal jurisdiction 
davis contends that the district court did not have jurisdiction over his person because the only relevant contact between himself,a new york resident,and new hampshire,the location of the suit,was the impact of the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations he made during his september,meeting with russell in new york.davis further argues that any other contacts between himself in new york and russell in new hampshire are irrelevant because these communications have no nexus with the fraud davis also claims that although he does not dispute the district court choice of the prima facie method for determining jurisdiction at the stage,after trial,the district court erred in not utilizing a preponderance of the evidence standard.we review the district court application of the prima facie standard de novo,babcock wilcox canada,cir,and after a discussion of the relevant new hampshire law on personal jurisdiction and the federal constitutional limitations on new hampshire exercise of that jurisdiction,we find that the district court correctly determined that it had personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
method of determining personal jurisdiction 
a district court,faced with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.b,may choose from among several methods for determining whether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that court personal jurisdiction over the defendant.daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson poole,cir.the district court here chose the most common of these methods,the prima facie method,which permits the district court to consider only whether the plaintiff has proffered evidence that,if credited,is enough to support findings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction,at quoting boit,cir.as noted above,at least with respect to the original motion to dismiss,the parties do not object to the district court choice of the prima facie method.
davis motion re jurisdiction 
after the jury returned the verdict against davis,davis moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and in the alternative,for a new trial.in this motion,davis reraise d and incorporate d his previous arguments and memoranda setting forth his basis and argument for contesting the court has personal jurisdiction.davis offered no additional argumentation,and did not anywhere state that he was requesting the district court review its jurisdictional determination in light of the fact that the jurisdictional evidence had changed as a result of findings made at trial.the district court treated this as a request to reconsider davis original motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and stated that it believe d the analysis made in the order denying davis motion to dismiss was correct on the submissions made and it would not reconsider it.davis contends on appeal that the judge ruling during the trial for purposes of nls new hampshire consumer protection claim that the september letter was not inextricably entwined with the misrepresentations made during the september meeting,rendered the letter irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes and thus there are insufficient contacts to establish jurisdiction in new hampshire davis made no such argument below.
we begin by noting that the denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint for a lack of jurisdiction over the defendant person is not a final adjudication and generally is not appealable on an interlocutory basis.charles alan wright and arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.and,a party who has unsuccessfully raised an objection under rule b may proceed to trial on the merits without waiving the ability to renew the objection to the court jurisdiction.id.thus,it is generally the case that where there has been an unsuccessful challenge to personal jurisdiction in a motion,the losing party must wait until final judgment is entered before appealing the denial of the dismissal.see id.
when a party makes a motion a lack of personal jurisdiction,the party may request,or the judge may determine on his own,to make the jurisdictional inquiry in light of the facts that were revealed at trial using a preponderance of the evidence standard.and,as we stated in boit 
any standard the trial court applies,other than the prima facie standard,will to some extent involve weighing evidence to make findings either under a preponderance or under a likelihood standard,exercising discretion,or both.review of any findings or discretionary determination will be deferential rather than de novo.of course,review of the district court legal conclusion as to whether the findings support personal jurisdiction will be nondeferential.
however,where,as here,the party simply requests the judge to revisit the judge initial ruling on the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and makes no argument to the judge why the jurisdictional facts have changed as a result of the trial,the judge is not required to advance such argument for the moving party.the district court here treated davis perfunctory request to revisit the motion as a motion for reconsideration and we find no error in that decision.furthermore,it is not clear from the record that the district judge ruling on the september letter for purposes of the consumer protection claim had any bearing on the consideration of that letter for jurisdictional purposes.therefore,in evaluating the district court reasoning on the original motion to dismiss,we accept the court choice of the prima facie method.see daynard,at.
the prima facie method 
under the prima facie method,the plaintiff has the burden of making a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.daynard,at.in daynard,we set forth the relevant analysis 
we must accept the plaintiff properly documented evidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of determini
