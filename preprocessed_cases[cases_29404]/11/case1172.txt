this case addresses unsolicited commercial,more commonly referred to as spam.while ignored by most and reviled by some,spam is largely considered a nuisance and a source of frustration to users who,at times,must wade through inboxes clogged with messages peddling assorted,and often unwanted,products and services.the rising tide of spam poses an even greater problem to businesses,institutions,and other entities through network slowdowns,server crashes,and increased costs.at the same time,commercial enterprise has staked its claim within the online world.the internet is a unique medium that offers legitimate businesses a means to promote themselves and their wares and in turn fosters competition in the marketplace.both consumers and congress have come to view,when fairly employed,as an established and worthwhile device in the toolbox of accepted marketing practices.
after individual states initially wrestled with properly balancing the benefits and burdens of commercial,congress enacted legislation in an effort to curb the negative consequences of spam and spamming practices without stifling legitimate commerce.through this opinion we review the federal statutory scheme of the controlling the assault of pornography and marketing act of,et,and assume the formidable task of determining the statutory standing requirements and the scope of federal preemption intended by congress.
in the case before us,james gordon,and his company,omni innovations,llc omni sued virtumundo,adknowledge,and scott lynn,the sole shareholder of both companies,seeking injunctive relief and significant damages based on the receipt of thousands of commercial.defendants are in the online marketing business and widely transmit advertisements and solicitations to potential consumers on behalf of clients.in the parlance of our time,they are spammers.
based on a dense record developed through substantial discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of virtumundo,adknowledge,and lynn collectively,virtumundo on all of gordon claims.we have jurisdiction over gordon appeal pursuant to.having carefully and independently evaluated the issues in light of the evidence,we agree that summary judgment was proper and therefore affirm.
gordon is the original registrant of the internet domain,which he hosts on server space that omni leases from godaddy,a domain registrar and web hosting company that also sells related software and services,see.the godaddy service allows users to virtually access the server through an ordinary internet gordon case,a broadband connection from verizon.through a virtual desktop called a plesk,gordon is able to manage his domain.he can post content on the internet,create new accounts,and set user names and passwords.there are,of course,substantial restrictions regarding gordon usage of the leased server space.
it was through this vehicle that gordon created a personal address around september,gordon created additional accounts through the domain for about six friends and family members,which he monitored for data collection and research purposes.gordon registered and the addresses of his clients in response to various online promotions and for numerous prize giveaways.gordon estimates that,in doing so,he subscribed,or opted in,to mailing lists somewhere between and times 
soon thereafter,these accounts began receiving from businesses marketing their goods and services.some of these messages were transmitted by online marketers,such as virtumundo,on behalf of their clients.at his instruction,gordon clients relinquished control of their accounts.they then set up their own domains through godaddy,which they housed on the server space leased by omni.this enabled these individuals to create their own addresses personalized domain,and rather than.
gordon continued to maintain and monitor the abandoned accounts.he described his ongoing efforts as do ing research on the spam that comes through.at some later point,gordon configured the server to provide an automated response to all commercial sent to accounts.the response was titled notice of offer to receive unsolicited commercial email spam and purported to consummate a binding contract by which the sender agreed to either cease and desist or pay gordon for each additional unsolicited subsequently delivered to the account.while he claims that online marketers,including virtumundo,ignored his requests that all addresses be removed from their mailing lists,gordon does not provide evidence,apart from a general belief,that he followed the procedure stated in the individual messages.not surprisingly,the accounts continued to receive spam,which over time accumulated in the unused inboxes.at the time of his deposition in january,these accounts remained active.however,the only persons who actually used a account were gordon and his wife.
in,gordon began filing lawsuits in state and federal court against persons and companies who sent solicitations or advertisements to accounts hosted on omni leased server space.in february,gordon filed this lawsuit against virtumundo in the western district of washington.he asserted various causes of action for violations of the act,et,the washington commercial electronic mail act cema.et,the washington consumer protection act cpa.et,and the washington prize statute.et.as relevant to this appeal,gordon contends that virtumundo sent,according to his most recent estimate,approximately materially misleading or otherwise unlawful commercial messages to accounts hosted through.gordon sought injunctive relief,several millions of dollars in statutory and treble damages,and his attorney fees and costs 
in december,the honorable john coughenour granted in part and denied in part virtumundo motion to dismiss for pleading deficiencies.the order dismissed gordon prize statute claims,in their entirety,and his cema and cpa claims to the extent they related to the gathering of personally identifying information.the court gave leave to amend the complaint to cure pleading deficiencies,but gordon never did so.
virtumundo then moved for summary judgment on all remaining claims,which consisted of gordon act claims and the surviving cema and cpa claims.by order dated may,the district court granted the defense motion,see gordon virtumundo,wl.may.judge coughenour concluded that both gordon and omni lacked standing to pursue a private action under the act and that the state law claims failed as a matter of law based in part on federal preemption grounds.

we first turn to gordon act claims.the act became effective on january,and was enacted in response to mounting concerns associated with the rapid growth of spam.congress determined 
there is a substantial governmental interest in regulation of commercial electronic mail on a nationwide basis 
senders of commercial electronic mail should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of such mail and 
recipients of commercial electronic mail have a right to decline to receive additional commercial electronic mail from the same source.
b the act does not ban spam outright,but rather provides a code of conduct to regulate commercial messaging practices.stated in general terms,the act prohibits such practices as transmitting messages with deceptive subject headings or header information that is materially false or materially misleading.see a.the act also imposes requirements regarding content,format,and labeling.for instance,unsolicited messages must include the sender physical postal address,indicate they are advertisements or solicitations,and notify recipients of their ability to decline further mailings.a.moreover,in order to comply with the act,each message must have either a functioning return address or a comparable mechanism that allows a recipient to opt out of future mailings.a 
the act enforcement provision empowers the federal trade commission,state attorneys general,and other state and federal agencies to pursue legal actions to enforce the act provisions.a,b,f.congress also provided a limited private right of action,which states a provider of internet access service adversely affected by a violation of a,b,or d,or a pattern or practice that violates a through of the act may bring a civil action in any district court to enjoin further violation by a defendant or to recover either actual or statutory damages,whichever is greater.g.statutory damages under the act are substantial and can equal as much as per unlawful g.the act also authorizes an award of attorneys fees and costs against any party at the district court discretion.g.
therefore,in any private action claiming act violations,a threshold issue is whether the plaintiff satisfies the statutory standing requirements.on its motion for summary judgment,virtumundo challenged gordon and omni ability to pursue a private action under g.the district court conducted a thorough analysis of the existing case law,the act itself,and the legislative history.based upon the facts of the summary judgment record,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had not demonstrated adequate,an adverse effect,as the district court called therefore lacked standing with respect to these federal claims.gordon,wl,at.
we agree that gordon lacks standing to bring a private action under the act.we commend the district court pioneering analysis in this uncharted territory,and reach a similar conclusion based on our assessment of the act statutory standing requirement and the appellate record.
as recognized by several courts,the case law regarding the relevant legal standards under the act is scant,asis internet servs.optin global,wl,at,and few courts have construed the standing provision,asis internet servs.active response group,wl,at.july.neither we nor any of our sister circuits have comprehensively addressed this issue.we endeavor to do so here,at least in part.
we begin by acknowledging that the standing inquiry involves two general components whether the plaintiff is an internet access service provider ias provider,and whether the plaintiff was adversely affected by statutory violations.see,brosnan alki mortgage,llc,wl,at.beyond that,however,the statutory standing provision read as a whole is point upon which all parties agree.we therefore employ familiar techniques of statutory construction to evaluate congress intent with regard to both components and their relation to one another.
while over time courts have developed various canons to assist with statutory interpretation,this is an area in which absolutist rules do not always lead to sensible or accurate results.graham red squirrel madigan,cir.i t is,after all,the duty of a court in construing a law to consider the circumstances under which it was passed and the object to be accomplished by it.united states.mines,cir quoting united states anderson,wall.accord callejas mcmahon,cir.therefore,especially in this highly technical and evolving field,c ommon sense not dogma is what is needed in order to explore the actual meaning of legislative enactments.graham red squirrel,at.
there are a few points that heavily influence our analysis,which we identify at the outset.first,despite what gordon and likeminded enthusiasts might contend,the purpose of the act was not to stamp spam out of existence.while gordon is likely not alone in his hostility toward spam and those who profit from it,there are beneficial aspects to commercial,even bulk messaging,that congress wanted to preserve,if not promote.indeed,the act recognizes value as a worthwhile commercial tool 
electronic mail has become an extremely important and popular means of communication,relied on by millions of americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial purposes.its low cost and global reach make it extremely convenient and efficient,and offer unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce.
a see also,at,as reprinted in,unlike direct mail delivered through the post office to consumers,can reach millions of individuals at little to no cost and almost instantaneously.the tailored regulations,which target deceptive and predatory practices and attempt to alleviate the negative effects of spam without unduly stifling lawful enterprise,embody the fine balance struck by congress.
second,congress conferred standing only on a narrow group of possible plaintiffs the federal trade commission,certain state and federal agencies,state attorneys general,and ias providers adversely affected by violations of the act.see a,b,f,g.the decision to restrict the right of action does not reflect an indifference or insensitivity to the effects of spam on consumers.the contrary is true.the act express findings and legislative history are littered with references to the burdens shouldered by individuals,businesses,and other institutions.the act itself recognizes the costs to recipients for the storage of unsolicited commercial,or for the time spent accessing,reviewing,and discarding such mail,or both.a.we surmise that congress intent was to limit enforcement actions to those best suited to detect,investigate,and,if appropriate,prosecute violations of the to efficiently and effectively pursue legal actions against persons engaged in unlawful practices and enforce federal law for the benefit of all consumers.
third,our review of the congressional record reveals a legitimate concern that the private right of action be circumscribed and confined to a narrow group of private plaintiffs section g provides for a limited right of action by bona fide internet service providers.cong.rec,remarks of dingell emphasis added accord id.at remarks of tauzin.it is perhaps a sad reality that congress must specify a bona fide ias provider,as possibly distinct from a ias provider.but this demonstrates to us that lawmakers were wary of the possibility,if not the likelihood,that the siren song of substantial statutory damages would entice opportunistic plaintiffs to join the fray,which would lead to undesirable results.while congress did not intend that standing be limited to operations we think it did intend to exclude plaintiffs who,despite certain identifying characteristics,did not provide the actual,bona fide service of a legitimate operation.see cong.rec.w e intend that internet access service providers provide actual internet access service to customers.we believe that congress clear intention to restrict private action remains of great importance and guides the proper standing analysis.
fourth and finally,we must factor into the calculus the unique nature of the subject matter at issue.especially in this arena,the engine of innovation moves far more quickly and nimbly than the methodical pace of legislation.that is readily apparent here.in the few years since the act became effective,the uses of the internet and the prevalence and variety of available online services have multiplied exponentially.the marketplace has developed a panoply of related products and services not available when congress authored the federal legislation.significantly,no longer are typical internet users primarily limited to accessing accounts and searching for content or information.with the rise of social networking sites,blogs,and other websites,the ability to post content on the internet or to create forums for others to do so is no longer a privilege reserved for the technologically savvy or the financially elite.the rate of development will only accelerate.as this inevitably occurs and the gateway to the online world further widens for the masses,courts should be mindful that the lines congress intended to draw when drafting the statutory text might lose clarity.
with these principles in mind,we apply a standing analysis that encapsulates congress will when it provided a limited private right of action.
we first address whether gordon is a provider of internet access service who,if adversely affected by a statutory violation,has private standing to bring act claims.the act defines internet access service by reference to the communications act,see,which provides 
the term internet access service means a service that enables users to access content,information,electronic mail,or other services offered over the internet,and may also include access to proprietary content,information,and other services as part of a package of services offered to consumers.such term does not include telecommunications services.
e.we have not previously spoken as to who is an internet access service provider within the meaning of the act,see ferguson quinstreet,wl,at,and note the ambiguity of this statutory definition.
district courts in our circuit have interpreted the definition of internet access service broadly to encompass a wide range of services,and not merely traditional internet service providers isps,the service that connects customers to the internet itself.see hypertouch,wl,at.march,stating that a provider of service alone,without any other services,qualifies as an ias provider under the act.for instance,one such court reasoned that,although the definition appears primarily to contemplate services that provide consumers their initial connection point to the internet,the language is broad enough to encompass entities such as facebook,a popular social networking site,that provide further access to content and communications between users for persons who may initially access the internet through a conventional isp.facebook,connectu llc,d,see also myspace,v.the,wl,at,holding that myspace had standing under the act and interpreting the definition of internet access service broadly to include traditional isps,any email provider,and even most website owners.gordon claims status,asserting that through the domain and the leased server space he enables users to access internet content and.on a superficial level,this proposition is hard to dispute.in the most general terms,a service that enables users to access online content or could encompass the proprietor of an internet coffee shop or,as one district court suggested,any person who allows another person to use their computer to access the internet,ferguson,wl,at.indeed,at some level,common utility services play a role in enabling users to access internet content.without question,this was not what congress intended when it was defining the private right of action.
while we agree that statutory standing is not limited to traditional isps,we reject any overly broad interpretation of internet access service that ignores congressional intent.contrary to gordon suggestion,providing accounts can not alone be sufficient.many employers and institutions,for example,provide their employees or members with accounts and our court.the findings codified in the statute note congress concern pertaining to the growth of unsolicited commercial and its imposition of monetary costs on providers of internet access services,which have standing to sue,as well as on businesses,and educational and nonprofit institutions that carry and receive such mail.a.clearly,congress viewed ias providers as distinct from entities that merely carry or receive such mail.standing under the act requires more.see,white buffalo ventures,llc of texas at austin,cir w e are to find that providing email accounts and email access does not bring the university of texas within the statutory definition emphasis added.there may well be a technical or hardware component implicit in the definition.but,we find the parties briefing on the topic inadequate to reach an informed decision here.because it is not necessary to our holding,we decline this opportunity to set forth a general test or define the outer bounds of what it means to be a provider of internet access service.
nevertheless,we conclude that gordon does not fit any reasonable definition of internet access service provider.gordon is a registrant of a domain name,which he,through omni,hosts on leased server space.he neither has physical control over nor access to the hardware,which godaddy owns,houses,maintains,and configures.from our review of the record,gordon service appears to be limited to using his plesk control panel,which he accesses via an ordinary internet connection through an isp,to set up accounts and passwords and to execute other administrative tasks.verizon enables his online access.godaddy provides the service that enables ordinary consumers to create accounts,register domain names,and build personalized web pages.gordon has simply utilized that service for himself and on behalf of others.it matters not that he entered the keystrokes or clicked the mouse.nor is it relevant that he created addresses for family and friends,and not merely himself.while verizon and godaddy might have a compelling argument that they are ias providers within the meaning of the act,gordon claim that he holds such elite status is unconvincing.
in addition to his nominal role in providing services,we are also troubled by the extent to which gordon fails to operate as a bona fide provider.as discussed in greater detail below,gordon has purposefully avoided taking even minimal efforts to avoid or block spam messages.instead,gordon devotes his resources to adding his clients addresses to mailing lists and accumulating spam through a variety of means for the purpose of facilitating litigation.
gordon arguments of technical compliance with this standing component,without any regard for the overarching congressional purpose,are not compelling.the record here is sufficiently developed.we hold that gordon is not an internet access service provider within the meaning of the act.
we next turn to the adversely affected by component of the act standing inquiry.gordon has undoubtedly encountered a large volume of commercial.this,however,is not enough to establish statutory standing.in order to pursue a private right of action,an ias provider must demonstrate that it has been adversely affected by a violation of or a pattern or practice that violates the act.g emphasis added.as with other issues on this appeal,we find little guidance in existing case law as to the meaning of the nebulous text.
the act itself does not delineate the types of harm suggested by the adversely affected by language.the district court,acknowledging this ambiguity,confronted the question by reference to traditional methods of statutory interpretation and ultimately concluded that the harm must be both real and of the type uniquely experienced by iass for standing to exist.gordon,wl,at emphasis added to our knowledge,all courts that have addressed the issue have similarly concluded that the type of harm envisioned by congress did not encompass the ordinary inconveniences experienced by consumers and end users.see active response,wl,at.we have considered the statutory text and the legislative record,and we agree.
it is notable that congress conferred standing only on adversely affected ias providers,but not adversely affected consumers.logically,the harms redressable under the act must parallel the limited private right of action and therefore should reflect those types of harms uniquely encountered by ias providers.the committee report identified the cost of investing in new equipment to increase capacity and customer service personnel to deal with increased subscriber complaints and maintaining filtering systems and other technology on their networks to reduce the deluge of spam as undesirable consequences facing the typical isp,at.all courts that have construed the statute have similarly defined the harms upon which standing may be predicated to include network crashes,higher bandwidth utilization,and increased costs for hardware and software upgrades,network expansion and additional personnel.active response,wl,at.we conclude that these sorts of harms are what congress had in mind 
we do not purport to enumerate each and every harm that might satisfy the act standing provision.nor do we suggest that the list is finite.at minimum,however,the harm must be both real and of the type experienced by isps.while the harm need not be significant in the sense that it is grave or serious,the harm must be of significance to a bona fide ias beyond the mere annoyance of spam and greater than the negligible burdens typically borne by an ias provider in the ordinary course of business.in most cases,evidence of some combination of operational or technical impairments and related financial costs attributable to unwanted commercial would suffice.see hypertouch,wl,at finding evidence of decreased server response and crashes,higher bandwidth utilization,and expensive hardware and software upgrades sufficient harm for statutory standing.
courts must of course be careful to distinguish the ordinary costs and burdens associated with operating an internet access service from actual harm.we expect a legitimate service provider to secure adequate bandwidth and storage capacity and take reasonable precautions,such as implementing spam filters,as part of its normal operations.courts should take an especially hard look at the cited harm if it suspects at the outset that a plaintiff is not operating a bona fide internet access service,as is the case here.
defining the type of harm required for act standing is,however,only one part of the equation.section g also inquires whether the contemplated harm is attributable to the type of practices circumscribed by the,whether an ias provider was adversely affected by misconduct.after all,network slowdowns,server crashes,increased bandwidth usage,and hardware and software upgrades bear no inherent relationship to spam or spamming practices.on the contrary,we expect these issues to arise as a matter of course and for legitimate reasons as technology,online media,and internet services continue to advance and develop.therefore,evidence of what could be routine business concerns and operating costs is not alone sufficient to unlock the treasure trove of the act statutory damages.
to give the statutory text meaning there must be,at bare minimum,a demonstrated relationship between purported harms and the type of practices regulated by the,a showing that the identified concerns are linked in some meaningful way to unwanted spam and,in turn,represent actual harm.the at issue in a particular case must,at the very least,contribute to a larger,collective spam problem that caused harms 
we note,in passing,that the threshold of standing should not pose a high bar for the legitimate service operations contemplated by congress.in some civil,for example,isps or plainly legitimate internet access service providers file harm might be presumed because any reasonable person would agree that such entities dedicate considerable resources to and incur significant financial costs in dealing with spam.see,at recounting reports by america online,microsoft,and earthlink regarding the effects of increasing volumes of spam.where,by comparison,a private plaintiff status as an ias provider is questionable and reasonably contested,courts should not only inquire into the plaintiff purported service operations but also closely examine the alleged harms attributable to spam.we have confidence in our district courts to review the individual characteristics of the plaintiffs on a basis and make a reasoned decision whether a purported ias provider is truly the type of bona fide ias provider adversely affected by commercial messaging that congress envisioned when it enacted the act.
in opposition to virtumundo summary judgment motion,gordon argued that he had been adversely affected by spam because he and his clients had been forced to wade through thousands of sent by virtumundo that clogged his service.applying the proper interpretation of the act standing provision,we conclude that gordon also fails the adversely affected by component.it is readily apparent that gordon,an individual who seeks out spam for the very purpose of filing lawsuits,is not the type of private plaintiff that congress had in mind when it fashioned g standing provision.while many enthusiasts may applaud his zealous against alleged spammers,gordon passion for the cause does not displace the will of congress in drafting a narrow private right of federal action.
gordon has failed to argue,let alone come forth with evidence,that,even if he was an ias provider,he has suffered any real harm contemplated by the act.he has not hired additional personnel,nor has he experienced technical concerns or incurred costs that can be necessarily attributed to commercial.it is also compelling that gordon purposefully refuses to implement spam filters in a typical manner or otherwise make any attempt to block allegedly unwanted spam or exclude such messages from users inboxes.in fact,gordon acknowledges that he was able to blacklist domain names at the server level,so that the godaddy server would reject from online marketers such as virtumundo.still,even without taking even basic precautions,he has not come close to using the gigabytes of bandwidth available to him through godaddy.he has presented nothing beyond the negligible burdens typically experienced by bona fide ias providers.as the district court concluded,gordon has suffered no harm related to bandwidth,hardware,internet connectivity,network integrity,overhead costs,fees,staffing,or equipment costs.gordon,wl,at.indeed,given his heavy dependence on the services and hardware of third parties,it would be difficult,if not impossible,for him to incur many of these harms 
gordon claimed harms almost exclusively relate to litigation preparation,not to the operation of a bona fide service.gordon made no real effort to avoid,block,or delete commercial,but instead has voluntarily assumed the role of a spam sleuth.he expends time and resources seeking out and capturing massive volumes of spam,which he collects and then organizes for use in his prolific lawsuits.he admits setting up domains as spam traps with the sole purpose of snagging as many marketing messages as possible.the record reveals that was one such trap.he is not alone in his litigation enterprise.his clients also use their personalized domains to gather commercial,which they then send to gordon in enormous unsorted batches of to messages to fuel his various lawsuits in exchange,gordon clients share in settlement proceeds.gordon apportions the bounty according to each individual contribution to the particular,the number of provided to gordon for use against a specific defendant.
gordon admits operating an business,which entails,in his words,n otifying spammers that they violating the law and filing lawsuits if they do not stop sending spam as gordon concedes,he is a professional plaintiff.reply br.of appellant at.since at least,gordon has held no employment.he has never been compensated for any of his purported internet services,and his only income source has come from monetary settlements from his litigation campaign.likewise,his company,omni,generates no revenue and is financed strictly through these lawsuits against marketers.while the term professional,as in professional plaintiff,is not a dirty word,see murray gmac mortgage,cir,and should not itself undermine one ability to seek redress for injuries suffered,gordon status is uniquely relevant to the statutory standing question here.hypertouch,wl,at rejecting defendant argument that hypertouch was a professional plaintiff that entered the isp business for the sole purpose of bringing lawsuits.
because we are tasked with determining whether gordon has been adversely affected by conduct regulated by the act,it is highly significant that the burdens gordon complains of are almost exclusively and purposefully undertaken.here,gordon acknowledges that he benefits from the receipt of spam through his research and monetary settlements.the fact that gordon derives substantial financial benefit but endures no real harm from commercial,coupled with his unusual efforts to seek out and than avoid or,demonstrates that he has not been adversely affected by alleged violations of the federal act in any cognizable way.
we do not discount the harmful effects spam and spamming practices,both lawful and unlawful,have upon businesses and consumers,and we recognize the need of bona fide ias providers,both small and large,for a legal remedy against spammers.we,like congress,are sympathetic to legitimate operations hampered by a deluge of unwanted marketing.our record,however,conclusively demonstrates that this is not the case before us.gordon has created a cottage industry where he and his clients set themselves up to profit from litigation.the act was enacted to protect individuals and legitimate to support a litigation mill for entrepreneurs like gordon.
as discussed above,it is undisputed that gordon encounters huge quantities of commercial.nevertheless,he is neither a bona fide ias provider nor has he been adversely affected by alleged violations of the act.we conclude that gordon lacks standing to pursue claims under g,and affirm the district court summary judgment dismissal of all his federal claims.
gordon also appeals the adverse summary judgment dismissing his claims for alleged violations of cema,washington statute regulating commercial messages.see.et.like many other states,washington has enacted legislation that seeks to curb abuses.cema states in relevant part 
no person may initiate the transmission,conspire with another to initiate the transmission,or assist the transmission,of a commercial electronic mail message from a computer located in washington or to an electronic mail address that the sender knows,or has reason to know,is held by a washington resident that 
a uses a third party internet domain name without permission of the third party,or otherwise misrepresents or obscures any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path of a commercial electronic mail message or 
b contains false or misleading information in the subject line.
the statute also prohibits certain practices aimed at inducing a person to reveal personally identifying information.like its federal counterpart,cema provides for sizeable statutory damages or actual damages,whichever is greater.
at the outset,we must frame the issue as it comes to us.first,virtumundo does not contest gordon standing to bring cema claims.in contrast to the more restrictive standing requirement of the act,cema authorizes a recipient of a commercial message or an interactive computer service to bring a private action.id.
of gordon various cema claims on appeal,only his claim relating to allegedly deficient headers requires detailed discussion.gordon has no viable cema claim based on the body of the messages at issue.unlike the act,cema does not regulate the body of the.state heckel,review denied,heckel ii.similarly,the state statute does not purport to regulate mechanisms.therefore,gordon cema claims,by nature of the state statute,are limited to the information contained in the headers and subject lines.
we further conclude,however,that summary judgment was properly granted on gordon claim that virtumundo subject lines are deceptive.in opposition to virtumundo summary judgment motion,gordon failed to identify or describe any specific or subject line text and simply countered that gordon contests the position that the subject lines are not misleading.gordon does not attempt to better articulate this claim on appeal.
the party opposing summary judgment must direct the court attention to specific,triable facts,cal.gas city of santa ana,cir,and the reviewing court is not required to comb through the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment,carmen san francisco unified sch,cir quoting forsberg pac.nw.bell,cir.see hernandez spacelabs med,cir the nonmoving party can not defeat summary judgment with allegations in the complaint,or with unsupported conjecture or conclusory statements.because gordon has failed to present a prima facie case in opposition to summary judgment,his claim that virtumundo subject lines violate cema fails as a matter of law,and summary judgment was appropriate.
therefore,the sole remaining cema claim that we must address relates to the headers of virtumundo.gordon argues that the header information misrepresents or obscures the identity of the sender,and therefore violates cema,see.a.we review the district court conclusion that this claim is preempted pursuant to the act express preemption clause,b.
as a preliminary matter,the attorney general for the state of washington state,appearing here as amicus curiae,insists that we need not reach the preemption issue.see atel fin.quaker coal,cir we may affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record,whether or not the decision of the district court relied on the same grounds or reasoning we adopt.the state argues that we may affirm summary judgment with respect to this cema claim because gordon allegations regarding the header information do not satisfy washington deceptiveness standard,as a matter of law.we have surveyed the legal landscape and note a fatal shortcoming in the state proposition.cema prohibits the sending of commercial that misrepresents or obscures any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path.a.the standard for deception under washington law is thus only relevant to the extent courts so limit the broad language of critical step that the state overlooks entirely.
in benson oregon processing service,review denied,the state appellate court interpreted the previously undefined terms misrepresent and obscure according to their ordinary dictionary,misrepresent to mean representing incorrectly to give a false,imperfect or misleading representation,and obscure to mean to conceal or hide from view as by or as if covering wholly or in part make difficult to discern.id.at quoting webster third new int l dictionary.these broad definitions extend cema prohibitive reach and purport to regulate a vast array of acts and practices.as subsequent courts reviewing cema have recognized,without further clarification,a sender of commercial email could be potentially held liable under cema for unintentional clerical errors,ferguson,wl,at,imperfect representations,or immaterial misstatements.
in short,we can not conclude,as the state presumes,that cema prohibitions extend only to acts of deception.the washington legislature or state courts may ultimately mold cema broad language so as to cabin its breadth or interpret the law in conformity with federal legislation.this task is,however,a matter for the state,as sovereign,to resolve 
we therefore turn,as we must,to whether summary judgment was proper under the doctrine of preemption.as recently noted by a district court,t here is no ninth circuit authority on whether plaintiff claim under the provision of cema is preempted by.ferguson,wl,at.indeed,the scope of the act preemption is an issue of first impression in this circuit.see asis internet servs.consumerbargaingiveaways,llc,wl,at.
the concept of preemption derives from the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.consistent with that command,we have long recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.altria group,good,d quoting maryland louisiana,d.courts typically identify three circumstances in which federal preemption of state law exists 
express preemption,where congress explicitly defines the extent to which its enactments preempt state law field preemption,where state law attempts to regulate conduct in a field that congress intended the federal law exclusively to occupy and conflict preemption,where it is impossible to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of congress.

although the analysis of the scope of preemption begins with the text,interpretation of that language does not occur in a contextual vacuum.id.at.rather,this inquiry is guided by two principles about the nature of preemption.first,there is a presumption against supplanting the historic police powers of the states by federal legislation unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at.this presumption against preemption leads us to the principle that express preemption statutory provisions should be given narrow interpretation.air conditioning refrigeration inst.energy res.conservation dev.comm n,cir.second,the preemption analysis is guided by the comment that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.medtronic,at.quotations and brackets omitted.as a result,any understanding of the scope of a statute must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose,and calls for courts to consider not only the language of the statute itself but also the statutory framework surrounding it and the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole.id.at.quotations omitted accord altria group.at congress may indicate intent through a statute express language or through its structure and purpose.

this chapter supersedes any statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages,except to the extent that any such statute,regulation,or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.
b.the following subsection adds further clarity congress reiterated that the preemption clause shall not be construed to preempt the applicability of a state laws that are not specific to electronic mail,including state trespass,contract,or tort law or b other state laws to the extent that those laws relate to acts of fraud or computer crime.b emphasis added.thus,the express language of b demonstrates congress intent that the act broadly preempt state regulation of commercial with limited,narrow exception.congress carved out from preemption state laws that proscribe falsity or deception in commercial communications.
to date,the fourth circuit opinion in omega world travel,mummagraphics,cir,is the only federal circuit court decision addressing preemption of state law claims by the act.in omega,mummagraphics alleged violations of the act and oklahoma law,see.stat.tit,a based on messages that contained a variety of inaccuracies omega,at.the fourth circuit reviewed the scope of the act preemption provision and concluded that congress could not have intended,by way of the language,to allow states to enact laws that prohibit mere error or insignificant inaccuracies.id.at.the court reasoned that a materiality component comported with the policy pursued by the federal legislation as a whole,further noting that a contrary reading would upend the balance struck by congress and turn an exception to a preemption provision into a loophole so broad that it would virtually swallow the preemption clause itself.id.at.ultimately,the court determined that the challenged could not be actionable under the oklahoma statutes because allowing a state to attach liability to bare immaterial error in commercial would be inconsistent with the federal act preemption text and structure,and,consequently,with a fair understanding of congressional purpose.id.at quoting medtronic,at.
having independently analyzed the act text,structure,and legislative purpose,we reach the same conclusion as the district court and the fourth circuit and interpret the act express preemption clause in a manner that preserves congress intended,to regulate commercial on a nationwide basis,b,and to save from preemption only statutes,regulations,or rules that target fraud or deception,at emphasis added.
as with any issue of statutory interpretation,we start with the text itself.the act preemption clause makes an exception for state laws that prohibit falsity or deception in commercial communication.b.because those terms are not defined in the statute,they should be given their ordinary meaning.emmert indus.artisan,cir.whereas the word deception certainly denotes something more than immaterial inaccuracies or inadvertent mistakes,the word falsity is susceptible to differing dictionary meanings.falsity means quality or state of being false,which is not itself informative.collegiate dictionary ed.the term false is defined,however,not only as not true but also as intentionally untrue,adjusted or made so as to deceive,and intended or tending to mislead.id.we therefore acknowledge facial ambiguity in the statutory text.see bryan garner,dictionary of modern legal usage ed stating that false is potentially ambiguous,since the word may mean either erroneous,incorrect or purposely deceptive bryan garner,garner modern am.usage same.
recognizing the same ambiguity,the fourth circuit applied the maxim of noscitur a sociis,a canon of statutory construction that counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.united states williams,d.reading falsity in conjunction with deception,which connotes a type of tort action based on misrepresentations,we are likewise persuaded that the exception language,read as congress intended,refers to traditionally tortious or wrongful conduct.omega,at.we find further support for this reading in the statutory text,which counsels against any interpretation that preempts laws relating to acts of fraud.see b.indeed,the committee explained that while a state law requiring some or all commercial to carry specific types of labels,or to follow a certain format or contain specified content,would be preempted,a state law prohibiting fraudulent or deceptive headers,subject lines,or content in commercial would not be preempted,at emphasis added see also cong.rec.at recognizing broad preemption,except state laws prohibiting falsification techniques and deception.the committee repeated reference to fraud and deception is telling and confirms that congress did not intend that states retain unfettered freedom to create liability for immaterial inaccuracies or omissions.
further scrutiny of congressional intent solidifies our reading of the preemption clause.as discussed supra,the act prohibits only deceptive subject line headings or materially false or materially misleading header information.see a accord b s enders of commercial electronic mail should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of such mail.emphasis added.significantly,congress intended this standard to regulate commercial messaging practices on a nationwide basis.b.it was because the patchwork of state laws had proven ineffective that congress sought to implement one national standard,at,applicable across jurisdictions.the act expresses this goal 
many states have enacted legislation intended to regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail,but these statutes impose different standards and requirements.as a result,they do not appear to have been successful in addressing the problems associated with unsolicited commercial electronic mail,in part because,since an electronic mail address does not specify a geographic location,it can be extremely difficult for businesses to know with which of these disparate statutes they are required to comply.
a see also,at i n contrast to telephone numbers,addresses do not reveal the state where the holder is located.as a result,a sender of has no easy way to determine with which state law to comply.moreover,a single could instantaneously implicate the laws of multiple jurisdictions as it journeys through cyberspace,traveling over various facilities before reaching its intended recipient,whose location is often unknown.therefore,one state internet laws may impose compliance costs on businesses throughout the country.omega,at citing psinet,chapman,cir.the act was designed to ensure that legitimate businesses would not have to guess at the meaning of various state laws when their advertising campaigns ventured into cyberspace.kleffman vonage holdings,wl,at.may,concluding that the act preempted california state law claims.
it would be logically incongruous to conclude that congress endeavored to erect a uniform standard but simultaneously left states and local lawmakers free to manipulate that standard to create more burdensome regulation.we are compelled to adopt a reading of the preemption clause that conforms with the statute structure as a whole and the stated legislative purpose.see b.the act established a national standard,but left the individual states free to extend traditional tort theories such as claims arising from fraud or deception to commercial communication.to find otherwise would create an exception to preemption that swallow s the rule and undermine s the regulatory balance that congress established,omega,at,and which would once again subject legitimate businesses to inconsistent and possibly incompatible state regulations.
applying its proper reading,the act preemption clause applies here and undermines gordon remaining cema claim.although he admits he was not in any way misled or deceived,gordon argues that the headers in the at,the from lines violate cema because they fail to clearly identify virtumundo as the sender and therefore misrepresent or obscure the identity of the sender.see.a.the from lines at issue contain two components a from name field,which typically references a topic or subject matter of the advertisement,and a domain name.examples of from lines condemned by gordon include and 
there is of course nothing inherently deceptive in virtumundo use of fanciful domain names.see,at recognizing microsoft msn and hotmail domains used for services.gordon agrees that the domains from which these were,and were properly registered to virtumundo.gordon further concedes that a whois search,or a similar database,accurately identifies virtumundo as the domain registrant and provides other identifying information gordon complains that in order to ascertain the actual identity of the sender a recipient must either review the message content or consult a database.he insists that any practice that requires consumers to engage in an extra step violates cema.
nothing contained in this claim rises to the level of falsity or deception within the meaning of the act preemption clause.gordon offers no proof that any headers have been altered to impair a recipient ability to identify,locate,or respond to the person who initiated the.nor does he present evidence that virtumundo practice is aimed at misleading recipients as to the identity of the sender.aitken commc ns workers of,d,holding that it is inappropriate to conclude,as a matter of law,that the misleading header information is immaterial where the defendant misappropriated identities of managers to send to employees.as stated by our district court,gordon claim is for,at best,incomplete or less than comprehensive information regarding the sender.gordon,wl,at.such technical allegations regarding the header information find no basis in traditional tort theories and therefore fall beyond the ambit of the exception language in the act express preemption clause.
gordon further suggests that the only information that could be used in the from name field that would not misrepresent is the name of the person or entity who actually sent the,or perhaps the person or entity who hired the sender to send the email on their behalf.in other words,he argues that cema provisions require that virtumundo or a client name expressly appear in the from lines.the act does not impose such a requirement.to the extent such a content or labeling requirement may exist under state law,it is clearly subject to preemption.see,at state law requiring some or all commercial to carry specific types of labels or contain specified content,would be preempted.see also kleffman,wl,at t he claim that the failure to include vonage name in the email is clearly preempted.
in sum,gordon alleged header deficiencies relate to,at most,statements or omissions and a heightened content or labeling requirement.regardless of the merits of his arguments,assuming they are actionable under cema,such state law claims falter under the weight of federal preemption.summary judgment was properly entered on gordon cema claims 
gordon also appeals summary judgment of his claim that virtumundo violated the washington cpa,which generally prohibits u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.a plaintiff must typically prove five elements to establish a cpa violation an unfair or deceptive act or practice,in trade or commerce,that impacts the public interest,which causes injury to the party in his business or property,and the injury must be causally linked to the unfair or deceptive act.hangman ridge training stables,safeco title ins.a violation of cema,however,likely constitutes a per se cpa violation see.heckel i,at rcw makes a violation of cema a per se violation of the cpa.
gordon primarily relies upon alleged cema violations to establish his cpa claim.because his cema claims fail as a matter of law,his cpa claims,to the extent grounded in cema violations,are likewise inadequate and were properly dismissed.
to the extent that gordon also brings independent cpa claims,they too fail.gordon has failed to identify an act or practice that misleads or misrepresents something of material importance.nguyen doak homes,emphasis added accord robinson avis,k nowing failure to reveal something of material importance is deceptive within the cpa.because gordon cpa claims are not predicated on unfair or deceptive conduct that has the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public,hangman ridge,at,summary judgment was appropriate.see carlile harbour homes,confirming that whether an act is unfair or deceptive is a question of law.
additionally,in order to succeed on a cpa claim,a plaintiff must establish that,but for the defendant unfair or deceptive practice,the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury.indoor,integra telecom of.here,gordon seeks only statutory damages and,despite more than adequate opportunity,has made no attempt to show that virtumundo proximately caused him actual harm.because gordon has failed in his burden to provide sufficient evidence to establish an essential element of this cause of action,his cpa claims must also fail as a matter of law.see river city markets,fleming foods west,cir.
we briefly address gordon remaining arguments and assignments of error on appeal.his claim that summary judgment violated the seventh amendment is devoid of merit.as the supreme court held,over one hundred years ago,a summary judgment proceeding does not deprive the losing party of its seventh amendment right to a jury trial.in re slatkin,cir citing fid.deposit of united states.further,gordon,dissatisfied with the result in the western district of washington,can not now challenge his initial choice of venue on appeal.see generally olberding.cent.noting that the plaintiff relinquishes his right to object to venue by bringing his lawsuit in a particular district.finally,we decline to entertain gordon poorly articulated argument that the act is unconstitutional under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.see broad sealaska,cir.this constitutional challenge was neither raised before the district court,nor pressed in the reply brief or at oral argument.we reject these and any additional arguments possibly buried in gordon briefing not expressly addressed herein.see indep.towers of washington,cir repeating the now familiar maxim j udges are not like pigs,hunting for truffles buried in briefs quoting united states dunkel,cir.
in summary,gordon lacks statutory standing to bring a private action for alleged violations of the act.his state law claims fail as a matter of law because they are precluded by the act express preemption clause and because he has failed to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists.accordingly,we affirm the district court order of summary judgment.
all parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
the most pertinent conclusion for me in this case,one that i reach after a careful evaluation of the district court comprehensive factual findings and cogent legal analysis,is that gordon was seeking to use the act to build a litigation factory for his personal financial benefit.for the reasons amply explained by judge tallman fine opinion,the ways in which gordon inserted himself into legal controversy here require conclusions that he is not an internet access service ias provider and that he was not adversely affected by spam.each of these conclusions is independently sufficient to deny gordon statutory standing to assert his claims,and each conclusion requires our affirmance of the district court summary judgment order.
i write separately to add this comment.in the long course of law,development of the common law has normally occurred in ways that gave legal remedies to persons who cried out for relief against a perceived injustice.see,oliver wendell holmes,the common law dover pubs t he various forms of liability known to modern law spring from the common ground of revenge.the body of the common law that we know as contract law developed from the need to provide remedies when certain promises were broken and more ancient common law writs were inadequate.see id.at tracing history of contracts to the writ of trespass on the case,which developed because there were many cases which did not exactly fall within the definition of trespass,but for which it was proper that a remedy should be furnished.similarly,tort law has for centuries expanded to cover new types of claims where wrong had caused damage.see id.at stating that tort law is continually adding to its specific rules based on t he tendency of a given act to cause harm under given circumstances,rules which must be determined by experience.
in both contract and tort claims for damages,the common law always required a showing of damages proximately caused by the wrong as an element of the claim.see hadley baxendale,exch.holding that contract damages must either aris e naturally or reasonably be supposed to have been the probable result of the breach of the contract dan dobbs,the law of torts in personal injury cases,the normal remedy is compensatory damages for all losses that have proximately resulted from the tort and all losses that will so result in the future.the branch of the common law known in england as chancery jurisdiction,which also developed in the colonies and in the early united states,was concerned with providing an equitable remedy to injured persons when common law damage remedies were inadequate.see joseph story,chancery jurisdiction an article written for the north american review,in,on the reports of johnson,the miscellaneous writings of joseph story william story,stating that courts of equity are necessary because t here are many cases in which the parties are without remedy at law,or in which the remedy is wholly inadequate to the attainment of justice.
thus the common law developed ample remedies for persons who had suffered grievous harms,but,as i understand the history of our common law,it did not develop remedies for people who gratuitously created circumstances that would support a legal claim and acted with the chief aim of collecting a damage award see charles mccormick,law of damages t he rules for awarding damages should be such as to discourage even persons against whom wrongs have been committed from passively suffering economic loss which could be averted by reasonable efforts,or from actively increasing such loss where prudence would require that such activity cease.i believe that the same principles that animated the common law influenced congress when it enacted the act.that congress explicitly limited claims to a subset of individuals or entities who were adversely affected by the proscribed conduct shows that congress did not aim to provide a remedy to anyone or any entity who sought out a position where the alleged harm might inevitably occur.but,for a person seeking to operate a litigation factory,the purported harm is illusory and more in the nature of manufactured circumstances in an attempt to enable a claim.in my view,manufactured claims should not be tolerated absent a clear endorsement from congress.such claims would not likely have been recognized at common law,and congress here wisely excluded them.
judge tallman opinion rightly focuses on language in the legislative history stating that only bona fide ias providers should have statutory standing.i would presume a bona fide requirement even without this legislative history because congress provided a private right of action for violations but expressly limited it to certain individuals and entities.given this limited private right of action,statutory standing should be denied to plaintiffs such as gordon who purposely structure themselves to look like one of the limited entities eligible to sue but do so for the primary purpose of collecting damages and settlements from litigation.such individuals trying to game the system do not fall into the limited class to which congress made available a private remedy,and ordinarily they should be denied statutory standing.that the legislative history specifies bona fide ias providers strengthens our conclusion that gordon suit should be dismissed,but the legislative history is not necessary to reach this conclusion in light of the antecedents that do not favor manufactured claims.
there are a few areas in which our developing statutory law has embraced the concept of permitting claims by those who insert themselves in the controversy for the express purpose of creating a lawsuit.one of the best examples is that we accord standing to those who test for discrimination in housing by feigning interest in a housing site.see,havens realty coleman,d.there may be good reasons for allowing this practice as a way to strengthen the enforcement of housing discrimination laws,and congress provided a broad standing provision for private actors.in permitting standing for testers,the supreme court reasoned that congress conferred on all persons a legal right to truthful information about available housing and plainly omitted a bona fide requirement for standing when it explicitly required one elsewhere in the same section of the fair housing statute.id.
similarly,we accord standing to individuals who sue defendants that fail to provide access to the disabled in public accommodation as required by the americans with disabilities act ada,even if we suspect that such plaintiffs are hunting for violations just to file lawsuits.see molski evergreen dynasty,cir per curiam for the ada to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled,it may indeed be necessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the ada.there,too,however,congress provided standing to any person subjected to disability discrimination in violation of the ada,and it also did not expressly require a showing of injury or adverse effect from the discrimination.a accord molski cable,cir 
we should not extend the concept of tester standing to an area where we do not have confidence that congress intended to empower anyone to make claims.unlike the broad standing provisions in the housing discrimination laws and the ada,here the statutory language grants a private right of action not to all persons regardless of injury,but only to ias providers who suffer adverse effect.these requirements make clear that a party in gordon circumstances has no standing to proceed under the act.
while spam in this context does not have a precise definition,it is typically understood to refer broadly to unsolicited messages or junk,typically commercial in nature.see united states kelley,cir thomas,dissenting.the term spam originated as the trademark name for a canned meat product manufactured by hormel foods corporation.see hormel foods jim henson productions,cir.the connotation has its roots in a popular s
