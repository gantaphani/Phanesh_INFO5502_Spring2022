this commercial dispute,more complicated than difficult,concerns a claim made on a surety bond issued by one insurer to another.the district court granted recovery on the bond in favor of the claimant,liberty mutual insurance company liberty,and against the issuer of the bond,greenwich insurance company greenwich.greenwich has appealed,and we now affirm.
the scene is easily set.in december,american tissue,american tissue,a manufacturer now bankrupt,obtained from liberty two insurance policies to cover workers compensation that american tissue might be forced to pay in the course of its ordinary operations.the policies the policies were to cover accidents occurring during the period december,and provided coverage for american tissue for amounts that it might owe for such accidents over and above a deductible of for each claim.
these policies were fronting policies,providing that liberty would pay all claims in their entirety up front and that american would reimburse liberty for any amount paid on the claim up to the deductible payments over and above the deductible were to be borne by liberty.the policies also required american tissue to pay premiums,but the total amount of the premiums was to be adjusted retrospectively based,among other things,on actual losses experienced by liberty.the policies thus provided some protection for american tissue but greater protection for injured workers.
during the year,american tissue encountered financial difficulties and failed to make required payments to liberty.so,as a condition of renewing the policies,liberty insisted that american tissue obtain guarantees to secure american tissue present and future obligations to reimburse liberty.on december,the two companies signed an agreement to this effect the agreement and liberty then renewed american tissue policies for the period january,to january,the policies.
the agreement,which is at the center of the dispute,said that its purpose was to secure all of american tissue obligations to liberty arising out of the and policies,including both reimbursements and premiums,and provided that payments due must be paid within days of liberty written demand.to secure these payments,american tissue agreed to deliver both a surety bond and a letter of credit in favor of liberty,substantially in the form of the bond and letter of credit attached to the agreement.
the agreement provided that the amounts of the required bond and letter of credit would be fixed by schedules prepared by liberty but it also provided that liberty at its sole discretion could increase the amounts by providing american tissue revised schedules,whenever liberty feared that the existing amounts so guaranteed were inadequate to cover american tissue existing obligations.
initially,liberty sought a surety bond of and a letter of credit of however,american tissue was unable to immediately supply so large a letter of credit.accordingly,liberty agreed to a bond in the amount of million and a letter of credit,provided that american tissue thereafter increase the letter to reach by april.the schedule read 
letter of credit to be increased to no later than 
surety bond may be decreased to on receipt of letter s of credit totaling 
in the final agreement,the deadline for supplementing the letter of credit was changed to june.
on january,american tissue obtained the required million surety bond from greenwich.in the archaic form sometimes used for surety bonds,the bond read that it would be void if american tissue carried out its obligations under its agreement with liberty but otherwise american tissue and greenwich were each jointly and severally liable in the amount of the bond.separately,american tissue agreed to indemnify greenwich for any payments that greenwich had to make to liberty under the bond.
having obtained an initial letter of credit for on february,american tissue on may,obtained an additional letter of credit for.not long after,american tissue sent an to marsh mclennan requesting that the surety bond be reduced to in accordance with the agreement marsh mclennan forwarded the request to greenwich,which responded that the bond reduction can be done by rider,but it must be acknowledged by the carrier apparently meaning that liberty must be notified first.
in all events,there is no evidence that liberty was itself notified,or that it consented to a bond reduction,or that the bond amount was in fact ever reduced instead,during american tissue began to miss payments to liberty and,on july,liberty issued a new schedule raising without qualification the required security to in letters of credit the value of the two existing letters and million for the surety bond.thereafter,to satisfy some of american tissue debt,liberty drew down almost in full both existing letters of credit.
on august,and again on september,liberty notified american tissue that the latter was in default under the agreement on account of continued.on september,american tissue filed for bankruptcy in delaware.on october,liberty wrote to greenwich,claiming that the bankruptcy constituted a default under the agreement and bond,making greenwich liable for the full amount of the bond million,which liberty now asserts is less than the estimated loss that liberty is going to suffer from american tissue default.
on greenwich refusal to pay,liberty on january,filed a complaint against greenwich in the federal district court.the first count which alone is before us claimed breach of contract for of the full amount of the bond.in due course,the district court granted summary judgment in liberty favor and certified this judgment as separate and final pursuant to.b.still unresolved,and not before us,are a claim by liberty under.laws ch.and counterclaims by greenwich on several different theories.
on appeal,greenwich first and most extensive argument is on the merits of liberty contract claim.its position is that under the surety bond,incorporating relevant terms of the agreement between liberty and american tissue,it can be liable to liberty only for the amount of sum to which the agreement permitted american tissue to reduce the bond once it had secured letters of credit totaling.alternatively,greenwich says that at least the bond and agreement were ambiguous,presenting an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.
the agreement provides explicitly that its terms are governed by massachusetts law the surety bond is silent but here the parties cite massachusetts law as well and we accept their implicit premise.see mcadams.mut.life ins,cir.the grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,dasey anderson,cir and ordinarily contract interpretation is for the court unless disputed issues of fact bear upon the interpretation of ambiguous language.fishman lasalle bank,cir.
in our this too is a question of law for the court,lanier prof l,ricci,cir neither the bond nor the agreement is ambiguous in any way relevant here.by its terms,the full amount of the bond is payable upon an act of default by american tissue,and greenwich does not deny that such a default occurred.nor does greenwich claim that it did issue a substitute bond in an amount smaller than or otherwise issued any rider reducing the amount of the bond.
rather,greenwich argues in substance that american tissue had a right,after furnishing the second letter of credit,to reduce the bond to,that it took steps to do so,and that the mechanics of the reduction even if not achieved were a mere ministerial act.it then argues that the reduction should be treated as automatic or as accomplished by the steps taken,that the reduction would carry out the intent of the parties,and that failing to reduce the amount would reward liberty for withholding consent that it was required to provide.
there is nothing to these arguments.we will assume,as greenwich urges,that the bond should be read in conjunction with the underlying agreement which permitted american tissue to have greenwich reduce the amount of the bond to.but the agreement said that american tissue may reduce the amount it did not say that it had to do so or that the reduction would be automatic.american tissue started the steps to ac
