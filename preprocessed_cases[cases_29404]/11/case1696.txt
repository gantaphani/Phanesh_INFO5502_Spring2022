pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,we granted the request of the united states court of appeals,ninth circuit to decide the following questions of california law,as we have rephrased them see cal.rules of court,rule f must a plaintiff who seeks damages under california civil code section,claiming the denial of full and equal treatment on the basis of disability in violation of the unruh civil rights act,and the americans with disabilities act of et,prove intentional discrimination if the answer to question is yes,what does intentional discrimination mean in this context 
although we held in harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,harris that proof of intentional discrimination was necessary to establish a violation of the unruh civil rights act,the legislature subsequently added subdivision f to civil code section specifying that a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of ada which does not necessarily require a plaintiff to show intentional discrimination shall also constitute a violation of this section.in lentini california center for the arts cir,lentini,the federal court held section,subdivision f added ada violations,whether or not involving intentional discrimination,to the class of discriminatory acts for which the unruh civil rights act provides a remedy in damages.in gunther lin th,d gunther,however,the court of appeal,expressly disagreeing with lentini,held that while an unintentional ada violation was by virtue of section,subdivision f a violation of that section,no damages remedy under section is available for such a violation.gunther,at,d.
on examining the language,statutory context,and history of section,subdivision f,we conclude lentini interpretation was right and gunther was wrong.the legislature intent in adding subdivision f was to provide disabled californians injured by violations of the ada with the remedies provided by section.a plaintiff who establishes a violation of the ada,therefore,need not prove intentional discrimination in order to obtain damages under section.in light of that conclusion,we need not reach the ninth circuit second question.
factual and procedural background 
the order of the ninth circuit court of appeals asking this court to decide questions of california law sets out the background of this case 
plaintiff kenneth munson has a physical disability that requires that he use a wheelchair.plaintiff alleges that he visited the del taco restaurant in san bernardino,california,which is owned and operated by defendant del taco.plaintiff further alleges that,at the del taco restaurant,he encountered architectural barriers that denied him legally required access to the parking area and restrooms.
plaintiff filed suit against defendant in the central district of california.he alleged violations of the americans with disabilities act of ada,and the unruh civil rights act,cal.plaintiff sought injunctive relief,damages,and attorney fees under california civil code section for the alleged unruh act violations.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.the court reasoned that there is no genuine issue of fact that an architectural barrier existed and that there is no genuine issue of fact that the restroom doorway widening was readily achievable.consequently,the court ruled that there is no genuine issue of fact that an ada violation occurred.thus,defendant is liable under the unruh act and plaintiff is entitled to pursue statutory damages.
the parties stipulated to in damages under the unruh act in lieu of holding a jury trial on the issue,with defendant reserving the right to appeal any adverse orders or judgments.the district court entered judgment,and defendant timely appealed the district court grant of plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment.
defendant argues on appeal that it is entitled to summary judgment because intent is required under the unruh act and plaintiff failed to put forth any evidence that defendant intentionally discriminated against him.plaintiff does not contend that he provided evidence that defendant was motivated by animus against people with disabilities,but argues that such intent is not required or,in the alternative,that the requisite intent is the intent not to remove barriers to access where readily achievable.munson del taco,cir,fn.omitted.
discussion 
as always in interpreting statutes,our goal is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to give effect to the law purpose.in re corrine cal th,d.with regard to the unruh civil rights act particularly,we recently explained that it must be construed liberally in order to carry out its purpose to create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in california business establishments by banishing or eradicating arbitrary,invidious discrimination by such establishments.angelucci century supper club cal th,d.the unruh civil rights act serves as a preventive measure,without which it is recognized that businesses might fall into discriminatory practices.ibid.
statutory background 
we begin by identifying and describing the pertinent provisions of california law and the ada.
section provides,in pertinent part 
a this section shall be known,and may be cited,as the unruh civil rights act.b all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.f a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of public law shall also constitute a violation of this section.
section provides,in pertinent part 
a whoever denies,aids or incites a denial,or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to section,or,is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages,and any amount that may be determined by a jury,or a court sitting without a jury,up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars,and any attorney fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto,suffered by any person denied the rights provided in section,or.
as we explained in harris,supra,cal d at pages,sections and were originally enacted in based on predecessor statutes and were substantially revised in,when the name unruh civil rights act was added.stats,ch,stats,ch.while section statement of the substantive scope of protections afforded and section statement of the remedies available have both changed over the course of time,section has always provided substantive protection against invidious discrimination in public accommodations,without specifying remedies,and section has always provided remedies,including a private action for damages,for violations of section in harris,therefore,we considered the two sections as interrelated parts of the same statutory scheme we referred to them together as the unruh act,with section serving to provide an enforcement mechanism for section and other provisions of law.harris,at,see id.at,accord,angelucci century supper club,supra,cal th at,d,stating,with reference to,the unruh civil rights act includes an enforcement provision that authorizes individual actions.
in the portion of harris particularly relevant here,we rejected the plaintiffs claim that a residential landlord minimum income policy for prospective renters violated the unruh civil rights act because it had a disparate impact on women.we held the disparate impact test employed in federal and state employment discrimination cases was inconsistent with the language of the unruh civil rights act,several parts of which point to an emphasis on intentional discrimination.harris,supra,cal d at.in particular,we noted section references to aid ing and incit ing denials of equal treatment,to making discriminations,and to commission of an offense,and further reasoned that section provisions for minimum and exemplary damages reflected a legislative focus on intentional and morally offensive conduct.harris,at.we also observed that a disparate impact test appeared to conflict with an exemption in section for standards applicable alike to persons of every sex,color,race,religion,ancestry,national origin,or blindness or other physical disability.harris,at,see current,subd.c.from these linguistic indications and the unruh civil rights act history and relationship to other statutes see harris,at,we concluded that a plaintiff seeking to establish a case under the unruh act must plead and prove intentional discrimination in public accommodations in violation of the terms of the act.harris,at.
in,the year after our decision in harris though not,as far as the history indicates,in response to that decision,the legislature amended section to,among other changes,add the paragraph that became subdivision f,specifying that a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of public law shall also constitute a violation of this section.stats,ch,see stats,ch,adding subdivision designations.this amendment was but one part of a broad enactment,originating as assembly bill reg.sess,that sought to conform many aspects of california law relating to disability discrimination in employment,government services,transportation,and communications,as well as public accommodations to the recently enacted ada,which was soon to go into effect.see assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,digest hereafter assembly judiciary report on assembly bill.the general intent of the legislation was expressed in an uncodified section it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to strengthen california law in areas where it is weaker than the americans with disabilities act of public law and to retain california law when it provides more protection for individuals with disabilities than the americans with disabilities act of.stats,ch.
the assembly judiciary report on assembly bill summarized the bill changes to the unruh civil rights act as follows include persons with mental disabilities in the enumerated classes of individuals protected by the unruh act.make a violation of the ada a violation of the unruh act.thereby providing persons injured by a violation of the ada with the remedies provided by the unruh act,right of private action for damages.assem.judiciary on assem.bill,supra,at.the corresponding senate report put forward substantially the same analysis of the bill effect on unruh civil rights act claims existing law,the unruh civil rights act,entitles protected groups,including blind and physically disabled persons,to full and equal accommodation,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments.this bill would include persons with mental disabilities in the enumerated classes of individuals protected by the unruh act.in addition,this bill would make a violation of the ada a violation of the unruh act.thereby providing persons injured by a violation of the ada with the remedies provided by the unruh act,right of private action for damages.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,hereafter senate judiciary report on assembly bill.
the ada public accommodations provisions are contained in title iii of that law.this part of the ada prohibits,among other things,the failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable.b a iv.intentional discrimination need not be shown to establish a violation of the ada access requirements,for congress,in the ada,sought to eliminate all forms of invidious discrimination against individuals with disabilities,including not only outright intentional exclusion,but also the discriminatory effects of architectural,transportation,and communication barriers and the failure to make modifications to existing facilities.a congressional finding see lentini,supra,at.although the attorney general of the united states may seek damages on the aggrieved person behalf,in a private action for violation of title iii no injunctive available.a,b b wander kaus cir.
with this background on the statutes involved,the issue is easily framed may an unruh civil rights act plaintiff relying on subdivision f of section obtain damages for denial of full access to a business establishment in violation of the ada and the unruh civil rights act without proof the denial involved intentional discrimination we conclude that a plaintiff proceeding under section,subdivision f may obtain statutory damages on proof of an ada access violation without the need to demonstrate additionally that the discrimination was intentional.
ii.statutory language and context 
we begin with the statutory language,viewed in light of the entire legislative scheme of which it is a part,as the language chosen is usually the surest guide to legislative intent.in re corrine,supra,cal th at,d.to the extent we find the statutory language susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we examine other sources,including the history of the provision enactment,for insight into the legislature intent.elsner uveges cal th,d.
subdivision f of section provides that a violation of the right of any individual under the ada is also a violation of section.the subdivision does not distinguish between those ada violations involving intentional discrimination and those resulting,in the words of the federal law,from the discriminatory effects of architectural,transportation,and communication barriers and the failure to make modifications to existing facilities.a.the remedies for violation of section in section a private action for damages.a reasonable interpretation of section,subdivision f is therefore that it,together with section,authorizes a private action for damages for ada violations without proof of intentional discrimination.this is the reading embraced by the lentini court lentini,supra,at and urged on us by plaintiff.
on the other hand,subdivision f of section states only that an ada violation is also a violation of this section,of section.section does not,in itself,establish any remedy for its violation.and section does not expressly state that its remedies apply to every violation of section.instead,section applies its remedies to any person who denies,aids or incites a denial,or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to section,language we read in harris as connoting intentional discrimination.harris,supra,cal d at.as a purely linguistic matter,therefore,another reasonable interpretation of section,subdivision f is that it makes all violations of the ada violations of section but,together with section,authorizes a private action for damages under the unruh civil rights act only for ada violations involving intentional discrimination.this is the reading embraced by the gunther court gunther,supra,th at,d and urged on us by defendant.
although linguistically admissible,gunther reading of the statute is not consistent with our understanding of the unruh civil rights act as elucidated in harris,or with the law history.as noted earlier,sections and have,throughout their history,functioned as an integral legal scheme section has defined the civil rights of californians to equal treatment in public accommodations,and section has established the liabilities of those who violate such civil rights.section has always referred expressly to violations of section and provided remedies for those violations.as we said in harris,section provide s an enforcement mechanism for section.harris,supra,cal d at.
in harris,we analyzed the statutory scheme as a both sections and concluded a violation of that law could not be established on a disparate impact theory.our holding in harris was not that section required proof of intentional discrimination in order to obtain damages,but that a plaintiff seeking to establish a case under the unruh act must plead and prove intentional discrimination harris,supra,cal d at,italics added.in reaching this conclusion,we relied on a provision of section providing that application of neutral standards does not violate the law and on the entire history of the unruh civil rights act,as well as on the particular language of section.harris,at.nowhere in harris did we suggest that unintentional discrimination would violate section,but would not support an action for damages under section.rather,we held that unintentional discrimination did not violate the unruh civil rights act at all.
the gunther court misread our harris decision as interpreting section only,hence unaffected by the addition of subdivision f to section.see gunther,supra,th at,d.as a federal court which followed lentini and disagreed with gunther explained,conceptually gunther envisions a process for obtaining damages first,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant engaged in discrimination,cal,and second,that the discrimination was intentional,cal.wilson haria and gogri d.because the amendment that added subdivision f to section made no substantial changes to the language of section relied on in harris,the gunther court believed that amendment did nothing to affect harris requirement of intentional discrimination.gunther,at,d.but gunther distinction between violations of section and violations of section warranting a remedy under section is without historical support.section has always provided remedies for violations of section,and our holding in harris concerned both sections.the most natural reading of the statutory section provides remedies for all categories of discrimination prohibited under section also the reading that best accords with the law history.
section authorizes a damages action against any person who makes any discrimination contrary to section.by adding subdivision f to section,making all ada or not involving intentional of the unruh civil rights act as well,the legislature included ada violations in the category of discrimination contrary to section,thus making them remediable under section.as the lentini court explained,quoting an earlier district court decision,because the unruh act has adopted the full expanse of the ada,it must follow,that the same standards for liability apply under both acts.lentini,supra,at.the effect was to create an exception to harris holding that a plaintiff seeking to establish a case under the unruh civil rights act must plead and prove intentional discrimination harris,supra,cal d at.
iii.legislative history 
we also find compelling evidence of legislative intent in the legislative history of the amendment,assembly bill reg.sess.as noted,assembly members were told that by adding subdivision f to section the bill would m ake a violation of the ada a violation of the unruh act.thereby providing persons injured by a violation of the ada with the remedies provided by the unruh act,right of private action for damages.assem.judiciary on assem.bill,supra,at,italics added.senators were told this bill would make a violation of the ada a violation of the unruh act.thereby providing persons injured by a violation of the ada with the remedies provided by the unruh act,right of private action for damages.judiciary on assem.bill,supra,at,italics added.
the ada,as explained above,permits a disabled individual denied access to public accommodations to recover damages in a government enforcement action only,not through a private action by the aggrieved person.but by incorporating the ada into the unruh civil rights act,california own civil rights law covering public accommodations,which does provide for such a private damages action,the legislature has afforded this remedy to persons injured by a violation of the ada.the legislative history shows the legislature contemplated and intended this effect,for,as both the legislative committee reports quoted above state,one purpose of the legislation was to provid e persons injured by a violation of the ada with the remedies provided by the unruh act,including a right of private action for damages.contrary to the gunther court reading,therefore,the evidence is clear that the law was intended not only to prohibit ada violations under section,but when such violations occur to provide a damages remedy under section 
the legislative history,true,does not explicitly mention ada violations that do not involve intentional discrimination.but neither does it mention those that do.rather,like the language of the amendment itself,it demonstrates an intent to incorporate ada accessibility standards comprehensively into the unruh civil rights act and thus to provide a damages remedy for any violation of the ada mandate of equal access to public accommodations.that broad remedial intent covers the particular circumstance before us.
any doubt remaining after examination of the language,context,and history of section,subdivision f would be resolved by the principle that the unruh civil rights act must be construed liberally in order to carry out its purpose,which is to create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in california business establishments.angelucci century supper club,supra,cal th at,d.the legislature having decided,in the amendment,to pursue the unruh civil rights act goal of equality by incorporating ada accessibility law into california own law,in the absence of contrary legislative direction we may not choose a restrictive reading of that amendment over a reasonable reading that gives full effect to the law guarantees.
we turn to two of the main reasons defendant and the gunther court gave for their interpretation the relationship between the unruh civil rights act and similar legislation,and the goal of curbing abusive litigation practices.
iv.relationship to other statutes 
the gunther court relied heavily on what it perceived as a deliberate legislative choice to require proof of intentional discrimination under the unruh civil rights act,pursuant to which plaintiffs recover minimum damages of see,subd.a,while allowing unintentional ada access violations to be remedied under the disabled persons act another california statutory scheme guaranteeing access to individuals with disabilities,which provides for minimum damages of only see,subd.a.gunther,supra,th at,d.the court believed that under its interpretation of the unruh civil rights act,the two statutes dovetail nicely.where there is intentional discrimination,there is a four times larger minimum penalty if there is,plaintiff still recovers,but less.gunther,at,d.
historically,however,it could not have been the legislature intent to create the contrasting set of remedies gunther describes.that is because in,when the legislature added subdivision f to section,making violations of the ada violations of the unruh civil rights act as well and doing the same for the disabled persons act by adding subdivision d to section,the minimum damages under the two laws were identical.historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll,historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll,stats,ch,stats,ch.the amendment could not,therefore,have been intended to balance a greater scienter requirement in section with greater minimum damages,as the gunther court imagined 
nor is gunther persuasive in its assertion that lentini interpretation,under which ada violations,even if not involving intentional discrimination,would be remediable by either section or section lentini,supra,at,renders section redundant gunther,supra,th at,d.the unruh civil rights act and the disabled persons act clearly have significant areas of overlapping application,although the unruh civil rights act,of course,applies to many more types of discrimination,while the disabled persons act contains unique specific provisions regarding guide,service,and signal dogs and may apply to more public places,facilities,and services than the unruh civil rights act.compare,subd.b all business establishments of every kind whatsoever with,subd.a streets,highways,sidewalks,walkways,public buildings and other public places and,subd.a accommodations,advantages,facilities,telephone facilities,places to which the general public is invited.recognizing the substantial overlap,the legislature has expressly prohibited double recovery under sections and,subd.c.as to ada violations,the overlap is plainly deliberate,the legislature having specified that ada violations are also violations of both t
