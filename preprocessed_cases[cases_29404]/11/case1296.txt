we consolidate these appeals for purposes of review and this opinion.enforma natural products,enforma asks us to quash two separate preliminary injunctions issued by district judge spencer letts before this case was reassigned to district judge stephen wilson restricting the sale and marketing of enforma diet supplement products.both appeals focus on irregular procedures employed by the district court.in appeal,enforma argues that the district court improperly relied on a expert and issued insufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the first preliminary injunction against enforma.in appeal,enforma contends that the district court unilateral substantive amendment of the parties stipulated proposed preliminary injunction was an abuse of discretion,particularly where the district court added an erroneous contempt finding.enforma also argues that the findings and conclusions issued in support of the second injunction are insufficient and that the court reliance on the expert was improper.
we vacate both injunctions and remand both appeals.in appeal,we remand for proper findings of fact supported by a record made in open court and we instruct the district court to clarify the status and role of the expert in accord with this opinion.in appeal we instruct the district court to review the parties stipulated proposed preliminary injunction,to identify the court objections,and to provide the parties an opportunity to respond to the court concerns.alternatively,the district court may,upon notice,enter a different form of preliminary injunction supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record.
i background and procedural history for both 
enforma markets and sells diet supplement products.in april,the federal trade commission ftc brought an action against enforma and andrew grey,enforma president and chief executive officer collectively enforma in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that enforma violated the federal trade commission act act by making false and unsubstantiated claims for products distributed under the trade names fat trapper,fat trapper plus and exercise in a bottle.in broad outline,the ftc complaint challenged enforma claims that its products enable consumers to lose weight and maintain weight loss without the need to reduce the intake of calories or to engage in physical exercise prevent the absorption of fat in the human body increase metabolism at the cellular level,leading to lower levels of fat in the human body and enable consumers to lose weight even if they eat foods.
the parties resolved the complaint in may through entry of a stipulated final order.as part of the stipulated final order,enforma admitted no liability,but agreed to pay the ftc million.enforma also agreed not to sell or market any product making the above or similar claims unless it possessed and relied upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates any such representation at the time the claim was made 
in january,the ftc applied for an order to show cause why enforma and michael ehrman,an enforma officer,should not be held in civil contempt for violating the may order the first contempt action.the ftc alleged that enforma continued to use misleading advertising for its products despite a lack of adequate substantiation for its claims 
the district court held a status conference on the first contempt action in march.at the conference,the district court indicated that its preliminary review of the evidence failed to support enforma weight loss claims,but did appear to support its claims concerning the ability of chitosan,the active ingredient in fat trapper plus.enforma expressed a desire to present expert witness testimony.the district court indicated that it intended to appoint a expert to aid the court.the district court stated that the expert would review the work of both parties experts,advise the court regarding how much discovery was needed,advise the court as to the proper methodology for examining the claims,and determine which of the parties experts had presented the stronger scientific views.the court explained that before the experts opinions were refined by counsel and before the parties deposed one another experts,the court wanted the parties experts to meet informally with the expert to discuss the science and to narrow the range of the dispute.the parties agreed to have their experts propose and select a mutually agreeable candidate to serve as the expert.the court also ordered the parties to submit in writing the issues that the expert should examine.
on march,heber,who was selected by the parties,was appointed by the court to serve as the court expert.the order appointing heber states that the expert is appointed to evaluate matters related to the science at issue,and to advise the court with respect to his opinions related to the science.the ftc and enforma lodged significantly different proposed orders specifying scientific issues for consideration and evaluation by heber.the record discloses that the district court did not enter either proposed order.there is no record before us identifying what matters,if any,the district court submitted to heber.
on july,while the first contempt action was still under consideration,the ftc filed a second application for an order to show cause why enforma should not be held in civil contempt for violating the may stipulated final order the second contempt action.the defendants in the second contempt action are enforma natural products,seven,llc,an enforma subsidiary,and donna diferdinando,of marketing and development for enforma and vice president of research and development for seven,llc collectively also enforma.the ftc alleged that enforma was marketing acceleron and chitozyme,two products that made the same general claims associated with exercise in a bottle and fat trapper plus,respectively.in its supporting memorandum,the ftc requested the initiation of contempt proceedings and a temporary restraining order tro to prevent enforma from making and disseminating allegedly unsubstantiated claims regarding its products through marketing and packaging.
on july,the district court denied the tro request associated with this second contempt proceeding,but scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for september.the parties completed briefing on the injunction issue related to the second contempt action by september.the hearing was continued to september,and then to october.
on september,the court conducted an status conference with regard to the second preliminary injunction request.during the conference,the district court stated that the merits of the contempt issues would involve a bench trial.nothing was resolved during this status conference.
following the september,status conference,the district court scheduled an october,meeting,which the court initially called a hearing.the court calendar designated the meeting as a status conference.it is unclear what,exactly,occurred at the october,proceeding,which took place off the record.it is also not clear whether the proceeding was directed at both contempt actions or only the second action,but it appears that the proceeding involved discussion of issues common to both actions.according to the parties,the meeting began as an informal conference between the district court judge,counsel,the experts of both parties,and the expert,heber.heber and the parties experts discussed the scientific issues involved in the case.heber was not under oath during the meeting,nor was he by the parties the parties report that at one point,the district court judge left the meeting and then returned.it appears that there were also ex parte communications between the district court and heber.the district court later indicated that heber opined during the october,conference that enforma sources provided inadequate substantiation of its claims.enforma,on the other hand,claims that when the district court judge was not present,heber actually confirmed that fat trapper plus does,in fact,trap fat.
at the end of the conference,the district court indicated that it would grant the ftc preliminary injunction request related to the second contempt action.later that day,the district court signed the ftc proposed injunction order,adopting verbatim the ftc proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the ftc proposed findings were conclusory and provided no details concerning enforma alleged contumacy.
the next day,enforma appealed the preliminary injunction,contending that the district court made inadequate findings of fact and improperly relied on the opinion of heber.this first preliminary injunction relating to the second contempt action is the subject of the first appeal,number.
on november,just after enforma appealed the preliminary injunction,the district court held a telephonic status conference during the conference,the district court made additional oral findings in support of the preliminary injunction that had just been appealed.
also on november,the ftc,having successfully procured a preliminary injunction in the second contempt action,lodged a proposed injunction addressing the allegations and defendants involved in the first contempt action.the ftc did not file a brief.the next day,enforma filed an opposition to the proposed injunction,and the ftc filed its reply a week later.
on december,before the district court acted on the ftc new preliminary injunction request relating to the first contempt action,the ftc and enforma stipulated to entry of a proposed form of preliminary injunction.the proposed terms of the parties stipulated preliminary injunction were almost identical to those found in the october,injunction related to the second contempt action.the parties also stipulated to a continuation of the merits hearing in the second contempt action to january.
the district court considered both stipulations and agreed to the continuance.the court also entered the form of the proposed injunction to which the parties agreed,but only after making two significant changes to its terms the district court struck language that would have allowed enforma to repackage,rather than recall,its fat trapper,fat trapper plus,and exercise in a bottle products.the district court also added language stating that it found the defendants in contempt during the course of the october,informal hearing.enforma appealed this preliminary injunction as well,challenging,among other things,the district court unilateral amendment of the parties proposed form of injunction.this second preliminary injunction relating to the first contempt action is the subject of appeal

iii appeal 
this appeal is enforma challenge to the first preliminary injunction,related to the second contempt action involving the products acceleron and chitozyme.just after the unrecorded october,proceeding,the district court adopted verbatim the ftc proposed form of the injunction,including the findings of fact and conclusions of law.enforma briefing focuses solely on the sufficiency of the district court findings and conclusions and the participation of the expert,heber.because there is evidence in the record to suggest that the district court may have improperly relied on heber opinion,we vacate the preliminary injunction and remand for further factual development and clarification of the factual and expert contributions of heber.we agree with enforma that the district court factual findings,adopted verbatim from the ftc proposed order,are insufficient in the circumstances in this case and we remand for further factual development.
role of the expert 
enforma argues that the district court erroneously deprived the appellants of the ability to depose or the expert,heber,or to view a report prepared by heber,as required by federal rule of evidence the ftc argues,however,that heber was only a technical advisor and thus not subject to rule requirements.the record is not conclusive on this issue.enforma claims that heber presented his opinions to the parties during the october,conference,and that the district court relied on those opinions in deciding to issue the preliminary injunction.the ftc contends that the october,meeting was not the basis for entry of the preliminary injunction and that heber was not an independent source of evidence.our review is hampered by the lack of any record detailing the proceedings of october,which resulted in a grant of the petition for a preliminary injunction.
when outside technical expertise can be helpful to a district court,the court may appoint a technical advisor.ass of educators california amae,cir en banc.the role of a technical advisor is to organize,advise on,and help the court understand relevant scientific evidence.id.a technical advisor is a tutor who aids the court in understanding the jargon and theory relevant to the technical aspects of the evidence.reilly united states,cir.a technical advisor may not assume the role of an expert witness by supplying new evidence nor may an advisor usurp the role of the judge by making findings of fact or conclusions of law.see a m records,napster,cir reilly,at.technical advisors,acting as such,are not subject to the provisions of rule,which govern expert witnesses.a expert is a witness subject to rule if the expert is called to testify or if the court relies on the expert as an independent source of evidence.amae,at reilly,at.
heber was not a testifying expert witness in a formal sense.he was never placed under oath or called to testify at trial.he did not submit an expert report or any other independent evidence on the record.according to enforma,however,heber offered his own opinion on the scientific evidence in the record during the october,conference.without a record of the october proceeding and any possible ex parte communication between heber and the district court,it is impossible to determine whether heber became the source of independent evidence or whether he merely advised the court with regard to the scientific issues in the case.
even if we assume that heber was a technical advisor who did not provide independent evidence,we are concerned about the manner in which the district court utilized heber expertise.despite our general endorsement of technical advisors,there is concern that the use of technical advisors may impermissibly influence a district court ultimate findings or impinge upon the court role as finder of fact.in amae,we explained that in the absence of any evidence even suggesting an impropriety on the part of the district court,we do not conclude that the court abused its discretion and we assume that the district court did its job properly.at.unlike the situation in amae,however,this record contains evidence that leads us to question whether the district court did its job properly.
the district court indicated that it was unlikely to disagree with heber views.before heber was appointed,the district court explained to the parties that the role of heber,the expert,would be to confer with the parties experts in an informal discussion and to tell the court who right.the district court stated that the court would ultimately decide which party expert he believed,but admitted that he was unlikely to disagree with the expert after those views were apparently expressed at an informal proceeding,the district court immediately issued a preliminary injunction.the district court later stated on the record that the preliminary injunction reflected the court independent views.the record also indicates,however,that the district court initially believed that enforma evidence substantiated enforma claims,though not its claims.the little evidence that is available in the record suggests that the district court may have improperly relied on independent findings and conclusions of heber.
enforma claims that heber carried a stack of materials with him when he attended the october,proceeding.enforma also asserts that the parties did not have an opportunity to view the materials that heber reviewed or to question heber about the studies and reports on which he relied.if heber was merely a technical advisor,he should not have relied upon information beyond,perhaps,his own work on the subject.if heber offered independent evidence as an expert witness,he should have been subject to about the information he relied upon in forming his opinions.see.
the district court failure to make a record of heber conclusions exacerbates our concern that heber may have played an improper role in the district court decision.in amae we accepted a paucity of information in the record about the technical expert interaction with the district court where the district court made all required findings of fact.at.here,the district court failure to make adequate findings of fact joins other signs that undermine our confidence that the district court acted independently.the district court could have alleviated these concerns by detailing the expert role at the time of appointment and providing a more detailed description of heber actual role.the district court decision not to adopt any safeguards provides little reason for comfort.

judge tashima recommendations include the following procedural steps utilize a fair and open procedure for appointing a neutral technical advisor address any allegations of bias,partiality,or lack of qualification clearly define and limit the technical advisor duties make clear to the technical advisor that any advice he or she gives to the court can not be based on any information and make explicit,either through an expert report or a record of ex parte communications,the nature and content of the technical advisor advice.amae,at tashima,dissenting.on remand,the district court should consider implementing some or all of these safeguards to assure the parties that the court is proceeding openly and fairly.employment of these standards will aid in appellate review if such review becomes necessary.
sufficiency of the findings 
despite the district court failure to clarify the role of heber,remand might have been unnecessary if the district court findings of fact were sufficiently detailed or uncontroverted to justify its decision.see id.at davis,at magna weld,at.the district court findings are neither.
enforma argues that the district court findings of fact are insufficient because they are adopted verbatim from the ftc conclusory,boilerplate order.we agree.the only finding in the district court injunctive order addressing the ftc likelihood of success on the merits states 
there is good cause to believe that defendants have disseminated and are likely to disseminate advertising,packaging and labeling for the products chitozyme and acceleron that violate the stipulated final order.
although verbatim adoption of a prevailing party proposed findings is not automatically objectionable if the findings are supported by the record,see unt aerospace,cir,the practice is generally disapproved,see lumbermen,at.the district court mechanical adoption of the ftc proposed findings renders them insufficient in this case,where evidence provided by enforma raises a genuine dispute as to whether the ftc would prevail on the merits and where there is no record of the hearing or conference that preceded the grant of the petition for preliminary injunctive relief.
the ftc asserts that even if the district court written findings are insufficient standing alone,the findings are adequate when supplemented by the court oral findings made on the record five days after the hearing during the november,teleconference the district court supplemented its findings 
i think that the findings of fact and the order i signed are all right.essentially,i think there is empirical evidence today on what happens with humans,and so far no showing has been made that the empirical evidence would support any claims at all.i also think that no showing was do think there is an overwhelming showing that the product has been sold as a weight loss product and has been bought as a weight loss product,there being no other tenable explanation for why people would buy it at all.as to the scientific information,that,too,was not on the record.as i did say the other day,professor heber really reinforced exactly the findings i would have made if he never appeared at all.he was engaged because it appeared that there could be a more informed reading of the same information that would support a different conclusion than the one i had reached.but,as you know,he came out exactly the opposite from that i do think that the product has been sold on the basis of false representations.and there does appear to be any way that it can be sold in the future without running into the same thing.so i would expect the preliminary injunction to ripen into a permanent injunction rather quickly once you reached the conclusions that i have reached rather firmly,albeit on preliminary injunction basis,i required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.these are they.i do see how i could permit continued sales or a stay of the order when my opinion is that every sale is a fraudulent sale.
the district court findings must be explicit enough to give the appellate court a clear understanding of the basis of the trial court decision,and to enable it to determine the ground on which the trial court reached its decision.unt,at internal citations omitted.even with the district court november,findings,we can not determine whether the distr
