this appeal is the first of three unrelated but similar cases requiring us to decide whether and to what extent an outdoor advertising company has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a municipal sign ordinance.in this opinion,we will outline the general legal principles applicable to all three cases and decide the appeal in the challenge to the san diego ordinance we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment to the city of san diego.
background 
get outdoors ii is an outdoor advertising company attempting to build and operate signs in the city of san diego the city.on june,get outdoors ii filed applications for billboard permits with the city,through its development services department.get outdoors ii alleges that it had already signed leases with various real property owners to post signs on their parcels.
when the company representative dropped off the applications,a city official informed him that the city sign ordinance prohibited new billboards but agreed to review the applications.the city then performed a complete review of the applications and notified get outdoors ii the next day that it could not grant permits for any of the signs under san diego municipal code sdmc,which prohibits new signs bearing messages the city sent a formal letter,dated june,to the same effect in a later declaration,a city development official explained that,in addition to violating the billboard ban,each of the permit applications was missing key documents and that,in any case,the proposed billboards violated size and height restrictions.each of the proposed billboards had a display square footage of and a pole height of feet in areas where display was limited to,or square feet and pole height limited to or feet.
get outdoors ii filed this lawsuit on july.its,second amended complaint raises fourteen claims for relief based on the first and fourteenth amendments.it argues that the city billboard regulations are unconstitutionally overbroad under the first and fourteenth amendments because they favor commercial over speech and some types of noncommercial speech over others,and that its own rights were violated by the ban on signs,as well as certain size and height restrictions.it also argued that the permitting process was an invalid prior restraint because it lacked a deadline provision and because it gave city officials unbridled discretion to grant or deny permits.get outdoors ii requested injunctive relief,damages,and attorney fees.notably,it requested that the court invalidate the entire sign ordinance.
the parties filed for summary judgment,which were argued in november.by that time,the city had enacted several legislative amendments,including a message substitution clause,a deadline for decisions on all permit applications,and a judicial review provision.see sdmc a d.the district court granted summary judgment to the city on july.see get outdoors ii city of san diego,d.
the district court held that get outdoors ii lacked standing to bring its overbreadth claim because it was challenging provisions of the ordinance other than the provision that applied to it,found the billboard ban constitutional,rejected the challenge to the permit procedure as moot,and rejected the unbridled discretion claim on the merits.the court also held that the challenged provisions were severable because the size and height restrictions may function independently from the provisions regulating sign copy and location.it granted summary judgment to the city.
get outdoors ii filed its timely appeal on august.we review the district court dismissal for lack of standing,dismissal for mootness,and grant of summary judgment de novo.see ruiz city of santa maria,cir desert outdoor advertising,city of moreno valley,cir.we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.lambert blodgett,cir.we hold that the city billboard size and height restrictions do not violate the first amendment,that get outdoors ii permit applications violated these restrictions,and that it therefore lacks standing to challenge the ban on messages.because we also hold that the challenge to the permit process fails,we affirm.
ii.standing 
we turn first to the question of whether get outdoors ii has standing to challenge the entire sign ordinance on the basis of the injuries it has alleged here.because get outdoors ii has made what it calls an overbreadth claim,it argues that it falls into a special exceptional category of standing doctrine.throughout its briefs,get outdoors ii uses overbreadth to describe two different arguments a severability argument that an injury caused by one provision of the sign ordinance should be considered an injury caused by the entire sign ordinance and a traditional overbreadth claim that certain provisions of the sign code are unconstitutionally overbroad because they threaten to burden the speech of to this case.the discussion that follows addresses both of these arguments.
lujan and overbreadth standing 
the irreducible minimum of standing under article iii of the constitution is an injury in fact which is actual,concrete,and particularized a causal connection between that injury and the defendant conduct and a likelihood that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision of the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the federal courts have supplemented this requirement of constitutional standing with the doctrine of prudential standing,which requires us to ask whether the plaintiff claim is sufficiently individualized to ensure effective judicial review.see elk grove unified school dist.newdow,d sec y of state joseph munson,d schlesinger reservists committee to stop the war,d.we employ the prudential standing doctrine to avoid usurping the legislature role as the policymaking body in our separation of powers.see prime media city of brentwood,cir hereinafter prime media ii.
when a plaintiff states an overbreadth claim under the first amendment,however,we suspend the prudential standing doctrine because of the special nature of the risk to expressive rights.see broadrick oklahoma,d dombrowski pfister,d.while the prudential standing doctrine typically prevents us from hearing lawsuits on the basis of injuries to,the doctrine operates as a narrow exception permitting the lawsuit to proceed on the basis of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.broadrick,at.in other words,a plaintiff challenging a law as overbroad argues that the law is constitutionally valid as applied to him,but unconstitutional as to others.see,virginia am.booksellers ass n,d new york ferber,d.
even when raising an overbreadth claim,however,we ask whether the plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact and can satisfactorily frame the issues on behalf of these.see munson,at.gospel missions of am.city of los angeles,cir.without this bare minimum of standing,the overbreadth exception would nullify the notion of standing generally in first amendment litigation.we therefore agree with a string of recent decisions in other circuits holding that the three lujan elements still apply in the overbreadth context.see camp legal defense fund,city of atlanta,cir accord prime media ii,at kh outdoor,clay county,cir advantage media,city of eden prairie,cir see generally valley forge christian college americans united for the separation of church and state,d.
in this case,get outdoors ii challenges the ban,as well as the rest of the sign code,on the basis of the harm it causes to other potential speakers,specifically noncommercial speakers.get outdoors ii must still show,however,that it meets the lujan requirements for each of the provisions it wishes to challenge as overbroad.
get outdoors ii standing 
having established that get outdoors ii must meet all three lujan requirements for any claim it wishes to make,we turn to deciding where and to what extent get outdoors ii has standing.the injuries alleged in this case are as follows the denial of the permits being subjected to an unconstitutional ban,and being subjected to an unconstitutional prior restraint.therefore,we mus
