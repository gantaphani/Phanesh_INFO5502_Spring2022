tommy grass grass filed a charge under section b of the national labor relations act act,b,alleging that his employer,fedex freight east,or fedex,engaged in unfair labor practices by suspending and discharging him based on his union activity.after investigating the charge,the general counsel of the national labor relations board board issued a complaint alleging that fedex violated section a of the act by threatening grass and section a of the act by suspending and discharging grass based on his union activity.a.the alj found for the general counsel.the board adopted the alj recommended order,but only part of the alj reasoning.the board ordered fedex to cease and desist from discriminating against employees based on union activity,ordered fedex to reinstate grass,and awarded back pay.fedex petitions this court for review of the board order.the board brings a for enforcement of its order.for the following reasons,we deny fedex petition and grant the board.
background 
grass was a driver at fedex summit,illinois terminal from june,until he transferred to the company newly constructed chicago heights terminal in march.he remained a driver at the chicago heights terminal until his discharge on may.prior to grass discharge,grass supervisors found him to be a good worker with good numbers.witnesses for fedex testified,however,that grass was a slow worker and was sometimes suspected of milking the clock.nonetheless,grass was never officially reprimanded by fedex.
at the time of the incidents alleged in the general counsel complaint,art hollrah hollrah was a terminal manager and grass immediate supervisor at chicago heights.hollrah reported to david boyle boyle,a vice president of.stuart baxter baxter was hollrah human resources manager.chris merritt merritt was a city dispatcher and also a supervisor of grass,within section of the act,during the relevant period.tammy despaltro despaltro was grass human resources representative at the chicago heights terminal and was a supervisor within section of the act.robert paulsen paulsen was operations supervisor at the time,bill hawkins hawkins was a dispatcher at the chicago heights terminal,and steve cawgill cawgill was an operations manager.
in,the international brotherhood of teamsters,local union attempted,unsuccessfully,to organize fedex drivers.at this time,only the summit terminal was in operation.grass was on the union organizing committee in and wore union buttons on his hat and jacket while at work.in,the union again attempted to organize fedex drivers.in september,grass signed a union authorization card and began speaking in favor of a renewed organizational effort to other drivers at the summit and chicago heights terminals.there is no evidence in the record that any supervisor observed these activities,and grass did not wear union buttons in.in december,the union filed a petition seeking to represent summit and chicago heights drivers.the union failed to generate sufficient support from drivers.therefore,on december,the union withdrew the petition for the chicago heights drivers and on january,withdrew the petition for the summit drivers.
according to grass testimony,which the alj and the board credited,grass and human resources representative despaltro had a conversation at bally health club in chicago on january,about the union organizational activities.according to grass,despaltro told him that he was making a big mistake with this union thing.grass also testified that he had several conversations with despaltro through late january,in which he argued that employees would benefit from affiliation with the union.the alj credited this testimony.grass further testified that despaltro told him that fedex would close the facility if the union was voted in.the alj did not credit this statement,in large part because grass did not include it in his affidavits.
additionally,grass testified that in early january,he was involved in an argument with merritt in which merritt accused grass of taking more time than necessary to perform certain tasks.grass reported that at the end of the argument,merritt stated,what are you mad about because the union did get in grass responded that his differences with merritt had nothing to do with the union.merritt did not deny grass testimony,and the alj credited it.
the record shows that in late january,fedex took grass off his usual route and assigned him to another one.in early february,grass complained to boyle about the change.according to grass,boyle told him that he did like grass attitude,that he would not let grass stay here and ruin this company,and that grass knew what boyle was talking about.grass replied that he had worked hard for the company for years and this is the thanks i get.boyle did not deny this testimony and the alj found it to be credible.soon after,fedex restored grass to his usual route.
operations supervisor paulsen testified that around the same time as the incident with boyle,dispatcher hawkins told paulsen that grass was poisoning the company and that paulsen should keep a close watch on grass.paulsen also testified that fedex was aware of grass involvement with the union.additionally,paulsen testified that he told supervisor hollrah and operations manager cawgill that he had been a union driver and would not be a headhunter for and discharge employees without cause.the alj credited paulsen testimony.
on april,grass was driving his old route.he was scheduled to make deliveries and.grass testified that he had to reverse the order of his usual route,which resulted in some delays,because fedex employees had loaded his truck backwards.grass testified that he was also delayed that day because a customer loaded its freight onto his truck in a way that blocked other deliveries.grass testified that by the time he was scheduled to take his unpaid lunch break,he had not completed his morning deliveries and decided to complete a delivery while on his lunch break.he wrote on fedex driver detail form that he took lunch from to and that from to,he made a delivery to the auburn corporation.grass testified that at,he arrived at the thomas dodge company for a.according to grass,the freight he was to pick up was not yet ready,and he waited at thomas dodge until.grass testified that he called dispatcher merritt to report the problem and that merritt told him the thomas dodge assignment would be erased from fedex computerized records.the paperwork generated by grass itinerary for april shows no activity for the hour of to 
grass reported that because of the delays,he was unable to make his final two deliveries of the day,to adheron coatings and fisher services.grass testified that he called merritt to explain the problem and merritt instructed grass to report that the deliveries could not be made because both customers had closed by fedex records show that grass marked the close time as the reason for his nondeliveries.according to fedex policy,when a driver fails to make a scheduled delivery,he or she is required to fill out a returned delivery receipt and check off one of possible reasons for the nondelivery.misloaded freight is an acceptable reason for nondelivery.however,merritt would have been held responsible for such a failure.several drivers for fedex testified that dispatchers like merritt routinely instructed drivers to list a closure as the cause of a,regardless of the true reason.merritt denied having told grass to report that the customers were closed by.the alj credited grass testimony over merritt.hollrah testified that there are usually several returned packages each business day and that there freight that brought back a lot.
witnesses for fedex testified that employees from adheron coatings and fisher services called to complain about the april missed deliveries.however,employees of the two customers testified that they never called in the complaints alleged by fedex.the alj credited the customers employees testimony and rejected fedex.
on may,allegedly in response to the customer complaints,hollrah called grass into his office and told him to write a statement recounting his actions on his route on april.grass testified that he told hollrah that he could not recall his exact itinerary for april and that hollrah did not provide him with the paperwork from that day to refresh his memory.hollrah testified that he showed grass the day paperwork,and the alj credited hollrah testimony over grass.grass wrote down his recollection of the day for hollrah.according to grass,after he completed the statement,he realized that he had made errors and therefore drafted a second short statement.in response to hollrah further questioning,grass wrote three more short statements.hollrah asked grass to draft a sixth statement explaining why he had indicated on returned delivery receipts that he had failed to make the deliveries to adheron coatings and fisher services because the customers had closed by grass explained that his truck had been incorrectly loaded,which prevented him from making the deliveries and that he had reported the problem to merritt,who instructed him to state on the receipts that the deliveries could not be made because the customers had closed by 
grass admits that his statements contain errors and contradictions regarding where he was on april and why he did not make the two deliveries at the conclusion of the nearly meeting and after reviewing grass answers,receipts,and paperwork,hollrah told grass that he was suspended pending investigation,because records showed that he had not worked between and on april.grass gave an explanation for the missing hour,though he did not say that he was at thomas dodge.hollrah sent grass home.
hollrah testified that he consulted with boyle and baxter regarding grass case and forwarded relevant documents to them,along with his recommendation that grass should be terminated.boyle and baxter agreed.hollrah did not need boyle and baxter approval to discharge grass.on may,hollrah told grass that he was being discharged for submitting a false statement.fedex policy provides that dishonesty and providing false or misleading information are causes for immediate discharge.
subsequently,grass filed a charge with the board alleging that his discharge violated the provisions of the act.see a.the alj held that fedex suspension and discharge of grass violated sections a and a because the general counsel proved,under wright line lamoureux,wl,enf cir,cert.denied,d,that fedex had knowledge of grass sympathies and suspended and discharged grass based on animus and fedex failed to prove that it would have taken the same actions against grass even if he was not engaged in protected activity because fedex investigation of grass was prompted solely by invidious motivation.
the board adopted the alj recommended order,but found it was unnecessary to reach the question whether fedex investigation had an invidious motivation.instead,the board found that the reasons fedex gave for suspending and discharging grass were false and pretextual and that fedex failed to prove it would have taken the same actions in the absence of grass union activities.fedex filed a timely petition for review with this court,and the board filed a for enforcement of its order.
ii.discussion 
section a of the national labor relations act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed under section of the act.a.section a prohibits an employer from discriminating against employees with regard to hiring,tenure of employment,or other terms and conditions of employment in order to discourage membership in a labor organization.a.an employer that discharges an employee because of his or her union activities violates sections a and a of the act.vulcan basement waterproofing of,nlrb,cir.
to prove that an employer violated the act by discharging an employee,the general counsel must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee engaged in a protected activity the decisionmaker knew it and the employer acted because of animus.ryder truck rental nlrb,cir citing wright line.once the general counsel meets this burden,the company must either rebut that evidence or mount an affirmative defense that the company would have taken the same action despite the employee protected activities.id.
fedex challenges three aspects of the board decision.first,fedex maintains that the board determination that fedex was aware of grass union activities was not supported by substantial evidence.second,fedex argues that the board erred by finding substantial evidence supported its determination that fedex discharged grass because of animus.third,according to fedex,the board should have accepted fedex argument that it would have suspended and discharged grass regardless of his union activities,because grass was untruthful during fedex investigation of his april itinerary.
standard of review 
in this case,where fedex is challenging the board determination that the general counsel case is supported by substantial evidence,we owe significant deference to the board factual and legal conclusions and will not retry the case.as this court has explained 
we will enforce the nlrb order if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and its conclusions have a reasonable basis in the law.seating nlrb,cir.the substantial evidence test requires not the degree of evidence which satisfies the court that the requisite fact exists,but merely the degree that could satisfy the reasonable fact finder.atc vancom of cal.nlrb,cir quoting allentown mack sales,nlrb,d emphasis in original.we owe particular deference to the board credibility determinations,which we will disturb only in extraordinary circumstances.sca tissue am.nlrb,cir.
we apply a similarly deferential standard in determining whether the board legal conclusions have a reasonable basis in law.int l union of operating eng rs nlrb,cir.we must uphold the board legal conclusions unless they are irrational or inconsistent with the nlra.atc vancom,at.where the board adopts the alj findings of facts and conclusions of law,it is the alj determinations that we review.sca tissue,at.
ryder truck rental,at footnote omitted.
fedex maintains that we are required to review the board decision with special scrutiny,based on this court decision in weather shield manufacturing,nlrb,cir.that standard,however,applies only in instances in which the board has rejected the alj credibility determinations.id.at the first question we must address is whether the board rejected either the express or implied credibility findings of the alj.if it did,then the board conclusion is subject to special scrutiny rather than merely the substantial evidence test.this is not such a case.
before the alj,fedex argued that it discharged grass because hollrah determined that grass was dishonest about where he was on company time and why he did not make deliveries to two customers.contrary to fedex assertion,the alj did not credit hollrah testimony that grass was fired for dishonesty instead,the alj found that grass statements may have given the appearance of dishonesty.the alj findings support two alternative theories under which the alj could reject fedex affirmative defense first,that the reasons fedex gave for discharging grass were false and pretextual since grass was able to clear up the inconsistencies in his statements and second,that even if grass could not explain his apparent untruthfulness,the fact that fedex began its investigation based on antiunion animus was sufficient to show that grass would not have been discharged but for fedex animus.the board chose to rest its decision on the first theory,while the alj chose to rest it on the second.
we apply the substantial evidence standard of review here,where the board and the alj disagree as to derivative inferences made from the testimony,weather shield,at,but do not disagree over the credibility of the testimony itself.the board referred to specific findings by the alj that supported the board determination that the reasons given by fedex for grass discharge were false and pretextual 
fedex claimed that grass was discharged for lying in his paperwork about missed deliveries on april,for lying in conjunction with an inquiry into the missed deliveries,and additionally for lying about his whereabouts on company time.credited evidence adduced at the hearing,some of it undisputed,belies these reasons.grass undisputed testimony is that the failure of deliveries on april had several causes,among them the misloading by fedex employees of grass truck on that day,and a delay encountered by grass at an earlier delivery at thomas dodge.the judge credited grass testimony that he recorded the inaccurate reason for the the were c losed after in his paperwork upon the instruction of dispatcher and statutory supervisor chris merritt.fedex also claimed that grass falsely reported that he was on his unpaid lunchbreak from to,in apparent contradiction of his statement that he was making a stop at auburn corporation between and grass explained that he carries his lunch with him and cut his lunch short because of the workload.fedex did not produce evidence contravening grass testimony.
order at emphasis added.
these findings by the board are consistent with and supported by the alj credibility determinations.thus,we will enforce the board order if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and its conclusions have a reasonable basis in the law,and we will overturn the board credibility determinations only if we find this to be an extraordinary case.ryder truck rental,at.
knowledge of union activity 
under wright line,the general counsel was first required to prove that fedex was aware of grass union activities.fedex argues that the evidence shows that fedex was not aware of grass union activities and that the alj simply assumed that decisionmakers at fedex had this knowledge.fedex relies heavily on grass testimony that they were unaware of grass support of the union.fedex also points to testimony of its own witnesses,who stated that they did not know of activity by grass in support of a union.these witnesses include hollrah,merritt,and boyle,among others.
hollrah was the decisionmaker responsible for suspending and discharging grass.fedex argues that the alj erred by finding that hollrah had knowledge of grass union activities because the alj based this conclusion in part upon evidence of a single conversation between hollrah and robert paulsen,fedex freight former operations supervisor,and paulsen conversation with two lower level supervisors,dispatcher hawkins and operations manager cawgill.specifically,the alj found 
paulsen,who was fedex operations supervisor until he terminated in october,testified that or months before grass was discharged information got out that grass was engaging in union activities.at the time,he and dispatcher hawkins and operations manager cawgill had a discussion in which hawkins said,we need to keep an eye on grass,make sure he doing everything out there right.paulsen,obviously knowing that hawkins was not just referring to grass performance which,again,hollrah testified was good replied to hawkins that,i not going to be a headhunter for the company and fire people for no reason.paulsen was immediately called on hollrah carpet and asked what paulsen had meant by his statement.paulsen told hollrah that he had once been a union driver and that he was not going to fire any employee for also being one.hollrah did assure paulsen that fedex did not want paulsen to fire anyone for prounion sympathies,and that fact can be said to significantly dilute any evidence of animus that was implied by the statement of hollrah subordinate,hawkins.nevertheless,the exchange is at least further proof that fedex supervisors were aware of grass prounion sympathies and activities 
order at emphasis added.
substantial evidence supports the board conclusion that fedex was on notice that grass was engaged in union activity.the alj credited paulsen statement that information got out at fedex about grass union activity.additionally,paulsen testimony shows that hollrah understood that paulsen thought hollrah wanted grass fired because of his union activity.even if hollrah was not aware of such activity earlier,his conversation with paulsen put him on notice that grass was active in the union.fedex also argues that the alj erred by imputing knowledge of managers to hollrah.however,the alj found specifically that hollrah himself was made aware of grass union activities through his conversation with paulsen,if not earlier.the fact that grass testified that he did not openly support the union at work by wearing union buttons,for example does not disprove the conclusion that hollrah found out about grass union activities in some other way.this is not an extraordinary case in which we should disrupt the board credibility determinations.see sca tissue,at.
additionally,grass testimony about his argument with merritt,who was grass supervisor under the act,indicates that fedex knew that grass was a union supporter.in testimony the alj credited,grass said that in early january,he got into an argument with merritt,in which merritt asked grass,what are you mad about because the union did get in 
moreover,a number of additional pieces of testimony support the alj conclusion that fedex was aware of grass union activity.grass was a longtime union supporter and had openly and vigorously campaigned for the union at fedex summit facility in.grass was active in the union december organizing drive at chicago heights.in early january,according to grass testimony,despaltro told grass he was making a big mistake with the whole union thing.in early february,grass complained to vice president boyle about being taken off his old route,and boyle told grass that he did like his attitude and then he would not let grass stay here and ruin the company.the company did give grass back his old route.around the same time,however,hawkins told paulsen that grass was poisoning the company.
all of this evidence,taken as a whole and reviewed under the substantial evidence standard,supports the alj and the board conclusion that decisionmakers at fedex were aware of grass union activities.
antiunion animus 
the second element of a wright line prima facie case is that the employer acted against the employee based on antiunion animus.fedex argues that the board finding that fedex possessed the requisite antiunion animus was not supported by substantial evidence,because testimony regarding vice president boyle statements did not demonstrate that fedex acted out of antiunion animus and there was no evidence that fedex had discriminated against other employees who openly supported unionization.
first,fedex disputes the board finding that boyle demonstrated antiunion animus.grass testified that when he complained to boyle about being taken off his regular route shortly after the unionization efforts failed 
dave boyle said that he did like my attitude there.he said that i was unhappy and he did like to see me unhappy.dave went on and said that he rather see me leave the company and go somewhere else where i be happy.
and dave said,i not going to have you stay here and ruin this company.and you know what i talking about.
boyle did not deny grass testimony,and the board found it to be credible.the alj explained that this threat by boyle,a vice president of fedex,is more than enough proof of unlawful animus that would require fedex,under wright line,to go forward with evidence absent his protected activities.order at.
the alj explanation recognizes that boyle did not tell grass explicitly that grass would ruin the company by helping to unionize employees.nonetheless,the alj could reasonably infer this meaning from grass and boyle conversation and the surrounding circumstances.van vlerah,nlrb,cir in determining if a section violation occurred,t he words used by the employer,as well as the context in which they were conveyed,must be examined.in evaluating an allegation of discrimination based on antiunion animus,the board must determine the employer motivation in taking a particular action,and t his determination often must be made on the basis of circumstantial evidence.id.at.we will not overturn the alj determination even if we would reach a different outcome based on the same evidence.see id.we shall not displace the board choice betwe
