plaintiff barry hinesley hinesley challenges on appeal the summary judgment granted defendant oakshade town center oakshade on hinesley first amended complaint for fraud and rescission of his commercial lease with oakshade.hinesley contends oakshade did not conclusively negate or show hinesley could not prove an essential element of his case.we disagree and shall affirm the judgment.
background 
in july hinesley signed a commercial lease with oakshade for square feet of retail space in a shopping center located in the south part of the city of davis in yolo county.in september,hinesley filed this action against oakshade alleging causes of action for fraud and rescission of the lease.oakshade answered the complaint,generally denying the allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses.hinesley relinquished the leased premises in april,and in september,oakshade filed a against hinesley for rent due under the lease and for attorney fees.after oakshade motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted as to hinesley fraud cause of action with leave to amend,hinesley filed a first amended complaint for fraud based on fraudulent concealment of material facts and for rescission.
in his first amended complaint hinesley alleged he and oakshade,during the spring of,had negotiated the terms and conditions of a commercial lease to hinesley of a suite within a shopping center being developed by oakshade in davis.hinesley and oakshade later executed a lease,dated july,for a square foot space at the oakshade town center shopping center for a term of five years.hinesley alleged that during the negotiations,oakshade agent and representative,paul petrovich petrovich,told hinesley the regional restaurant chain dos coyotes,the international coffee shop chain starbucks,and the international ice cream and yogurt vendor chain would be leasing and occupying suites near the suite hinesley was to lease.it was represented all three chains would commence operations by the end of 
hinesley alleged petrovich knew when these representations were made that oakshade did not have any contractual commitment from any of these businesses.hinesley alleged oakshade,through petrovich,had an obligation to make a full and truthful disclosure of the contractual status of these prospective tenants once it elected to make some representations about them.instead,in order to mislead hinesley,oakshade concealed the true facts and failed to qualify the representations.
hinesley first amended complaint alleged he incurred costs,had to pay rent and other lease obligations for the leased premises,and lost profits directly attributable to the lack of foot traffic as the result of his reasonable reliance on the misrepresentations about his cotenants.he alleged oakshade failed to disclose the true facts concerning the prospective tenancies of starbucks,and dos coyotes,which facts,if they had been accurately disclosed to hinesley would have induced him not to enter into the subject lease,or,alternatively,to execute the lease with a later effective commencement date tied to the occupancy of one or more of the aforementioned prospective major tenants.in addition to damages,he sought rescission of the lease.
the case went to nonbinding arbitration.the arbitrator denied both hinesley claims for fraud and rescission and oakshade claims for rent and attorneys fees.after both parties requested trial de novo,oakshade moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the alleged statements were nonactionable opinion and the alleged concealment was not material because paragraph of the lease provided hinesley was not relying on the existence of other tenants in entering the contract and because hinesley never expressed any concern or raised any question about the other tenants to oakshade.
the trial court granted the motion,relying on the undisputed facts that hinesley did not advise oakshade that the existence of the other tenants was important to his decision,did not ask if other tenants had signed leases,and did not advise oakshade the start date of his lease should be tied to the arrival of other tenants.the trial court concluded a lessee in a commercial lease situation has a duty of discovery.judgment was entered in favor of defendant oakshade on hinesley complaint.
on oakshade for rent,the trial court granted summary adjudication for oakshade,finding hinesley liable for the outstanding rent due under the lease,but required the parties to proceed to trial on hinesley defense of mitigation of damages.a jury found oakshade had acted unreasonably in its efforts to mitigate its damages,and that oakshade could have further mitigated damages in the amount of.the court applied such further offset to the rent determined to be due and entered a judgment against hinesley on oakshade in the amount of.the trial court subsequently ordered hinesley to pay oakshade attorney fees of this appeal followed.
hinesley claims on appeal there were triable questions of fact as to whether petrovich unqualified representations regarding the three other tenants were material assertions of fact or,at the least,opinions for which he had no reasonable basis.

oakshade summary judgment focused on the fraud elements of misrepresentation and justifiable reliance.specifically,oakshade claimed the alleged representations were nonactionable opinions about the future actions of third parties.oakshade also claimed the representations were not material assertions on which hinesley reasonably relied because a specific section of the signed lease expressly repudiated any such reliance and hinesley never expressed any concern or raised any question about the other tenants to oakshade.
there existed a triable issue of fact as to whether petrovich representations were statements of fact or of nonactionable opinion 
oakshade contended in its motion for summary judgment that hinesley could not establish fraud because the alleged statements by petrovich were nonactionable opinion.oakshade relied on the deposition testimony of wayne beck beck,an acquaintance of hinesley who was present at the meeting at which the alleged representations were made.according to oakshade,hinesley own witness beck testified petrovich had made no specific statements regarding the other tenancies beck was simply left with the impression that the tenants were coming soon with no specific time frames for their arrival.according to beck,petrovich stated he was merely working with these other tenants.
oakshade argued such statements could not support an action for fraud citing the general rules that an action for fraud must be based on a statement of fact,not opinion,and that statements as to future actions by some third party are deemed nonactionable opinions.nibbi brothers,home federal sav.loan d.san francisco design center associates portman companies th,d witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.
in opposition to oakshade motion for summary judgment hinesley disputed the summarization of beck deposition testimony regarding the representations made by petrovich.hinesley pointed out beck did not testify that petrovich made no specific statements about other tenants,but only that he could not recall the specifics of the conversation.although beck could not recall any specific time or date mentioned for the arrival of the other tenants,beck was left with the impression it was soon.whatever soon is.beck remembered that petrovich pointed to particular locations on the shopping center site plan for the three other tenants,indicating they were going to locate there.beck said there was no discussion regarding the status of contract negotiations with the three tenants.according to beck,the question did not come up.however,nothing was said that left beck with the impression there was some conditional nature to their future tenancy.when asked later whether he recalled anything to the effect that petrovich was in negotiations with these other tenants but they had not yet signed,beck said he was sure there was some conversation to that effect or he would not have had the feeling they were coming.beck suggested it would have probably been in the context of,yes,we are working with them,or something to that effect,but he could not recall the exact conversation.
in opposition to the motion for summary judgment hinesley submitted a declaration from beck in which beck said petrovich never stated that these three major tenants were potential tenants,possible tenants,likely tenants,probable tenants.petrovich pointed to the lease spaces on his site plan of his shopping center and stated definitely where each of these three major tenant s were going to be located.there is no question in my mind that petrovich presented these three major tenants as definite.
hinesley also submitted in opposition to the summary judgment portions of his own deposition.hinesley testified at his deposition petrovich told him starbucks would be opening right on the corner of building and they would be open by year end.petrovich showed him a space in building that was going to be a restaurant that was known as dos coyotes.it would also be open by the end of.the other tenant that was going to be coming by the end of was,but it was not totally decided which suite it was going to take.petrovich did not say he had a signed lease with each of these tenants,but neither did he say he was in negotiations with them.as petrovich described the location of the other tenants,hinesley had no reason to believe anything else other than the fact they were coming.
hinesley opposition to oakshade motion for summary judgment,thus,showed a conflict in the evidence over what petrovich said,and expressed by gestures,to hinesley regarding dos coyotes,starbucks,and.hinesley version was not obviously false and if believed,hinesley description of the representations made by petrovich regarding at least dos coyotes and starbucks,supported by beck declaration and deposition testimony taken in context,contained an implied assertion that oakshade had already signed leases with these particular businesses the definite description of where they were going to be located and that they were going to be operating by the end of the calendar year suggested they were already tenants of oakshade in the process of opening their businesses.this was a false assertion of existing fact,not an opinion regarding future actions of third parties.petrovich did not disclose to hinesley oakshade true contractual status with these businesses.a triable issue existed,therefore,as to what petrovich actually represented to hinesely whether petrovich expressions were actionable misrepresentations of facts or nonactionable opinions about the future.
we turn to the question of whether oakshade showed,in its motion for summary judgment,that such misrepresentations,even if found to have been made,were not material assertions on which hinesley justifiably relied in deciding to sign his lease with oakshade.
oakshade successfully demonstrated no triable issue of fact existed as to whether hinesley justifiably relied on any material misrepresentation or concealment 
oakshade claimed any representations made by petrovich regarding the three other tenants were not material assertions on which hinesley justifiably relied because a specific section of the signed lease expressly repudiated any such reliance and hinesley never expressed any concern or raised any question about the other tenants to oakshade.
oakshade submitted,as part of the evidence supporting its summary judgment motion,a copy of the lease between hinesley and oakshade.paragraph of the lease provides lessor reserves the right to effect such other tenancies in the shopping center as lessor in the exercise of its judgment shall determine to bet sic promote the interest of the shopping center.lessee does not rely on the fact nor does lessor represent that any specific lessee of sic type or number of lessees shall during the term of this lease occupy any space in the shopping center.italics added.
oakshade cited to hinesley deposition in which hinesley stated he was certain he had read paragraph,as he had read all other sections in the contract.oakshade pointed out hinesley had a lawyer assist him in reviewing the lease and hinesley never requested any revisions to paragraph of the lease despite requesting and receiving revisions to a number of other provisions in the lease.
in his declaration submitted in support of the summary judgment motion,petrovich stated that at the time hinesley executed his lease the shopping center already had a safeway store and a rite aid store.the safeway store occupies approximately square feet of space and is the largest grocery store in davis.the rite aid store has approximately square feet and is the only pharmacy serving south davis.in comparison to the total square footage of the shopping center,the total square footage which would have been occupied by dos coyotes,starbucks and was.hinesley never asked if these three other tenants had signed leases,did not discuss with petrovich the potential benefits,such as traffic volume or spending patterns,of such tenants,never told petrovich that he was signing this lease based on those three tenants coming,and never said the start date of his lease should be tied to the arrival of those three tenants.
in opposition to oakshade summary judgment motion,hinesley admitted paragraph was in the lease,but stated it was not emphasized in any manner.hinesley acknowledged he had read the entire lease prior to signing it,but pointed to a portion of his deposition in which he clarified that he did not remember stopping at paragraph and spending any time reviewing it to a point where he could recall looking at that particular paragraph.hinesley said he paid for and obtained only a limited review of the lease by his attorney.he asked the attorney to take a precursor look at this contract just for obvious improprieties.he did not ask for an,review.he did not mention to his attorney any of the representations made by petrovich regarding other tenants.as the attorney was unaware of such representations,he did not bring paragraph to hinesley attention.the attorney did not advise hinesley in the preparation of the lease modifications proposed by hinesley.hinesley agreed he never requested revision to paragraph.
