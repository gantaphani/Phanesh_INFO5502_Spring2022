in june,the san diego county board of supervisors adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance to govern the operation of adult entertainment businesses within its jurisdiction,which covers the unincorporated portions of the county.the ordinance restricts the hours in which such businesses can operate,requires the removal of doors on peep show booths,and limits adult entertainment establishment to areas of the county zoned for industrial use.san diego county stated rationale for the ordinance was to combat negative secondary,disorderly conduct,blight,noise,traffic,property value depreciation,and unsanitary concentrate in and around adult businesses.
the two adult entertainment establishments presently operating in the unincorporated portions of san diego county filed suit.the city of san diego and the other incorporated municipalities in the county are not governed by this ordinance.in this appeal,the operator of one of the establishments,fantasyland video,appeals the district court decision to uphold the ordinance hours restriction and requirement.in its briefing to us,fantasyland also contended that the hours of operation restriction violated both the first amendment and the california constitution.after oral argument,we certified to the california supreme court the question of what the proper standard of review is under the california constitution.fantasyland video,county of san diego,cir.the california supreme court responded that ordinances for adult businesses are subject to intermediate scrutiny.fantaemail yousyland video,county of san diego,cal,order denying request to decide a question of california law.in the meantime,fantasyland advised us of its decision to withdraw its claim that the hours of operation restriction violates the first amendment,while retaining its claim under the california constitution.the federal issue has thus been taken off the table regarding the hours restriction,but it remains a basis for the challenge to the requirement.
we affirm the district court decision to uphold the ordinance restriction as surviving intermediate scrutiny under the california constitution.fantasyland fails to cast direct doubt on the county rationale for the hours restriction.with respect to the requirement,we affirm the district court ruling that the county requirement of open booths at peep shows does not violate the first amendment.similar to the ordinances in other cases upholding requirements,the county ordinance is supported by evidence of the nexus between closed booths and adverse secondary effects such as prostitution and pandering,matters in which the county has a substantial interest in regulating.further,the ordinance is narrowly tailored.the content,number,and availability of peep shows are untouched the ordinance deals only with the doors.we further reject fantasyland argument that the provision is invalid under justice kennedy concurring opinion in city of los angeles alameda books,d.that concurrence is not applicable to requirements.
background 
in june,citing to concerns about the surrounding neighborhood,the county board of supervisors adopted a comprehensive set of regulations and licensing procedures governing adult entertainment establishments within its jurisdiction.among these regulations,the county prohibited any door,curtain,or obstruction of any kind to be installed within the entrance to a peep show booth.san diego county,ordinance,june.in addition,the county made it unlawful for any owner,operator,manager or employee of an adult entertainment establishment to remain open for business between the hours of and of any day excepting herefrom an adult hotel motel.san diego county ordinance.the ordinance took effect the following month.
fantasyland operates an adult arcade,bookstore,novelty shop,and video store.it initiated federal and state constitutional challenges against the new ordinance,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
the district court granted summary judgment to the county,upholding the ordinance requirement that adult establishments close between the hours of and and its restriction on doors at the entranceway to private peep show booths see fantasyland video,county of san diego,d.later,fantasyland filed a rule b motion for relief from judgment,which the district court denied.
these timely appeals followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over fantasyland constitutional claims under,a,and over its state claims under a.we have jurisdiction under.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party,determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact for trial.see gammoh city of la habra,cir.we review the district court denial of fantasyland rule b motion for an abuse of discretion.see united states asarco,cir.
iv.discussion 
the constitutionality of the challenged provisions is governed by the framework announced in city of renton playtime theatres,d,and refined in the plurality opinion of alameda books,d.as recounted by center for fair public policy maricopa county,cir,the renton inquiry proceeds in three steps first,the ordinance can not be a complete ban on the protected expression.id.at.second,the ordinance must be or,if with respect to sexual and pornographic speech,its predominate concern must be the secondary effects of such speech in the community.id.at.third,the regulation must pass intermediate scrutiny.it must serve a substantial government interest,be narrowly tailored to serve that interest,and allow for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.id.at.
with respect to this third step,the supreme court has adopted a specialized framework.when enacting a secondary effects ordinance,the municipality must rely on evidence that demonstrate s a connection between the speech regulated and the secondary effects that motivated the adoption of the ordinance.alameda books,at.plurality.any material that is reasonably believed to be relevant can be used.id.at.quoting renton,at.
to avoid summary judgment,the plaintiffs must then cast direct doubt on the municipality rationale,either by demonstrating that the municipality evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the municipality factual findings.id.at.such evidence must be actual and convincing.id.at.if successful,the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.id.
restriction 
fantasyland argues that the restriction should be invalidated under the california constitution based on people glaze,cal d,which struck down a similar restriction under a test that was stricter than what the first amendment requires.indeed,as noted above,fantasyland formally dropped its claim against this provision under the first amendment and limited its challenge to the california constitution.however,the california supreme court indicated in its response to our certified question that restrictions are reviewed under intermediate scrutiny as applied by the united states supreme court.see fantasyland video,county of san diego,cal,order denying request to decide a question of california law.that is the same standard identified in renton,and the response to our certified question,including its citations to los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,cal th,d,city of national city wiener,cal th,d,and people superior court lucero,cal d,suggests to us that the standard under the california constitution is the same in this situation as that applied by the united states supreme court in renton.under renton,fantasyland failed to supply sufficient evidence to cast direct doubt on the county asserted rationale.we conclude that the challenge under the california constitution fails for the same reason.
at the legislative stage,the county relied on studies and reports,reported court decisions,and anecdotal testimony to establish a correlation between adult establishments and negative secondary effects based on this evidence,the county could reasonably infer that restricting the hours of opera
