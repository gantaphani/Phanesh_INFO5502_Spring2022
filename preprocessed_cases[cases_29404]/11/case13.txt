the exclusive rights that a copyright owner has to distribute copies of a copyrighted work,are qualified by the application of several limitations set out in through,including the first sale doctrine,which provides that the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title is entitled,without the authority of the copyright owner,to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord,a.importing a copy made abroad without the copyright owner permission is an infringement of.see a.in quality king distributors,research int l,this court held that a reference to incorporates the through limitations,including first sale doctrine.however,the copy in quality king was initially manufactured in the united states and then sent abroad and sold.
respondent,john wiley sons,an academic textbook publisher,often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary wiley asia rights to publish,print,and sell foreign editions of wiley english language textbooks abroad.wiley asia books state that they are not to be taken without permission into the united states.when petitioner kirtsaeng moved from thailand to the united states to study mathematics,he asked friends and family to buy foreign edition textbooks in thai book shops,where they sold at low prices,and to mail them to him in the united states.he then sold the books,reimbursed his family and friends,and kept the profit.
wiley filed suit,claiming that kirtsaeng unauthorized importation and resale of its books was an infringement of wiley exclusive right to distribute and import prohibition.kirtsaeng replied that because his books were lawfully made and acquired legitimately,a first sale doctrine permitted importation and resale without wiley further permission.the district court held that kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine does not apply to goods manufactured abroad.the jury then found that kirtsaeng had willfully infringed wiley american copyrights and assessed damages.the second circuit affirmed,concluding that a lawfully made under this title language indicated that the first sale doctrine does not apply to copies of american copyrighted works manufactured abroad.
held the first sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.
a wiley reads lawfully made under this title to impose a geographical limitation that prevents a doctrine from applying to wiley asia books.kirtsaeng,however,reads the phrase as imposing the limitation made in accordance with or in compliance with the copyright act,which would permit the doctrine to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner permission.
b section a language,its context,and the first sale doctrine history favor kirtsaeng reading.
section a says nothing about geography.under can logically mean in accordance with.and a nongeographical interpretation provides each word in the phrase lawfully made under this title with a distinct purpose lawfully made suggests an effort to distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,and under this title sets forth the standard of lawful ness the copyright act.this simple reading promotes the traditional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes linguistic sense.
in contrast,the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic difficulties.wiley first reads under to mean in conformance with the copyright act where the copyright act is applicable.wiley then argues that the act is applicable only in the united states.however,neither under nor any other word in lawfully made under this title means where.nor can a geographical limitation be read into the word applicable.the fact that the act does not instantly protect an american copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking place abroad does not mean the act is inapplicable to copies made abroad.indeed,a makes pirated copies subject to the copyright act.and says that works subject to protection include unpublished works without regard to the author nationality or domicile,and works first published in any of the nearly nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the united states.
both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate that congress did not have geography in mind when writing the present version of a.a comparison of the language in a predecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion.the former version referred to those who are not owners of a copy,but mere possessors who lawfully obtained a copy,while the present version covers only owners of a lawfully made copy.this new language,including the five words at issue,makes clear that a lessee of a copy will not receive first sale protection but one who owns a copy will be protected,provided that the copy was lawfully made.a nongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions of the present statute.for example,the manufacturing clause,which limited importation of many copies printed outside the united states,was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies made in america and copies made abroad.but that equal treatment principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpretation that would grant an american copyright holder permanent control over the american distribution chain in respect to copies printed abroad but not those printed in america.finally,the court normally presumes that the words lawfully made under this title carry the same meaning when they appear in different but related sections,and it is unlikely that congress would have intended the consequences produced by a geographical interpretation.
a nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of statutory interpretation that when a statute covers an issue previously governed by the common law,it is presumed that congress intended to retain the substance of the common law.samantar yousuf.the first sale doctrine,which has an impeccable historic pedigree,makes no geographical distinctions.nor can such distinctions be found in straus,where this court first applied the first sale doctrine,or in a predecessor provision,which congress enacted a year later.
library associations,dealers,technology companies,retailers,and museums point to various ways in which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic constitutional copyright objectives,in particular promot ing the progress of science and useful arts,art.i,cl.for example,a geographical interpretation of the doctrine would likely require libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books in their collections that were printed overseas.wiley counters that such problems have not occurred in the years since a federal court first adopted a geographical interpretation.but the law has not been settled for so long in wiley favor.the second circuit in this case was the first court of appeals to adopt a purely geographical interpretation.reliance on the first sale doctrine is also deeply embedded in the practices of booksellers,libraries,museums,and retailers,who have long relied on its protection.and the fact that harm has proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders to assert geographically based resale rights.thus,the practical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious,extensive,and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant particularly in light of the importance of foreign trade to america.
c several additional arguments that wiley and the dissent make in support of a geographical interpretation are unpersuasive.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
section of the copyright act grants the owner of copyright under this title certain exclusive rights,including the right to distribute copies of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership.these rights are qualified,however,by the application of various limitations set forth in the next several sections of the act,through.those sections,typically entitled limitations on exclusive rights,include,for example,the principle of fair use permission for limited library archival reproduction,and the doctrine at issue here,the first sale doctrine.
section a sets forth the first sale doctrine as follows 
notwithstanding the provisions of section the section that grants the owner exclusive distribution rights,the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title is entitled,without the authority of the copyright owner,to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.emphasis added.
thus,even though forbids distribution of a copy of,say,the copyrighted novel herzog without the copyright owner permission,a adds that,once a copy of herzog has been lawfully sold or its ownership otherwise lawfully transferred,the buyer of that copy and subsequent owners are free to dispose of it as they wish.in copyright jargon,the first sale has exhausted the copyright owner exclusive distribution right.
what,however,if the copy of herzog was printed abroad and then initially sold with the copyright owner permission does the first sale doctrine still apply is the buyer,like the buyer of a domestically manufactured copy,free to bring the copy into the united states and dispose of it as he or she wishes 
to put the matter technically,an importation provision,a,says that 
i mportation into the united states,without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title,of copies of a work that have been acquired outside the united states is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies under section a,supp.v emphasis added.
thus a makes clear that importing a copy without permission violates the owner exclusive distribution right.but in doing so,a refers explicitly to the exclusive distribution right.as we have just said,is by its terms s ubject to the various doctrines and principles contained in through,including a first sale limitation.do those same modifications apply in particular,does the first sale modification apply when considering whether a prohibits importing a copy 
in quality king distributors,research int l,we held that a reference to exclusive distribution right incorporates the later subsections limitations,including,in particular,the first sale doctrine of.thus,it might seem that,a notwithstanding,one who buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into the united states and dispose of it,just as he could had he bought the copy in the united states.
but quality king considered an instance in which the copy,though purchased abroad,was initially manufactured in the united states and then sent abroad and sold.this case is like quality king but for one important fact.the copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.that fact is important because a says that the first sale doctrine applies to a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title.and we must decide here whether the five words,lawfully made under this title,make a critical legal difference.
putting section numbers to the side,we ask whether the first sale doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other lawful owner of a copy of a copyrighted work lawfully manufactured abroad.can that buyer bring that copy into the united states and sell it or give it away without obtaining permission to do so from the copyright owner can,for example,someone who purchases,say at a used bookstore,a book printed abroad subsequently resell it without the copyright owner permission 
in our view,the answers to these questions are,yes.we hold that the first sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.
respondent,john wiley sons,publishes academic textbooks.wiley obtains from its authors various foreign and domestic copyright assignments,licenses and permissions to the point that we can,for present purposes,refer to wiley as the relevant american copyright owner.see.wiley often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary,john wiley sons asia pte,rights to publish,print,and sell wiley english language textbooks abroad.app.to pet.for cert.each copy of a wiley asia foreign edition will likely contain language making clear that the copy is to be sold only in a particular country or geographical region outside the united states,at.
for example,a copy of wiley american edition says,copyright john wiley sons.all rights reserved.printed in the united states of america.walker,fundamentals of physics,vi ed.a copy of wiley asia asian edition of that book says 
copyright john wiley sons asia pte ltd.all rights reserved.this book is authorized for sale in europe,asia,africa,and the middle east only and may be not exported out of these territories.exportation from or importation of this book to another region without the publisher authorization is illegal and is a violation of the publisher rights.the publisher may take legal action to enforce its rights.printed in asia.walker,fundamentals of physics,vi ed.wiley int l student ed.
both the foreign and the american copies say 
no part of this publication may be reproduced,stored in a retrieval system,or transmitted in any form or by any means except as permitted under sections or of the united states copyright act.compare,ibid.int l ed,with walker,supra,at vi american ed.
the upshot is that there are two essentially equivalent versions of a wiley textbook,at,each version manufactured and sold with wiley permission an american version printed and sold in the united states,and a foreign version manufactured and sold abroad.and wiley makes certain that copies of the second version state that they are not to be taken without permission into the united states.ibid.
petitioner,supap kirtsaeng,a citizen of thailand,moved to the united states in to study mathematics at cornell university.ibid.he paid for his education with the help of a thai government scholarship which required him to teach in thailand for years on his return.brief for petitioner.kirtsaeng successfully completed his undergraduate courses at cornell,successfully completed a program in mathematics at the university of southern california,and then,as promised,returned to thailand to teach.ibid.while he was studying in the united states,kirtsaeng asked his friends and family in thailand to buy copies of foreign edition textbooks at thai book shops,where they sold at low prices,and mail them to him in the united states,at.kirtsaeng would then sell them,reimburse his family and friends,and keep the profit.app.to pet.for cert.
in wiley brought this federal lawsuit against kirtsaeng for copyright infringement,at.wiley claimed that kirtsaeng unauthorized importation of its books and his later resale of those books amounted to an infringement of wiley exclusive right to distribute as well as related import prohibition.ed,a,supp.v.see also ed.authorizing infringement action.app.kirtsaeng replied that the books he had acquired were lawfully made and that he had acquired them legitimately.record in sdny,doc.thus,in his view,a first sale doctrine permitted him to resell or otherwise dispose of the books without the copyright owner further permission,at.
the district court held that kirtsaeng could not assert the first sale defense because,in its view,that doctrine does not apply to goods even if made abroad with the copyright owner permission.app.to pet.for cert.the jury then found that kirtsaeng had willfully infringed wiley american copyrights by selling and importing without authorization copies of eight of wiley copyrighted titles.and it assessed statutory damages of per work,at.
on appeal,a split panel of the second circuit agreed with the district court,at.it pointed out that a first sale doctrine applies only to the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title.at emphasis added.and,in the majority view,this language means that the first sale doctrine does not apply to copies of american copyrighted works manufactured abroad,at.a dissenting judge thought that the words lawfully made under this title do not refer to a place of manufacture but rather focu s on whether a particular copy was manufactured lawfully under america copyright statute,and that the lawfulness of the manufacture of a particular copy should be judged by copyright law.at opinion of murtha.
we granted kirtsaeng petition for certiorari to consider this question in light of different views among the circuits.compare,at case below first sale doctrine does not apply to copies manufactured outside the united states,with omega costco wholesale,first sale doctrine applies to copies manufactured outside the united states only if an authorized first sale occurs within the united states,aff by an equally divided court,and sebastian int l,consumer contacts pty,limitation of the first sale doctrine to copies made within the united states does not fit comfortably within the scheme of the copyright act 
we must decide whether the words lawfully made under this title restrict the scope of a first sale doctrine geographically.the second circuit,the ninth circuit,wiley,and the solicitor general as amicus all read those words as imposing a form of geographical limitation.the second circuit held that they limit the first sale doctrine to particular copies made in territories in which the copyright act is law,which the circuit says are copies manufactured domestically,not outside of the united states.at emphasis added.wiley agrees that those five words limit the first sale doctrine to copies made in conformance with the united states copyright act where the copyright act is applicable,which wiley says means it does not apply to copies made outside the united states and at least not to foreign production of a copy for distribution exclusively abroad.brief for respondent.similarly,the solicitor general says that those five words limit the first sale doctrine applicability to copies made subject to and in compliance with the copyright act,which the solicitor general says are copies made in the united states.brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief for united states emphasis added.and the ninth circuit has held that those words limit the first sale doctrine applicability to copies lawfully made in the united states,and to copies lawfully made outside the united states but initially sold in the united states with the copyright owner permission.denbicare toys r us.
under any of these geographical interpretations,a first sale doctrine would not apply to the wiley asia books at issue here.and,despite an american copyright owner permission to make copies abroad,one who buys a copy of any such book or other copyrighted work whether at a retail store,over the internet,or at a library sale could not resell or otherwise dispose of that particular copy without further permission.
kirtsaeng,however,reads the words lawfully made under this title as imposing a limitation.he says that they mean made in accordance with or in compliance with the copyright act.brief for petitioner.in that case,a first sale doctrine would apply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture met the requirements of american copyright law.in particular,the doctrine would apply where,as here,copies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the copyright owner.see referring to the owner right to authorize.
in our view,a language,its context,and the history of the first sale doctrine,taken together,favor a interpretation.we also doubt that congress would have intended to create the practical harms with which a geographical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly,artistic,commercial,and consumer activities.see part,infra.we consequently conclude that kirtsaeng nongeographical reading is the better reading of the act.
the language of a read literally favors kirtsaeng nongeographical interpretation,namely,that lawfully made under this title means made in accordance with or in compliance with the copyright act.the language of a says nothing about geography.the word under can mean i n accordance with.oxford english dictionary ed.see also black law dictionary ed.according to and a nongeographical interpretation provides each word of the phrase with a distinct purpose.the first two words of the phrase,lawfully made,suggest an effort to distinguish those copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,and the last three words,under this title,set forth the standard of lawful ness.thus,the nongeographical reading is simple,it promotes a traditional copyright objective combatting piracy,and it makes linguistic sense.
the geographical interpretation,however,bristles with linguistic difficulties.it gives the word lawfully little,if any,linguistic work to do.how could a book be unlawfully made under this title it imports geography into a statutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.and it is far more complex than may at first appear.
to read the clause geographically,wiley,like the second circuit and the solicitor general,must first emphasize the word under.indeed,wiley reads under this title to mean in conformance with the copyright act where the copyright act is applicable.brief for respondent.wiley must then take a second step,arguing that the act is applicable only in the united states.ibid.and the solicitor general must do the same.see brief for united states a copy is lawfully made under this title if title governs the copy creation and the copy is made in compliance with title requirements see also post,at ginsburg,dissenting under describes something governed or regulated by another 
one difficulty is that neither under nor any other word in the phrase means where.see,oxford english dictionary,supra,at definition of under it might mean subject to,see post,at,but as this court has repeatedly acknowledged,the word evades a uniform,consistent meaning.see kucana holder,under is chameleon ardestani ins,under has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context 
a far more serious difficulty arises out of the uncertainty and complexity surrounding the second step effort to read the necessary geographical limitation into the word applicable or the equivalent.where,precisely,is the copyright act applicable the act does not instantly protect an american copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking place abroad.but that fact does not mean the act is inapplicable to copies made abroad.as a matter of ordinary english,one can say that a statute imposing,say,a tariff upon any rhododendron grown in nepal applies to all nepalese rhododendrons.and,similarly,one can say that the american copyright act is applicable to all pirated copies,including those printed overseas.indeed,the act itself makes clear that in the solicitor general language pirated copies are subject to the act.a,supp.v referring to importation of copies the making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright,or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been applicable brief for united states.see also post,at suggesting that made under may be read as subject to 
the appropriateness of this linguistic usage is underscored by the fact that of the act itself says that works subject to protection under this title include unpublished works without regard to the nationality or domicile of the author,and works first published in any one of the nearly nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the united states.a,b ed.emphasis added,supp.v defining treaty party copyright office,circular,international copyright relations of the united states.thus,ordinary english permits us to say that the act applies to an irish manuscript lying in its author dublin desk drawer as well as to an original recording of a ballet performance first made in japan and now on display in a kyoto art gallery.nimmer nimmer,copyright,hereinafter nimmer on copyright noting that the principle that copyright laws do not have any extraterritorial operation requires some qualification 
the ninth circuit geographical interpretation produces still greater linguistic difficulty.as we said,that circuit interprets the first sale doctrine to cover both copies manufactured in the united states and copies manufactured abroad but first sold in the united states with the american copyright owner permission.denbicare,at.see also brief for respondent suggesting that the clause at least excludes the foreign production of a copy for distribution exclusively abroad at the court need not decide whether the copyright owner would be able to restrict further distribution in the case of a downstream domestic purchaser of authorized imports brief for petitioner in costco wholesale omega,excepting imported copies made by unrelated foreign copyright holders emphasis deleted.
we can understand why the ninth circuit may have thought it necessary to add the second part of its definition.as we shall later describe,see part,infra,without some such qualification a copyright holder could prevent a buyer from domestically reselling or even giving away copies of a video game made in japan,a film made in germany,or a dress with a design copyright made in china,even if the copyright holder has granted permission for the foreign manufacture,importation,and an initial domestic sale of the copy.a publisher such as wiley would be free to print its books abroad,allow their importation and sale within the united states,but prohibit students from later selling their used texts at a campus bookstore.we see no way,however,to reconcile this interpretation with the language of the phrase,lawfully made under this title.as a matter of english,it would seem that those five words either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they do not.
in sum,we believe that geographical interpretations create more linguistic problems than they resolve.and considerations of simplicity and coherence tip the purely linguistic balance in kirtsaeng,nongeographical,favor.
both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate that congress,when writing the present version of a,did not have geography in mind.in respect to history,we compare a present language with the language of its immediate predecessor.that predecessor said 
n othing in this act shall be deemed to forbid,prevent,or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.copyright act of,stat.emphasis added.
see also copyright act of,stat.the predecessor says nothing about geography and wiley does not argue that it does.so we ask whether congress,in changing its language implicitly introduced a geographical limitation that previously was lacking.see also part,infra discussing codification of principle.
a comparison of language indicates that it did not.the predecessor says that the first sale doctrine protects the transfer of any copy the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.the present version says that the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.what does this change in language accomplish 
the language of the former version referred to those who are not owners of a copy,but mere possessors who lawfully obtained a copy.the present version covers only those who are owners of a lawfully made copy.whom does the change leave out who might have lawfully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned that copy one answer is owners of movie theaters,who during the and before often leased films from movie distributors or filmmakers.see donahue,american film distribution,describing and agreements note,the relationship between motion picture distribution and exhibition an analysis of the effects of bidding legislation.because the theater owners had lawfully obtained their copies,the earlier version could be read as allowing them to sell that copy,it might have given them first sale protection.because the theater owners were lessees,not owners,of their copies,the change in language makes clear that they like bailees and other lessees can not take advantage of the first sale doctrine.those who find legislative history useful will find confirmation in,house committee on the judiciary,copyright law revision,supplementary report of the register of copyrights on the general revision of the copyright law revision bill,pt,comm.print hereinafter copyright law revision w here a person has rented a print of a motion picture from the copyright owner,he would have no right to lend,rent,sell,or otherwise dispose of the print without first obtaining the copyright owner permission see also platt munk republic graphics,friendly,pointing out predecessor statute leasing problem.
this objective perfectly well explains the new language of the present version,including the five words here at issue.section a now makes clear that a lessee of a copy will not receive first sale protection but one who owns a copy will receive first sale protection,provided,of course,that the copy was lawfully made and not pirated.the new language also takes into account that a copy may be lawfully made under this title when the copy,say of a phonorecord,comes into its owner possession through use of a compulsory license,which this title provides for elsewhere,namely,in.again,for those who find legislative history useful,the relevant legislative report makes this clear,for example,any resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an infringement,but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section would not 
other provisions of the present statute also support a nongeographical interpretation.for one thing,the statute phases out the manufacturing clause,a clause that appeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation of many copies of copyrighted works printed outside the united states,stat.prior to july,the importation into or public distribution in the united states of copies of a work consisting preponderantly of nondramatic literary material is prohibited unless the portions consisting of such material have been manufactured in the united states or canada the phasing out of this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manufactured in america and copies manufactured abroad.see,at.
the equal treatment principle,however,is difficult to square with a geographical interpretation of the first sale clause that would grant the holder of an american copyright perhaps a foreign national,see supra,at permanent control over the american distribution chain sales,resales,gifts,and other distribution in respect to copies printed abroad but not in respect to copies printed in america.and it is particularly difficult to believe that congress would have sought this unequal treatment while saying nothing about it and while,in a related clause the manufacturing,seeking the opposite kind of policy goal.golan holder,slip,at congress has moved from a copyright regime that,prior to,entirely excluded foreign works from copyright protection to a regime that now ensure s that most works,whether foreign or domestic,would be governed by the same legal regime emphasis added.
finally,we normally presume that the words lawfully made under this title carry the same meaning when they appear in different but related sections.department of revenue of acf industries.but doing so here produces surprising consequences.consider 
section c says that,despite the copyright owner exclusive right to display a copyrighted work provided in,the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title may publicly display it without further authorization.to interpret these words geographically would mean that one who buys a copyrighted work of art,a poster,or even a bumper sticker,in canada,in europe,in asia,could not display it in america without the copyright owner further authorization.
section e specifically provides that the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted video arcade game lawfully made under this title may publicly perform or display that game in equipment without the authorization of the copyright owner.to interpret these words geographically means that an arcade owner could not without the authority of the copyright owner perform or display arcade games whether new or used originally made in japan.red park,taito.
section says that a teacher,without the copyright owner authorization,is allowed to perform or display a copyrighted work say,an audiovisual work in the course of teaching activities unless the teacher knowingly used a copy that was not lawfully made under this title.to interpret these words geographically would mean that the teacher could not without further authorization use a copy of a film during class if the copy was lawfully made in canada,mexico,europe,africa,or asia.
in its introductory sentence,provides the act basic exclusive rights to an owner of a copyright under this title.the last three words can not support a geographic interpretation.
wiley basically accepts the first three readings,but argues that congress intended the restrictive consequences.and it argues that context simply requires that the words of the fourth example receive a different interpretation.leaving the fourth example to the side,we shall explain in part,infra,why we find it unlikely that congress would have intended these,and other related consequences.
a relevant canon of statutory interpretation favors a nongeographical reading.w hen a statute covers an issue previously governed by the common law,we must presume that congress intended to retain the substance of the common law.samantar yousuf,slip,at.see also isbrandtsen johnson,statutes which invade the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of and familiar principles,except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident 
the first sale doctrine is a doctrine with an impeccable historic pedigree.in the early century lord coke explained the common law refusal to permit restraints on the alienation of chattels.referring to littleton,who wrote in the century,gray,two contributions to coke studies,chi,lord coke wrote 
if a man be possessed of a horse,or of any other chattell and give or sell his whole interest therein upon condition that the donee or vendee shall not alien ate the same,the condition is voi d,because his whole interest is out of him,so as he hath no possibilit y of a reverter,and it is against trade and traffi c,and bargaining and contracting betwee n man and man and it is within the reason of our author that it should ouster him of all power given to him.coke,institutes of the laws of england.
a law that permits a copyright holder to control the resale or other disposition of a chattel once sold is similarly against trade and traffi c,and bargaining and contracting.ibid.
with these last few words,coke emphasizes the importance of leaving buyers of goods free to compete with each other when reselling or otherwise disposing of those goods.american law too has generally thought that competition,including freedom to resell,can work to the advantage of the consumer.see,leegin creative leather products,psks,restraints with manifestly anticompetitive effects are per se illegal others are subject to the rule of reason internal quotation marks omitted areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,ed.t he principal objective of antitrust policy is to maximize consumer welfare by encouraging firms to behave competitively 
the first sale doctrine also frees courts from the administrative burden of trying to enforce restrictions upon,readily movable goods.and it avoids the selective enforcement inherent in any such effort.thus,it is not surprising that for at least a century the first sale doctrine has played an important role in american copyright law.see straus,copyright act of,stat.see also copyright law revision,further discussions and comments on preliminary draft for revised copyright law,pt,comm.print irwin karp of authors league of america expressing concern for the very basic concept of copyright law that,once you sold a copy legally,you ca restrict its resale 
the doctrine makes no geographical distinctions nor can we find any in where this court first applied the first sale doctrine or in a predecessor provision,which congress enacted a year later.see supra,at.rather,as the solicitor general acknowledges,a straightforward application of would not preclude the first sale defense from applying to authorized copies made overseas.brief for united states.and we can find no language,context,purpose,or history that would rebut a straightforward application of that doctrine here.
the dissent argues that another principle of statutory interpretation works against our reading,and points out that elsewhere in the statute congress used different words to express something like the reading we adopt.post,at quoting a prohibiting the importation of copies the making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright,or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been applicable emphasis deleted.hence,congress,the dissent believes,must have meant a different language to mean something different such as the dissent own geographical interpretation of a.we are not aware,however,of any canon of interpretation that forbids interpreting different words used in different parts of the same statute to mean roughly the same thing.regardless,were there such a canon,the dissent interpretation of a would also violate it.that is because congress elsewhere in the act included the words manufactured in the united states or canada,stat,which express just about the same geographical thought that the dissent reads into a very different language.
associations of libraries,dealers,technology companies,retailers,and museums point to various ways in which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic constitutional copyright objectives,in particular promot ing the progress of science and useful arts.art.i,cl.
the american library association tells us that library collections contain at least million books published abroad presumably,many were first published in one of the nearly nations and enjoy american copyright protection under,see supra,at that many others were first published in the united states but printed abroad because of lower costs and that a geographical interpretation will likely require the libraries to obtain permission or at least create significant uncertainty before circulating or otherwise distributing these books.brief for american library association et as amici curiae,at,discussing limitations of potential defenses,including the fair use and archival exceptions.see also library and book trade almanac bogart,ed.during a significant amount of book printing moved to foreign nations 
how,the american library association asks,are the libraries to obtain permission to distribute these millions of books how can they find,say,the copyright owner of a foreign book,perhaps written decades ago they may not know the copyright holder present address.brief for american library association many books lack indication of place of manufacture no practical way to learn where a book was printed and,even where addresses can be found,the costs of finding them,contacting owners,and negotiating may be high indeed.are the libraries to stop circulating or distributing or displaying the millions of books in their collections that were printed abroad 
dealers tell us that,from the time when benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson built commercial and personal libraries of foreign books,american readers have bought used books published and printed abroad.brief for powell books et as amici curiae citing stern,antiquarian bookselling in the united states.the dealers say that they have operat ed for centuries under the assumption that the first sale doctrine applies.brief for powell books.but under a geographical interpretation a contemporary tourist who buys,say,at shakespeare and in paris,a dozen copies of a foreign book for american friends might find that she had violated the copyright law.the dealers can not easily predict what the foreign copyright holder may think about a reader effort to sell a used copy of a novel.and they believe that a geographical interpretation will injure a large portion of the business.
technology companies tell us that automobiles,microwaves,calculators,mobile phones,tablets,and personal computers contain copyrightable software programs or packaging.brief for public knowledge et as amici curiae.see also brief for association of service and computer dealers international,et as amici curiae.many of these items are made abroad with the american copyright holder permission and then sold and imported with that permission to the united states.brief for retail litigation center,et as amici curiae.a geographical interpretation would prevent the resale of,say,a car,without the permission of the holder of each copyright on each piece of copyrighted automobile software.yet there is no reason to believe that foreign auto manufacturers regularly obtain this kind of permission from their software component suppliers,and wiley did not indicate to the contrary when asked.see tr.of oral arg.without that permission a foreign car owner could not sell his or her used car.
retailers tell us that over trillion worth of foreign goods were imported in.brief for retail litigation center.american retailers buy many of these goods after a first sale abroad,at.and,many of these items bear,carry,or contain copyrighted packaging,logos,labels,and product inserts and instructions for the use of everyday packaged goods from floor cleaners and health and beauty products to breakfast cereals.at.the retailers add that american sales of more traditional copyrighted works,such as books,recorded music,motion pictures,and magazines likely amount to over billion,at.see also,at electronic game industry is billion.a geographical interpretation would subject many,if not all,of them to the disruptive impact of the threat of infringement suits,at.
art museum directors ask us to consider their efforts to display works by,say,cy twombly,rené magritte,henri matisse,pablo picasso,and others.see supra,at describing how often makes such works subject to american copyright protection.a geographical interpretation,they say,would require the museums to obtain permission from the copyright owners before they could display the work,see supra,at even if the copyright owner has already sold or donated the work to a foreign museum.brief for association of art museum directors et as amici curiae.what are the museums to do,they ask,if the artist retained the copyright,if the artist can not be found,or if a group of heirs is arguing about who owns which copyright,at.
these examples,and others previously mentioned,help explain why lord coke considered the first sale doctrine necessary to protect trade and traffi c,and bargaining and contracting,and they help explain why american copyright law has long applied that doctrine.supra,at.
neither wiley nor any of its many amici deny that a geographical interpretation could bring about these horribles at least in principle.rather,wiley essentially says that the list is artificially invented.brief for respondent.it points out that a federal court first adopted a geographical interpretation more than years ago.cbs,scorpio music distributors,supp,ed,summarily aff,table.yet,it adds,these problems have not occurred.why not because,says wiley,the problems and threats are purely theoretical they are unlikely to reflect reality.see also post,at.
we are less sanguine.for one thing,the law has not been settled for long in wiley favor.the second circuit,in its decision below,is the first court of appeals to adopt a purely geographical interpretation.the third circuit has favored a nongeographical interpretation.sebastian int l.the ninth circuit has favored a modified geographical interpretation with a nongeographical but textually unsustainable corollary designed to diminish the problem.denbicare.see supra,at.and other courts have hesitated to adopt,and have cast doubt upon,the validity of the geographical interpretation.pearson,liu,supp.sdny franklin park,taito,wl,ed,rev on other grounds.
for another thing,reliance upon the first sale doctrine is deeply embedded in the practices of those,such as booksellers,libraries,museums,and retailers,who have long relied upon its protection.museums,for example,are not in the habit of asking their foreign counterparts to check with the heirs of copyright owners before sending,a picasso on tour.brief for association of art museum directors.that inertia means a dramatic change is likely necessary before these institutions,instructed by their counsel,would begin to engage in the complex process that a geographical interpretation would demand.and this court adoption of the geographical interpretation could provide that dramatic change.these intolerable consequences along with the absurd result that the copyright owner can exercise downstream control even when it authorized the import or first sale have understandably led the ninth circuit,the solicitor general as amicus,and the dissent to adopt textual readings of the statute that attempt to mitigate these harms.brief for united states post,at.but those readings are not defensible,for they require too many unprecedented jumps over linguistic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.see,post,at acknowledging that its reading of significantly curtails the independent effect of a 
finally,the fact that harm has proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so far to assert geographically based resale rights.they may decide differently if the law is clarified in their favor.regardless,a copyright law that can work in practice only if unenforced is not a sound copyright law.it is a law that would create uncertainty,would bring about selective enforcement,and,if widely unenforced,would breed disrespect for copyright law itself.
thus,we believe that the practical problems that petitioner and his amici have described are too serious,too extensive,and too likely to come about for us to dismiss them as insignificant particularly in light of the importance of foreign trade to america.see the world bank,imports of goods and services of gdp imports in of gross domestic product compared to in,online at http as visited,and available in clerk of court case file.the upshot is that consequences along with language,context,and interpretive canons argue strongly against a geographical interpretation of a.
wiley and the dissent make several additional important arguments in favor of the geographical interpretation.first,they say that our quality king decision strongly supports its geographical interpretation.in that case we asked whether the act importation provision,now a then a,barred importation without permission of a copyrighted item labels affixed to hair care products where an american copyright owner authorized the first sale and export of hair care products with copyrighted labels made in the united states,and where a buyer sought to import them back into the united states without the copyright owner permission,at.
we held that the importation provision did not prohibit sending the products back into the united states without the copyright owner permission.that section says 
importation into the united states,without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title,of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the united states is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or under section.a,supp.v emphasis added.see also a ed.
we pointed out that this section makes importation an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute under.we noted that a first sale doctrine limits the scope of the exclusive distribution right.we took as given the fact that the products at issue had at least once been sold.and we held that consequently,importation of the copyrighted labels does not violate a,at.
in reaching this conclusion we endorsed and its statement that the copyright laws were not intended to create a right which would permit the holder of the copyright to fasten,by notice in a book a restriction upon the subsequent alienation of the of copyright after the owner had parted with the title to one who had acquired full dominion over it.at.
we also explained why we rejected the claim that our interpretation would make a pointless.those advancing that claim had pointed out that the copyright act amendments retained a prior provision,prohibiting the importation of pirated copies.quality king,supra,at.thus,they said,a must prohibit the importation of lawfully made copies,for to allow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a first sale,as quality king holding would do,would leave a without much to prohibit.it would become superfluous,without any real work to do.
we do not believe that this argument is a strong one.under quality king interpretation,a would still forbid importing without permission,and subject to the exceptions in a copies lawfully made abroad,for example,where a foreign publisher operating as the licensee of an american publisher prints copies of a book overseas but,prior to any authorized sale,seeks to send them to the united states a foreign printer or other manufacturer if not the owner for purposes of a,before an authorized sale sought to send copyrighted goods to the united states a book publisher transports copies to a wholesaler and the wholesaler not yet the owner sends them to the united states,see copyright law revision,pt,at giving this example or a foreign film distributor,having leased films for distribution,or any other licensee,consignee,or bailee sought to send them to the united states.see,nimmer on copyright b a,at section a provides that the distribution right may be exercised solely with respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work,not to prevent or restrict the resale or other further transfer of possession of such copies these examples show that a retains significance.we concede it has less significance than the dissent believes appropriate,but the dissent also adopts a construction of that significantly curtails a effect,post,at,and so limits the scope of that provision to a similar,or even greater,degree.
in quality king we rejected the superfluous argument for similar reasons.but,when rejecting it,we said that,where an author gives exclusive american distribution rights to an american publisher and exclusive british distribution rights to a british publisher,presumably only those copies made by the publisher of the united states edition would be lawfully made under this title within the meaning of a.at emphasis added.wiley now argues that this phrase in the quality king opinion means that books published abroad under license must fall outside the words lawfully made under this title and that we have consequently already given those words the geographical interpretation that it favors.
we can not,however,give the quality king statement the legal weight for which wiley argues.the language lawfully made under this title was not at issue in quality king the point before us now was not then fully argued we did not canvas the considerations we have here set forth we there said nothing to suggest that the example assumes a first sale and we there hedged our statement with the word presumably.most importantly,the statement is pure dictum.it is dictum contained in a rebuttal to a counterargument.and it is unnecessary dictum even in that respect.is the court having once written dicta calling a tomato a vegetable bound to deny that it is a fruit forever after 
to the contrary,we have written that we are not necessarily bound by dicta should more complete argument demonstrate that the dicta is not correct.central.community college katz,w e are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at issue was not fully debated humphrey executor united states,rejecting,under stare decisis,dicta,which may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are not controlling and,given the bit part that our quality king statement played in our quality king decision,we believe the view of stare decisis set forth in these opinions applies to the matter now before us.
second,wiley and the dissent argue to those who consider legislative history that the act legislative history supports their interpretation.but the historical events to which it points took place more than a decade before the enactment of the act and,at best,are inconclusive.
during the,representatives of book,record,and film industries,meeting with the register of copyrights to discuss copyright revision,complained about the difficulty of dividing international markets.copyright law revision discussion and comments on report of the register of copyrights on the general revision of the copyright law,pt,comm.print english editions of particular books fin d their way into this country at works publi shed in a country where there is no copyright protection of any sort are put into the free stream of commerce and shipped to the united states ibid.similar concern in respect to films.
the of copyrights,abraham kaminstein,found these examples very troubl ing.ibid.and the copyright office released a draft provision that it said deals with the matter of the importation for distribution in the united states of foreign copies that were made under proper authority but that,if sold in the united states,would be sold in contravention of the rights of the copyright owner who holds the exclusive right to sell copies in the united states.pt,at.that draft version,without reference to,simply forbids unauthorized imports.it said 
importation into the united states of copies or records of a work for the purpose of distribution to the public shall,if such articles are imported without the authority of the owner of the exclusive right to distribute copies or records under this title,constitute an infringement of copyright actionable under section.preliminary draft for revised copyright law and discussions and comments,pt,comm.print.
in discussing the draft,some of those present expressed concern about its effect on the first sale doctrine.for example,irwin karp,representing the authors league of america asked,if a german jobber lawfully buys copies from a german publisher,are we not running into the problem of restricting his transfer of his lawfully obtained copies pt,at.the copyright office representative replied,this could vary from one situation to another,i guess.i should guess,for example,that if a book publisher transports,does not sell copies to a wholesaler,a nonowner,this is not yet the kind of transaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.ibid.emphasis added.
the office later withdrew the draft,replacing it with a draft,which,by explicitly referring to,was similar to the provision that became law,now a.the office noted in a report that,under the new draft,importation of a copy without permission would violate the exclusive rights of the copyright owner where the copyright owner had authorized the making of copies in a foreign country for distribution only in that country.pt,at.
still,that part of the report says nothing about the first sale doctrine,about a,or about the five words,lawfully made under this title.and neither the report nor its accompanying draft answers the question before us here.quality king,at without those five words,the import clause,via its reference to,imports the first sale doctrine.
but to ascertain the best reading of a,rather than dissecting the remarks of industry representatives concerning at congressional meetings held years before the statute was enacted,see post,at,we would give greater weight to the congressional report accompanying a,written a decade later when congress passed the new law.that report says 
section a restates and confirms the principle that,where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work,the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale,rental,or any other means.under this principle,which has been established by the court decisions and the present law,the copyright owner exclusive right of public distribution would have no effect upon anyone who owns a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title and who wishes to transfer it to someone else or to destroy it.
to come within the scope of section a,a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully made under this title,though not necessarily with the copyright owner authorization.for example,any resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an infringement but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section would not.at emphasis added.
this history reiterates the importance of the first sale doctrine.see,copyright law revision,revision bill with discussions and comments,pt,comm.print f ull ownership of a copy authorizes its owner to dispose of it freely it explains,as we have explained,the nongeographical purposes of the words lawfully made under this title.part,supra.and it says nothing about geography.nor,importantly,did a predecessor provision.see supra,at.this means that,contrary to the dissent suggestion,any lack of legislative history pertaining to the first sale doctrine only tends to bolster our position that congress revision did not intend to create a drastic geographical change in its revision to that provision.see post,at.we consequently believe that the legislative history,on balance,supports the nongeographical interpretation.
third,wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeographical interpretation will make it difficult,perhaps impossible,for publishers and other copyright holders to divide foreign and domestic markets.we concede that is so.a publisher may find it more difficult to charge different prices for the same book in different geographic markets.but we do not see how these facts help wiley,for we can find no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that publishers are especially entitled to such rights.
the constitution describes the nature of american copyright law by providing congress with the power to secur e to a uthors for limited t imes the exclusive r ight to their w ritings.art.i,cl.the founders,too,discussed the need to grant an author a limited right to exclude competition.compare letter from thomas jefferson to james madison july,in papers of thomas jefferson,boyd ed.arguing against any monopoly with letter from james madison to thomas jefferson,in,at,boyd ed.arguing for a limited monopoly to secure production.but the constitution language nowhere suggests that its limited exclusive right should include a right to divide markets or a concomitant right to charge different purchasers different prices for the same book,say to increase or to maximize gain.neither,to our knowledge,did any founder make any such suggestion.we have found no precedent suggesting a legal preference for interpretations of copyright statutes that would provide for market divisions.copyright law revision,pt,at statement of barbara ringer,copyright office division of territorial markets was primarily a matter of private contract 
to the contrary,congress enacted a copyright law that through the first sale doctrine limits copyright holders ability to divide domestic markets.and that limitation is consistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid market divisions.palmer brg of,per curiam a greements between competitors to allocate territories to minimize competition are illegal whether copyright owners should,or should not,have more than ordinary commercial power to divide international markets is a matter for congress to decide.we do no more here than try to determine what decision congress has taken.
fourth,the dissent and wiley contend that our decision launches united states copyright law into an unprecedented regime of international exhaustion.post,at brief for respondent.but they point to nothing indicative of congressional intent in.the dissent also claims that it is clear that the united states now opposes adopting such a regime,but the solicitor general as amicus has taken no such position in this case.in fact,when pressed at oral argument,the solicitor general stated that the consequences of wiley reading of the statute perpetual downstream control were worse than those of kirtsaeng reading restriction of market segmentation.tr.of oral arg.and the dissent reliance on the solicitor general position in quality king is undermined by his agreement in that case with our reading of a.brief for united states as amicus curiae in quality king,when congress wishes to make the location of manufacture relevant to copyright act protection,it does so expressly ibid.calling it distinctly unlikely that congress would have provided an incentive for overseas manufacturing.
moreover,the exhaustion regime the dissent apparently favors would provide that the sale in one country of a good does not exhaus t the owner right to control the distribution of that good elsewhere.post,at.but our holding in quality king that a is a defense in courts even when the first sale occurred abroad,at,has already significantly eroded such a principle.
for these reasons we conclude that the considerations supporting kirtsaeng nongeographical interpretation of the words lawfully made under this title are the more persuasive.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

supap kirtsaeng,dba,petitioner john wiley sons.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice kagan,with whom justice alito joins,concurring.
i concur fully in the court opinion.neither the text nor the history of a supports removing protection from every copy of a protected work manufactured abroad.see ante,at.i recognize,however,that the combination of today decision and quality king distributors,research int l,constricts the scope of a ban on unauthorized importation.i write to suggest that any problems associated with that limitation come not from our reading of a here,but from qual ity king holding that a limits a.
as the court explains,the doctrine has played an integral part in american copyright law for over a century.see ante,at straus.no codification of the doctrine prior to even arguably limited its application to copies made in the united states.see ante,at.and nothing in the text or history of a the copyright act of provision suggests that congress meant to enact the new,geographical restriction john wiley proposes,which at once would deprive american consumers of important rights and encourage copyright holders to manufacture abroad.see ante,at.
that said,john wiley is right that the court decision,when combined with quality king,substantially narrows a ban on unauthorized importation.quality king held that the importation ban does not reach any copies receiving protection under a.see,at.so notwithstanding a,an owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title can import that copy without the copyright owner permission.a.in now holding that copies lawfully made under this title include copies manufactured abroad,we unavoidably diminish a scope indeed,limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications.see ante,at.
but if congress views the shrinking of a as a problem,it should recognize quality king not our decision today as the culprit.here,after all,we merely construe a quality king is the decision holding that a limits a.had we come out the opposite way in that case,a would allow a copyright owner to restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the doctrine that result would enable the copyright owner to divide international markets in the way john wiley claims congress intended when enacting a.but it would do so without imposing downstream liability on those who purchase and resell in the united states copies that happen to have been manufactured abroad.in other words,that outcome would target unauthorized importers alone,and not the libraries,dealers,technology companies,retailers,and museums with whom the court today is rightly concerned.ante,at.assuming congress adopted a to permit market segmentation,i suspect that is how congress thought the provision would work not by removing protection from every copy manufactured abroad as john wiley urges us to do here,but by enabling the copyright holder to control imports even when the doctrine applies as quality king now prevents 
at bottom,john wiley together with the dissent asks us to misconstrue a in order to restore a to its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright holders to segment international markets.i think john wiley may have a point about what a was designed to do that gives me pause about quality king holding that the doctrine limits the importation ban scope.but the court today correctly declines the invitation to save a from quality king by destroying the protection that a gives to every owner of a copy manufactured abroad.that would swap one possible mistake for a much worse one,and make our reading of the statute only less reflective of congressional intent.if congress thinks copyright owners need greater power to restrict importation and thus divide markets,a ready solution is at hand not the one john wiley offers in this case,but the one the court rejected in quality king.
ginsburg,dissenting 
supap kirtsaeng,dba,petitioner john wiley sons.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice ginsburg,with whom justice kennedy joins,and with whom justice scalia joins except as to parts iii and,dissenting.
in the interpretation of statutes,the function of the courts is easily stated.it is to construe the language so as to give effect to the intent of congress.united states american trucking.instead of adhering to the legislature design,the court today adopts an interpretation of the copyright act at odds with congress aim to protect copyright owners against the unauthorized importation of,copies of their copyrighted works.the court bold departure from congress design is all the more stunning,for it places the united states at the vanguard of the movement for international exhaustion of copyrights a movement the united states has steadfastly resisted on the world stage.
to justify a holding that shrinks to insignificance copyright protection against the unauthorized importation of copies,the court identifies several practical problems.ante,at.the court parade of horribles,however,is largely imaginary.congress objective in enacting a importation prohibition can be honored without generating the absurd consequences hypothesized in the court opinion.i dissent from the court embrace of international exhaustion,and would affirm the sound judgment of the court of appeals.
because economic conditions and demand for particular goods vary across the globe,copyright owners have a financial incentive to charge different prices for copies of their works in different geographic regions.their ability to engage in such price discrimination,however,is undermined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies from regions and sell them in regions.the question in this case is whether the unauthorized importation of copies constitutes copyright infringement under law.
to answer this question,one must examine three provisions of title of the code,a,and a.section sets forth the exclusive rights of a copyright owner,including the right to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending.this distribution right is limited by a,which provides notwithstanding the provisions of section,the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title is entitled,without the authority of the copyright owner,to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.section a codifies the first sale doctrine,a doctrine articulated in straus,which held that a copyright owner could not control the price at which retailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work.the first sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner should not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over the distribution of copies of a copyrighted work.at some point ordinarily the time of the first commercial sale the copyright owner exclusive right under to control the distribution of a particular copy is exhausted,and from that point forward,the copy can be resold or otherwise redistributed without the copyright owner authorization.
section a,supp.v last,but most critical,of the three copyright provisions bearing on this case is an importation ban.it reads 
importation into the united states,without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title,of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the united states is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords under section,actionable under section.
in quality king distributors,research int l,the court held that a copyright owner right to control importation under a is a component of the distribution right set forth in and is therefore subject to a codification of the first sale doctrine.quality king thus held that the importation of copies made in the united states but sold abroad did not rank as copyright infringement under a,at.see also,at ginsburg,concurring quality king involve d a round trip journey,travel of the copies in question from the united states to places abroad,then back again important to the court holding,the copies at issue in quality king had been lawfully made under title a prerequisite for application of a,at,quoting a.section a,the court noted,would apply to copies that were lawfully made not under the united states copyright act,but instead,under the law of some other country.at.drawing on an example discussed during a public meeting on proposed revisions to the copyright laws the court stated 
if the author of a work gave the exclusive united states distribution rights enforceable under the act to the publisher of the united states edition and the exclusive british distribution rights to the publisher of the british edition,presumably only those copies made by the publisher of the united states edition would be lawfully made under this title within the meaning of a.the first sale doctrine would not provide the publisher of the british edition who decided to sell in the american market with a defense to an action under a or,for that matter,to an action under,if there was a distribution of the copies.at.
as the district court and the court of appeals concluded,see,app.to pet.for cert,application of the quality king analysis to the facts of this case would preclude any invocation of a.petitioner supap kirtsaeng imported and then sold at a profit over copies of copyrighted textbooks printed outside the united states by the asian subsidiary of respondent john wiley sons,wiley.app.see also ante,at opinion of the court.in the words the court used in quality king,these copies were lawfully made not under the united states copyright act,but instead,under the law of some other country.at.section a therefore does not apply,and kirtsaeng unauthorized importation constitutes copyright infringement under a.
the court does not deny that under the language i have quoted from quality king,wiley would prevail.ante,at.nevertheless,the court dismisses this language,to which all members of the quality king court subscribed,as dictum.ante,at.i agree that the discussion was dictum in the sense that it was not essential to the court judgment.see quality king,at ginsburg,concurring w e do not today resolve cases in which the allegedly infringing imports were manufactured abroad.but i disagree with the court conclusion that this dictum was ill considered.instead,for the reasons explained below,i would hold,consistently with quality king dictum,that a authorizes a copyright owner to bar the importation of a copy manufactured abroad for sale abroad.
the text of the copyright act demonstrates that congress intended to provide copyright owners with a potent remedy against the importation of copies of their copyrighted works.as the court recognizes,ante,at,this case turns on the meaning of the phrase lawfully made under this title in a.in my view,that phrase is most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a copy creation is governed by,and conducted in compliance with,title of the code.this reading is consistent with the court interpretation of similar language in other statutes.see florida of revenue piccadilly cafeterias,under in a,a bankruptcy code provision exempting certain asset transfers from stamp taxes,means pursuant to ardestani ins,the phrase under section in the equal access to justice act means subject to or governed by internal quotation marks omitted.it also accords with dictionary definitions of the word under.see,american heritage dictionary ed.under means,among other things,s ubject to the authority,rule,or control of 
section a,properly read,affords kirtsaeng no defense against wiley claim of copyright infringement.the copyright act,it has been observed time and again,does not apply extraterritorially.see united dictionary merriam,copyright statute requiring that copyright notices be placed in all copies of a work did not apply to copies published abroad because copyright laws have no force beyond the united states borders nimmer nimmer,copyright,hereinafter nimmer c opyright laws do not have any extraterritorial operation.patry,copyright,hereinafter patry copyright laws are rigorously territorial.the printing of wiley textbooks therefore was not governed by title.the textbooks thus were not lawfully made under title,the crucial precondition for application of a.and if a does not apply,there is no dispute that kirtsaeng conduct constituted copyright infringement under a.
the court point of departure is similar to mine.according to the court,the phrase lawfully made under this title means made in accordance with or in compliance with the copyright act.ante,at.but the court overlooks that,according to the very dictionaries it cites,ante,at,the word under commonly signals a relationship of subjection,where one thing is governed or regulated by another.see black law dictionary ed.under frequently means inferior or subordinate internal quotation marks omitted oxford english dictionary ed.under means,among other things,i n accordance with some regulative power or principle emphasis added.see also webster third new international dictionary under means,among other things,in a condition of subjection,regulation,or subordination and suffering restriction,restraint,or control by only by disregarding this established meaning of under can the court arrive at the conclusion that wiley textbooks were lawfully made under copyright law,even though that law did not govern their creation.it is anomalous,however,to speak of particular conduct as lawful under an inapplicable law.for example,one might say that driving on the right side of the road in england is lawful under law,but that would be so only because law has nothing to say about the subject.the governing law is english law,and english law demands that driving be done on the left side of the road 
the logical implication of the court definition of the word under is that any copy manufactured abroad even a piratical one made without the copyright owner authorization and in violation of the law of the country where it was created would fall within the scope of a.any such copy would have been made in accordance with or in compliance with the copyright act,in the sense that manufacturing the copy did not violate the act because the act does not apply extraterritorially.
the court rightly refuses to accept such an absurd conclusion.instead,it interprets a as applying only to copies whose making actually complied with title,or would have complied with title had title been applicable,had the copies been made in the united states.see ante,at a first sale doctrine would apply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture met the requirements of american copyright law.congress,however,used express language when it called for such a counterfactual inquiry in a and b.see a importation into the united states or exportation from the united states,without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title,of copies or phonorecords,the making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright,or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been applicable,is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords under section.emphasis added b in a case where the making of the copies or phonorecords would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been applicable,their importation is prohibited.emphasis added.had congress intended courts to engage in a similarly hypothetical inquiry under a,congress would presumably have included similar language in that section.see russello united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting united states wong kim bo,per curiam brackets in original 
not only does the court adopt an unnatural construction of the a phrase lawfully made under this title.concomitantly,the court reduces a to insignificance.as the court appears to acknowledge,see ante,at,the only independent effect a has under today decision is to prohibit unauthorized importations carried out by persons who merely have possession of,but do not own,the imported copies.see a a applies to any owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title emphasis added if this is enough to avoid rendering a entirely superfluous,ante,at,it hardly suffices to give the owner importation right the scope congress intended it to have.congress used broad language in a it did so to achieve a broad objective.had congress intended simply to provide a copyright remedy against larcenous lessees,licensees,consignees,and bailees of films and other goods,see ante,at,it likely would have used language tailored to that narrow purpose.see nimmer b c,at,it may be wondered whether potential causes of action against licensees and the like are more than theoretical.see also ante,at kagan,concurring the court decision limits a to a fairly esoteric set of applications 
the court decision also overwhelms a exceptions to a importation prohibition.goldstein,copyright a,ed.hereinafter goldstein those exceptions permit the importation of copies without the copyright owner authorization for certain governmental,personal,scholarly,educational,and religious purposes.a.copies imported under these exceptions will often be lawfully made gray market goods purchased through normal market channels abroad.goldstein a,at but if,as the court holds,such copies can in any event be imported by virtue of a,a work has already been done.for example,had congress conceived of a sweep as the court does,what earthly reason would there be to provide,as congress did in a c,that a library may import no more than five copies of a work for its lending or archival purposes 
the far more plausible reading of a and a,then,is that congress intended a to apply to copies made in the united states,not to copies manufactured and sold abroad.that reading of the first sale and importation provisions leaves a exceptions with real,meaningful work to do.see trw andrews,it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.internal quotation marks omitted.in the range of circumstances covered by the exceptions,a frees individuals and entities who purchase copies abroad from the requirement they would otherwise face under a of obtaining the copyright owner permission to import the copies into the united states 
the history of a reinforces the conclusion i draw from the text of the relevant provisions a does not apply to copies manufactured abroad.section a was enacted as part of the copyright act of,stat.that act was the product of a lengthy revision effort overseen by the copyright office.see mills music,snyder.in its initial report on recommended revisions,the copyright office noted that publishers had suggested that the import ban on piratical copies should be extended to bar the importation of foreign edition s in violation of agreements to divide international markets for copyrighted works.copyright law revision report of the register of copyrights on the general revision of the copyright law,judiciary comm.print hereinafter copyright law revision.see copyright act of,stat.the importation into the united states of any piratical copies of any work copyrighted in the united states is prohibited.the copyright office originally recommended against such an extension of the importation ban,reasoning that enforcement of territorial restrictions was best left to contract law.copyright law revision.
representatives argued strenuously against the position initially taken by the copyright office.at a panel discussion on the copyright office report,for example,horace manges of the american book publishers council stated 
when a book publisher enters into a contract with a british publisher to acquire exclusive rights for a particular book,he often finds that the english edition of that particular book finds its way into this country.now it all right to say,commence a lawsuit for breach of contract.but this is expensive,burdensome,and,for the most part,ineffective.copyright law revision part discussion and comments on report of the register of copyrights on the general revision of the copyright law,judiciary comm.print.
sidney diamond,representing london records,elaborated on manges statement.there are many situations,he explained,in which it is not necessarily a question of the inadequacy of a contract remedy in the sense that it may be difficult or not quick enough to solve the particular problem.at.very frequently,diamond stated,publishers run into a situation where copies of a work produced in a foreign country may be shipped to the united states without violating any contract of the copyright proprietor.ibid.to illustrate,diamond noted,if a british publisher sells a copy to an individual who in turn ship s it over to the united states,the individual conduct would not violate any contract between the british and the american publisher.ibid.in such a case,no possibility of any contract remedy would exist.ibid.the facts of kirtsaeng case fit diamond example,save that the copies at issue here were printed and initially sold in asia rather than great britain.
after considering comments on its report,the copyright office prepared a preliminary draft of provisions for a new copyright statute.copyright law revision part preliminary draft for revised copyright law and discussions and comments on the draft,v judiciary comm.print.section of the draft statute addressed the concerns raised by representatives.in particular,a provided 
importation into the united states of copies or records of a work for the purpose of distribution to the public shall,if such articles are imported without the authority of the owner of the exclusive right to distribute copies or records under this title,constitute an infringement of copyright actionable under section,the section providing for a private cause of action for copyright infringement.at.
in a panel discussion regarding the draft statute,abe goldman,the copyright office general counsel,left no doubt about the meaning of a.it represented,he explained,a shif t from the copyright office report,which had recommended against using copyright law to facilitate publishers efforts to segment international markets.copyright law revision part further discussions and comments on preliminary draft for revised copyright law,judiciary comm.print.section a,goldman stated,would allow copyright owners to bring infringement actions against importers of foreign copies that were made under proper authority.ibid.see also,at goldman agreed with a speaker comment that a enlarge d copyright law by extending import prohibitions to works legally produced in europe and other foreign countries 
the next step in the copyright revision process was the introduction in congress of a draft bill on july.see copyright law revision part revision bill with discussions and comments,iii judiciary comm.print.after another round of public comments,a revised bill was introduced on february.see copyright law revision part supplementary report of the register of copyrights on the general revision of the copyright law revision bill,v judiciary comm.print hereinafter copyright law revision part.in language closely resembling the statutory text later enacted by congress,a of the bill provided 
importation into the united states,without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title,of copies or phonorecords of a work for the purpose of distribution to the public is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords under section,actionable under section.at 
the court implies that the bill explici t refer ence to showed a marked departure from a of the copyright office prior draft.ante,at.the copyright office,however,did not see it that way.in its summary of the bill provisions,the copyright office observed that a of the bill,like a of the copyright office prior draft,see supra,at,permitted copyright owners to bring infringement actions against unauthorized importers in cases where the copyright owner had authorized the making of the imported copies in a foreign country for distribution only in that country.copyright law revision part,at.see also,at xxvi under a of the bill,a n unauthorized importer could be enjoined and sued for damages both where the copies or phonorecords he was importing were piratical that is,where their making would have constituted an infringement if the copyright law could have been applied,and where their making was lawful.
the current text of a was finally enacted into law in.see copyright act of,a,stat.the house and senate committee reports on the act demonstrate that congress understood,as did the copyright office,just what that text meant.both reports state 
section deals with two separate situations importation of piratical articles that is,copies or phonorecords made without any authorization of the copyright owner,and unauthorized importation of copies or phonorecords that were lawfully made.the general approach of section is to make unauthorized importation an act of infringement in both cases,but to permit the bureau of customs to prohibit importation only of piratical articles.emphasis added.see also,same.
in sum,the legislative history of the copyright act of is hardly inconclusive.ante,at.to the contrary,it confirms what the plain text of the act conveys congress intended a to provide copyright owners with a remedy against the unauthorized importation of copies of their works,even if those copies were made and sold abroad with the copyright owner authorization 
unlike the court holding,my position is consistent with the stance the united states has taken in negotiations.this case bears on the highly contentious trade issue of interterritorial exhaustion.the issue arises because intellectual property law is territorial in nature,see supra,at,which means that creators of intellectual property may hold a set of parallel intellectual property rights under the laws of different nations.chiappetta,the desirability of agreeing to disagree the wto,trips,international ipr exhaustion and a few other things.int l,hereinafter chiappetta.there is no international consensus on whether the sale in one country of a good incorporating protected intellectual property exhausts the intellectual property owner right to control the distribution of that good elsewhere.indeed,the members of the world trade organization,agreeing to disagree,provided in article of the agreement on aspects of intellectual property rights trips,that nothing in this agreement shall be used to address the issue of exhaustion.see chiappetta observing that exhaustion of intellectual property rights was hotly debated during the trips negotiations and that article reflects the negotiators ultimate inability to agree on a single international standard.similar language appears in other treaties to which the united states is a party.see world intellectual property organization wipo copyright treaty,treaty doc,nothing in this treaty shall affect the freedom of contracting parties to determine the conditions,if any,under which the exhaustion of the right to control distribution of copies of a copyrighted work applies after the first sale or other transfer of ownership of the original or a copy of the work with the authorization of the author.wipo performances and phonograms treaty,treaty doc,containing language nearly identical to article of the wipo copyright treaty.
in the absence of agreement at the international level,each country has been left to choose for itself the exhaustion framework it will follow.one option is a regime,under which a copyright owner right to control distribution of a particular copy is exhausted only within the country in which the copy is sold.see forsyth rothnie,parallel imports,in the interface between intellectual property rights and competition policy,anderman ed.hereinafter forsyth rothnie.another option is a rule of international exhaustion,under which the authorized distribution of a particular copy anywhere in the world exhausts the copyright owner distribution right everywhere with respect to that copy.see ibid.the european union has adopted the intermediate approach of regional exhaustion,under which the sale of a copy anywhere within the european economic area exhausts the copyright owner distribution right throughout that region.see,at.section a,in my view,ties the united states to a framework.the court decision,in contrast,places the united states solidly in the camp.
strong arguments have been made both in favor of,and in opposition to,international exhaustion.see chiappetta r easonable people making valid points can,and do,reach conflicting conclusions regarding the desirability of international exhaustion.international exhaustion subjects goods to competition from lower priced imports and,to that extent,benefits consumers.correspondingly,copyright owners profit from a regime,which also enlarges the monetary incentive to create new copyrightable works.see forsyth rothnie surveying arguments for and against international exhaustion.
weighing the competing policy concerns,our government reached the conclusion that widespread adoption of the framework would be inconsistent with the economic interests of the united states.see brief for united states as amicus curiae in quality king,hereinafter quality king brief accordingly,the united states has steadfastly taken the position in international trade negotiations that domestic copyright owners should have the right to prevent the unauthorized importation of copies of their work sold abroad.at.the united states has advanced this position in multilateral trade negotiations,including the negotiations on the trips agreement,at.see also gervais,the trips agreement drafting history and analysis,ed.it has also taken a dim view of our trading partners adoption of legislation incorporating elements of international exhaustion.see clapperton corones,locking in customers,locking out competitors laws in australia and their potential effect on competition in high technology markets,melbourne,united states expressed concern regarding legislation in australia montén,comment,the inconsistency between section and trips counterproductive with respect to the future of international protection of intellectual property rights marq.intellectual property,same with respect to new zealand and taiwan.
even if the text and history of the copyright act were ambiguous on the answer to the question this case presents which they are not,see parts,i would resist a holding out of accord with the firm position the united states has taken on exhaustion in international negotiations.quality king,i acknowledge,discounted the government concerns about potential inconsistency with united states obligations under certain bilateral trade agreements.see,at.see also quality king brief listing the agreements.that decision,however,dealt only with products made in the united states.see,at ginsburg,concurring.quality king left open the question whether owners of copyrights could retain control over the importation of copies manufactured and sold abroad a point the court obscures,see ante,at arguing that quality king significantly eroded the principle that,in my view,a embraces.the court today answers that question with a resounding no,and in doing so,it risks undermining the united states credibility on the world stage.while the government has urged our trading partners to refrain from adopting regimes that could benefit consumers within their borders but would impact adversely on producers in the united states,the court embraces an rule that could benefit consumers but would likely disadvantage foreign holders of copyrights.this dissonance scarcely enhances the united states role as a trusted partner in multilateral endeavors.vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer.
i turn now to the court justifications for a decision difficult to reconcile with the copyright act text and history.
the court asserts that its holding is consistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid market divisions.ante,at.see also ante,at again referring to antitrust principles.section a,however,read as i do and as the government does,simply facilitates copyright owners efforts to impose vertical restraints on distributors of copies of their works.see forsyth rothnie parallel importation restrictions enable manufacturers and distributors to erect vertical restraints in the market through exclusive distribution agreements.see generally leegin creative leather products,psks,discussing vertical restraints.we have held that vertical restraints are not per se illegal under of the sherman act,because such restraints can have procompetitive effects.at 
the court sees many horribles following from a holding that the a phrase lawfully made under this title does not encompass copies.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.if a excluded copies,the court fears,then copyright owners could exercise perpetual control over the downstream distribution or public display of such copies.a ruling in wiley favor,the court asserts,would shutter libraries,put dealers out of business,cripple art museums,and prevent the resale of a wide range of consumer goods,from cars to calculators.ante,at.see also ante,at kagan,concurring expressing concern about imposing downstream liability on those who purchase and resell in the united states copies that happen to have been manufactured abroad copyright law and precedent,however,erect barriers to the anticipated horribles 
recognizing that copies fall outside the ambit of a would not mean they are forever free of the first sale doctrine.as earlier observed,see supra,at,the court stated that doctrine initially in its decision.at that time,no statutory provision expressly codified the first sale doctrine.instead,copyright law merely provided that copyright owners had the sole liberty of printing,reprinting,publishing,completing,copying,executing,finishing,and vending their works.copyright act of,stat.
in,the court addressed the scope of the statutory right to ven d.in granting that right,the court held,congress did not intend to permit copyright owners to fasten a restriction upon the subsequent alienation of the of copyright after the owner had parted with the title to one who had acquired full dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for it.at.o ne who has sold a copyrighted article without restriction,the court explained,has parted with all right to control the sale of it.at.thus,t he purchaser of a book,once sold by authority of the owner of the copyright,may sell it again,although he could not publish a new edition of it.ibid.
under the logic of,the sale of a copy in the united states carried out with the copyright owner authorization would exhaust the copyright owner right to vend that copy.the copy could thenceforth be resold,lent out,or otherwise redistributed without further authorization from the copyright owner.although uses the word distribute rather than vend,there is no reason to think congress intended the word distribute to bear a meaning different from the construction the court gave to the word vend in.see ibid.emphasizing that the question before the court was purely one of statutory construction thus,in accord with,the first authorized distribution of a copy in the united states exhausts the copyright owner distribution right under.after such an authorized distribution,a library may lend,or a dealer may resell,the copy without seeking the copyright owner permission.ante,at.
for example,if wiley,rather than kirtsaeng,had imported into the united states and then sold the textbooks at issue in this case,wiley distribution right would have been exhausted under the rationale of.purchasers of the textbooks would thus be free to dispose of the books as they wished without first gaining a license from wiley.
this line of reasoning,it must be acknowledged,significantly curtails the independent effect of a.if,as i maintain,the term distribute in incorporates the first sale doctrine by virtue of,then a codification of that doctrine adds little to the regulatory regime section a,however,does serve as a statutory bulwark against courts deviating from in a way that increases copyright owners control over downstream distribution,and legislative history indicates that is precisely the role congress intended a to play.congress first codified the first sale doctrine in of the copyright act of,stat.it did so,the house committee report on the act explains,in order to make clear that congress had no intention of enlarg ing in any way the construction to be given to the word vend.according to the committee report,was not intended to change existing law in any way.ibid.the position i have stated and explained accords with this expression of congressional intent.in enacting and its successors,i would hold,congress did not change existing law,by stripping the word vend and thus its substitute distribute of the limiting construction imposed in.
in any event,the reading of the copyright act to which i subscribe honors congress aim in enacting a while the court reading of the act severely diminishes a role.see supra,at.my position in no way tugs against the principle underlying a,that certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the owner distribution right.the court,in contrast,fails to give meaningful effect to congress manifest intent in a to grant copyright owners the right to control the importation of copies of their works.
other statutory prescriptions provide further protection against the absurd consequences imagined by the court.for example,a c permits an organization operated for scholarly,educational,or religious purposes to import,without the copyright owner authorization,up to five copies of a work notably,a book for library lending or archival purposes.but ante,at suggesting that affirming the second circuit decision might prevent libraries from lending books 
the court also notes that amici representing art museums fear that a ruling in wiley favor would prevent museums from displaying works of art created abroad.ante,at citing brief for association of art museum directors et.these amici observe that a museum right to display works of art often depends on c.see brief for association of art museum directors et that provision addresses exhaustion of a copyright owner exclusive right under to publicly display the owner work.because c,like a,applies only to copies lawfully made under this title,amici contend that a ruling in wiley favor would prevent museums from invoking c with respect to works of art,at 
limiting c to works,however,does not bar art museums from lawfully displaying works made in other countries.museums can,of course,seek the copyright owner permission to display a work.furthermore,the sale of a work of art to a museum may carry with it an implied license to publicly display the work.see patry,at c ourts have noted the potential availability of an implied nonexclusive licens e when the circumstances demonstrate that the parties intended that the work would be used for a specific purpose.displaying a work of art as part of a museum exhibition might also qualify as a fair use under.bouchat baltimore ravens.partnership,display of copyrighted logo in exhibition constituted fair use 
the court worries about the resale of consumer goods contain ing copyrightable software programs or packaging.ante,at.for example,the court observes that a car might be programmed with diverse forms of software,the copyrights to which might be owned by individuals or entities other than the manufacturer of the car.ibid.must a car owner,the court asks,obtain permission from all of these various copyright owners before reselling her car ibid.although this question strays far from the one presented in this case and briefed by the parties,principles of fair use and implied license to the extent that express licenses do not exist would likely permit the car to be resold without the copyright owners authorization 
most telling in this regard,no court,it appears,has been called upon to answer any of the court horribles in an actual case.three decades have passed since a federal court first published an opinion reading a as applicable exclusively to copies made in the united states.see columbia broadcasting system,scorpio music distributors,supp,ed,summarily aff,table.yet kirtsaeng and his supporting amici cite not a single case in which the owner of a consumer good authorized for sale in the united states has been sued for copyright infringement after reselling the item or giving it away as a gift or to charity.the absence of such lawsuits is unsurprising.routinely suing one customers is hardly a best business practice manufacturers,moreover,may be hesitant to do business with software programmers taken to suing consumers.manufacturers may also insist that software programmers agree to contract terms barring such lawsuits.
the court provides a different explanation for the absence of the untoward consequences predicted in its opinion namely,that lower court decisions regarding the scope of a first sale prescription have not been uniform.ante,at.uncertainty generated by these conflicting decisions,the court notes,may have deterred some copyright owners from pressing infringement claims.ante,at.but if,as the court suggests,there are a multitude of copyright owners champing at the bit to bring lawsuits against libraries,art museums,and consumers in an effort to exercise perpetual control over the downstream distribution and public display of copies,might one not expect that at least a handful of such lawsuits would have been filed over the past years the absence of such suits indicates that the practical problems hypothesized by the court are greatly exaggerated.ante,at they surely do not warrant disregarding congress intent,expressed in a,to grant copyright owners the authority to bar the importation of copies of their works.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.
to recapitulate,the objective of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of congress.american trucking,at.here,two congressional aims are evident.first,in enacting a,congress intended to grant copyright owners permission to segment international markets by barring the importation of copies into the united states.second,as codification of the first sale doctrine underscores,congress did not want the exclusive distribution right conferred in to be boundless.instead of harmonizing these objectives,the court subordinates the first entirely to the second.it is unsurprising that none of the three major treatises on copyright law embrace the court construction of a.see nimmer b c,at to goldstein a,at patry.
rather than adopting the very rule the united states has consistently resisted in negotiations,i would adhere to the framework set by the copyright act text and history.under that regime,codified in a,kirtsaeng unauthorized importation of the textbooks involved in this case infringed wiley copyrights.i would therefore affirm the second circuit judgment.
although quality king concluded that the statute text foreclosed that outcome,see,at,the solicitor general offered a cogent argument to the contrary.he reasoned that a does not limit a because the former authorizes owners only to sell or dispose of copies not to import them the act provision and its importation ban thus regulate separate,spheres of conduct.see brief for united states as amicus curiae in quality king.that reading remains the government preferred way of construing the statute.see tr.of oral arg.w e think that we still would adhere to our view that section a should not be read as a limitation on section a see also ante,at post,at,ginsburg,dissenting.
indeed,allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective of the doctrine,reversing quality king would yield a far more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting john wiley argument here.that is because only the former approach turns on the intended market for copies the latter rests instead on their place of manufacture.to see the difference,imagine that john wiley prints all its textbooks in new york,but wants to distribute certain versions only in thailand.without quality king,john wiley could do so,produce books in new york,ship them to thailand,and prevent anyone from importing them back into the united states.but with quality king,that course is not open to john wiley even under its reading of a to prevent someone like kirtsaeng from the books and so to segment the thai market john wiley would have to move its printing facilities abroad.i can see no reason why congress would have conditioned a copyright owner power to divide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.
in,congress renumbered what was previously a as a.see prioritizing resources and organization for intellectual property act of proipa,b,stat.like the court,i refer to the provision by its current numbering.
although justice kagan concurrence suggests that quality king erred in holding that a limits a,ante,at,that recent,unanimous holding must be taken as a given.see john sand gravel united states,s tare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation has special force,for congress remains free to alter what we have done.quoting patterson mclean credit union.the court objective in this case should be to avoid unduly constrict ing the scope of a ban on unauthorized importation,ante,at opinion of kagan,while at the same time remaining faithful to quality king holding and to the text and history of other copyright act provisions.this aim is not difficult to achieve.see parts,infra.justice kagan and i appear to agree to this extent congress meant the ban on unauthorized importation to have real force.see ante,at acknowledging that wiley may have a point about what a was designed to do 
see quality king distributors,research int l,quoting copyright law revision part further discussions and comments on preliminary draft for revised copyright law,judiciary comm.print hereinafter copyright law revision part statement of harriet pilpel.
the court asserts that my position gives the word lawfully in a little,if any,linguistic work to do.ante,at.that is not so.my reading gives meaning to each word in the phrase lawfully made under this title.the word made signifies that the conduct at issue is the creation or manufacture of a copy.see webster third new international dictionary defining made as artificially produced by a manufacturing process the word lawfully indicates that for a to apply,the copy creation must have complied with some body of law.finally,the prepositional phrase under this title clarifies what that body of law is namely,the copyright prescriptions contained in title of the code.
attempting to show that my reading of a is susceptible to the same criticism,the court points to the manufacturing clause,which required copies of a work consisting preponderantly of nondramatic literary material in the english language to be manufactured in the united states or canada.copyright act of,a,stat.because congress expressly referred to manufacturing in this provision,the court contends,the phrase lawfully made under this title in a can not mean manufactured in the united states.ante,at.this argument is a non sequitur.i do not contend that the phrases lawfully made under this title and manufactured in the united states are interchangeable.to repeat,i read the phrase lawfully made under this title as referring to instances in which a copy creation is governed by,and conducted in compliance with,title of the code.see supra,at.not all copies manufactured in the united states will satisfy this standard.for example,piratical copies manufactured in the united states without the copyright owner authorization are not lawfully made under title.nor would the phrase lawfully manufactured in the united states be an exact substitute for lawfully made under this title.the making of a copy may be lawful under title yet still violate some other provision of law.consider,for example,a copy made with the copyright owner authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum wage.the copy would be lawfully made under title in the sense that its creation would not violate any provision of that title,but the copy manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the violation of the laws.
when a was originally enacted in,it played an additional role providing a private cause of action against importers of piratical goods.see quality king,at.in,however,congress amended to provide for such a cause of action in a,which prohibits the unauthorized i mportation into the united states of copies or phonorecords,the making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright,or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if title had been applicable.see proipa,b,stat.thus,under the court interpretation,the only conduct reached by a but not a is a nonowner unauthorized importation of a nonpiratical copy.
notably,the court ignores the history of a,which reveals that the primary purpose of the prescription was not to provide a remedy against rogue licensees,consignees,and bailees,against whom copyright owners could frequently assert claims even in the absence of a.instead,the primary purpose of a was to reach importers,enterprising actors like kirtsaeng,against whom copyright owners could not assert contract claims due to lack of privity.see part iii,infra.
section a provides 
this subsection,a does not apply to 
a importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the authority or for the use of the government of the united states or of any state or political subdivision of a state,but not including copies or phonorecords for use in schools,or copies of any audiovisual work imported for purposes other than archival use 
b importation or exportation,for the private use of the importer or exporter and not for distribution,by any person with respect to no more than one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time,or by any person arriving from outside the united states or departing from the united states with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part of such person personal baggage or 
c importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly,educational,or religious purposes and not for private gain,with respect to no more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival purposes,and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other work for its library lending or archival purposes,unless the importation of such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of systematic reproduction or distribution,engaged in by such organization in violation of the provisions of section g.
the term gray market good refers to a good that is imported outside the distribution channels that have been contractually negotiated by the intellectual property owner.forsyth rothnie,parallel imports,in the interface between intellectual property rights and competition policy anderman ed.such goods are also commonly called parallel imports.ibid.
the court asserts that its reading of a is bolstered by,which extends the copyright protection s of title to a wide variety of foreign works.see ante,at.the protection under this title afforded by,however,is merely protection against infringing conduct within the united states,the only place where title applies.see patry,copyright,to hereinafter patry.thus,my reading of the phrase under this title in a is consistent with congress use of that phrase in.furthermore,describes which works are entitled to copyright protection under law.but no one disputes that wiley copyrights in the works at issue in this case are valid.the only question is whether kirtsaeng importation of copies of those works infringed wiley copyrights.it is basic to copyright law that o wnership of a copyright is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied.see also copies are material objects,other than phonorecords,in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed,and from which the work can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.given the distinction copyright law draws between works and copies,is inapposite to the question here presented.patry,at there is no connection,linguistically or substantively,between section s and section deals with national eligibility for the intangible work of authorship section a deals with the tangible,physical embodiment of the work,the copy.
as the court observes,ante,at,irwin karp of the authors league of america stated at the panel discussion that a ran counter to the very basic concept of copyright law that,once you sold a copy legally,you ca restrict its resale.copyright law revision part,at.when asked if he was presenting an argument against a,however,karp responded that he was neutral on th e provision.at.there is thus little reason to believe that any changes to the wording of a before its codification in a were made in response to karp discussion of the problem of restricting the transfer of lawfully obtained foreign copies.ibid.
there is but one difference between this language from the bill and the corresponding language in the current version of a in the current version,the phrase for the purpose of distribution to the public is omitted and the phrase that have been acquired outside the united states appears in its stead.there are no material differences between the quoted language from the bill and the corresponding language contained in the bill.see copyright law revision part supplementary report of the register of copyrights on the general revision of the copyright law revision bill,judiciary comm.print.
the court purports to find support for its position in the house and senate committee reports on the copyright act.ante,at.it fails to come up with anything in the act legislative history,however,showing that congress understood the words lawfully made under this title in a to encompass copies.

the court states that my reliance on the solicitor general position in quality king is undermined by his agreement in that case with the reading of a that the court today adopts.ante,at.the united states principal concern in both quality king and this case,however,has been to protect copyright owners right to prevent parallel imports.brief for united states as amicus curiae in quality king,hereinafter quality king brief.see also brief for united states as amicus curiae arguing that kirtsaeng interpretation of a,which the court adopts,would subver t section a ban on unauthorized importation in quality king,the solicitor general urged this court to hold that a codification of the first sale doctrine does not limit the right to control importation set forth in a.quality king brief.after quality king rejected that contention,the united states reconsidered its position,and it now endorses the interpretation of the a phrase lawfully made under this title i would adopt.brief for united states as amicus curiae.

despite the court suggestion to the contrary,this case in no way implicates the per se antitrust prohibition against horizontal a greements between competitors to allocate territories to minimize competition.ante,at quoting palmer brg of,per curiam.wiley is not requesting authority to enter into collusive agreements with other textbook publishers that would,for example,make wiley the exclusive supplier of textbooks on particular subjects within particular geographic regions.instead,wiley asserts no more than the prerogative to impose vertical restraints on the distribution of its own textbooks.see hovenkamp,restraints and competitive harm the first sale doctrine in perspective,ann.survey am,vertical restraints include limits on the way a seller own product can be distributed 
as the court observes,ante,at,the united states stated at oral argument that the types of horribles predicted in the court opinion would,if they came to pass,be worse than the frustration of market segmentation that will result from the court interpretation of a.tr.of oral arg.the united states,however,recognized that this purported dilemma is a false one.as the united states explained,the court horribles can be avoided while still giving meaningful effect to a ban on unauthorized importation.ibid.
