commercial fishers in california are subject to a bevy of fees.for certain fees,however,are charged two to three times more than residents.plaintiffs represent a class of commercial fishers who contend that california discriminatory fees violate the privileges and immunities clause of the united states constitution.because california has failed to offer a closely related justification for its discrimination against,we agree with plaintiffs and therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff class.
background 
the named plaintiffs are commercial fishers residing outside california.they represent a class of who,since,have purchased commercial fishing licenses,registrations,or permits from california and paid higher fees than residents.plaintiffs sued charlton bonham,in his official capacity as the director of the california department of fish and game,alleging that the differential fees violate the privileges and immunities and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution.
plaintiffs challenge four specific fees general commercial fishing license fees,commercial fishing vessel registration fees,herring gill net permit fees,and dungeness crab vessel permit fees.see cal.fish game code.while the parties dispute the prevalence of herring gill and dungeness crab permits,it is undisputed that,at a minimum,commercial fishers must purchase the general license to fish in california waters and a vessel registration to do so from a boat they own or operate.see id.in,the relevant fees were as follows 
commercial fishing license for residents for 
commercial fishing vessel registration for residents for nonresidents 
herring gill net permit for residents for 
dungeness crab vessel permit for residents for.
all four licenses would set a resident back,but a.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court concluded that california had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact and granted summary judgment to the plaintiff class on its privileges and immunities clause claim.the district court then entered final judgment as to plaintiffs privileges and immunities clause claim pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure 
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.see pac.shore,llc city of newport beach,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state,we must decide whether there are any genuine disputes of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.see olsen idaho bd.of,cir.
discussion 
the privileges and immunities clause provides that t he citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.consti.art.iv,cl.this clause was designed to place the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states,so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned.of friedman,d quoting paul virginia,wall.see also toomer witsell.the clause was designed to insure to a citizen of state a who ventures into state b the same privileges which the citizens of state b enjoy.the clause thus establishes a norm of comity between residents and of a state,austin new hampshire,d,to create a national economic union,council of ins.agents brokers molasky arman,cir quoting.of piper,d 
the clause,however,is not an absolute.molasky arman,at quoting toomer,at.while it bars discrimination against citizens of other states where there is no substantial reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other states it does not preclude disparity of treatment in the many situations where there are perfectly valid independent reasons for it.id.quoting toomer,at.we therefore employ a test to determine whether disparate treatment violates the clause.first,the activity in question must be sufficiently basic to the livelihood of the nation as to fall within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.friedman,at quoting united constr.trades council mayor and council of camden,d.second,if the challenged restriction deprives nonresidents of a protected privilege,we will invalidate it only if we conclude that the restriction is not closely related to the advancement of a substantial state interest.id.at citing piper,u.at.california contends that the differential license fees pass muster under both parts of this test.we disagree.
california does not dispute that plaintiffs right to pursue a common calling is one of the most fundamental of those privileges protected by the clause.camden,at see also toomer,at thus we hold that commercial shrimping in the marginal sea,like other common callings,is within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.it instead argues that,in addition to demonstrating that the affected activity is protected,plaintiffs must make two additional showings.
first,california argues that our decision in international organization of masters,mates,pilots andrews,cir,requires plaintiffs to show that the differential fees exclude them,in whole or in part,from commercial fishing.this showing can not be made,california claims,because the percentage of commercial fishers in california has increased,not decreased.in andrews,we held that the clause was not violated by a statute regarding cost of living wage adjustments because the statute was designed to provide equity between the wages of citizen and non citizen workers.andrews,at.the statute in andrews thus created equality,not inequality,and therefore did not run afoul of the privileges and immunities clause because,we said,the appellants ha d not shown that they are prevented or discouraged by the state from pursuing employment.id.
california contends that our choice of the words prevented or discouraged upset decades of precedent and added an exclusion requirement to the first part of the test.we disagree.as we recited in andrews just two paragraphs before,the first step requires only that we determine first whether the statute burdens rights protected under the clause.id.at.an exclusion requirement would undermine the purpose of the clause because permitting a state to freely discriminate against up to the point they are driven out would not place the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states.lunding tax appeals tribunal,d quoting paul,wall.at.and,to any extent that andrews may have implied that a plaintiff must demonstrate exclusion from pursuing their common calling,the supreme court subsequent statement in friedman makes clear that n othing in its precedents supports the contention that the privileges and immunities clause does not reach a state discrimination against nonresidents when such discrimination does not result in their total exclusion from the state.at 
second,california argues that mcburney young,d,the supreme court most recent privileges and immunities clause decision,requires that plaintiffs show that the differential fees were enacted for a protectionist purpose.the supreme court in mcburney did note that prior cases struck laws down as violating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only when those laws were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening citizens.id.at.california urges us to read that statement to mean that proof of a protectionist purpose always is required to meet step one of our privileges and immunities inquiry.we can not accept that interpretation of mcburney.
when the court determines that the privileges and immunities clause does not apply at all,it says so.for example,in baldwin fish game commission,d,the court held that,because elk hunting was not basic to the maintenance or of the union,the state decision to charge more than residents for licenses simply did not fall within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.in mcburney,the court rejected one of mcburney arguments that virginia law denied them the right to access public information on equal terms with citizens of virginia for similar reasons,holding that the privileges and immunities clause did not cover this broad right.at.
by contrast,with respect to mcburney common calling argument,the court held that the virginia law at issue did not abridge ability to engage in a common calling in the sense prohibited by the privileges and immunities clause.id.at emphasis added.the court reached that conclusion because the statute had only an incidental effect on the pursuit of a common calling,and because the distinction it made between citizens and had a distinctly nonprotectionist aim.id.at.this reasoning,along with the court discussion of earlier cases involving statutes with protectionist purposes,is a part of step two of the inquiry,which requires the state to point to a substantial reason for the discrimination.friedman,at.part and parcel to this analysis is determining whether the state has demonstrated a substantial factor unrelated to economic protectionism to justify the discrimination.connecticut ex rel.blumenthal crotty,cir.
requiring proof of a legislature protectionist purpose at the first step of the inquiry,as california urges,would negate the second step burden on the state to provide a valid justification for the discrimination against.moreover,an intent requirement would undermine the clause purpose to plac e the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states,lunding,at quoting paul,wall.at,by mandating different outcomes depending upon a state motive.we therefore reject california invitation to read mcburney as a dramatic overhaul of the first step of the settled inquiry.
to reiterate,contrary to california arguments,the first step of the privileges and immunities clause inquiry asks only whether the challenged statute directly burdens a protected activity.it is undisputed that california commercial fishing license fees are significantly higher for fishers than for residents.and it is common sense that commercial fishing license fees directly affect commercial fishing.those facts alone satisfy plaintiffs burden at the first step of the inquiry.see toomer,at a statute that charged to residents for commercial shrimping licenses,but charged to plainly and frankly discriminate d against and thus satisfied the first step mullaney anderson.holding that the privileges and immunities clause would bar any state from imposing a license fee on resident fishers and a fee on unless a state offered a substantial,closely related justification at the second step of the inquiry.
at the second step,the burden shifts to the state to demonstrate that substantial reasons exist for the discrimination and that the degree of discrimination bears a close relation to such reasons.friedman,at to determine whether the state proffered justifications bear a close relation to the discrimination,we must consider whether,within the full panoply of legislative choices otherwise available to the state,there exist alternative means of furthering the state purpose without implicating constitutional concerns.id.
the supreme court has noted that t he state is not without power to charge a differential which would merely compensate the state for any conservation expenditures from taxes which only residents pay.toomer,at.california argues that it is doing just that merely compensating itself for expenditures on conservation and enforcement efforts from which benefit.but california claims that toomer allows for inequality at step two and therefore any fee differential is permissible so long as the state does not overcompensate itself in the aggregate,which,according to california,means only that the amount collected from nonresidents can not exceed their collective fair share of the state expenditures.these differential fees thus are permissible,according to california,because the total additional amount collected from approximately constitutes a mere of the budget shortfall between costs and revenues approximately million but comprise approximately of the commercial fishers in california.
we are unpersuaded.although we agree that obtaining compensation for expenditures the state makes for conservation or enforcement is a permissible state objective,the additional fees charged to must bear a close relation to the taxes which only residents pay.toomer,at see also molasky arman,at noting that a substantial reason for discrimination does not exist unless there is something to indicate that noncitizens constitute a peculiar source of the evil at which the statute is aimed quoting toomer,at.in other words,a state may justify a differential fee by showing either that it is closely related to the costs of addressing a burden uniquely impose or that it approximates the amount in taxes which only residents pay towards the relevant state expenditures from which also benefit.toomer,at see also tangier sound waterman ass pruitt,cir toomer permits state to discriminate against where state establishes an advancement of a substantial state interest as a reason for the disparate treatment,and,in the facts of this case,evenly or approximately evenly distributes the costs imposed on residents and nonresidents to support those programs benefiting both groups.such a differential would bear a close relation to the achievement of a substantial state objective,friedman,at,because it would address the particular evil present,unfairly benefiting from residents tax expenditures.it also would place upon the same footing with,id.at,or at least in substantial equality with california residents,toomer,at,by forcing an individual who benefits from the state expenditures to contribute an amount substantially equal to that which an individual resident contributes across all fees and related taxes.
california does not claim,however nor has it presented any evidence that shows that the fee differential approximates the amount in taxes a resident contributes to the state expenditures related to commercial fishing.mullaney,at see also hicklin orbeck,d t he discrimination the statute works against nonresidents does not bear a substantial relationship to the particular evil they are said to present.california alone bore the step two burden of showing that the discrimination is warranted by a substantial state objective and closely drawn to its achievement.friedman,at.it failed to carry that burden,despite ample opportunity to develop and support its offered justification and all the facts in its possession.mullaney,at.
conclusion 
for the above reasons,we hold that california differential commercial fishing license fees,cal.fish game code,and,violate the privileges and immunities clause.charging two to three times the amount charged to residents plainly burdens right to pursue a common calling,in this case commercial fishing.such discrimination violates the privileges and immunities clause unless the state carries its burden to show that such discrimination bears a close relation to the achievement of substantial state objectives.friedman,at.although its stated objective,compensation for state expenditures for conservation or enforcement,is valid,california has failed to show that the differential fee charged to a is closely related to a resident share of the state expenditures.
i respectfully dissent.although i agree fully with the majority analysis at step one of the inquiry,i would hold,at step two,that the differential fees survive summary judgment.further evidentiary development is necessary to determine whether the nonresident fees merely compensate the state for any added enforcement burden nonresidents may impose or for any conservation expenditures from taxes which only residents pay.toomer witsell.
we have little guidance to assist us in determining what the united states supreme court meant in the foregoing passage from toomer.only twice since toomer has the court quoted the phrase taxes which only residents pay in a privileges and immunities context,and in neither case did it explain the meaning of those words.baldwin fish game comm n,d mullaney anderson.as i explain in more detail below,two state supreme courts have reached different conclusions about the proper interpretation of that phrase.but we do not know which if either of those courts got it right,because the supreme court denied certio
