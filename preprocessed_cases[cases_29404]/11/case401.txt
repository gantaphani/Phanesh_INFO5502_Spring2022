opinion of the court 
this case arises out of the competing claims of wawel savings bank wawel and yale factors llc yale to the accounts receivable of debtor jersey tractor trailer training,jttt.wawel entered into a loan agreement with jttt and its president,william oliver,for the principal amount of.in the corresponding security agreement,jttt pledged all capital equipment and assets of the company as collateral,and wawel perfected its security interest by filing uniform commercial code financing statements s with the new jersey department of the treasury and the bergen county clerk office.approximately one year later,jttt entered into a factoring agreement with yale whereby jttt agreed to sell the rights to its accounts receivable in return for,inter alia,a percent payment of the amount due on the particular account receivable.yale subsequently filed a statement describing its lien on all present and accounts receivable of jttt.
on april,jttt filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code,see,et,and on june,wawel brought this action seeking declaratory relief that its lien on jttt accounts receivable had priority over yale lien that it was entitled to the proceeds of jttt accounts receivable that had been held in escrow following a state action filed by yale and that it was entitled to jttt outstanding accounts receivable until its lien was satisfied because the parties did not dispute that wawel had a first in time lien against jttt accounts thus a senior security central issue was whether yale could establish that it maintained a priority position as a matter of law.see a a except as otherwise provided c onflicting perfected security interests rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection.more specifically,unless yale could establish a that wawel consented to the sale of jttt accounts receivable free of its security interest,see a,or b that it was a holder in due course of jttt accounts receivable,see id.at a,or c that it was a purchaser of instruments,see id.at d,then wawel was entitled to the relief it sought.
following a bench trial,the bankruptcy court found in favor of wawel,stating that it was entitled to a judgment granting it all accounts receivable proceeds presently held in escrow,as well as the proceeds of all outstanding accounts receivable.app.at.the bankruptcy court found,as a matter of fact,that wawel did not authorize jttt factoring agreement with yale,and held that yale could not be considered a purchaser of instruments or a holder in due course because it did not establish that it acted in good faith by observing reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.yale conducted lien searches for jersey tractor trailer training,omitting from jttt full corporate name those searches,the bankruptcy court determined,were substandard.yale appealed to the district court pursuant to a,and the district court affirmed.
we will affirm in part because the bankruptcy court properly concluded that wawel had not authorized the sale of jttt accounts receivable free of its security interest.the bankruptcy court analysis of whether yale should be considered a purchaser of instruments or a holder in due course,however,is undermined by its legal conclusion that a lien search is commercially unreasonable if it does not include the debtor full corporate name.we will,therefore,vacate the judgment of the district court affirming the order of the bankruptcy court,and remand to the district court with the direction that the case be remanded to the bankruptcy court to determine whether yale qualifies as a holder in due course or as a purchaser of instruments.
background 
jttt is a new jersey corporation that specializes in training truck drivers to pass the uniform commercial driver license cdl exam.in january,jttt owner and president,william oliver,applied to wawel,seeking a loan in the amount of.jttt application was granted and,on march,jttt and wawel entered into a loan agreement.the corresponding security agreement pledged all of jttt assets,including its accounts receivable,as collateral for the loan the agreement further stated that i f this agreement includes accounts,i,oliver,will not settle any account for less than its full value without your written permission and i will collect all accounts until you tell me otherwise.app.at.
at the time,the jttt loan was the largest commercial loan made by wawel,and bank president robert ranzinger,was personally responsible for its administration.in an effort to keep an eye on jttt finances,ranzinger asked oliver to move jttt business bank accounts to wawel,and oliver agreed to do so.as ranzinger testified,the security agreement allowed jttt to sell its assets,including its accounts receivable,unless it was in default.it did not,however,allow jttt to sell its accounts receivable for less than their full value.
nevertheless,under oliver direction,jttt did just that.on march,oliver applied to enter into a factoring agreement with yale.before granting oliver application,harry perkal,yale president,engaged in a limited review of jttt finances perkal testified that he asked dun bradstreet to perform a lien search on jttt property,and that the search was conducted on jersey tractor trailer training,although perkal knew jttt full name to be jersey tractor trailer training,he also testified that dun bradstreet performed monthly lien searches thereafter.the earliest such search included in the record is dated may.that search,despite not including in the search term,revealed a terminated lien against jersey tractor trailer training,but did not reveal wawel outstanding lien.
yale and jttt entered into the factoring agreement on march.the agreement provided that,upon receiving commitments to pay from its clients,jttt would assign those commitments to yale in exchange for percent of their face value less an percent net percent jttt represented on each assignment that it was the sole owner of each account receivable free and clear of all liens,claims,security interests and encumbrances except in yale favor.dist.docket at.when yale received the payment from jttt clients,it would rebate the remaining percent to jttt 
at the outset of the factoring agreement,yale wired its payments into jttt bank account at the bank of new york,and oliver withdrew the money and transferred it to jttt account at wawel.oliver and perkal agreed,however,that the process took too long,and soon perkal sought to wire money directly to jttt account at wawel.because wawel was a savings and loan bank,it did not have access to the federal funds system and was not able to directly receive wire transfers.instead,wawel maintained an account at the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb to allow its customers access to wire transfers.beginning in november,yale purchased jttt accounts receivable by wiring money to wawel account at the fhlb 
by december,jttt business checking account had a negligible balance and the company had missed several loan payments.ranzinger met with oliver on december,to discuss the matter.it was at that time,according to ranzinger,that oliver first notified him of jttt factoring agreement with yale.ranzinger testified that any prior notice of factoring would have set off bells and whistles and red lights.app.at.oliver agreed,testifying that he purposefully concealed the factoring agreement from wawel because if they knew about it,i be in big trouble with the bank.id.at.following the meeting,oliver faxed the factoring agreement to ranzinger,who reviewed it and demanded a meeting with yale.that meeting,with perkal,ranzinger,oliver and jttt accountant in attendance,occurred on december.at the meeting,perkal and ranzinger discussed the details of the factoring agreement,including the amount jttt owed yale,which was approximately in overdue accounts receivable.ranzinger testified that he told perkal about the wawel loan,and about wawel security interest in jttt accounts receivable.within days after the meeting,ranzinger notified oliver that the factoring agreement was in violation of the wawel loan terms.in january,oliver sought to end the factoring agreement,informing yale that jttt would not renew the agreement when it expired on march.
in march,perkal reviewed the records of the earlier lien searches,and discovered that the search term omitted from jttt full corporate name.he then asked a yale employee to conduct a lien search using the full name and that search revealed wawel lien including the fact that it was filed one year before yale 
procedural history 
wawel filed this action against yale and jttt,and the bankruptcy court held a bench trial.the bankruptcy court rejected yale argument that wawel had consented to jttt sale of its accounts receivable,and instead found that ranzinger and the bank itself had no actual notice of the factoring agreement until the december,meeting between ranzinger and oliver.id.at because the bankruptcy court concluded that wawel did not have knowledge of jttt sale of its accounts receivable,it held that wawel could not have authorized the disposition of jttt accounts receivable free of its security interest.see a.
the bankruptcy court also concluded that yale could neither be considered a holder in due course nor a purchaser of instruments.see a article does not limit the rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument which take s priority over an earlier security interest,even if perfected id.d stating that a purchaser of an instrument has priority over a security interest in the instrument perfected by a method other than possession if the purchaser gives value and takes possession of the instrument in good faith and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.in this context,as the bankruptcy court recognized,the questions of whether yale is a holder in due course and whether it is purchaser of instruments overlap significantly.
the bankruptcy court first accepted,for purposes of its analysis,that the invoices associated with jttt accounts receivable qualified the accounts receivable as instruments.see b and a holder in due course means the holder of an instrument emphasis added id.at d purchaser of an instrument emphasis added because it is clear that yale bought the accounts receivable for value,the bankruptcy court focused on whether yale had purchased them in good faith.see a a person may only be considered a holder in due course where he has t aken the instrument for value,in good faith,and without notice of various defects or claims.id.at d a purchaser of an instrument is one who gives value and takes possession of the instrument in good faith and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.id.at a and a good faith means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.the bankruptcy court concluded,without discussion,that yale failed to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing when it conducted its series of ucc searches on the incorrect corporate name.app.at.additionally,it concluded that a search of jttt revealing no significant secured bank debt,at a time when the company faced liquidity issues necessitating the use of a factor,should have raised red flags,and yale acted in bad faith by ignoring those flags.id.
consequently,the bankruptcy court found that wawel was entitled to all accounts receivable proceeds presently held in escrow,as well as the proceeds of all outstanding accounts receivable.id.at.the district court affirmed 
ii.jurisdiction standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.in reviewing an appeal to a district court of a bankruptcy decision,we stand in the shoes of the district court and review the bankruptcy court decision.in re sterten,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.in re pransky,cir.
iii.discussion 
generally,c onflicting perfected security interests rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection.a.there are,however,of which yale argues apply here.first,a senior secured creditor may waive its security interest,see id.at a,and yale asserts that wawel did precisely that.alternatively,yale asserts that it should be considered a holder in due course,see id.at a,or a purchaser of instruments,see id.at d,and should therefore have priority over wawel senior security interest.we will address each assertion in turn 
consent to sale a 
yale argument that wawel waived its security interest in jttt accounts receivable relies on a,which states that a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale or other disposition thereof unless the secured party authorized the disposition free of the security interest emphasis added.the general rule,as the commentary notes,is that a security interest survives the disposition of the collateral,and yale must establish that jttt sale of its accounts receivable fits within the exception for authorized disposition free of the security interest.id.at cmt.the question we must answer is whether the bankruptcy court clearly erred in concluding that it did not do so 
yale argues,first,that because the security agreement accompanying wawel loan to jttt did not expressly prohibit the sale of collateral,wawel waived its security interest.that argument is without merit,especially given that in its agreement with wawel,jttt represented that it w ould not settle any account for less than its full value without your written permission,and that it would collect all accounts until told otherwise.app.at.jttt sale of its accounts receivable,therefore,ran afoul of the security agreement.
alternatively,yale argues that wawel,in its course of dealing,implicitly waived its security interest.that argument has two components first,that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that wawel lacked knowledge of the factoring agreement until december,and,second,that wawel approved of the agreement to the extent that it surrendered its security interest in jttt accounts receivable.we are receptive to yale position regarding knowledge.at least one of four officers at of whom,according to ranzinger testimony,had the authority to bind the notification via phone,facsimile,or mail of each of the wire transfers from yale factors nj llc to jttt.ncp litig.trust kpmg llc,the imputation doctrine is derived from common law rules of agency and p ursuant to those common law rules,a principal is deemed to know facts that are known to its agent.we assume,therefore,for purposes of our analysis and contrary to the bankruptcy court factual determination,that wawel was aware that jttt was involved with a thus was selling its accounts receivable.
even assuming that knowledge,however,there is a substantial difference between wawel knowing of the sale of jttt accounts receivable,and wawel authorizing the sale free of its security interest.see a.yale argues to the contrary,but relies exclusively on cases interpreting former,which was replaced by revised a in new jersey,effective july.see cmt.stating that subsection a derives from former section.the two sections differ in one material respect.former stated that a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale,exchange or other disposition thereof,unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party in the security agreement or otherwise emphasis added,while revised a states a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale,lease,license,exchange,or other disposition thereof unless the secured party authorized the disposition free of the security interest emphasis added 
consistent with revised a,we must determine whether there is any evidence to support yale contention that wawel impliedly authorized the sale of jttt accounts receivable free and clear of its security interest.in so doing,we keep in mind that the theory underlying a is that a security interest would be meaningless if the secured party could not reach the collateral in the hands of a third party when the debtor disposes of it without authorization.william hawkland,frederick miller neil cohen,hawkland series rev.because a does not require a secured party to take action to preserve its security interest,inaction alone may not
