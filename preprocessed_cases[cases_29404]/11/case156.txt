an automobile manufacturer upset one of its existing franchisees when it decided to open a new dealership near the existing franchise.the franchisee brought a diversity action,alleging that the manufacturer actions violated state law.following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for the manufacturer.the franchisee now appeals.we consider whether the district court erred in either its evidentiary admissions or factual findings and,discerning no error,affirm the court judgment.
gallo motor corporation gallo became a dealer for mazda motor of america,mazda in,when gallo acquired an existing mazda dealership on shrewsbury street in worcester,massachusetts.gallo management decided to purchase the franchise despite its awareness of other mazda dealers in the area.
like all new mazda franchisees,gallo was assigned a specific geographic area called a statistical observation area soa.mazda uses the soa to monitor its dealers performances.by comparing new vehicle registrations in each soa with benchmarks such as mazda national and regional market shares,mazda is able to determine whether sales in a particular soa are above or below average.gallo assigned soa encompassed all of worcester and neighboring shrewsbury,massachusetts.
at the time gallo purchased the franchise,mazda sales in the soa were below the national and regional averages.because mazda believed that the poor location of the shrewsbury street dealership in worcester was at least partially to blame for the substandard sales,it conditioned its approval of the gallo franchise on gallo agreement to relocate the dealership from shrewsbury street to gold star boulevard also in worcester.gallo agreed to an eventual relocation.
in,approximately three years after gallo began operating the shrewsbury street dealership but prior to its relocation,mazda commissioned market studies to evaluate more than of its metropolitan market areas throughout the country.these studies were part of a dealer revitalization program,which was designed both to eliminate dealers with poor performance records and to maximize the efficiencies of the remaining dealerships.
based on market data from through,the studies revealed that the greater worcester area,which encompasses gallo soa as well as the neighboring westborough soa,was not performing at an optimal level.at the time of the studies,this area contained three dealerships gallo,north end,and roy rioux.a report accompanying the studies cautioned that,while three dealerships were sufficient for the area,all three dealerships needed to achieve superior sales and service records if mazda was to achieve its expected market share in the greater worcester area.
in,the number of mazda dealerships in the greater worcester area decreased from three to two when roy rioux closed its doors.located on route in westborough,massachusetts,the former rioux dealership was approximately miles away from gallo shrewsbury street facility in worcester.unable to find an acceptable buyer for the rioux facility,mazda quickly began searching for a new dealership to service the westborough area.
after considering a number of factors,including the greater worcester area market study,mazda management determined that a new dealership on route would lead to greater market penetration in the westborough soa.accordingly,in late,mazda entered into an agreement with ford motor company to establish a joint dealership metrowest on route in shrewsbury,just over the westborough town line.meanwhile,in march,gallo relocated from shrewsbury street to gold star boulevard in worcester pursuant to its franchising agreement with mazda.
on august,three months after gallo move,mazda notified gallo by certified mail of its intention to establish a new dealership at the southwest corner of route and walnut street in westborough,massachusetts emphasis added.although the letter description provided an accurate street address,it incorrectly identified the new dealership site as westborough instead of shrewsbury.based on this defective letter,gallo management assumed that the new dealership was effectively replacing the former rioux dealership in westborough.accordingly,it neither objected nor inquired further.
with no pending protests,mazda and ford proceeded with their plans to establish the metrowest dealership.at completion,the million approximately miles away from gallo gold star boulevard dealership in entirely.
in march,just a few months prior to metrowest grand opening,gallo management discovered that the joint dealership was located in westborough.management immediately contacted mazda regional general manager to express concern.on june,gallo counsel sent mazda a letter complaining about both the establishment of the metrowest dealership and mazda failure to provide gallo with the notice required by massachusetts law.on july,mazda counsel responded with a corrected notice letter,which confirmed mazda intention to proceed with the metrowest dealership.
gallo thereafter filed a diversity action in federal district court,alleging violations of massachusetts dealer bill of rights.see.laws ch.b amended.specifically,gallo claimed that mazda metrowest decision was arbitrary and that mazda had failed to provide adequate notice of its decision.the pertinent text of the statute,as it existed at the time of trial,is reproduced below.
it is a violation for a manufacturer arbitrarily and without notice to existing franchisees to grant or enter into a franchise or selling agreement to or with an additional franchisee who intends or would be required by such franchise selling agreement to conduct its dealership operations from a place of business situated within the relevant market area of an existing franchisee 
any manufacturer which intends to grant or enter into an additional franchise or selling agreement,shall,at least sixty days prior to granting such franchise or entering into such agreement,give written notice of its intention to do so to each motor vehicle dealer with a franchise or selling agreement covering the same line make within a twenty mile radius of the location where the business of the proposed franchise will be located.such notice shall state the date on or after which such proposed franchise shall be granted or entered into.
in determining whether such proposed appointment is arbitrary,the court shall consider all pertinent circumstances.these may include but are not limited to a list of eight lengthy statutory factors 
laws ch.b,l amended.
during the bench trial,gallo sought to prove the arbitrariness of mazda decision by arguing,inter alia,the of the statutory factors.gallo also asserted that mazda decision was influenced more by ford participation in the metrowest particular,ford by any rational weighing of the pros and cons.
unconvinced,the district court entered judgment for mazda.see gallo motor ctr,d at.after considering all pertinent circumstances,see id.at quoting.laws ch.b,l amended,including several of the eight statutory factors,the court found that gallo has not sustained its burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that mazda establishment of the metrowest dealership is arbitrary t o the contrary,mazda new dealership promotes competition which,in turn,benefits the public interest.id.at.regarding gallo claim that mazda provided inadequate notice of its metrowest decision,the court found that although the notice given by mazda on august,was defective and inadequate,i ts subsequent letter of july,was effective statutory notice pursuant to chapter.id.at.
this appeal followed.
essentially,we are presented with two broad questions whether the district court improperly admitted and considered certain evidence and whether,as a result of improperly weighing the evidence,the district court erred in its factual findings.
given these separate questions,two standards of review apply first,we review a district court decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.see larch mansfield mun,cir see also united states davis,cir a trial court enjoys considerable discretion in connection with the admission or exclusion of evidence.second,we review findings of fact for c
