the principal question on appeal is whether exemption of the freedom of information act foia,b,permits the department of commerce to withhold from public disclosure information contained in export license applications.this determination requires the court to address the nature of the reference in foia exemption to statutes allowing documents to be withheld.under the export administration act,app,which from time to time has been enacted as temporary legislation,manufacturers of commodities that is,products that can be used for both military and civilian purposes must obtain a license from the department before they may export their products.the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control the wisconsin project requested access under foia to these export license applications.the department responded by providing aggregate data while declining,under exemption,to supply much of the requested specific export data.in light of the unique statutory framework created by congress to retain the confidentiality of export data,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the department.
the export administration act eaa authorizes the department of commerce to establish a regulatory scheme governing the export of items.app.the department accordingly promulgated the export administration regulations export regulations,which set forth exporters obligations and specify the types of products that are subject to the eaa requirements.section c of the eaa provides that information obtained for the purpose of consideration of,or concerning,license applications under this act shall be withheld from public disclosure unless the release of such information is determined by the secretary of commerce to be in the national interest.app.c.the department has incorporated this confidentiality provision into the export regulations.pt,supp.
congress originally enacted the export control system as part of the export control act of,c,stat,and subsequently replaced it with the export administration act of,c,stat.congress has enacted each version of the statute as a temporary measure,explaining that such important regulatory legislation should be periodically reviewed,at.from time to time,however,congress has amended the eaa to reinstate its provisions and on each occasion has included a sunset provision specifying the date on which the eaa will expire.app.the current version of the statute the eaa of has lapsed six times,for periods ranging from as short as five days to as long as six years.each time the eaa has expired,the president has promptly declared a national emergency and has extended the regulatory scheme by executive order.see,exec.order,wl,exec.order,wl exec.order,wl,exec.order,wl,exec.order,wl,exec.order,wl.
originally the president relied on a provision in the trading with the enemy act twea,app.b,for authorization to continue the export control system during lapses in the eaa.in,however,congress reformed the twea by enacting the international emergency economic powers act ieepa and provided that the president,upon declaration of a national emergency,may regulate prevent or prohibit importation or exportation of any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any person,or with respect to any property,subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.a.in enacting ieepa,congress reaffirmed the president regulatory control over exports by broadening the scope of the eaa to include regulation of extraterritorial exports,stat,codified as amended at app.ieepa legislative history,moreover,indicates that congress intended the president to use his authority under ieepa to continue the export administration regulations in effect should a lapse occur in the eaa,at.no conference report exists,and the senate report is silent on this point.
the eaa of expired by its terms in,and the president,pursuant to ieepa,again extended the export controls by executive order.the president declared that the eaa expiration posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states and constituted a national emergency.exec.order,wl,reprinted in.the president ordered that the eaa provisions be carried out under this order so as to continue in full force and effect id.
on july,during the period when the eaa had lapsed,the wisconsin project submitted a request under foia to the department for records of all license applications for commodities that the department of commerce approved,denied,suspended,or returned without action,for export to the people republic of china including hong kong,india,israel,pakistan,and russia,for the period beginning january,and extending to the present.the request stated that it included information showing the federal agencies to which each license application was referred for review,each agency recommendation on the application referred,the applicant,the case number,the date received,the final date,the user,the export control classification number,the value and the statement of end use.the department responded by letter dated august,turning over reports showing aggregate data for the specified countries while stating that the more detailed information was exempt from disclosure under foia exemption.
after exhausting its administrative remedies,the wisconsin project sued in the district court for release of the detailed export information.while the lawsuit was pending,congress reenacted the eaa,extending its expiration date from august,to august,stat.codified at app.before the district court ruled on the department motion for summary judgment,the august expiration date passed,and the president once more extended the eaa export controls by executive order.exec.order.the district court granted the department motion on september.citing statements by members of congress and the president,the district court concluded that congress amendment of the eaa in made clear that the eaa covered the time period when the wisconsin project request for records was pending before the department,and it ruled that the amended eaa did not constitute an unconstitutional retroactive application of a new statute to prior conduct.

exemption has evolved from its original text to require that congress,not the agencies of the executive branch,determine the need for nondisclosure.congress amended exemption in in response to the supreme court decision in administrator,faa robertson,d,which held that of the federal aviation act of faa,constituted an exemption withholding statute.the faa authorized the administrator to withhold information from public disclosure when,in the administrator judgment,a disclosure of such information is not required in the interest of the public.robertson,at.at.concerned that robertson afford ed the faa administrator cart e blanche to withhold any information he please d,congress overruled the decision and narrowed exemption by adding subsections a and b,pt,at,reprinted in.as this court has explained 
the amended text and its legislative history make clear that congress did not want the exemption to be triggered by every statute that in any way gives administrators discretion to withhold documents from the public.on the contrary,congress intended exemption from the foia to be a legislative determination and not an administrative one.

this court has previously considered the application of exemption to the eaa.in,in american jewish congress kreps,the court held that the disclosure provision of the eaa of did not specify the types of matters to be withheld with sufficient particularity.at.the court explained that congress,in amending exemption,clarified that statutes that merely set forth benchmarks for secrecy so general as the interest of the public such as the statute at issue in robertson do not satisfy subsection b particular criteria requirement.id.at.when,on the other hand,congress has made plain its concern with a specific effect of publicity exemption is to honor that concern.id.because the nondisclosure provision in the eaa of referred only to information obtained under the act,id.at,the court concluded that the statutory language was too broad to justify withholding information under exemption,id.at.the court,in light of the eaa lapse in,had no occasion to reach the thorny question whether material that,when submitted,was specifically exempted from disclosure by statute lost its exemption once the statute went into remission.id.footnote omitted.
following the court decision in american jewish congress,congress enacted the eaa of and amended the statute nondisclosure provision,c,stat,codified as amended at app.c.section c now specifies the particular types of matters to be withheld namely,information obtained for the purpose of consideration of,or concerning,license applications under this act app.c.thus,we have little difficulty concluding that section c qualifies as an exemption statute.times publ g united states dep t of commerce,cir lessner united states dep t of commerce,cir per curiam durnan united states dep t of commerce.as a result,the thorny question to be addressed here is whether the department may withhold export application data submitted during a period of lapse in the eaa,the mirror image of the thorny question in american jewish congress.
the wisconsin project contends that the department may not withhold the data,and the logic of its argument is simple exemption,by its text,requires that a withholding statute be in place because the eaa was not in effect either when the exporters submitted their application data to the department or when the wisconsin project requested that data from the department under foia,no statute exists to justify the department withholding of the requested data.the wisconsin project formalistic logic,however,misses the bigger picture.as the foregoing discussion of this circuit precedents indicates,the touchstone of the exemption inquiry is whether the statute is the product of congressional appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data and incorporates a formula whereby the administrator may determine precisely whether disclosure in any instance would pose the hazard that congress foresaw.am.jewish,at.
congress actions throughout the long history of the eaa evince a clear appreciation of the dangers inherent in exposing export application data to public view.since it was first enacted by congress,the eaa has always contained a confidentiality provision that permits the department to withhold export application data.see app.c eaa of,c,stat,export control act of,c,stat.in,as congress prepared to renew the eaa provisions,the department urged congress to grant a blanket exemption from the provisions of the freedom of information act with respect to all information submitted under the eaa,at,reprinted in.declining the invitation,the house international relations committee explained that a ny such information which is legitimately confidential is,in the opinion of the committee,adequately protected by the exemptions of the freedom information act and section c of the export administration act.id.congress reaffirmed this view two years later when,in enacting the eaa of,it replaced section c with an amended section c in order to protect the export data from disclosure under the court opinion in american jewish congress,c,stat,codified as amended at app.c.
the legislative history indicates that congress intended to preserve these confidentiality protections when it renewed the eaa in november.in commenting on the original house version of the bill,representative gilman noted that the department is currently defending against two separate lawsuits seeking public release of export licensing information,and he explained that the bill would make sure that the department can keep the information confidential cong.rec.daily ed.senator gramm,commenting on the final version of the legislation,stated that the statute will make clear that the department authority to apply the c confidentiality provision of the act is to be considered as covering any information regarding license applications obtained during that time period,as if there had been no interruption of authority.cong.rec.daily ed.the wisconsin project rightly notes that the legislative history is not entirely uniform on this point.representative gilman,for example,indicated that the bill final language left him uncertain whether the amendment would clearly protect all information submitted between and from disclosure.cong.rec.daily ed.but regardless of whether every member of congress agreed on the amendment effect,the members determined that the confidentiality provision is important to the functioning of the export control system otherwise they would not have included it as part of the renewed eaa.and that determination is the touchstone of this circuit exemption inquiry.irons sears,at.
the wisconsin project fails to acknowledge that the eaa is not the only statute that reflects congress determination regarding the confidentiality of export application information.congress enacted ieepa out of concern that export controls remain in place without interruption,and the accompanying report of the house international relations committee included the following statement 
the committee rejected administration recommendations that it make the export administration act permanent legislation,because it feels that such important regulatory legislation should be periodically reviewed should a lapse in the eaa occur,however,the authority of ieepa could be used to continue the export administration regulations in effect if,and to the extent that,the president declared a national emergency as a result of such lapse 
at.although the legislative history does not refer to the eaa confidentiality provision,it does evince congress intent to authorize the president to preserve the operation of the export regulations promulgated under the eaa.moreover,it is significant for purposes of determining legislative intent that congress acted with the knowledge that the eaa export regulations had long provided for confidentiality and that the president ongoing practice of extending the eaa by executive order h
