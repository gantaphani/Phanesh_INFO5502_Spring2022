this appeal stems from a disagreement between two different groups of plaintiffs about who has standing as a direct purchaser to bring a claim under federal antitrust laws.one group consists of delaware valley surgical supply company,dvss and niagara falls memorial medical center niagara.they are both entities that bought medical supplies directly from johnson johnson and its subsidiaries j j.the other plaintiff is bamberg county memorial hospital nursing center bamberg,a hospital that had a contract with j j setting a list price for the purchase of medical supplies,but that ultimately purchased its j j products through a separate contract with a distributor.
dvss,niagara,and bamberg all brought independent antitrust claims against j j.the district court consolidated the three cases.before reaching the merits of the underlying antitrust claims,the district court ruled that bamberg lacked standing to assert its claim against j j.the district court reasoned that because bamberg bought its supply through a distributor and not from j j,it was not a direct purchaser.bamberg and j j both contest that decision through this interlocutory appeal.we affirm the order of the district court,and hold that bamberg lacks standing to pursue an antitrust claim under a direct purchaser theory.
factual and procedural background 
three plaintiffs brought antitrust actions against j j arising from the manufacturer contracts with hospitals and their group purchasing organizations gpos.this litigation involves two categories of products sutures used to close wounds and endomechanical products endos used primarily for minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.the plaintiffs are bamberg,a hospital niagara,a hospital and dvss,a distributor of medical devices.
i.the underlying antitrust claims 
in december and january,bamberg,dvss,and niagara independently filed suit against j j,claiming they were direct purchasers of j j endomechanical products.their complaints allege that j j conduct is an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of of the sherman act,and an unlawful exclusive dealing in violation of of the clayton act.the plaintiffs further allege that j j monopolized or attempted to monopolize the relevant markets in violation of of the sherman act.
more specifically,the plaintiffs assert that j j impermissibly leveraged its monopoly power in sutures to create a monopoly in the endos market.they contest j j market share purchase requirements,under which j j enters into contractual arrangements that condition discounts and rebates on a buyer purchasing the bulk of its products from the company.this scheme,plaintiffs suggest,was coercive and resulted in artificially inflated prices.plaintiffs also object to the bundled discounts offered to hospitals that purchase both sutures and endos from j j.they allege that these bundled discounts are exclusionary because of j j dominance in the sutures market.
ii.bamberg contracts with j j and the distributor 
bamberg is a member of premier,a gpo which negotiated agreements with j j on bamberg behalf.those agreements set the pricing options for sutures and endo products.bamberg then executed its own contracts with j j pursuant to the terms of the premier agreements.those contracts noted that bamberg would order products either directly from j j or from an authorized distributor of j j products.bamberg chose the latter option and selected as its distributor owens minor o m.bamberg entered into a separate contract with o m,which specified the terms of purchase for j j products.accordingly,bamberg contract with j j did not result in the procurement of any goods directly from j bamberg did not pay j j directly for any goods,and j j did not ship any goods directly to bamberg.
the distributor,o m,is not owned or otherwise controlled by j o m distributorship agreement with j j specified that if products were sold to a j j contract customer,the distributor would pay the manufacturer the set price that was negotiated between j j and the gpo.in turn,bamberg contract with o m permitted the distributor to charge a markup percentage.accordingly,the final contract price paid by bamberg was equal to the price negotiated under the premier agreement with j j,plus o m markup.indisputably,bamberg paid o m directly for its orders,and o m delivered the products to bamberg.
iii.proceedings below 
after this contractual scheme was laid out before the district court,dvss moved for partial summary judgment.it argued that bamberg did not have standing to seek damages because it was not a direct purchaser of j j products,as required by illinois brick illinois,d.j j and bamberg moved for a determination that bamberg does have standing as a direct purchaser because the complaint challenges the legality of bamberg own contracts with j 
the district court entered an order denying the motions filed by j j and bamberg,and granting dvss motion for partial summary judgment.the court held that bamberg is not a direct purchaser from j j because it bought its products from an independent distributor,and therefore the hospital lacks standing to sue for antitrust damages.in the district court view,bamberg independent contract with j j did not change the fact that o m is the direct purchaser here.in re endosurgical products direct purchasher antitrust,no.this interlocutory appeal followed.

discussion 
i.the direct purchaser rule 
section of the clayton act broadly authorizes that any person who shall be injured by a violation of the antitrust laws may seek treble damages from the offending party.a.the supreme court has interpreted that section narrowly,thereby constraining the class of parties that have statutory standing to recover damages through antitrust suits.see illinois brick illinois,d hanover shoe,united shoe machinery,d.in particular,the supreme court has given considerable attention to the question of who may assert a claim when a middleman,for example a distributor or a wholesaler,sits between an end user and a manufacturer.
the first major case to consider the scope of was hanover shoe.there,hanover alleged that united had monopolized the shoe manufacturing industry in violation of of the sherman act.id.at.the plaintiff sought treble damages for overcharges paid in leasing certain machinery from united.id.at.united defended itself using a theory,arguing that hanover had passed on the overcharge to its customers and therefore had suffered no injury.id.at.the court rejected the defense for two reasons.first,it reasoned that establishing the amount of overcharge shifted to indirect purchasers would normally prove insurmountable.id.at.second,it concluded that a defense would reduce the overall effectiveness of antitrust actions by diminishing the recovery available to any potential plaintiff.id.at.accordingly,the court held that a party could not defend an antitrust suit brought by a middleman by showing that the actual injury caused by the overcharge was suffered by the end user.id.
in illinois brick,the supreme court extended the hanover principle to foreclose the offensive use of a theory.at.holding that indirect purchasers may not recover in an antitrust suit by proving that an overcharge was passed on to them through the distribution chain.there,the state of illinois sued concrete block manufacturers for conspiring to raise prices in violation of of the sherman act.id.at.the companies had sold blocks to contractors who acted as the middlemen before selling to the state.id.at.the court reasoned that the rule forbidding the use of a theory enunciated in hanover shoe should apply equally to plaintiffs and defendants.id.at.a llowing offensive but not defensive use of would create a serious risk of multiple liability for defendants.id.at.accordingly,the state was foreclosed from asserting a suit under of the clayton act because it did not buy concrete directly from the defendant manufacturers.id.at.
the supreme court further reasoned that the direct purchaser rule serves to eliminate the evidentiary complexities and uncertainties of apportioning overcharges between direct and indirect purchasers.id.at.a ntitrust laws will be more effectively enforced by concentrating the full recovery for the overcharge in the direct purchasers rather than by allowing every plaintiff potentially affected by the overcharge to sue id.at.the court explicitly rejected the state attempt to carve out exceptions to the hanover shoe rule for particular types of markets.id.at.in sum,a bright line rule emerged from illinois brick only direct purchasers have standing under of the clayton act to seek damages for antitrust violations.see id.at.
the supreme court reaffirmed the reasoning of illinois brick in kansas utilicorp united,d.there,the states of kansas and missouri,on behalf of individual energy consumers,initiated suits against a pipeline company and five gas production companies,alleging that the defendants conspired to inflate the price of gas.id.at.the court determined that the states lacked standing because the consumers they represented were indirect purchasers.id.at.in the distribution chain,they are not the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators.the consumers bought gas directly from the utilities,so any antitrust claim against the defendants is for the utilities to assert.id.
the court refused to create an exception to the illinois brick rule,even where its previous concerns about the difficulties of apportionment,the risk of multiple recovery,and the diminution of incentives for private antitrust enforcement would not apply with equal force.id.at.the court rejected the states argument that the rule should not apply because it would be relatively easy to apportion the overcharge among the purchasers.id.at.in order to avoid extensive litigation in antitrust suits to establish standing,the court specifically noted its desire for a brightline rule.id.at.the difficulties posed by issues of apportionment led us to adopt the direct purchaser rule,and we must decline to create an exception that would require their litigation.the court noted that the illinois brick rule often den ies relief to consumers who have paid inflated prices because of their status as indirect purchasers,id.at,yet refused to broaden the scope of relief in order to maintain stability in the law,id.at.the court concluded 
the rationales underlying hanover shoe and illinois brick will not apply with equal force in all cases.we nonetheless believe that ample justification exists for our stated decision not to carve out exceptions to the direct purchaser rule for particular types of markets.the possibility of allowing an exception,even in rather meritorious circumstances,would undermine the rule.
in sum,even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying the illinois brick rule might be disproved in a specific case,we think it an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of exceptions.having stated the rule in hanover shoe,and adhered to it in illinois brick,we stand by our interpretation of.

in royal printing,cir,this circuit applied the direct purchaser rule.a printing company and other small businesses brought suit against ten manufacturers of paper products.id.at.the plaintiffs had never bought paper products directly from any of the defendants,but instead purchased through wholesaling firms.id.this court permitted the suit to proceed insofar as plaintiffs could demonstrate that the wholesaler was a subsidiary of a defendant.id.at.however,those plaintiffs who bought through independent wholesalers that were not owned or controlled by any defendant were only indirect purchasers.id.at.therefore,the illinois brick rule barred them from sustaining a suit under of the clayton act.id.
we recently reaffirmed the direct purchaser rule in kendall visa,cir.there,merchants brought an antitrust action against both credit card companies and banks,alleging that the defendants conspired to set fees on credit card purchases.id.at.we found that,because the fee at issue was set by the credit card companies and not by the banks,the banks were the middlemen.id.at.as a result,plaintiffs could not maintain an antitrust suit against the credit card companies as direct purchasers because they ran squarely into the illinois brick wall.id.at.the plaintiffs could not get around the direct purchaser rule because they failed to allege any facts showing that the banks were either controlled by or in a conspiracy with the credit card companies.id.at.
ii.bamberg is not a direct purchaser 
precedent controls the outcome 
quite simply,we are bound by the sensible and straightforward rule set forth by illinois brick.appellants argue this situation is distinguishable because bamberg and j j did have an independent contractual relationship.however,supreme court jurisprudence has been neither vague nor ambiguous in establishing the direct purchaser rule.the supreme court intended to make a bright line rule for identifying the proper plaintiff when an antitrust violation occurs in a distribution system.see illinois brick,at.the court has explicitly rejected attempts to create exceptions to that rule,even when the considerations in a particular market may undermine some of the reasoning used by the illinois brick court.see utilicorp,at.the undisputed truth is that bamberg only indirectly purchased goods from j 
under the direct purchaser rule,bamberg lacks standing under of the clayton act to assert an antitrust violation against j j.it is undisputed that o m,as the distributor,was the immediate purchaser of sutures and endo products from j o m paid j j directly for its inventory and took title in the products before selling them to bamberg.bamberg directly paid o m,not j j,for its orders.o m is not an agent or subsidiary of j j,but rather an independently owned and managed company.following the clear rule set forth in illinois brick,bamberg lacks standing because the hospital is not a direct purchaser of products from j although the price that bamberg pays o m is set,in part,by an agreement negotiated by a gpo on behalf of bamberg,the hospital contracted separately with o m for the actual sale and delivery of products.the final price paid by bamberg included the list price negotiated by premier,plus a markup fee charged by o 
the presence of a contractual relationship between bamberg and j j does not change the fact that bamberg also had a contract with o m,and it was that contract that ultimately effectuated the transfer of these goods.furthermore,the plaintiffs are not merely seeking to invalidate an individual contract between a gpo and j j rather they are attacking the pricing scheme employed by j j in its negotiations with a wide range of health care providers.appellants contention that we should myopically focus on the contract between bamberg and j j,without taking into consideration where the hospital actually bought its products,is therefore unavailing.
b.we decline to adopt appellants reformulation of the direct purchaser rule 
appellants do not contend that bamberg qualifies for any exception to the direct purchaser rule rather,they urge this court to adopt a new rule that they believe is better attuned to the business relationships between health care providers and manufacturers.they contend that this case presents a common arrangement whereby a gpo negotiates prices with manufacturers on behalf of hospitals,but then individual hospitals place orders through independent distributors.appellants assert that the hospital,not the distributor,is the direct victim of the alleged antitrust violation.under their reasoning,the hospital is therefore the proper plaintiff to enforc
