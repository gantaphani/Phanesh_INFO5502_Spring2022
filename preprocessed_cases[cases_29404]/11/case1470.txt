transportation intelligence,appeals from an order of the federal communications commission denying the company application for review of a decision to authorize a competitor to market a radio transmitter.finding that the commission order was neither arbitrary nor capricious,we affirm.
both transportation intelligence transintel and highway information systems highway manufacture and sell highway advisory radio systems,which use am radio transmitters to broadcast traffic,emergency,and other information to drivers transintel is a competitor,as well as a customer,of highway each company has developed and markets its own radio transmitter,while transintel also resells some of highway devices.transintel principals,joanne and john alpiser,were employed by highway until they left to start transintel in.joanne alpiser father,virgil duncan,was also employed by highway until he left the firm in.
the communications act of grants the federal communications commission fcc authority to promulgate reasonable regulations,consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity,to govern the interference potential of devices which in their operation are capable of emitting radio frequency energy in sufficient degree to cause harmful interference to radio communications.a.acting pursuant to that authority,the fcc generally prohibits the sale of radio frequency devices absent fcc authorization,which for the type of transmitter at issue in this case requires the seller to obtain certification.see a,see generally id.et.a party seeking certification must submit a written application to the commission,complete with detailed descriptions and measurements,showing compliance with the pertinent fcc technical requirements.id.b see id.the commission will grant a certificate only if it determines that the equipment is capable of complying with those requirements and that the grant would serve the public interest,convenience and necessity.id.a see id.
once the fcc grants an application,any modification in the design,circuitry or construction of the equipment requires a new application for certification.id.a.there is an exception,however,for certain minor modifications classified as permissive.id.b.if the fcc finds that a manufacturer has failed to abide by these rules,it may revoke the device certification or assess a forfeiture penalty.see id.a.
on may,transintel filed a complaint with the commission,alleging,among other things,that highway had made substantial modifications to a am transmitter that the fcc had originally authorized in,without seeking a new equipment certification.transintel stated that it discovered those modifications when purchasers of that highway transmitter,which transintel had resold,complained that the device caused interference with radio transmissions in rockland county,new york.transintel asked the fcc to revoke highway certification,require a recall,impose a fine,and conduct a hearing on highway character and fitness to hold an fcc equipment certification.
highway responded to transintel complaint by submitting an application for a new certification of the modified transmitter,which highway had also altered to address the interference.highway stated that it regarded the modifications it had made in its authorized device as permissive,but was applying for a new certification because it could not locate the original test data.on june,the fcc office of engineering and technology oet granted highway application.
on july,transintel filed a petition for reconsideration with oet.it asked that highway certification be rescinded or that a hearing be held on the matter in light of what it described as highway willful violations of fcc regulations.in a letter dated november,addressing both transintel complaint and its petition for reconsideration,oet denied the petition,refused to revoke highway new certification,and deferred a decision on whether highway alleged earlier infractions warranted a forfeiture penalty.oet stated that,because highway modified device had now been properly certified and the interference concerns resolved,revocation of the certification was inappropriate.
on december,transintel applied for review by the commission of oet decision on its petition for reconsideration.transintel again requested that the fcc revoke highway certification or hold a hearing to determine whether highway had the qualifications for an equipment certification.after considering the parties written submissions,the commission denied transintel application for review and refused to revoke the certification or designate the matter for a hearing.see highway info,hereinafter fcc order.
in denying transintel application for review,the commission rejected highway argument that the modifications it had made to its transmitter were permissive changes that did not require a new equipment authorization.nonetheless,the fcc affirmed oet grant of certification.although the modifications were not permissive as defined by fcc rules,the commission determined that they were relatively innocuous,that the resulting modified transmitter readily passed the certification process,and that the device was now properly certified.id.at.it also explained that the interference of which transintel complained was not the result of a rule violation or the lack of appropriate recertification.the commission noted that although it might have pursued the imposition of a fine as an enforcement matter,the statute of limitations for such a sanction had already passed.id.citing a see c.but revocation of the equipment authorization sought by transintel is not an appropriate remedy or sanction in this case,the commission said,noting that it had stated before that violation of section of our rules generally does not form the basis for a denial of an equipment authorization.id.citing toshiba,rad.reg d p f.
the fcc did not exclude the possibility that perpetration of a fraud on the commission could form the basis of such a denial.id.it concluded,however,that transintel has not raised a substantial and material question of fact as to whether highway actions were so willful or deliberate as to rise to the level of implicating highway fitness to hold a fcc equipment authorization.id.nonetheless,the commission noted that it might call in further samples of the highway device to ensure that it continues to comply,and warned that a ny new instance of by highway could result in sanctions including fines and forfeitures and,if continuous or repeated,could call into question highway fitness to hold an equipment authorization.id.
as we have recounted,the commission order denied transintel application for review of oet denial oftransintel petition for reconsideration,including transintel request for revocation of the certification granted to highway by oet.transintel now appeals from the fcc order.before we may address the merits of that appeal,we must consider threshold questions concerning our jurisdiction and standard of review.
the denial of a petition for reconsideration by the commission is generally nonreviewable,unless the request for reconsideration was based on new evidence or changed circumstances.schoenbohm fcc,quoting icc brotherhood of locomotive eng rs,d see entravision holdings,llc fcc.the fcc does not contend that transintel appeal is unreviewable on this ground,however,and rightly so.in this case,the fcc did not deny a petition for reconsideration of its own prior decision,but rather that of a staff office.moreover,although transintel characterized its filing with oet as a petition for reconsideration of oet decision to grant highway application for a new certification,it was in fact the first opportunity that the fcc rules afforded transintel to make any filing at all regarding that application,and hence the first opportunity oet had to rule on transintel opposition to the application.see providing that only p ersons aggrieved by virtue of an equipment authorization action may file a petition for reconsideration or an application for review emphasis added.accordingly,both the oet decision of which transintel sought review before the commission,and the fcc decision of which transintel seeks review in this court,were dispositions of transintel first filings at each level of the agency.the principle that agency denials of reconsideration are generally nonreviewable is therefore inapplicable to this case.
the commission does advance another ground,however,for concluding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review its order.the fcc argues that the order was nothing more than a determination not to take enforcement action,a category of decision that like a denial of reconsideration is presumptively committed to agency discretion and hence unreviewable.heckler chaney,d quoting a see id.at.but it is not accurate to characterize the fcc decision here as a refusal to take enforcement action.nor is it correct to describe transintel petition for reconsideration or subsequent application for review as a request to take such action.
it may well be fair to describe as an enforcement request transintel initial complaint to the commission,which asked that highway be fined and its certification revoked for,among other things,selling its modified transmitter without a new certification.but the fcc refusal to sanction highway for that violation is not the subject of this appeal indeed,transintel concedes that that refusal is unreviewable.see reply br.at.after transintel filed its complaint,however,highway responded by submitting an application for a new certification of the modified device,which oet then granted.and it is that grant of highway application an affirmative act of approval,not merely a refusal to take action that transintel challenges here.see heckler,at.stating that affirmative acts of approval,in contrast to refusals to take action,are judicially reviewable.
it is true,as the fcc contends,that transintel opposition to highway application took the form of a request to revoke highway newly granted certification.but as we have just described,that was simply a function of the agency rules.in contrast to the rules governing broadcast license applications the rules concerning equipment certification applications provide no mechanism for an opponent to contest an application before it is granted.hence,a petition for reconsideration was transintel only option and revocation its only remedy.see see also toshiba,rad.reg d at t he commission rules do not contemplate petitions to deny equipment authorization applications the only prescribed procedure for challenging an equipment authorization is by a petition for reconsideration or application for review.nor does the fact that revocation is transintel requested remedy in this court put its appeal in a materially different posture from that routinely presented when a party appeals from the fcc denial of a challenge to an application for a broadcast license in such cases,the fcc normally has already granted the license,see,citizens for jazz on wrvr,fcc,and vacatur is a logical remedy,see,weyburn broad.fcc.
furthermore,in contrast to the circumstances that face a court trying to review a failure to take enforcement action,here the fcc grant of highway application provides a focus for judicial review,inasmuch as the agency did exercise its power,and t he action can be reviewed to determine whether the agency exceeded its statutory authority.heckler,at.nor is this a case in which the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.id.at.the communications act grants the fcc authority to promulgate reasonable regulations,consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity,to govern the manufacture and sale of radio transmitting devices.a.under that authority,the commission has promulgated providing that it will grant an application for certification only if it finds that the equipment is capable of complying with pertinent technical standards,and that a grant of the application would serve the public interest,convenience and necessity.a see id.there is no question that this public interest standard constitutes a broad grant of discretion to the fcc.but there is also no question that this is the same standard that governs the fcc actions in a multitude of areas and against which this court routinely judges the commission actions to determine whether they are arbitrary or capricious 
having concluded that we have jurisdiction to review the fcc decision,we now turn to the remaining threshold issue,our standard of review.all parties agree as do we that this court must review the merits of the fcc order under the traditional arbitrary or capricious standard applied to commission decisions.under that standard,we will uphold the fcc order as long as it was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.global crossing,fcc,quoting a see g.
transintel,however,contends that a stricter or at least more structured standard must apply to the fcc refusal to hold a hearing regarding highway application for certification.in support,it cites cases like astroline communications fcc,which set forth a test that the fcc must use to determine whether to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding a broadcast license application.first,the protesting party must submit a petition containing specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.id.at quoting d.the fcc must examine the petition on the basis of the petitioner allegations alone,proceeding on the assumption that the specific facts set forth in the petition are true.id.quoting citizens for jazz,at.second,if the fcc determines that the petition satisfies this requirement,it must then determine whether,on the basis of the application,the pleadings filed,or other matters which it may officially notice,a substantial and material question of fact is presented.id.quoting d.if the fcc finds that such a question is presented,the commission shall proceed to an evidentiary hearing.d emphasis added see id.e.
but astroline makes clear that this structured,process is required by the statute that governs hearings concerning broadcast license applications indeed,the double quotation marks and citations in the above paragraph demonstrate that the astroline analysis is drawn directly from d and e.there is,however,no such statutory provision for hearings concerning equipment certification applications.rather,the communications act simply grants the fcc authority to promulgate regulations to govern the manufacture and sale of such devices.see.
pursuant to this grant of authority,the commission has promulgated the following regulation whenever it is determined that an application for equipment authorization presents substantial factual questions relating to the qualifications of the applicant or the equipment,the commission may designate the application for hearing.emphasis added as is apparent on its face,the regulation does not contain the language that led the astroline court to conclude that the agency must follow a test in deciding whether to designate a hearing for a broadcast license equally important,the regulation states only that,when there is a substantial factual question,the commission may designate an equipment certification application for hearing as compared to e,which states that it shall do so when there is such a question concerning a broadcast license application.and the fcc reasonably argues that may denotes discretion rather than obligation on the part of the commission.appalachian power epa,stating that when a statute uses the permissive may rather than the mandatory shall,this choice of language suggests that congress intends to confer some discretion on the agency internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore conclude that the standard of review appropriate for the fcc refusal to designate highway application for a hearing is the same as that applicable to the merits of the agency decision we may overturn those determinations only if they were arbitrary or capricious.
the commission denied transintel application for review,without designating an evidentiary hearing,concluding that the company had not raised a substanti
