plaintiff brought suit against an airline alleging a common law breach of contract under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the district court held that plaintiff claim was preempted by the airline deregulation act ada,b,and dismissed the claim pursuant to.b.we conclude that the ada does not preempt this common law contract claim,and reverse the district court.
when congress passed the ada,it dismantled a federal regulatory structure that had existed since.by including a preemption clause,congress intended to ensure that the states would not undo the deregulation with regulation of their own.congress manifest purpose was to make the airline industry more efficient by unleashing the market forces of competition it was not to immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims.congress did not intend to convert airlines into agencies,complete with sovereign immunity.
the purpose,history,and language of the ada,along with supreme court and ninth circuit precedent,lead us to conclude that the ada does not preempt a contract claim based on the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing.
background 
plaintiff binyomin ginsberg was an active member of worldperks,a frequent flier program offered by defendant northwest airlines,northwest.ginsberg began his worldperks membership in,and by he had obtained platinum elite status.northwest revoked ginsberg worldperks membership on june.ginsberg attempted several times to clarify the reasons behind northwest decision to revoke his membership.ginsberg alleges that northwest revoked his membership arbitrarily because he complained too frequently about the services.northwest sent ginsberg an email on november,detailing the basis for northwest decision to revoke ginsberg membership.in that email the northwest representative quotes from paragraph of the general terms and conditions of the world perks program,which provides that northwest may determine in its sole judgment whether a passenger has abused the program,and that abuse may result in cancellation of the member account and future disqualification from program participation,forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards.
ginsberg initially filed suit on january,asserting four causes of action breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing negligent misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation.northwest moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b,arguing that the ada preempted the claims.the district court dismissed,with prejudice,ginsberg claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligent misrepresentation,and intentional misrepresentation,concluding that the ada preempted them because they relate to airline prices and services.the district court also dismissed the general breach of contract claim without prejudice,finding that the claim was not preempted,but that ginsberg had failed to allege facts sufficient to show a material breach.
ginsberg only appeals the district court conclusion that the ada preempts a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
standard of review 
dismissals under.b for failure to state a claim are reviewed de novo.kahle gonzales,cir.
based on our case law,supreme court precedent,and the ada legislative history and statutory text,we conclude that the ada does not preempt common law contract claims,such as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.although ginsberg claim may still fail on the merits,the district court erred when it dismissed the claim under the preemption doctrine.doing so was a misapplication of the law because the ada was never designed to preempt these types of disputes.
preemption doctrine 
the key to understanding the scope of the ada preemption clause is to determine what congress intended to achieve when it enacted the ada.preemption may be either express or implied,and is compelled whether congress command is explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.fmc holliday,internal quotation marks omitted.this inquiry begin s with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in medtronic,lohr,the supreme court advised that preemption provisions ought to be narrowly construed for two reasons 
first,because the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action second,our analysis of the scope of the statute is guided by our comment that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.
internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,preemption analysis must be guided by respect for the separate spheres of governmental authority preserved in our federalist system.alessi raybestos manhattan,u.when the question of preemption implicates a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.medtronic,at internal citation and quotations omitted.
to determine what congress manifest purpose was,we must first consider the ada unique history.under the federal aviation act of,the civil aeronautics board cab had regulatory authority over interstate air transportation.but the board power in this field was not exclusive,for the statute also contained a savings clause,clarifying that n othing in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.u,amended and renumbered as c by,stat.because the act did not expressly preempt state law,this clause allowed states to regulate airlines,leading to economic distortions.see,california cab,concluding that states may regulate intrastate airfares,even if such regulations interfere with interstate prices.
by congress had concluded that regulation was inefficient and that deregulation,along with market forces,could better promote efficiency,variety,and quality in the airline industry.see,at.but seeing that states could just as easily undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,morales trans world airlines,congress included a preemption clause in former section a,which now reads as follows 
a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.
at the same time,congress retained the savings clause,thereby preserving common law and statutory remedies.since,the scope of this preemption clause has been hotly debated,but never fully resolved.
supreme court and ninth circuit precedent 
the supreme court has encountered the ada preemption clause at least three times since.in morales,the court considered whether the ada preempted the states from prohibiting allegedly deceptive airline fare advertisements through enforcement of their general consumer protection statutes.at.the court concluded that because advertising has such a direct link to pricing and rates,the ada preempted restrictions against deceptive advertising.id.at.the court therefore reasoned that the advertising restrictions at issue had the forbidden significant effect on rates,routes,or services.id.at.because the regulations were inconsistent with the ada deregulatory purpose,they were preempted under former a.but in the next breath the court cabined its holding to those laws that actually have a direct effect on rates,routes,or services.
the court went to great lengths to make clear that its holding was narrow,and that the ada only preempts laws that have a direct effect on pricing 
in concluding that the advertising guidelines are,we do not set out on a road that leads to of state laws against gambling and prostitution as applied to airlines.nor need we address whether state regulation of the nonprice aspects of fare advertising for example,state laws preventing obscene depictions would similarly relate to rates the connection would obviously be far more tenuous s ome state actions may affect airline fares in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to have a preemptive effect.
at internal citations omitted.
we echoed this view in air transport association of america city county of san francisco,where we concluded that congress did not intend for the ada to preempt state laws forbidding employment discrimination,even if these laws have an economic effect,because employment discrimination laws are not directly related to pricing,routes,or services,cir.
the court considered the ada preemption clause for a second time in american airlines,wolens.in a fact pattern similar to this case,the plaintiffs in wolens were members of a frequent flyer program and brought suit against an airline.id.at.the plaintiffs challenged certain program modifications that devalued credits the members had already earned,and claimed that the devaluation constituted a breach of contract and a violation of illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.id.the court concluded that a clearly preempted the consumer fraud claim because it was a regulation that related to the price,routes,or services of air carriers.id.at.but the court allowed the breach of contract claim to go forward,making clear that the ada allows room for court enforcement of contract terms set by the parties themselves.id.in so doing,the court held that congress did not intend to preempt common law contract claims.charas trans world airlines,cir en banc discussing the scope of a after the wolens decision.
the court in wolens drew a clear distinction between the consumer fraud claim,which was based on a proscriptive law targeting primary conduct,and actions that simply give effect to bargains offered by the airlines and accepted by airline customers.wolens,at.because this distinction between state laws that regulate airlines and state enforcement of contract disputes is crucial,we quote the court at length 
we do not read the ada preemption clause,however,to shelter airlines from suits alleging no violation of obligations,but seeking recovery solely for the airline alleged breach of its own,undertakings.as persuasively argued by the united states,terms and conditions airlines offer and passengers accept are privately ordered obligations and thus do not amount to a state enact ment or enforce ment of any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law within the meaning of a.brief for united states as amicus curiae.cipollone liggett group,d plurality opinion a remedy for a contractual commitment voluntarily undertaken should not be regarded as a requirement imposed under state law within the meaning of federal cigarette labeling and advertising act b.
the ada,as we recognized in morales was designed to promote maximum reliance on competitive market forces.market efficiency requires effective means to enforce private agreements.see farber,contract law and modern economic theory,remedy for breach of contract is necessary in order to ensure economic efficiency as stated by the united states the stability and efficiency of the market depend fundamentally on the enforcement of agreements freely made,based on the needs perceived by the contracting parties at the time.brief for united states as amicus curiae.that reality is key to sensible construction of the ada.
wolens,at internal footnote omitted alterations in original emphasis added.in sum,the court concluded that a state does not enact or enforce any law when it uses its contract laws to enforce private agreements 
after drawing this distinction,the court then pointed out institutional limitations that demonstrate the ada can not preempt breach of contract claims,including those based on common law principles such as good faith and fair dealing.in particular,the department of transportation is not equipped to adjudicate these types of claims.first,the dot own regulations contemplate that contracts ordinarily would be enforceable under the contract law of the states.wolens,at citing.second,the dot is not equipped with either the authority or the apparatus required to superintend a contract dispute resolution regime.id.at.although before the cab adjudicated contract disputes,when congress deregulated the airline industry it dismantled this apparatus and never replaced it.therefore,if common law contract claims were preempted by the ada,a plaintiff literally would have no recourse because state courts would have no jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim,and the dot would have no ability to do so.effectively,the airlines would be immunized from suit a result that congress never intended.this also means that the indicated no intention to establish,simultaneously,a new administrative process for dot adjudication of private contract disputes.id.consequently,the court flatly refused to foist on the dot work congress has neither instructed nor funded the department to do.id.at.we agree.
the supreme court considered a for a third time in rowe new hampshire motor transport ass n.in rowe a group of transport carrier associations challenged a maine statute that regulated the shipment of tobacco into the state.id.at.the court concluded that the ada preempted maine statute because the latter produces the very effect that the federal law sought to avoid namely,a state direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces.id.at.invoking morales,the court emphasized that state enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to carrier rates,routes,or service,are.id.at quoting morales,at alteration omitted.indeed,compared to either wolens or morales,the link in rowe was more directly related to routes,rates,or services because it regulated primary activity that fell under the ada,thereby frustrating congress manifest purpose to deregulate the industry.
and finally,we addressed a similar question in west northwest airlines,cir.there,the plaintiff brought suit against northwest for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under montana law.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment to northwest,stating that the claim was preempted by the ada.on appeal we reversed,concluding that a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing was too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger preemption under the ada.id.at.although this case was,we conclude it is still good law.
indeed,in charas,a decision,we emphasized that congress clear and manifest purpose in enacting airline deregulation was to achieve just that the economic deregulation of the airline industry.charas,at.the only purpose of the preemption clause is to prevent state interference with the mandate of deregulation.id.at noting that when congress enacted the ada it intended to preempt only state laws and lawsuits that would adversely affect the economic deregulation of the airlines and the forces of competition within the airline industry.
additionally,that congress did not intend for a to preempt state common law contract claims is evident from another provision the savings clause,which preserves common law remedies.because the ada preemption clause does not explicitly preempt common law breach of contract claims,we turn to the rest of the statute language to ascertain and give effect to the plain meaning of the language used,but must be careful not to read the preemption clause language in such a way as to render another provision superfluous.charas,at quoting hughes air public utils.comm n,cir.
in charas we concluded that,taken together,the savings clause and preemption clause evidence congressional intent to prohibit states from regulating the airlines while preserving state tort remedies that already existed at common law,providing that such remedies do not significantly impact federal deregulation.id.at.similar logic would apply to state contract remedies that already existed at common law,such as the implied covenan
