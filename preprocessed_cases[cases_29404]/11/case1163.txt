the city of los angeles routinely towed vehicles owned by lone star security video,lone star for violating an ordinance that lone star contends was preempted by the california vehicle code.lone star brought a claim under,arguing that because the ordinance was invalid under state law,the city violated lone star due process rights under the united states constitution.we must decide whether this claim makes out a federal constitutional violation.we also address whether due process required the city to provide notice to lone star,a chronic violator of the ordinance,each time it towed one of lone star vehicles.
background 
the california vehicle code preempts municipal vehicle ordinances inconsistent with its provisions.in relevant part,the code provides that no local authority shall enact or enforce any ordinance on the matters covered by this code unless expressly authorized herein.cal.the code further makes it unlawful for any peace officer or any unauthorized person to remove any unattended vehicle from a highway to a garage or to any other place,except as provided in this code.id.as an exception to this general prohibition against towing unattended vehicles,the code provides that a municipal officer who is engaged in directing traffic or enforcing parking laws and regulations of a city is authorized to tow a vehicle parked or left standing upon a highway for or more consecutive hours in violation of a local ordinance authorizing removal.id.
although the code provides for the towing of vehicles parked for or more consecutive hours,id.emphasis added,the city of los angeles enacted a provision that,during the relevant period,prohibited parking in an otherwise legal public spot for more than hours in the aggregate during any period of consecutive hours,emphasis added the ordinance further stated that a vehicle shall be deemed parked or left standing for hours unless during that period it is either driven a minimum of one mile after leaving the location where it has been parked or left standing or,within that period,is removed from any highway,street or alley.id.
lone star,the in this action,sells security systems to homes and business.as part of its marketing strategy,lone star attached advertisements to a number of mobile trailers and parked them for extended periods on residential streets in los angeles.over several years,officers of the los angeles police department lapd and los angeles department of transportation ladot towed and impounded of lone star trailers for having been parked longer than hours in violation of los angeles municipal code.
both lapd and ladot officers have forms they may attach to a vehicle in order to notify its owner that the vehicle may be towed for being parked longer than hours in violation of section.the city policy is that lapd and ladot officers should attach one of these notice forms to any vehicle belonging to a offender.the decision whether to attach the form to a repeat offender vehicle,however,is left to each individual officer discretion.it is unclear from the record whether the city had,at some point,placed a notice on each of lone star trailers that it ultimately towed and impounded.lone star does not dispute,however,that it received multiple notices for being parked in violation of section and that,in addition to its trailers being towed,it was issued hundreds of citations for violating the ordinance.
in april,lone star filed an action in california state court alleging the city was in unlawful possession of lone star trailers that were impounded under los angeles municipal code because the ordinance was invalid under the california vehicle code.in the state court action,lone star sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the city from towing any of its vehicles that the city could not prove had remained parked in the same location for over consecutive hours without having been moved at least a mile during that period.the los angeles county superior court denied lone star preliminary injunction request,concluding that it was unlikely lone star could prove that the los angeles municipal code was inconsistent with the california vehicle code.
lone star voluntarily dismissed its state court action and filed the present one in federal court.in this action,lone star raised two claims under,contending that its federal due process rights were violated because the city provided inadequate notice before towing its vehicles,and because los angeles municipal code was by the california vehicle code and thus invalid lone star complaint,however,asserts no state law causes of action.
the district court granted lone star summary judgment on the ground that section is invalid under the california vehicle code,but also held that the city was not constitutionally required to provide lone star notice each time it towed one of lone star vehicles for violating the rule.following a bench trial,the district court awarded lone star damages reflecting the company overall losses for all of its trailers towed under section between and,irrespective of whether those trailers were in fact parked more than consecutive that california vehicle code k would permit their were simply parked for more than hours in the aggregate during a period.the city timely appealed the district court judgment,and lone star timely the district court determination that it received constitutionally sufficient notice before its vehicles were towed.
discussion 
lone star purports to raise two distinct due process claims in this action.we conclude that the district court should have rejected the claim and properly rejected the notice claim.
lone star asserts a due process claim under based solely on the city having towed its trailers for being parked in violation of an ordinance that,lone star argues,is invalid under state law the claim.specifically,lone star contends that los angeles municipal code was preempted by the california vehicle code.the city violated lone star federal due process rights by enforcing section,lone star argued in its motion for summary judgment,because w hen a public authority takes property on the basis of a law that is itself unauthorized,that taking is improper and a violation of due process.the district court accepted lone star claim,holding that t o the extent that the city of los angeles or its agencies or representatives have towed or impounded lone star vehicles under section,those actions have been unlawful and deprived plaintiffs of constitutional rights under color of law in violation of.
lone star contends that its due process rights were violated solely by virtue of the city acting under an ordinance that is invalid under state law.we conclude that this claim fails as a matter of law.lone star does not suggest,nor could it,that its claim is based on substantive due process.the ordinance lone star challenges does not interfere with one of the fundamental rights or liberty interests that enjoy heightened protection against government interference under the substantive component of the due process clause.washington glucksberg,d.in addition to restricting legislation that interferes with fundamental rights,substantive due process also bar s certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.daniels williams,d.but this prohibition extends only to executive conduct that amount s to an abuse of power lacking any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective.shanks dressel,cir quoting county of sacramento lewis,d.lone star concedes that section serves the rational purpose of encourag ing removal of any vehicle parked for more than hours in a public place from its place of repose,scofield city of hillsborough,cir,and therefore can not contest that the city advanced this purpose by enforcing the ordinance.thus,lone star can not plausibly assert a substantive due proc
