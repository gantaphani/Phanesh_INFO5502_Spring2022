the city of turlock city adopted a zoning ordinance that prohibited the development of big box retail stores containing a full service grocery department.stores,and real estate business trust collectively,challenged the validity of the ordinance,claiming city unconstitutionally exceeded its police powers and failed to comply with the california environmental quality act ceqa the superior court ruled the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power and was not subject to further environmental review under ceqa because enactment of the ordinance was not a project for purposes of ceqa and,alternatively,various exemptions applied.
we conclude that a city may exercise its police power to control and organize development within its boundaries as a means of serving the general welfare,city made a legitimate policy choice when it decided to organize development using neighborhood shopping centers dispersed throughout the city,the ordinance was reasonably related to protecting that development choice,and no showing was made that the restrictions significantly affected residents of surrounding communities.accordingly,the restrictions in the ordinance bear a reasonable relationship to the general welfare and,thus,city constitutionally exercised its police power.
also,we conclude that further environmental review under ceqa is not necessary because the zoning amendments were consistent with city general plan and were covered adequately by the prior environmental impact report eir prepared for the general plan,tit,subd.i.specifically,the administrative record does not show any reasonably foreseeable changes in the environment that are significant and peculiar to the zoning amendments or their site.in less technical language,it is too soon for the detailed environmental analysis urged by.the impacts wants analyzed are more closely related to later activities and thus are not peculiar to the adoption of the zoning amendments and,consequently,guidelines section allows the detailed environmental analysis to be deferred until those later activities are begun.
we publish this opinion because no other published opinion has upheld the approval of a project based on the application of the provisions in guidelines section see gentry city of murrieta th,d approval of residential development project reversed on remand,city could consider whether project was partially covered by.
facts and proceedings 
in early,began taking steps to develop a site containing a supercenter.asked city officials to identify entitlements and any development impact fees city would require in connection with a development in the vicinity of state route and tuolumne road.city responded to in may by identifying development entitlements and estimating development impact fees applicable to the proposed project.
contends that city staff initially encouraged to proceed with its application but began to modify its position in late july,and,by,city first announced that it would require a conditional use permit cup and an eir for the proposed supercenter project.city disputes this claim of encouragement but acknowledges that,in august,representatives of unions and existing local supermarkets began meeting with and lobbying members of the city council to prevent the development of big box stores containing grocery departments.
also contends that city staff notified representatives on september,that,at its next regularly scheduled meeting,the city council would consider an ordinance proposal that would effectively prohibit the development of a supercenter within city jurisdiction.
at the september,meeting,the city council unanimously passed a motion directing city planning commission to prepare and present a proposed zoning ordinance that would limit the ability of big box retailers to sell nontaxable items such as groceries.
city staff prepared proposed zoning and specific plan amendments that would require a cup for the development of certain retail stores and would prohibit discount superstores,which are defined as retail stores of greater than square feet that devote more than percent of area to nontaxable items such as groceries.on november,the planning commission met,reviewed the draft ordinance,and recommended its approval.
in an agenda report to the city council dated december,city planning manager stated the concern as follows 
discount superstores compete directly with existing grocery stores,many of which anchor commercial centers.many smaller stores within a neighborhood center rely upon the foot traffic generated by the grocery store for their existence.in neighborhood centers where the primary grocery store closes,vacancy rates typically increase and deterioration takes place in the remaining center.for instance,the tenants in the turlock town center have been adversely impacted by the closure of albertson and the entire center lacks its former vitality.for the residents surrounding turlock town center,longer trips are now necessary to acquire consumer goods.the proposed zoning ordinance amendment is intended to preserve the city existing shopping centers that are centrally located within the neighborhood this distribution of shopping and employment creates a land use pattern that reduces the need for vehicle trips and encourages walking and biking for shopping,services,and employment.in short,the proposed amendments are intended to protect grocery stores in existing neighborhood centers to prevent a significant change in land use,employment and traffic patterns throughout the city.a significant concern with discount superstores is that they combine retail grocery in a more remote,retail center,such as along state highway.this means that local residents are forced to drive further for basic services for groceries,causing a shift in traffic patterns,and potentially overburdening streets that were not designed to accommodate such traffic 
in a letter dated november,law firm set forth various grounds for its opposition to the proposed ordinance.one ground asserted in the letter was that a supercenter was the best option when considering vehicle trips and the attendant environmental impacts of congestion and air pollution.to support this assertion,the letter included a study by and associates,an engineering,planning,and environmental consulting firm,and a report by tjkm transportation consultants tjkm.the analysis estimated that a supercenter would generate significantly fewer vehicle trips than a multitenant shopping center containing the same facilities.the tjkm report considered four scenarios a supercenter that used square feet for groceries,a discount store with an unattached supermarket nearby,a shopping center with a supermarket as an anchor tenant and a total of square feet of floor area,and a discount club,such as a costco,with an unattached supermarket nearby.the tjkm report opined that,because the supercenter would generate fewer vehicle trips than the other scenarios,it also would result in less traffic growth and less traffic congestion.
law firm submitted another letter on december,restating opposition to the proposed ordinance and urging its rejection.the letter emphasized position that there was substantial evidence that the ordinance might have a significant effect on the environment and that,therefore,an environmental review was required under ceqa.to support this position,the letter stated the report by tjkm concluded in part that a supercenter would result in anywhere from to fewer trips per week compared with the situation as it would exist absent a supercenter.
the december,letter also included a december,letter from an air quality and noise specialist with jones stokes,who used the tjkm report as the basis for concluding that the construction of a supercenter would have less impact on air quality than alternative developments and a december,letter from real estate developer and broker mehmet noyan,who opined that there was considerable justification for the four development scenarios used in the tjkm report.noyan also stated that,in his opinion,it is more likely than not that a large supermarket of the type currently being operated by winco and food maxx is the most probable occupant for the real property that is the subject of the supercenter proposal,if the supercenter is prohibited by the city.
the december,letter included a section addressing blight and asserted that there was no evidence that the construction of the proposed supercenter would result in blight within city 
at its meetings on december,and january,the city council accepted the planning commission recommendation and adopted ordinance,which amended city zoning regulations,and ordinance,which made parallel amendments to city northwest triangle specific plan collectively,the ordinance.the ordinance defined discount store,discount superstore and discount club.
discount stores are stores with parking that usually offer a variety of customer services,centralized cashing,and a wide range of products.they usually maintain long store hours seven days a week.the stores are often the only ones on the site,but they can also be found in mutual operation with a related or unrelated garden center or service station.discount stores are also sometimes found as separate parcels within a retail complex with their own dedicated parking.a discount superstore is defined as a discount store that exceeds square feet of gross floor area and devotes at least percent of the total sales floor area to the sale of nontaxable merchandise,often in the form of a grocery department.a discount club is defined as a discount store or warehouse where shoppers pay a membership fee in order to take advantage of discounted prices on a wide variety of items,such as food,clothing,tires,and appliances many items are sold in large quantities or bulk.
the ordinance requires developers of discount stores and discount clubs to obtain a cup before constructing such stores.the development of discount superstores within city is not permitted under the ordinance.the following recitation of facts was included in the ordinance 
whereas,the turlock general plan including,but limited to policies,establishes locational requirements for the regional and neighborhood retail centers encouraging a number of neighborhood centers equally dispersed throughout the city while encouraging a concentration of regional shopping centers along the highway drive corridor and 
whereas,general plan policies promote and encourage vital neighborhood commercial districts that are evenly distributed throughout the city so that residents are able to meet their basic daily shopping needs at neighborhood shopping centers and 
whereas,given the changes in the retail sector and the evolution toward stores,it is necessary that the zoning ordinance be amended to regulate larger retail establishments appropriately and to afford them adequate review and 
whereas,the turlock zoning ordinance title of the turlock municipal code has not kept pace with the evolution of the retail sector and fails to adequately distinguish the size,scale and scope of various retail activities and 
whereas,the establishment of discount superstores in turlock is likely to negatively impact the vitality and economic viability of the city neighborhood commercial centers by drawing sales away from traditional supermarkets located in these centers and 
whereas,industry and academic studies indicate discount superstores rarely add any retail services currently not provided within a community,and that the majority of sales growth at a discount supercenter comes from a direct shift of dollars from existing retailers within a community,primarily from grocery stores and 
whereas,discount superstores compete directly with existing grocery stores that anchor commercial centers and 
whereas,smaller stores within a neighborhood center rely upon the foot traffic generated by the grocery store for their existence and in neighborhood centers where the grocery store closes,vacancy rates typically increase and deterioration takes place in the remaining center and 
whereas,the ordinance proposed zoning changes are intended to preserve the city existing shopping centers that are centrally located within the community and 
whereas,the city current distribution of neighborhood shopping centers provide convenient shopping and employment in close proximity to most residential neighborhoods in turlock,consistent with the turlock general plan and 
whereas,this distribution of shopping and employment creates a land use pattern that reduces the need for vehicle trips and encourages walking and biking for shopping,services,and employment.
the city council also made findings that the development of a discount superstore within city would concentrate retail traffic around that store location,which would create traffic congestion in a city that,thus far,had been developed using the concept of retail centers.
city filed a notice of exemption from ceqa with the stanislaus county on january,which stated the amendment of the zoning regulations had been determined to be exempt because it was not a public project,the project was consistent with a program eir,the project was consistent with a general plan,and a categorical exemption relating to the minor alteration of a land use limitation applied.
four weeks later,filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief that alleged city approval of the ordinance violated ceqa,violated state zoning laws,and was an arbitrary,capricious,and unlawful legislative act.
the superior court issued its written decision denying the petition for writ of mandate and the request for declaratory relief on december.the superior court determined that the ordinance was a proper exercise of city police power even though it had an anticompetitive effect,and that an initial study was not required because the ordinance was not a project subject to ceqa review and because certain exemptions from ceqa applied.
a judgment in favor of city and awarding it costs was filed on january.filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
ceqa standard of review 
a preliminary review is the analysis by which a public agency determines whether ceqa applies to a proposed activity.association for a cleaner environment yosemite community college dist.th,d ace.during a preliminary review,the public agency considers whether the proposed activity is a discretionary project and,if so,whether an exemption from ceqa applies.ace,supra,at,d.when the preliminary review results in a determination that the proposed activity is a discretionary project that is not exempt,ceqa requires the public agency to proceed with an initial study.ace,at,d guidelines.in contrast,when the preliminary review results in a determination that the proposed activity is not a project or is exempt,the public agency ceqa inquiry ends and it may file a notice of exemption.guidelines.
in this case,city determined that the enactment of the ordinance was outside ceqa substantive requirements because it was not a project for purposes of ceqa,and various exemptions applied.the determinations that result from an agency preliminary review are subject to judicial review under the abuse of discretion standard contained in section,which provides that an a buse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.ace,supra,th at,d.
for purposes of applying ceqa abuse of discretion standard,substantial evidence includes fact,a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact,or expert opinion supported by fact and excludes argument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,and evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous,subd.e guidelines.furthermore,evidence is substantial when it provides enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.guidelines,subd.a.
ii.existence of a ceqa project 
under ceqa,a project includes an activity that may cause a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and is directly undertaken by any public agency,subd.a.
we will assume for purposes of this opinion that the enactment of the ordinance prohibiting discount superstores within city was a project for purposes of subdivision a of section.therefore,we need not resolve a question of statutory wit,whether subdivision a of section establishes a rule of law that all enactments of zoning ordinances are discretionary projects regardless of whether all of the requisite elements contained in section definition of a project have been met 
iii.application of guidelines section 
section of the guidelines creates a streamlined environmental review for qualifying projects that are consistent with a general plan for which an eir was certified.section provides in part 
a ceqa mandates that projects which are consistent with the development density established by existing general plan policies for which an eir was certified shall not require additional environmental review,except as might be necessary to examine whether there are significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site.this streamlines the review of such projects and reduces the need to prepare repetitive environmental studies.
i where the prior eir relied upon by the lead agency was prepared for a general plan that meets the requirements of this section,any rezoning action consistent with the general plan shall be treated as a project subject to this section.
the ordinance contained a section titled environmental determination that included findings regarding direct and indirect impacts of the change in zoning and the applicability of exemptions from ceqa contained in sections,and of the guidelines.the finding in the ordinance regarding the applicability of the streamlined review in guidelines section states 
that,pursuant to ceqa guidelines section,the proposed regulations are consistent with the general plan,including but limited to promoting commercial centers,dispersing these centers throughout the city,and promoting regional serving commercial centers along the highway corridor.furthermore,a program eir was certified for the general plan and the sic all impacts were previously assessed because there are no effects peculiar to this project that were not addressed in the general plan eir,there are no effects which were not previously analyzed as significant effects,there are no potentially significant cumulative or effects,and there are no previously identified significant effects,which as a result of substantial new information,are determined to have more severe impacts.
the ordinance also included a specific finding that any potential indirect secondary impacts of the proposed amendments on the physical environment are speculative and are not reasonably foreseeable,and are,therefore,not subject to review under ceqa.
challenges city reliance on guidelines section and the prior eir covering city general plan by arguing that the prior eir analyzed neither significant environmental effects peculiar to the ordinance nor potentially significant impacts.does not contend that the ordinance was inconsistent with the general plan.see guidelines,subds.a d c provisions concerning consistency with general plan,subd.a zoning ordinances shall be consistent with the general plan.
standard of review for on prior eir 
one dispute between the parties concerns whether the applicability of guidelines section should be evaluated under the fair argument standard or the substantial evidence standard.we will assume,without deciding,that the fair argument standard applies to our review of city determination that the adoption of the ordinance may be on the eir prepared for its general plan.see gentry city of murrieta,supra,th at,fn,d suggesting fair argument standard applies to determination under that activity is covered by prior eir.accordingly,the ordinance will not be covered by the eir certified for city general plan if presents a fair argument regarding the existence of a reasonably foreseeable significant change in the environment that is peculiar to the ordinance or its site.guidelines,subd.a.
with respect to the production of evidence,a party that makes assertions based on actions it claims it will take in the future is in the best position to present evidence that shows its plans for that future action,county sanitation dist.county of kern th,d county sanitation sanitation districts presented employee declarations identifying the alternate disposal methods likely to be implemented in response to ordinance banning a type of sludge disposal widely used.accordingly,in this case was responsible for producing evidence to support its assertions regarding how it would respond to the adoption of the ordinance.
environmental effects peculiar to the project 
the proper application of the language in guidelines section regarding significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site begins with an understanding of the term significant effects.
effects must relate to physical change and are categorized as either direct primary or indirect secondary.guidelines.when the project is a zoning amendment,few if any direct physical changes will exist.city of board of supervisors d.evaluating environmental consequences of rezoning involves a focus on secondary effects see guidelines,discussion of secondary effects of zoning amendment need not be as detailed as discussion of effects of specific construction project.furthermore,a n indirect physical change is to be considered only if that change is a reasonably foreseeable impact which may be caused by the project.a change which is speculative or unlikely to occur is not reasonably foreseeable.guidelines,subd.d.
based on these provisions,our evaluation of environmental effects will focus on the reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment that may be caused by the adoption of the ordinance.see,subd.a definition of project guidelines,subd.d determining significance of project environmental effects.
contends there will be significant environmental effects peculiar to the ordinance as it will inevitably lead either to the development of a shopping center in the place of the proposed supercenter,or to the development of a supercenter outside the city limits,either of which will have negative impacts on traffic and air quality.accordingly,the possible physical changes in the environment that asserts may be caused by the enactment of the ordinance are derived from two sources.first are the physical changes predicts will result from the possible development of a multitenant shopping center where initially planned to build its supercenter and thus will result indirectly from the enactment of the ordinance.second are the physical changes related to the possible construction of a supercenter outside the boundaries of city,which we will regard as potential impacts of the kind mentioned in subdivision b of guidelines section 
identifying the change relevant to ceqa analysis 
an analysis of each of these sources of potential physical change in the environment begins with a proper identification of the relevant change.fundamentally,a physical change is identified by comparing existing physical conditions with the physical conditions that are predicted to exist at a later point in time,after the proposed activity has been implemented.city of board of supervisors,supra,d at.effects of rezoning are evaluated against existing physical conditions,not against hypothetical conditions permitted by land use plan.the difference between these two sets of physical conditions is the relevant physical change.
using the idea of photographic snapshots to illustrate our point,the baseline environment can be depicted in a snapshot of the physical conditions that exist at the time when the environmental review of the proposed activity begins.next,an array of snapshots is created by picturing the physical conditions that one can reasonably foresee existing in the future the physical changes that are reasonably foreseeable are the differences between the baseline snapshot and any one of the snapshots depicting future conditions.
one can identify an error in analysis of physical change by using this photography illustration.argues that the ordinance will likely result in alternative developments that will have worse environmental effects than the banned discount superstores.by comparing alternative developments on one hand with the discount superstores prohibited by the ordinance on the other hand,has compared two snapshots of future conditions and failed to use the snapshot of existing baseline conditions.this comparison by fails to identify the relevant change.instead,it identifies changes to the in the physical environment,which is a step removed from the inquiry relevant to ceqa.see environmental planning information council county of el dorado d.error to compare population capacities designated under existing general plan with population capacities designated in plan proposed as amendments to general plan the impact of development associated with proposed area plans must be determined by comparing that development with existing physical conditions.
the correct analysis of the relevant physical change in the environment involves a comparison of the physical conditions that existed at the time the ordinance was proposed or approved with forecasts of reasonably foreseeable future conditions that may occur as a result of the adoption of the ordinance.as we shall discuss below,however,there is insufficient evidence in the administrative record to establish that the physical changes predicted by are reasonably foreseeable,much less,peculiar to the ordinance.
asserted changes within city 
claims that the ordinance will inevitably lead to the development of a shopping center in the place of the proposed supercenter in the language of ceqa,this claim can be restated as asserting that the development of a multitenant shopping center at the location proposed for a supercenter is a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change to the environment that may be caused by the enactment of the ordinance.thus,according to analysis,there are significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site,and the enactment of the ordinance falls outside the scope of guidelines section.
reasonable foreseeability 
the question whether alleged physical changes are reasonably foreseeable requires an examination of the evidence presented in the administrative record.for example,in county sanitation,supra,th,d,this court reviewed the administrative record to identify which alternative methods of disposing of sewage sludge were reasonably foreseeable after the county of kern prohibited the land application of certain types of sewage sludge within its jurisdiction.we concluded that incineration was a foreseeable alternative disposal method because applicable rules of law allowed it and the administrative record described it as an alternative.id.at,d.despite being foreseeable,however,the quality and quantity of evidence in the administrative record did not show a reasonable possibility that incineration would be used in the future.id.at,d.the evidence indicated that incineration of sewage sludge was an unlikely alternative because of its negative effects on air quality.as a result,this court concluded that incineration was not a reasonably foreseeable alternative method of sewage sludge disposal.id.at,d.
in this case,we examine the administrative record to determine whether it includes substantial evidence that the development of a multitenant shopping center at the location had chosen for its facility is reasonably foreseeable.in this regard,we note,first,that cites no evidence to support and,indeed,makes no argument either that the ordinance is the catalyst for,or part of,a larger set of actions designed to achieve such a development at that location or that,at the time the preliminary review was being conducted,one or more developers had expressed any interest in developing a multitenant shopping center at that location,much less taken any steps toward initiating it.
second,we note that the assertion in opening brief that such a shopping center is inevitable or,at least,reasonably foreseeable is not supported by a citation to the administrative record.see cal.rules of court,rule a c computerxpress,jackson th,d factual assertions in appellate briefs should be supported with specific cites to the record.the assertion can not,in itself,be treated as evidence because it is merely argument or unsupported opinion,subd.e substantial evidence excludes argument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative guidelines,subd.a.
third,we note that the section in opening brief that addresses guidelines section twice cites to page five of its law firm november,letter to city planning commission that page discusses transportation and traffic circulation and asserts the study by shows that a supercenter would generate significantly fewer trips than would a shopping center containing the same facilities.a supercenter would generate total daily trips,percent less than the total daily trips that the shopping center containing the same facilities could be expected to generate.in addition,the letter describes the report by tjkm as concluding in part that a supercenter would result in anywhere from to fewer trips per week compared with the situation as it would exist absent a supercenter.although this letter to the planning commission,the study by,and the report by tjkm all refer to the possibility that a multitenant shopping center containing the same facilities as would a supercenter will be constructed at the location where wanted to build its facility,these documents merely assume such a multitenant shopping center will be built there.they are not substantial evidence for the proposition that adoption of the ordinance caused the construction of such a shopping center to become reasonably foreseeable.
fourth,despite the failure of the appellate briefs of to reference the document in the administrative record as required by rule a c of the california rules of court,we will consider whether the december,letter from mehmet noyan constitutes substantial evidence that development of a multitenant shopping center,containing the same facilities as would a supercenter,on the site where wanted to build its facility,is reasonably foreseeable.specifically,noyan opined it is more likely than not that a large supermarket of the type currently being operated by winco and food maxx is the most probable occupant for the real property that is the subject of the supercenter proposal,if the supercenter is prohibited by the city.in other words,noyan stated the belief that there is more than a percent chance that a large supermarket is the most probable future occupant of the site.noyan also opined that there was considerable justification for the four development scenarios used in the tjkm report.
substantial evidence includes expert opinion supported by facts and excludes unsubstantiated opinion.guidelines.noyan opinion is not substantiated by any reference to any market study or expression of interest by any supermarket developer.thus,it is not based on an existing intent or interest,but is based on generalized prospects.noyan opinion about the range of general prospects for the potential development of the site is supported by his review of the location,his years of experience as a real estate developer in the area,and his role in negotiating the acquisition of the site for.in stating that there was considerable justification for the four development scenarios,however,noyan made no reference to the existing zoning requirements that would have required a cup for the large supermarket component in those scenarios.under these requirements,city would have to approve the development of a large supermarket at the location.such an approval is unlikely because a large supermarket at that location would be inconsistent with city stated policy of favoring the use of neighborhood centers for supermarket food sales noyan letter does not provide a factual basis for inferring that city would approve or it is reasonably foreseeable city would approve any one of the four development scenarios.this unaddressed contingency creates sufficient uncertainty over whether any of the scenarios would actually be implemented as to render those scenarios speculative rather than reasonably foreseeable.
in addition,vagueness in the opinion makes it difficult to interpret.noyan statement that it is more likely than not that a large supermarket is the most probable tenant if a supercenter is prohibited only means he believes there is more than a percent chance that a large supermarket is the most probable future occupant.without some context for comparing how that most probable future occupant relates to the entire range of possible future occupants,we can not tell whether the large supermarket described as the most probable occupant is reasonably foreseeable or,instead,is only the most probable of a list of speculative alternatives.
consequently,we conclude that noyan opinion is not substantial evidence supporting the inference that the building of a multitenant shopping center containing facilities comparable to those of a supercenter was reasonably foreseeable as a result of the adoption of the ordinance.
effects peculiar to the ordinance 
finally,regardless of whether the building of a multitenant shopping center at the site in question became reasonably foreseeable,the impacts of such a shopping center would not be environmental effects peculiar to the adoption of the ordinance as those terms are used in guidelines section,subdivision a.
the usual and ordinary meaning of the term peculiar to may be derived from a dictionary.see leavitt county of madera th,d dictionary definition gives the usual meaning of a word.webster third new international dictionary page defines peculiar as belonging exclusively or esp.to a person or group tending to be a characteristic of one only distinctive.
applying these definitions,a physical change in the environment will be peculiar to the ordinance if that physical change belongs exclusively or especially to the ordinance or if it is characteristic of only the ordinance.in general,these definitions illustrate how difficult it will be for a zoning amendment or other land use regulation that does not have a physical component to have a sufficiently close connection to a physical change to allow the physical change to be regarded as peculiar to the zoning amendment or other land use regulation 
none of the physical changes advocated by as reasonably foreseeable are peculiar to the ordinance in the sense that those changes are characteristic of only the ordinance or belong exclusively or especially to the ordinance.rather,the ordinance is at least twice removed from those physical changes.the physical changes will not occur unless a specific development project is proposed,city grants its approval to that specific project,the project is completed,and customers visit the project.the intervening construction project and city approval prevent the impacts asserted by from being regarded as peculiar to the ordinance or its site 
the only result that is peculiar to the adoption of the ordinance is the elimination of one type of development,discount superstores.thus,all of the development possibilities that existed before the adoption of the ordinance,except the possibility of a discount superstore,also existed after the adoption of the ordinance.within that wide range of development possibilities,none of the remaining possibilities were promoted or encouraged to the detriment of another remaining possibility.because the relative probability of the remaining development possibilities is unaltered by the ordinance,when and if any one of those alternatives actually comes into being,it can not be described by an alternative that was peculiar to the ordinance for purposes of guidelines section.
the foregoing construction of the terms peculiar to and promotes efficiency by reducing delay and needless paperwork and,therefore,is consistent with the purpose underlying the streamlined review of guidelines section.remy,supra,at see generally guidelines.this construction means that the asserted physical changes in the environment caused by the project must be more closely connected to the project than to a subsequent,more specific project that will be subject to further environmental review.in contrast,construction and application of guidelines section would result in repetitive environmental studies guidelines,subd.a where the subsequent project that is actually implemented does not align with the details that contends are now reasonably foreseeable and should be used for a environmental review,which would undermine the efficiency of streamlined review.
also,the foregoing construction is consistent with the view that environmental review documents should be general when they cover general possibilities and specific when the specifics of a project are reasonably foreseeable.here,the eir for city general plan adequately covered,and continues to cover,the general possibility that the location will be developed.also,when a specific project is proposed for that location,its details will be presented to city for approval and city will be required to conduct another preliminary review to determine what additional environmental review,if any,is necessary for ceqa compliance.see no oil,city of los angeles d.when route for pipeline was selected and the specifics of construction became known,a new eir containing a detailed analysis would need to be prepared.
in summary,the environmental impacts that contends may occur because of physical changes within city jurisdiction have not been shown to be reasonably foreseeable effects which are peculiar to the project or its site for purposes of guidelines section.thus,the provision covering rezoning action that is consistent with a general plan applies and further environmental review is unnecessary at this time.guidelines,subd.i.
changes outside city 
pursuant to subdivision b of guidelines section,potentially significant impacts which were not discussed in the prior eir must be examined in an initial study or other analysis.as noted previously,in considering what effects are potentially significant,an indirect physical change is to be considered only if that change is a reasonably foreseeable impact which may be caused by the project.a change which is speculative or unlikely to occur is not reasonably foreseeable.guidelines,subd.d.
asserts that potentially significant impacts are present here because the construction of a supercenter outside the city limits of turlock will result in reasonably foreseeable environmental effects that are peculiar to the ordinance.this analysis,however,puts the cart before the horse.before addressing the asserted environmental impacts of construction of a supercenter outside city jurisdiction we must examine the evidence has referenced to see whether it supports the conclusion that the construction is reasonably foreseeable.
in its opening brief,cites to page five from its law firm november,letter to the planning commission that stated 
by prohibiting discount superstores in the city of turlock,the proposed ordinance and plan amendments would force such stores to locate in communities near the city of turlock.residents of the city would have to travel greater distances to take advantage of the lower prices and expanded product offerings that would be available and e mployees too may face longer vehicle trips.
the november,letter did not disclose the facts from which it inferred that would build a supercenter near but outside of city if it was not allowed to build within city jurisdiction.neither is the factual basis for such an inference disclosed in tjkm report or study.the only reference to the possibility of construction outside city is the statement in the letter that the ordinance would force discount superstores to locate in communities around city,and this statement is not supported by a citation to any evidence.the statement in the letter is not,in itself,substantial evidence because it is argument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,subd.e guidelines,subd.a.
city is located in stanislaus county.the record reveals that,during the process of enacting the ordinance,and in response to assertion that the ordinance would result in the building of a supercenter outside the city limits,city learned that there are no proximate sites within stanislaus county jurisdiction that are appropriately zoned and have adequate urban service utilities that would provide a suitable alternative site.labels this proposition a red herring because it ignores the fact that turlock is at the county border,and thus that numerous proximate locations exist outside of stanislaus county jurisdiction in merced county.as evidentiary support for this assertion,however,references nothing more than two pages of maps contained in city general plan that show city is located near the boundary between merced and stanislaus counties.it hardly needs saying that,although the maps are evidence regarding the proximity of merced county to city,they do not show that the construction of a supercenter in merced county is reasonably foreseeable.
the quantity and quality of evidence presented in county sanitation,supra,th,d to show that particular responses to the new sewage sludge restrictions were reasonably foreseeable stands in stark contrast to the absence of evidence in the administrative record in this case.in county sanitation,the sanitation districts presented declarations of employees who described the available options and the extent of the planning that had been done in anticipation of the possibility that the county of kern would adopt the proposed ordinance.id.at,d.also,under the circumstances of that case,a or alternative was not an option available to the sanitation districts because the continued production of sewage sludge by their treatment plants meant that their need to dispose of that sludge was a near certainty and,thus,easily within the range of the reasonably foreseeable.id.at,d.
in contrast,presented no declarations or other evidence regarding its plans to build a supercenter near city in response to the passage of the ordinance.also,unlike the sanitation districts,has the option of responding to the ordinance by taking no action at is,it could choose not to build a supercenter near city.
as a matter of logic,we recognize that possible reactions can be divided into two will build a supercenter near city or it will not.each category is foreseeable.nevertheless,substantial evidence must exist in the administrative record before a foreseeable alternative is reasonably foreseeable.here,simply assumed it would build a supercenter near city and failed to present evidence that rendered this possibility reasonably foreseeable.the building of a supercenter near city is an essential link in the causal chain that leads to the impacts on traffic and air quality alleged by.without this essential link,the causal chain is broken and the alleged impacts to traffic and air quality can not reach the level of probability necessary to be regarded as reasonably foreseeable.
environmental effects analyzed in prior eir 
contends that the environmental effects of the ordinance w ere not analyzed as significant effects in a prior eir on the general plan with which the project is consistent.guidelines,subd.b.
this contention is rejected based on our earlier determinations that the impacts asserted by were not supported by enough evidence to be reasonably foreseeable,the specific possibility of development of a multitenant shopping center where had planned to build its supercenter was not reasonably foreseeable,and to the extent that one could reasonably foresee development occurring at the location where had planned to build its supercenter,it was general in nature and adequately covered by city general plan and related eir.
potentially significant impacts 
asserts that potentially significant impacts and cumulative impacts not discussed in the prior eir prepared for the general plan guidelines,subd.b require preparation of an initial study or an eir.
this contention is rejected based on our earlier determination that the impacts asserted by were not reasonably foreseeable under the evidence contained in the administrative record.therefore,the fact that the prior eir did not discuss those impacts is of no consequence in this case.
conclusion
