walid elkhatib is a palestinian arab of the muslim faith who is a citizen.in,he purchased his first dunkin donuts franchise,and has continuously operated various dunkin donuts franchises since that time.elkhatib attested that he chose to pursue the franchise opportunity with dunkin donuts in part because it would not require him to handle pork products,which he asserts is forbidden to members of the arab race by tradition and custom.although no pork products were served at dunkin donuts when elkhatib purchased his first franchise in,that situation changed in when dunkin donuts introduced its breakfast sandwiches,which are croissants with egg and a choice of cheese,bacon,ham or sausage.elkhatib refused to sell the sandwiches at his store,and district manager jeff zevoral did not object to that decision.in,elkhatib opened a second franchise in berkeley,illinois,and again his refusal to carry pork products was met with no objection from dunkin donuts personnel.a year later,elkhatib began selling breakfast sandwiches without bacon,sausage or ham,at his two locations.zevoral facilitated those sales,supplying elkhatib with a sign that stated meat products not available.zevoral also provided another plastic sign to elkhatib advertising the breakfast sandwiches,which stated at participating shops only sic bacon,sausage or ham may not be available at all shops.in,elkhatib opened a dunkin donuts store in westchester,illinois.
elkhatib was approached in by gene liguoritis,development manager for dunkin donuts,about the possibility of moving his location within westchester to a more advantageous location at the intersection of two busy roads.elkhatib pursued that opportunity,and entered into a letter of intent to ground lease for the new location contingent upon the approval by dunkin donuts.that approval was not forthcoming,and in fact,in may,elkhatib was informed that dunkin donuts would not agree to the relocation.elkhatib met with dunkin donuts supervisors greg novak and chuck cowgill to ascertain the reason for that decision.near the conclusion of that meeting,the issue of the breakfast sandwiches arose,and elkhatib informed them that he would continue to sell breakfast sandwiches,but would not sell pork products because he was forbidden to handle pork.no one mentioned at that time that his objection to selling pork was fatal to his future as a franchise owner.
however,on august,elkhatib received that news via a letter from dunkin donuts legal counsel,declaring that although his current franchise agreements would be honored,he could not relocate nor could he renew any of his franchise agreements because of his failure to carry dunkin donuts full breakfast sandwich product line.in november,elkhatib filed a complaint against dunkin donuts and its parent company allied domecq hereinafter dunkin donuts,alleging that the refusal to allow him to relocate or to renew his franchises based on his refusal to sell pork products constituted racial discrimination in violation of and.
dunkin donuts sought summary judgment in the district court,arguing that elkhatib was denied the right to relocate and renew his franchises because of his refusal to carry a full line of dunkin donuts products,including pork products,and not due to his race.in granting that motion,the court on its own construed elkhatib claim to be one of religious discrimination rather than racial discrimination,based on the court determination that the restrictions on handling pork are associated with religion rather than race.neither party argues for affirming on that basis.instead,dunkin donuts argues that the district court properly held in the alternative that elkhatib had failed to meet his burden in demonstrating racial discrimination.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing all facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to elkhatib.cerutti basf,cir.we will affirm only if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that dunkin donuts is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the complaint was filed under,which provide that all persons shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts,as is enjoyed by white citizens,that those rights are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination,and that all citizens shall have the same right as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,purchase,lease,sell,hold,and convey real and personal property.those provisions are inapplicable to religious discrimination,but protect against racial discrimination.
we note initially that the supreme court has recognized that the protection against racial discrimination applies to discrimination based on a person status as an arab.saint francis college,d.elkhatib may prove discrimination under either through direct evidence,or through the indirect method discussed in mcdonnell douglas green,d.humphries cbocs west,cir cerutti,at.
elkhatib has presented little in the way of direct evidence relating to his race.direct evidence is evidence that,if believed,shows discriminatory conduct by the employer without reliance on inference or presumption,such as where there is an admission by an employer that the decision was based on the prohibited animus.cerutti,at.that may include circumstantial evidence,but such evidence must point directly to a discriminatory reason for the employer action.id.at,quoting adams stores,cir.elkhatib provides only a statement from his store manager that in,she overheard greg novak make what she regarded as an statement at a meeting of franchisees and their managers.with elkhatib permission,she reported the comment through the complaint mechanism supplied by dunkin donuts,and was told that novak boss,cowgill,would stop by the store to apologize.cowgill did visit the store that week,but did not apologize,and the store manager reported that as well.that incident is potentially relevant in determining the motive for the decision not to renew the franchise agreements,although it arguably indicates retaliatory discrimination rather than racial discrimination.see humphries,at recognizing that the protections of also apply to claims of retaliation.it is so lacking in detail,however,including any indication as to what the statement was,that any thoughts as to its potential relevance are purely speculative.for purposes of this motion,it is enough to note that it does not provide direct evidence that the decision regarding the renewal and relocation of the franchises was based on elkhatib race.
in the absence of such direct evidence,he may survive summary judgment through the indirect method of mcdonnell douglas.under that method,he must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by producing evidence which would allow a jury to find that he belongs to a protected class he met dunkin donuts legitimate expectations with regard to the franchise agreement he suffered an adverse action and individuals were treated more favorably.once elkhatib meets that burden,dunkin donuts must provide a legitimate,reason for its actions.the burden would then shift back to elkhatib to demonstrate that dunkin donuts actions were merely pretextual.
there is no dispute that elkhatib belongs to a protected class,nor is there any question that he suffered an adverse action.dunkin donuts argues,however,that elkhatib has failed to establish that he can perform his obligations under the contract because he is unwilling to serve the full line of products,and that there are no individuals treated more favorably.
for its first argument,dunkin donuts points to the franchise agreement itself,which requires all franchisees to carry dunkin donuts full food product line.elkhatib refusal to carry pork products violates that provision,and according to dunkin donuts,establishes that he can not or will not perform his obligations under the contract.elkhatib responds that dunkin donuts has never required its franchisees to carry the full product line despite that language,and in fact that it affirmatively assisted franchisees in carrying less than the full product line by providing signs for stores declaring no meat
