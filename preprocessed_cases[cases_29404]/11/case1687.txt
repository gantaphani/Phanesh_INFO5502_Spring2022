the credit card act of credit card act,et is designed to promote consumer protection.florez linens n things,th,d florez.one of its provisions,section,prohibits businesses from requesting that cardholders provide personal identification information during credit card transactions,and then recording that information,subd.a.
plaintiff sued defendant retailer,asserting a violation of the credit card act.plaintiff alleges that while she was paying for a purchase with her credit card in one of defendant stores,the cashier asked plaintiff for her zip code.believing it necessary to complete the transaction,plaintiff provided the requested information and the cashier recorded it.plaintiff further alleges that defendant subsequently used her name and zip code to locate her home address 
we are now asked to resolve whether section is violated when a business requests and records a customer zip code during a credit card transaction.in light of the statute plain language,protective purpose,and legislative history,we conclude a zip code constitutes personal identification information as that phrase is used in section.thus,requesting and recording a cardholder zip code,without more,violates the credit card act.we therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the court of appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with our decision.
facts and procedural history 
because we are reviewing the sustaining of a demurrer,we assume as true all facts alleged in the complaint.sheehan san francisco,cal th,d.
in june,plaintiff jessica pineda filed a complaint against defendant stores,the complaint alleged the following 
plaintiff visited one of defendant california stores and selected an item for purchase.she then went to the cashier to pay for the item with her credit card.the cashier asked plaintiff for her zip code and,believing she was required to provide the requested information to complete the transaction,plaintiff provided it.the cashier entered plaintiff zip code into the electronic cash register and then completed the transaction.at the end of the transaction,defendant had plaintiff credit card number,name,and zip code recorded in its database.
defendant subsequently used customized computer software to perform reverse searches from databases that contain millions of names,addresses,telephone numbers,and street addresses,and that are indexed in a manner resembling a reverse telephone book.the software matched plaintiff name and zip code with plaintiff previously undisclosed address,giving defendant the information,which it now maintains in its own database.defendant uses its database to market products to customers and may also sell the information it has compiled to other businesses.
plaintiff filed the matter as a putative class action,alleging defendant had violated section and the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.she also asserted an invasion of privacy claim.defendant demurred,arguing a zip code is not personal identification information as that phrase is used in section,that plaintiff lacked standing to bring her ucl claim,and that the invasion of privacy claim failed for,among other reasons,failure to allege all necessary elements.plaintiff conceded the demurrer as to the ucl claim,and the trial court subsequently sustained the demurrer as to the remaining causes of action without leave to amend.as for the credit card act claim,the trial court agreed with defendant and concluded a zip code does not constitute personal identification information as that term is defined in section.
the court of appeal affirmed in all respects.with respect to the credit card act claim,the court of appeal relied upon party city superior court th,d party city,which similarly concluded a zip code,without more,does not constitute personal identification information 
plaintiff sought our review regarding both her credit card act claim and her invasion of privacy cause of action.we granted review,but only of plaintiff credit card act claim 
discussion 
we independently review questions of statutory construction.imperial merchant services,hunt cal th,d.in doing so,we look first to the words of a statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.hsu abbara cal th,d.we give the words their usual and ordinary meaning lungren deukmejian cal d,while construing them in light of the statute as a whole and the statute purpose walker superior court cal d.in other words,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.smith superior court cal th,d.we are also mindful of the general rule that civil statutes for the protection of the public are,generally,broadly construed in favor of that protective purpose.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d,lungren see florez,supra,th at,d liberally construing former,now.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.people snook cal th,d.only when the statute language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,may the court turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.our discussion thus begins with the words of section.
section,subdivision a provides,in pertinent part,n o person,firm,partnership,association,or corporation that accepts credit cards for the transaction of business shall request,or require as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services,the cardholder to provide personal identification information,which the person,firm,partnership,association,or corporation accepting the credit card writes,causes to be written,or otherwise records upon the credit card transaction form or otherwise,subd.a,italics added.subdivision b defines personal identification information as information concerning the cardholder,other than information set forth on the credit card,and including,but not limited to,the cardholder address and telephone number,subd.b.because we must accept as true plaintiff allegation that defendant requested and then recorded her zip code,the outcome of this case hinges on whether a cardholder zip code,without more,constitutes personal identification information within the meaning of section.we hold that it does.
subdivision b defines personal identification information as information concerning the cardholder including,but not limited to,the cardholder address and telephone number,subd.b,italics added.concerning is a broad term meaning pertaining to regarding having relation to or respecting webster new internat.dict.ed.a cardholder zip code,which refers to the area where a cardholder works or lives see dmm,supra,ch,subtopic as of,each post office is assigned at least one unique zip code,is certainly information that pertains to or regards the cardholder.
in nonetheless concluding the legislature did not intend for a zip code,without more,to constitute personal identification information,the court of appeal pointed to the enumerated examples of such information in subdivision b,the cardholder address and telephone number,subd.b.invoking the doctrine ejusdem generis,whereby a general term ordinarily is understood as being restricted to those things that are similar to those which are enumerated specifically costco wholesale superior court cal th,d,conc.opn.of george,the court of appeal reasoned that an address and telephone number are specific in nature regarding an individual.by contrast,the court continued,a zip code pertains to the group of individuals who live within the zip code.thus,the court of appeal concluded,a zip code,without more,is unlike the other terms specifically identified in subdivision b.
there are several problems with this reasoning.first,a zip code is readily understood to be part of an address when one addresses a letter to another person,a zip code is always included.the question then is whether the legislature,by providing that personal identification information includes the cardholder address,subd.b,inte
