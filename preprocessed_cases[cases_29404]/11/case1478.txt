in,congress instructed the department of transportation dot to determine whether drivers of commercial motor vehicles cmvs large trucks,passenger coaches,and school receiving adequate training.intermodal surface transportation efficiency act,stat,istea or the act.in july,after extensive study,the federal highway administration fhwa published a study entitled,assessing the adequacy of commercial motor vehicle driver training final report adequacy report.the report concluded,inter alia,that in order for any training program to be adequate,it must include hours of training.the findings of the adequacy report were distilled into a final regulatory evaluation,which the agency transmitted to congress in february.in april,the agency published a notice in which it solicited comments on the adequacy report and the final regulatory evaluation.and then nothing much happened until november,when parties petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus ordering the secretary of transportation to fulfill his istea duties.in re citizens for reliable safe highways.pursuant to a settlement agreement,the agency agreed to publish a final rule implementing training requirements no later than may.
on august,the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to address the findings of the adequacy report.after eliciting comments,fmcsa issued a final rule in may.in the rule summary,fmcsa stated this action responds to a study mandated by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of that found the private sector training of drivers in the heavy truck,motorcoach,and school bus industries was inadequate.minimum training requirements for commercial motor vehicle operators,may,codified at pt.however,the rule departed sharply from earlier agency recommendations.the adequacy report determined that effective training for cmv drivers required practical,instruction on how to operate a heavy vehicle.but fmcsa ignored this evidence and opted for a program that focuses on areas unrelated to the practical demands of operating a commercial motor vehicle.
petitioners,who represent private citizens concerned with highway safety and the industries affected by training requirements,seek review of fmcsa final rule.the striking incongruity between the methods of training previously shown to be effective and the regimen adopted in the final rule,petitioners argue,shows the agency action to be arbitrary and capricious,in violation of the administrative procedure act the apa.see a.we agree.initial phases of the regulatory involved extensive study and voluminous deficiencies in training,and then prescribed standards for judging training adequacy and guidelines for inculcating the requisite operational skills.fmcsa proclaims that its final rule responds to those earlier findings.in truth,however,the final rule inexplicably ignores the adequacy report and the regulatory prescriptions contained in that report.the agency,without coherent explanation,has promulgated a rule that is so at odds with the record assembled by dot that the action can not stand.accordingly,we grant the petitions for review and remand the final rule to the agency for further rulemaking consistent with this opinion.
background 
licensing and training drivers of commercial motor vehicles 
this case concerns congress ongoing efforts to ensure that cmvs operate safely on the nation roads.for almost two decades,the federal government has regulated the licensing of cmv drivers.however,prior to the instant rulemaking,which was instituted under istea,the government never purported to impose any standards of driver training.private parties had developed training for neophyte drivers,but these efforts were found to be insufficient to secure cmv safety.
in,congress passed the commercial motor vehicle safety act cmvsa,et.under the cmvsa,the secretary of transportation was required to promulgate regulations,to be administered by individual states,setting minimum uniform standards governing commercial drivers licenses cdls for cmvs.id.cmvs include trucks within a specified weight range,vehicles designed to transport at least passengers,and vehicles carrying certain hazardous materials.id.among other things,the statute mandates that cdl tests include written and driving components.id.
the federal standards governing cdls do not establish a training regimen.in other words,there are no prerequisite federal training requirements to obtain a cdl.minimum training requirements for commercial motor vehicle operators,proposed,codified as amended at pt.generally,drivers individually prepare for the cdl tests by studying such areas as vehicle inspection procedures,vehicle maneuvers and operating a cmv in traffic.id.
while the cdl program does not mandate any cmv training,some segments of the private sector,with guidance from the federal government,have attempted to promote effective training practices.in,fhwa published a model curriculum for training drivers model curriculum.see joint appendix.the model curriculum sets out a primer for instructing drivers of heavy trucks.it focuses on five subject areas basic operation,safe operating practices,advanced operating practices,vehicle maintenance,and nonvehicle activity.the model curriculum prescribes a total of hours of training,including hours of training and additional hours of time.id.at.the curriculum is primarily focused on inculcating the skills and knowledge needed to enhance cmv safety.for example,it prescribes hours of training on the techniques needed to avoid accidents while driving a truck in reverse,and hours on advanced operating practices,like emergency maneuvers and skid control.id.still,the model curriculum introduction emphasizes that its program sets out only minimum standards,and that g raduates of this curriculum can not be considered fully trained,ready to solo type drivers unless the curriculum is considerably expanded and enriched to provide both additional driving time and material pertinent to the particular driving job that the student is being trained for.id.at emphases in original.in,fhwa devised a similar curriculum for motor coach drivers.
shortly after the model curriculum was published,groups representing the motor carrier,training,and insurance industries formed the professional training institute of america ptdia or the institute.the institute develops standards for training truck drivers,and it certifies private training organizations that meet or exceed its recommendations.ptdia acknowledges that the model curriculum has been the bible around which the ptdia has built its standards.professional truck driver institute of america,comments to pt,at,reprinted in.to qualify as adequate under ptdia standards,a truck driver training program must provide hours of instruction including hours of combined street and range time.id.at.
congress revisited the issue of cmv safety in when it passed istea.the rulemaking at issue here was commenced pursuant to a of the act,which provides 
a entry level.
study of private later than months after the date of the enactment of this act,the secretary shall report to congress on the effectiveness of the efforts of the private sector to ensure adequate training of entry level drivers of commercial motor vehicles.in preparing the report,the secretary shall solicit the views of interested persons.

implementing istea dictates 
studying the adequacy of driver training 
as a first step toward implementing a of istea,fmcsa predecessor,fhwa,issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.training for all entry level drivers of commercial motor vehicles cmvs.announced june,to be codified at pt.noting the requirements of a,fhwa solicited comments on the need to require training of all entry level drivers of commercial motor vehicles cmvs.id.the agency further explained that it had contracted with an outside company to produce a study examining the effectiveness of private sector efforts to ensure adequate training of cmv drivers.id.at.information gleaned from this study would form the basis of the report to congress mandated by istea.to help assemble the necessary material,the agency invited interested parties to submit comments in response to a list of questions addressing the state of driver training.id.at.
in july,after receiving over responses to its request for comments,fhwa published its adequacy report,reprinted in.the adequacy report began by surveying the training levels among drivers of heavy trucks,motor coaches,and school buses.what it found was not encouraging the conclusion of this study is that none of the three private sectors are effectively providing adequate training.adequacy report at.specifically,the adequacy report found that the heavy truck sector has the smallest percentage of carriers offering adequate training about percent,while only percent of motor coach carriers offered adequate training.id.at.the report concluded that the present level of training adequacy is not likely to improve due to the actions of the private sectors themselves.id.at.given widespread training failures across the industries it examined,the report recommended that i f it is desirable to target fewer than all three domains,the heavy truck domain should be considered first priority,followed by motorcoaches.id.at.
the adequacy report also made extensive findings on the form that adequate training would take.with regard to heavy trucks,the report stated,there is general agreement in the industry that the model driver curriculum developed by the fhwa in the represents an adequate content and approach for training truck drivers.adequacy report at.therefore,the model curriculum was the starting point in defining adequate training for heavy truck drivers.id.using the model curriculum as a baseline for analysis,the report noted that f or a program to be considered adequate it must have hours.id.at.
the findings of the adequacy report were distilled into a final regulatory evaluation,which fhwa transmitted to congress in february.the evaluation presented a analysis of mandating driver training in conformity with the model curriculum.on balance,the report found,mandatory training would be beneficial.in its analysis,the agency discounted the anomalous results produced by some earlier studies of driver training,which had suggested that training might increase accident rates.such counterintuitive findings,the agency determined,likely reflected the pervasiveness of training programs that were not adequate.final regulatory evaluation driver training at may,reprinted in.adjusting for shoddy training programs made the benefits of good training clear.based on the information presented from case studies,a reduction in accidents is possible when training is well designed.accident reductions in the to percent range are not unrealistic.id.at.economically,mandating training along the lines described in the model curriculum would yield substantial projected benefits.against a cost of between billion and billion over years,mandatory training was expected to generate a benefit in the range of billion to billion during the same period.id.at.
in april,fhwa published a notice in which it solicited comments on the adequacy report and the final regulatory evaluation.training of drivers of commercial motor vehicles,notice of availability and request for comments.in response,the agency received additional comments.on november,the agency held a public meeting on the issue,which individuals attended.after the meeting,however,the agency activities pursuant to a came to a halt.nothing in the record explains this hiatus,but for six years the agency initiated no further action.indeed,it took litigation by concerned private parties to nudge the agency out of its slumber.in november,those parties petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus ordering the secretary of transportation to fulfill his istea duties.in re citizens for reliable safe highways.the matter was settled,and dot agreed to publish a final rule implementing training requirements no later than may.id.
fmcsa final rule 
on august,fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking.after recounting the findings of the adequacy report,fmcsa proposed a novel approach to the problem of cmv training 
the agency is not requiring drivers to receive training in areas that are covered in the cdl test.such training would be redundant.instead,the required training would address driver,and drug and alcohol testing,driver hours of service limitations,driver wellness,and whistle blower protection.
minimum training requirements.at.fmcsa estimated that training in this course of study would entail about hours for heavy truck and motor coach drivers.id.the proposed rule defined driver as one with less than two years experience.id.at.licensed drivers with one year of experience and a good driving record,however,would be grandfathered past the new standard.id.finally,the agency asserted that the proposed rule would be,but it offered no studies directly demonstrating the rule economic benefit.instead,fmcsa relied on inferences from data related to more extensive training regimens.estimating a cost of million,the agency claimed that the proposed rule would have to prevent accidents in the first year and crashes in subsequent years to be.id.since those numbers represented less than one percent of accidents,and the training program contemplated in the adequacy report was projected to cut accident rates by up to percent,the agency concluded that the reduction in accidents required to justify the rule cost was attainable.id.
after eliciting comments and holding a public meeting,fmcsa announced its final rule in may.in the rule summary,the agency stated this action responds to a study mandated by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of that found the private sector training of drivers in the heavy truck,motorcoach,and school bus industries was inadequate.minimum training requirements.at.the final rule mandates action in the four areas sketched in the notice of proposed rulemaking.fmcsa did not set a minimum number of hours,but suggested that hours of training would be appropriate for heavy truck drivers.at.the new rule defined to cover all drivers with less than one year of experience driving with a cdl.b.
in july,petitioners,advocates for highway and auto safety advocates and the independent drivers association,filed separate petitions for review of fmcsa final rule.petitioner united motorcoach association uma initially filed a petition for reconsideration with fmcsa.it then filed a petition for review with this court,which was dismissed as incurably premature since uma had a petition for reconsideration pending before the agency.after notifying the agency that it was withdrawing its petition for reconsideration,uma filed a new petition for review with this court in december.all three petitions were consolidated for review.
in,congress passed an act to codify without substantive change laws related to transportation and to improve the united states code,stat.oddly,the act seems to repeal a.id,stat.at.neither party mentions this act,and it is hard to know what to make of it.the act was passed in october,approximately eight months after the fhwa fulfilled its mandate under a by transmitting the adequacy report to congress.congress appears to have believed it was repealing only obsolete statutory language relating to the a mandate.see,section repeals section a,c,d,and e of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of to eliminate obsolete provisions.however,beyond the obsolete requirements of a,the remainder of a unequivocally required the agency to take further action,either by issuing a rule on driver training or,if doing so would contravene the public interest,by submitting a further report to congress.id.a.neither party suggests that.repealed the agency obligations beyond those set forth in a.indeed,both sides argued the case as if the disputed statutory provisions remain in full force and effect.
whatever the status of a and for purposes of this opinion,we share the parties evident assumption that it remains seems clear that this court has authority to determine whether fmcsa final rule is arbitrary and capricious under the apa,a.fmcsa,whose chief mission is to ensure highway safety,see b,has the undisputed authority to promulgate regulations responding to the findings of the adequacy report,see id.f authorizing the secretary of transportation to delegate authority to fmcsa.that is precisely what the agency set out to do when it issued its notice of proposed rulemaking.see.at.and the parties do not doubt that the agency final regulations are subject to judicial review under the apa.in other words,for purposes of judicial review,it does not matter whether fmcsa final rule is viewed as an act taken pursuant to a specific duty under istea or an act taken pursuant to the authority granted under the agency organic statute to address matters relating to highway safety.in either case,fmcsa lawfully set out to promulgate regulations that respond to the adequacy report.that is the basis upon which we review the final rule to determine whether it survives judicial scrutiny under the apa standard of review.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a party challenging an agency rulemaking has the burden of showing that the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also city of olmsted falls faa.an agency rule will be found arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
fmcsa driver training rule 
the contested final rule begins with the assurance that it responds to the adequacy report.see minimum training requirements.at.rather than respond to the imperatives laid out in the adequacy report,however,the final rule completely ignores the study emphasis on practical,training.the agency has adopted a rule with little apparent connection to the inadequacies it purports to address.for this reason,it fails review under a.
the record reveals numerous disjunctions between the final rule and the findings of the adequacy report.most glaringly,the final rule inexplicably abandons the recommendations of the model curriculum,despite the adequacy report heavy reliance on those recommendations.the report,in its definition of adequate training,says that the model curriculum was the starting point in defining adequate training for heavy truck drivers,and that it is largely applicable to the motor coach industry.adequacy report at,emphasis added.fmcsa accepted this premise when it announced the rule at issue here.minimum training requirements.at the agency believes that the model curriculum represents the basis for training adequacy.methodologically,the adequacy report is entirely structured around the notion that adequate training is defined in reference to the model curriculum.but the final rule eschews the model curriculum altogether.while the curriculum devotes some attention to the topics covered by the final example,it prescribes five hours of instruction on personal health and safety,and hours of training on hours of service subjects are clearly secondary.model curriculum at,reprinted in.overwhelmingly,the curriculum addresses topics directly related to driving skills,with a heavy emphasis on skills and techniques necessary to safely operate a heavy truck.none of the four areas covered by the final qualification,hours of service,driver wellness,and whistleblower anything to do with operational skills.thus,they fly in the face of the adequacy report recommendations.
a critical facet of the training program developed in the model curriculum is training.indeed,the adequacy report conclusions evince a presumption that any rule instituting mandatory training would contain a substantial training component.early on,the report says that f or a program to be considered adequate it must have training.adequacy report at.the unsurprising assumption underlying this statement is that the best way to enhance safety among truck drivers is to ensure practical but supervised experience handling heavy vehicles.fmcsa final rule flouts this premise.quite clearly,the four topics it embraces do not touch on the operational skills of driving a heavy truck.nothing in the final rule,the administrative record,or even the arguments presented in litigation,suggests any reason to believe that the agency changed course on the basis of evidence that the adequacy report conclusions were faulty.the final rule purported responsiveness to the adequacy report is therefore flatly contradicted.
from a purely economic perspective,the agency disregard of the adequacy report is baffling in light of the evidence in the record.instituting a training regimen along the lines sketched in the model curriculum would,according to the agency own calculations,produce benefits far in excess of costs.as noted earlier,the program estimated cost of between billion to billion would yield a benefit ranging from billion to billion,depending on analytic assumptions.see.the analysis in favor of the final rule,however,lends no support to fmcsa position.in the final rule,fmcsa says practically nothing about the projected benefits.after running through the costs of mandating its program,the agency suggests that,to be,the rule would need to prevent crashes by the drivers affected by its provisions each year,representing approximately a five percent reduction in crash rates.at.but the discussion cites no evidence that the final rule would achieve that goal.
fmcsa final regulatory evaluation,which was issued to explain the new rule,underscores the frailty of fmcsa analysis.in asserting that the new rule will generate a sufficient benefit,fmcsa says a percent reduction in crashes for this group would appear plausible when measured against the estimates of potential crash reduction measured in studies cited in the notice of proposed rulemaking,the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking,and its accompanying regulatory evaluation.regulatory evaluation,final rule,minimum training requirements for commercial motor vehicle operators at,reprinted in.this makes no sense,because the studies to which this statement alludes are those that measured the effect of more substantial training.
thus,from the premise that a particular method of driver training reduces crashes,the agency infers that anything it calls driver training will reduce crashes.this is patently illogical.it is also in direct tension with a specific finding of the adequacy report.to explain the correlation found in some studies between training and increased accident rates,the adequacy report noted that researchers have attributed this tendency to the high variability in training quality,indicating that poor training may give the new driver a false sense of confidence in abilities.i adequacy report at.the agency is wrong to assume that its unstudied training program can piggyback on the demonstrated effectiveness of practical,training,and its blithe assurance that any training is beneficial ignores the documented risks flowing from subpar training programs.
fmcsa efforts to portray the final rule as consistent with the adequacy report are fruitless.for example,at oral argument,agency counsel suggested that the cdl program,when coupled with the training requirements of the final rule,will assure adequate driver training.transcript of proceedings tr.at,advocates for highway auto safety fed.motor carrier safety.in particular,counsel pointed to a section of the adequacy report that states one possible outcome could be a hybrid program,a combination of the training and approaches that embodies the advantages of each.see adequacy report at.but fmcsa invocation of that language misrepresents the discussion of hybrid programs presented in the record.first,as already noted,the term training in the adequacy report did not refer to instruction in any set of subject areas imaginable.it had specific,the kind of training outlined in the model curriculum.and approach certainly did not mean the existing cdl program.rather,under a approach,drivers would be required to pass more comprehensive knowledge and skill tests than are presently required to obtain a commercial drivers license cdl.id.at.the deficiencies of counsel attempt to characterize the agency rule as a hybrid program are readily apparent.whatever role the cdl plays,it is irrelevant to fulfilling the agency mandate under istea.the cdl requirements were well established by the time the adequacy report concluded,unequivocally,that the private sector was not effectively ensuring adequate training.the notion that the final rule responds to the adequacy report because it works in tandem with existing cdl standards is unpersuasive.
fmcsa main strategy in defending the final rule is to suggest that it is the first installment of an incremental program that will fulfill its statutory obligations.this is entirely unconvincing.agencies surely may,in appropriate circumstances,address problems incrementally.see mobil oil exploration producing,united distribution,d.however,in this case,fmcsa has not shown that its action inaugurates a program designed to tackle the concerns of the adequacy report.rather,the final rule points to some irrelevant initiatives which fmcsa characterizes as part of the agency overall effort to improve its driver safety programs.see minimum training requirements.at.none of these programs involves cmv training.the cited initiatives include considering whether to modify the cdl test and whether the test can be administered more identifying the costs and benefits of a graduated license system,an inquiry mandated by another section of istea publishing an interim final rule intended to heighten awareness of safety regulations among motor carriers and administering a grant program,in place since,that provides financial assistance to states in aid of roadside inspections and other enforcement activities designed to improve cmv safety.id.at.these initiatives do not reflect concrete regulatory proposals to address the training problems identified in the adequacy report.indeed,the grant program predates istea and the adequacy report.even on their own terms,two of the initiatives are so speculative that they may come to nothing.the agency has thus presented no reason to believe that these initiatives,in concert with the new rule at issue here,will address the deficiencies identified by the adequacy report.
in short,the record in this case shows that the agency entirely failed to consider important aspects of the cmv training problems before it it largely ignored the evidence in the adequacy report and abandoned the recommendations of the model curriculum without reasonable explanation and it adopted a final rule whose terms have almost nothing to do with an adequate cmv training program.fmcsa simply disregarded the volumes of evidence that extensive,training enhances cmv safety.fmcsa action was thus arbitrary and capricious under a.
uma arguments 
petitioner uma,in addition to endorsing the broad criticisms of the final rule,argues that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing a rule that applied uniformly to the trucking and motor coach industries.according to uma,evidence that the motor coach industry has a superior safety record,coupled with the motor coach industry economic vulnerability,makes uniform treatment unfair and irrational.
fmcsa maintains that three of uma arguments that the industry should be given an opportunity to work with the agency to develop a better training program,that insurance carriers might require training of all drivers rather than just drivers,and that motor coach operators will be exposed to waived because they were not raised before the agency prior to the promulgation of the final rule.uma responds that,in light of sims apfel,d,there can be no waiver.
the agency correctly asserts that,as a general proposition,the applicable case law emphasizes the need for parties seeking judicial review of agency action to raise their issues before the agency during the administrative process in order to preserve those issues for judicial review.see,united states tucker truck lines.simple fairness to those who are engaged in the tasks of administration,and to litigants,requires as a general rule that courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.however,sims indicates that this doctrine does not represent an ironclad rule.and,as a general matter,a party presentation of issues during a rulemaking proceeding is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.see avocados plus veneman,courts presume exhaustion is unless congress states in clear,unequivocal terms that the judiciary is barred from hearing an action until the administrative agency has come to a decision.quoting pension fund benefit plan c stockton tri,emphasis added.
uma relies on sims to argue that it is inappropriate to apply the general principles of issue waiver to administrative rulemaking.sims involved a social security claimant who was denied disability benefits and then requested that the social security appeals council council review her claims.sims,at.after the council denied review,sims filed suit in federal district court.she lost and,on appeal,the fifth circuit held that two of the three arguments she pressed were not reviewable on the merits,because she had not raised them before the council.id.at.the supreme court reversed.the court began its analysis by noting that requirements of administrative issue exhaustion are largely creatures of statute,and that most of the court cases refusing to consider arguments initiated in litigation involved specific statutory directives.id.at.the court noted that when neither statute nor regulation required issue exhaustion,the court has occasionally imposed its own exhaustion hurdle.but in those cases,the administrative context was critical the basis for a judicially imposed requirement is an analogy to the rule that appellate courts will not consider arguments not raised before trial courts.id.at.the application of issue exhaustion depends on the degree to which the analogy to normal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding.id.at.where the parties must present and develop issues,the adjudicative model is apt and issue exhaustion is appropriate.where,by contrast,an administrative proceeding is not adversarial,the reasons for a court to require exhaustion are much weaker.id.at.a plurality in sims pointed out that social security proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial,that they are highly informal,and that many claimants are not represented by attorneys,thus making issue exhaustion inapposite.id.at.
uma contends that,in light of the court holding in sims,fmcsa waiver argument is misplaced.pet r reply br.at rulemakings are classic examples of administrative proceedings.this argument is not unreasonable,because there appears to be no statute or regulation compelling exhaustion in advance of judicial review,and no argument has been made analogizing the agency rulemaking to adjudication.
the difficulty that uma faces,however,is that the case law sims gives little support to its position.for example,in appa
