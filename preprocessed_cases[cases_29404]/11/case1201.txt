scott webb appeals the district court civil bench trial judgment against him for piracy of satellite television signals and modification of equipment used for unauthorized interception and decryption of satellite television signals.based on evidence of webb purchase of satellite television hardware and pirate access devices used to enable the unauthorized reception of television programming,the district court held that webb intercepted the broadcast signal of directv,dtv in violation of a and a.in addition,the district court held that webb use of a pirate access device called an emulator to modify legitimate dtv access cards for the purpose of unauthorized decryption constituted a violation of e.
regarding the violation of e,our court recent decision in directv,huynh,cir,resolved some of the issues raised in this case.huynh held that e does not apply to personal use.since webb was held liable under that statute for modification of equipment which he used himself,the portion of the judgment holding him responsible for one violation of e must be reversed.other violations of that statute alleged by dtv were held by the district court to be barred by the application of a limitations period borrowed from california law.dtv challenges the district court selection and application of that limitations period,but we agree with the district court that the limitations period is appropriately drawn from california law,such that other potential claims against webb for violation of e are barred as untimely.
that leaves the violations of a and a,which webb challenges with several arguments.we hold,among other things,that circumstantial evidence of signal interception can be sufficient,and was sufficient in this case,to sustain the claims,but that possession of multiple pirate devices does not in itself constitute multiple violations of these statutes.
applying those conclusions to this judgment,we affirm in part and reverse in part,and we remand the action to the district court.
background 
dtv is a provider of satellite broadcast programming.unlike cable television providers,which transmit signals through fixed optical fibers or coaxial cables,dtv delivers its signals via satellite directly into its customers homes.customers pay for this service on a subscription or basis.like conventional radio and television broadcasting,dtv signals are broadcast through the air and can be anyone with the proper hardware.thus,dtv encrypts its signals to protect against signal theft.
to receive dtv signals in unscrambled form,an individual must have a hardware system consisting of a satellite dish,a signal processor known as an integrated,and an access card.the access card is a smart card that contains an embedded computer chip and memory,which,when authorized,allows the integrated to process dtv signals for television viewing.the access card is therefore critical to receiving usable signals from dtv.in theory,the other hardware is of little use without an authorized access card because that hardware can not unscramble dtv encrypted signals.in reality,pirate access devices exist that will simulate authorization.by using such a device,a signal pirate can circumvent dtv encryption technology and obtain unpaid access to dtv programming.
in december,scott webb purchased a dtv television hardware system.webb received a pending account at that time,which was legally incapable of decrypting dtv transmissions because its access card was unauthorized pending account activation.webb never activated this account and did not pay dtv for its service.instead,he bought pirate access devices between august,and december.
dtv first learned of webb in may as part of an investigation into internet purveyors of pirate access devices the company filed suit against him on may,alleging numerous acts of signal piracy and pirate access device modification and distribution in violation of a,e,and following a bench trial,the district court found that webb was liable for committing one act of unlawful signal reception in violation of a,acts of signal interception in violation of a,and one act of access card modification in violation of e.the court awarded dtv statutory damages of for webb a violation,for his e violation,and for days at per day of signal interception in violation of a.the court also held that a statute of limitations barred other claims by dtv against webb.the court ordered equitable relief in the form of an injunction prohibiting webb from further violations,and awarded costs and attorneys fees in the amount of.webb moved to amend the findings and the award of damages,or alternatively to receive a new trial,but the court denied this motion.both parties appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.idaho potato comm g t terminal packaging,cir.under the clearly erroneous standard,the district court findings must be upheld unless on review of all the evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.twentieth century fox film entm t,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
a.the statutory framework 
two federal statutes govern television signal piracy the federal communications act of communications act,and the wiretap act.neither act originally addressed television signal piracy,but amendments made to both statutes in the extended their reach to the unauthorized reception or interception of television programming.concerned with the theft of cable service,congress in amended and supplemented the communications act with the cable communications policy act.see,at,reprinted in.the legislation retained original prohibitions without amendment in what became a.congress then added b e to curb the growing practice of individuals taking down satellite delivered programming for private,home viewing by means of privately owned backyard earth stations.at.in,congress again amended the communications act in order to deter piracy practices.see the satellite home viewer act of,stat.these amendments stiffened applicable civil and criminal penalties,expanded civil standing to sue,and added the provision now identified as e,which prohibits the manufacture,sale,modification,and distribution of pirate access devices.ii,at,reprinted in.
the wiretap act underwent a similar evolution.while the statute originally covered just wire and oral communications,congress passed the electronic communications privacy act ecpa in to extend the wiretap act protections to electronic communications.see konop hawaiian airlines,cir citing,stat.unlike the communications act,it appears that congress did not amend the wiretap act with signal piracy specifically in mind.see united states lande,cir noting that nothing in the legislative history of the ecpa indicates particular concern about satellite pay television piracy.nevertheless,since the passage of the ecpa amendments courts have generally held that satellite television transmissions are electronic communications within the meaning of the wiretap act.see directv,pepe,cir united states herring,cir en banc united states v.one macom video cipher ii,cir united states splawn,cir united states shriver,cir united states davis,cir.
the first two statutory sections under which the district court found webb liable were a and a.these sections of the communications act and wiretap act both address satellite television signal piracy.such piracy is illegal.we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that webb violated these sections.
section a of the communications act prohibits the unauthorized receipt and use of radio communications for one own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto.a.that section does not specifically reference satellite communications because,as discussed previously,congress put the prohibitions originally contained in into a without changing the substance of the provision when it amended the communications act in.see satellite sports,eliadis,cir.when the original provision was written,dtv and the business of satellite broadcasting did not exist.still,it is clear from the case law since the amendments that the communications protected by a include satellite television signals.see,sosa directv,cir by using specialized smart card programming equipment,an individual can gain unauthorized access to directv signal,in violation of.satellite sports,at.
section a of the wiretap act also prohibits signal piracy.that section makes it illegal to intercept electronic communications,including satellite television signals.a lande,at acknowledging that a prohibits the unauthorized viewing of satellite pay television.
webb argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the district court finding that he pirated dtv signals in violation of these statutes.he points first to the lack of direct evidence that he intercepted dtv signal and second to his own testimony denying such a violation.even under the clear error standard that applies to findings of fact,he contends,a finding that he intercepted signals can not be sustained.we disagree.
the law does not require direct evidence to support a factual finding.circumstantial evidence may be sufficiently persuasive.signal piracy is by its nature a surreptitious venture and direct evidence of actual interception may understandably be hard to come by.see walker darby,cir direct evidence may not have been available based on the stealthiness of the invasion.internal quotation and citation omitted.for this reason,courts have correctly concluded that direct evidence of signal piracy is not required to prove unlawful interception.see,directv,robson,cir circumstantial evidence can support a finding that a communication was intercepted,even absent direct evidence.walker,at.
evidence that a person possessed a pirate access device,by itself,may not be enough to infer actual interception of a signal.see directv,treworgy,cir finding no private right of action against a person who possesses a device in violation of the wiretap act robson,at nn.collecting cases.these devices may assist in the unauthorized interception of signal,but they are not capable of interception by themselves.
in this case,however,the evidence demonstrated that webb had more than a pirate access device.he possessed everything else he needed to intercept dtv signals.he purchased multiple dtv receivers,but never activated any with dtv.he admittedly kept a dtv hardware system at his house.he purchased not just one or two pirate access devices,but of them.robson,at in which the court was unwilling to infer interception from the mere purchase and possession of two pirate access devices without any evidence of the other dtv components required for interception.he denied unlawful interception of dtv signal,but he failed to explain why else he would buy and possess pirate access devices and unauthorized dtv hardware for several years.the district court was not persuaded by his bare denials,and understandably so.
moreover,there was evidence from dtv customer service records that webb girlfriend called dtv once from his home to complain of a system malfunction.this malfunction black sunday electronic countermeasure ecm,an electronic signal broadcast by dtv to detect and incapacitate unauthorized pirate access cards.it is difficult to avoid the inference that webb girlfriend was accustomed to watching dtv signals on a system enabled for unauthorized reception.
faced with this evidence,the district court did not clearly err in finding that webb engaged in signal piracy.see twentieth century fox film,at.to the contrary,the evidence was compelling.we affirm the district court determination that webb violated a and a.
webb also challenges the number of violations found by the district court.in particular,the court found webb liable for violations of a based on his possession of pirate access devices.on that subject,we agree with webb,though not in a way that significantly affects the outcome of the case.as we have discussed,the mere possession of pirate access devices is insufficient to create an inference of signal interception in violation of a.in order to intercept a signal,a defendant must also possess the hardware needed to capture and process satellite broadcast signals.robson,at.
the district court found that webb had one dtv hardware system in his possession.this system was capable of just one signal interception no matter how many devices webb attached to it.section offers no indication that statutory violations should be counted by the number of devices used to engage in signal interception.e providing expressly that the number of violations is established by the number of devices.similarly,the statute itself suggests that use of a system to intercept a signal multiple times does not constitute a separate violation each time.statutory damages for violation are authorized in b b as the greater of a day for each day of violation or,contemplating a single violation that stretched over many days.whether webb used one or devices to steal dtv signal,his personal use of devices in conjunction with his dtv hardware constituted one violation of a.the same logic should apply to a.
nevertheless,the error here was harmless.the district court found webb liable for only one violation of a and awarded statutory damages of.the amount of statutory damages awarded by the district court under a would be the same if it was based on a single violation,because it was based on counting the number of days webb was in violation,not the number of violations.specifically,the court awarded statutory damages of under b b,based on its finding that webb engaged in signal interception for days.we affirm those awards.
webb challenges the computation,arguing that even if it is assumed he engaged in piracy,the record does not support the district court finding that he engaged in piracy for each of the days.that time period represented the number of days between august,when webb first acquired the equipment necessary for signal piracy,and the first day of his trial on january.the district court found that evidence that webb possessed dtv hardware and a pirate access device as of august,was enough to establish unlawful interception as of that date.we agree.see robson,at see treworgy,at see walker,at.
webb suggests that he could not have intercepted dtv signal after dtv deployed its black sunday ecm in january.webb offered no evidence,however,to prove that the ecm irreparably damaged his equipment.he never discarded or otherwise disposed of his pirate access devices or his dtv hardware.the district court inferred continued piracy from his continued possession of the equipment,and that inference was not clearly erroneous.
webb was charged by dtv and held liable by the district court for more than signal piracy in violation of a and a.he was also found by the district court to be liable for one violation of e,which provides that 
any person who manufactures,assembles,modifies,imports,exports,sells,or distributes any electronic,mechanical,or other device or equipment,knowing or having reason to know that the device or equipment is primarily of assistance in the unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming,or satellite services,or is intended for any other activity prohibited by subsection a of this section,shall be fined not more than for each violation,or imprisoned for not more than years for each violation,or both.
other alleged violations of e were held by the district court to be barred by the statute of limitations applicable to this section,as will be discussed in more detail below.the one violation that was sustained by the district court was based on webb modification of a device for his own personal use.
in directv,huynh,cir,our court held that e does not apply to,meaning persons who employ pirate access devices for their own personal use,rather than for sale or distribution to others.since the one violation found by the district court was for modification of a device webb used himself,the portion of the judgment holding him liable for that one violation of e must be reversed.
statute of limitations 
while the district court held webb liable for violating e,it concluded that he could be held liable for only one violation under that statute for improper modification of access cards for the purpose of decrypting dtv signals because other claimed violations of e did not survive the applicable statute of limitations.dtv challenges the district court decision regarding the limitations period.we consider that argument because some or all of the other alleged violations of e arguably involved ultimate use of the devices by other persons,not by webb himself as an.dtv claims against webb involving ultimate use by other persons would not necessarily be barred by our interpretation of the statute in huynh.we conclude that the district court was correct in its treatment of the statute of limitations,however,such that the other alleged violations by webb are barred.
section does not contain or reference its own statute of limitations.accordingly,the district court borrowed a limitations period from an analogous state law the california piracy act piracy act,code.on,dtv contends that the district court incorrectly applied the piracy act statute of limitations to its claims under.dtv argues instead that the limitations period of the wiretap act,should govern its claims under.
when a federal statute does not have its own statute of limitations,we are directed to borrow a period from the forum state analogous state law as a matter of interstitial fashioning of remedial details under the respective substantive federal statute.delcostello int l of teamsters,d see also wilson garcia,d noting that when congress has not established a time limitation for a federal cause of action,the settled practice has been to adopt a local time limitation,superceded by statute on other grounds,judicial improvements act of,stat,as recognized in jones donnelley sons,d.borrowing is a longstanding and settled practice when federal statutes do not provide for their own limitations periods.north star steel thomas,d quotations and citations omitted.this practice is rooted in the expectations of congress and,as such,constitutes a general rule that may not be lightly abandoned.lampf gilbertson,d.
though borrowing from the forum state law is the general rule,the supreme court has recognized that state limitations periods do not always provide the best vehicles for the enforcement of federal law,and that it may be inappropriate to conclude that congress would choose to adopt state rules at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law.delcostello,at.as such,a court may instead apply a limitations period from analogous federal law when borrowing a state statute of limitations would frustrate or interfere with the implementation of federal law.north star,at.citation omitted.federal law nonetheless is limited to serving as a secondary lender of limitations periods to be used only as a closely circumscribed exception to the general preference for state law.id.quotations omitted.courts must adopt a limitations period from analogous state law unless federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes,and the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.lampf,at.quotations and citation omitted.
as does not have its own limitations period,the district court properly looked first to analogous state law.the district court determined that the california piracy act was most closely analogous to and that policy factors did not support adopting something else.consequently,the district court applied the statute of limitations applicable to violations of the piracy act to dtv claims under.
we agree with the district court that the piracy act offers the proper source for a limitations period here.to start,the california statute is remarkably similar to in purpose and structure.see lampf,at.instructing that commonality of purpose and similarity of elements are relevant when choosing the proper source for a limitations period.
congress originally enacted in,but it substantially expanded the statute in in order to address the theft of cable service.see.at.as we previously noted,the original prohibitions of are now contained in a,which makes it unlawful to receiv e,assist in receiving,transmit,or assist in transmitting,any interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio without authorization.a.section also prohibits divulg ing or publish ing information gleaned from unauthorized signal reception,or otherwise using that information for one own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto.id.the statute provides for criminal penalties and a civil cause of action in e,and,as discussed above,prohibits the manufacture,assembl y,modifi cation,import,export,s ale,or distribut ion of pirate access devices in e.
like,the piracy act prohibits the unauthorized reception of cable services.see people prevost,th,d holding that the clear purpose of the piracy act is to deter the theft of cable.section of the piracy act prohibits the unauthorized receipt of any program or other service carried by a multichannel video or information services provider by means of specifically forbidden conduct code a a.the statute also forbids a litany of conduct related to pirate access devices in b,providing that any person who knowingly and willfully manufactures,assembles,modifies,imports into this state,distributes,sells,offers to sell,advertises for sale,or possesses the devices is guilty of a public offense.and,in,the act extends to subscription television providers essentially the same protections given by to providers of multichannel video or information services.
in sum,the piracy act runs entirely parallel to.both the federal and state statutes recognize the property interest inherent in satellite broadcast transmissions and treat the unauthorized receipt of television signals as theft.see a code a.both statutes prohibit the manufacture,modification,and distribution of decryption devices.see e code b.both prohibit unauthorized signal transmission as well as reception see a code c.finally,the two statutes have similar remedial structures.prostar massachi,cir describing this factor as relevant for the borrowing of a limitations period.
the piracy act and are so similar that the california courts have expressly characterized the piracy act as a analogue to.in prevost,for example,the california court of appeal stated 
t he clear purpose of the piracy act is to deter the theft of cable by requiring the customers who receive cable transmissions and the entities who distribute equipment to receive those transmissions to obtain authorization from the cable operator.the federal law achieves that aim in while the state achieves it in the piracy act.
th at,d see also people patton,d supp.dep t super.we find that piracy act is a state law which attempts to regulate the same subject as.
dtv also argues that the piracy act can not provide a statute of limitations for because it does not contain its own limitations period but merely incorporates the catchall limitations period of.while the supreme court has rejected the borrowing of a catchall statute of limitations,this means only that a catchall limitations period is not itself substantively analogous.see,agency holding,d hereinafter rejecting the borrowing of a pennsylvania catchall period because this period was not analogous to the federal rico claim at issue.unlike the catchall pennsylvania limitations period in,the piracy act is substantively parallel to.the fact that the statute derives its limitations period from is irrelevant.
despite the clear similarities between the piracy act and,dtv argues that the wiretap act offers a closer analogue to and should provide the statute of limitations for its claims.the wiretap act,creates a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of wiretapping and electronic surveillance.gelbard united states,d.it authorizes the electronic surveillance by law enforcement under stringent conditions,but flatly prohibits u nauthorized interceptions and the disclosure or use of information obtained through unauthorized interceptions.id.
most relevant here are and of the wiretap act.section prohibits the intentional interception of electronic communications and the use
