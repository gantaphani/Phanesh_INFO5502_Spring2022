sprint spectrum,does not dispute that it breached its contract with its former bill collector,penncro associates.still,it offers two reasons why,in its view,the district court judgment for penncro in excess of million should be reversed.first,sprint argues that the parties agreement precludes the sort of damages penncro seeks.in their contract,the parties agreed to forego consequential damages,and sprint urges us to find that the term,as defined by the parties agreement,includes any and all lost profits whether flowing directly or consequentially from sprint breach.because all of penncro claimed damages are lost profits,sprint argues the district court judgment is fatally flawed.secondly,and alternatively,sprint contends that penncro damages should be calculated on the basis of the work it was ready and able to perform,rather than on the basis of a fixed monthly fee,as the district court found.for its part,penncro,arguing that it is entitled to an additional million in damages.penncro submits that the district court erred when it found that the company was able,by taking on new work after sprint breach,to avoid losses in this amount.
we affirm the district court on all three questions presented to us.while parties to a contract may define their terms as they duck may be a see no evidence that sprint and penncro definition of the term consequential damages was designed to embrace and thus foreclose the award of profits lost as a direct result of sprint breach.likewise,the plain and unambiguous language of the parties agreement obliged penncro to provide sprint with a fixed amount of available labor capacity,and required sprint to pay for that capacity,whether utilized or not.finally,we see no clear error in the district court finding that penncro managed to avoid a modicum of the losses that sprint breach imposed.
originally,sprint,a national telecommunications company,handled for itself the task of trying to collect from its cell phone customers behind on their monthly bills.beginning in april,however,it decided to outsource,contracting first with penncro and subsequently with two additional vendors to assume the job.under the terms of the parties agreements,customers with overdue sprint accounts trying to make outgoing calls were automatically routed to centers run by one of the three vendors,based on which one had the shortest estimated wait time.penncro employees introduced themselves as sprint agents,informed callers that their accounts were past due,and attempted to collect monies owed to service known as inbound collections work 
the nature of the parties agreement was spelled out in four interrelated documents a master services agreement msa a contract order an attachment to the contract order attachment a and an addendum to attachment 
the msa contained certain generic terms and conditions sprint employed with all vendors.it obligated neither party to perform and expressly indicated that the scope and specific terms of the services provided would be governed by contract orders.msa.
the contract order was just such a document,involving only sprint and penncro,and detailing the particular services,staffing levels,and compensation rates attending to the parties relationship.under the terms of the contract order,penncro agreed,among other things,to maintain staffing levels sufficient to provide sprint with productive hours per month.contract order c.a productive hour was defined as time spent by a fully trained penncro employee handling calls,waiting for calls,training,or waiting due to system downtime.id.b.this amounted,more or less,to an agreement to maintain approximately call center employees at sprint disposal in exchange,sprint agreed to pay for productive hours per month at a rate of per hour less for training hours,more for overtime hours.id.b,
the parties agreement anticipated a commitment at these levels of service,but also anticipated that the number of productive hours could vary according to certain terms specified in attachment a.in attachment a,the parties set forth various performance metrics on which penncro and other vendors were evaluated.poor performance for three consecutive months could result in a reduction of the number of productive hours requested by.attachment a at.six months of consecutive poor performance entitled sprint to terminate the contract for cause.contract order d msa.
sprint emailed the addendum to attachment a to penncro in september,several months into the parties relationship.a cover email outlined a number of changes to the parties incentive program effected by the addendum,and the document was included as an email attachment.one change not outlined in the cover email,but made in the addendum,was the removal of the word guaranteed before the reference to the number of productive hours outlined in section c of the contract is,the number of call center hours that penncro promised to supply and for which sprint promised to pay 
the presence or removal of the word guaranteed does not seem to have had much bearing on the parties performance,which was fraught with difficulty.penncro endured considerable staffing problems and was for many months unable to retain sufficient employees to provide the number of productive hours required by the parties contract.the hours penncro did provide,moreover,were of sufficiently poor quality to rank penncro last among sprint three vendors in several for a number of months.sprint,meanwhile,did not experience the call volume it had anticipated and so never called on penncro to provide the number of productive hours.from the beginning,sprint and penncro discussed the actual number of hours that sprint needed and penncro could provide,agreeing,for the time being,to have penncro bill and sprint pay only for the hours that penncro actually supplied.at no time did the total hours supplied,billed,or paid for reach the hours for which the parties had contracted.according to penncro ceo,this arrangement was party complained or took action under the both parties had difficulties performing,the contract was in its early stages,and the parties fully expected to meet their obligations over the contract term.in september,sprint emailed penncro to announce a unilateral reduction in the number of ftes and therefore productive hours due to lower than expected call volume.penncro voiced no objection.
as call volumes and the hours necessary to handle them waned,sprint gave notice of its intent to terminate penncro inbound collections contract by letter dated january.the parties then entered a period during which the number of ftes requested of penncro was incrementally reduced.the reason sprint gave for its action was that penncro was in third place or below in six agreed performance measures for the six months from july through december event entitling sprint to terminate the parties relationship for cause under section d of the contract order.
as the parties were ramping down,and in spite of their prior performance problems,sprint and penncro entered into a new contract order for a different but related outbound collections work see supra note.sprint asserted that it would not have given this new work to penncro if penncro was still performing under the parties initial,inbound contract,as sprint did not think penncro capable of handling both tasks.penncro also entered into two other contracts for outbound collections work during the same,one with at t and another with a utility company,american water.
in november,penncro sued sprint for breach of the parties inbound collections contract in federal district court,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction.penncro claimed that sprint was liable for breach of contract as a matter of law because sprint stated reason for termination was erroneous penncro was not in last place for the full six consecutive months necessary to justify termination under the parties contract.the district court agreed and entered summary judgment for penncro on the question of liability.
for its part,sprint itself chose to pitch its battle primarily on the field of damages and a trial on damages followed,after which the district court issued a detailed ruling.during trial,sprint pointed to section of the msa,which rules out the award of consequential damages and proceeds to define the term as includ ing,but not limited to,lost profits,lost revenues and lost business opportunities.this language,sprint submitted,prohibited either party from obtaining recovery of any and all lost profits.the district court disagreed,holding that the msa forbids only consequential or indirect damages that are beyond direct economic loss or ordinary loss of bargain damages,thereby doing nothing to rule out of bounds lost profits suffered as a direct consequence of sprint breach.
as a fallback argument,sprint contended that any award of lost profits should be limited to the hours that penncro employees actually worked or could have worked.again the district court disagreed,holding that,in spite of the difficulties that both sides had in living up to their obligations under the contract,sprint agreement constituted an unambiguous and unqualified promise to pay for productive hours per month without regard to whether it actually called upon penncro to provide those hours.
based on these holdings,the district court awarded penncro in expectation damages in lost contractual revenues lost profits,minus in costs avoided by not having to perform and in losses avoided due to the breach.penncro contested many of these reductions,especially those concerning avoided losses.the district court found that,solely because of sprint termination which freed up capacity,penncro was able to mitigate its losses by taking on new work for sprint the outbound collections contract,at t,and american water.penncro disputed the court assessment,arguing that it easily could have handled the new work as well as sprint existing inbound collection work.
both parties appeal.we turn first to sprint appeal and then penncro.
the proper construction of a contract is a question of law we review de novo.see in re villa west,cir liggatt employers mut.cas.under kansas law,which the parties agree controls this dispute,see msa,a contract is ambiguous if reading its plain language yields doubtful or conflicting meanings.liggatt,at.however,ambiguity will only be found where the meaning is genuinely uncertain,and even then not until the language has been given a reasonable and practical construction in light of the contract as a whole.decatur county feed yard,fahey.in determining whether or not a contractual ambiguity exists,moreover,we are obliged under kansas law to confine ourselves to the four corners of the contract.see decatur county feed yard,at city of wichita sw.bell,cir.only after finding the presence of a contractual ambiguity may we look to extrinsic the parties course of construe the documents.sw.bell,at farrell motors.it is with these standards fixed in mind that we approach the parties competing contentions.
sprint begins its appeal by renewing its argument that penncro impermissibly seeks lost profits.section of the msa forbids the recovery of consequential damages,specifying that they include,but are not limited to,lost profits,lost revenues and lost business opportunities.in sprint parlance,this means that any lost profits are forbidden consequential damages.for several reasons,we are persuaded that sprint interpretation is foreclosed by the unambiguous language of the msa.
section syntax alone propels us in this direction.the parties language is not unlike a doctor prescription that you really should not eat fried this includes,but is not limited to,meat and potatoes.ordinary usage and common experience does not suggest that the patient should avoid all meat and potatoes,but only those that are parts or components of the initial,larger group of fried foods say,chicken fried steak and french fries.the dictionary underscores the point.webster defines the term to include as meaning to place,list,or rate as a part or component of a whole or of a larger group,class,or aggregate.webster third new international dictionary.the more general term informs the subsequently listed examples,not the other way around,and so lost profits here refer only to those that are a part or component of the larger group or class of consequential damages.
the common legal meaning of the terms involved confirms this reading.direct damages refer to those which the party lost from the contract other words,the benefit of the consequential damages refer to economic harm beyond the immediate scope of the contract lost profits,under appropriate circumstances,can be recoverable as a component of either and both direct and consequential damages thus,for example,if a services contract is breached and the plaintiff anticipated a profit under the contract,those profits would be recoverable as a component of direct,benefit of the bargain damages.if that same breach had the effect of causing the plaintiff to close its doors,precluding it from performing other work for which it had contracted and from which it expected to make a profit,those lost profits might be recovered as consequential to the breach.all of this is by way of saying that,under the circumstances we face here,a reading of section informed by the normal legal meaning of its terms suggests that it bars only the recovery of consequential lost profits,not direct lost profits.section says that no consequential damages are recoverable,includ ing lost profits it simply does not speak to direct damages,or to lost profits recoverable under such a theory.
a review of section of the msa further strengthens our confidence about the parties meaning in section.in section,sprint obligated penncro to indemnify spring against all claims,damages,losses,liabilities,costs,expenses,and reasonable attorney fees arising from claims by third parties for work performed by penncro.msa.by using the phrase all damages,the parties manifested a clear intent to insulate sprint from any damages,direct or indirect,claimed by third parties.when it came to insulating sprint from liability to penncro itself,however,the parties in the very next section precluded recovery only of the class of damages that are consequential or indirect.id.when a contract uses different language in proximate and similar provisions,we commonly understand the provisions to illuminate one another and assume that the parties use of different language was intended to convey different meanings.see decatur county feed yard,at before finding ambiguity,court must view contested language in light of the contract as a whole sosa,d w hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended.internal quotation and citation omitted rogers shanahan,presuming that the legislature intended a different meaning when it used different language in different parts of a statute.
finally,our understanding of the parties chosen language comports with how kansas courts have interpreted similar terms.in brennan kunzle,d,for example,a mortgage allowed the plaintiffs to recover expenses incurred to enforce the agreement,including,but not limited to,reasonable attorneys fees.the court held that this formulation authorized the recovery only of those attorneys fees incurred in pursuing remedies under the mortgage and simply did not speak,one way or the other,to other attorney fees,such as those incurred in defending counterclaims.the same logic applies here section is all about consequential lost profits and does not tell us anything,one way or the other,about direct lost profits.dikeman educators,cir allowing,in a statute where examples of a general term were listed,that the more general term limits the scope of the examples 
sprint responds by observing that parties are free to diverge from linguistic and legal norms and to define terms in their contracts as they see fit.this,sprint contends,is what the parties did here,defining consequential damages,to encompass any lost profits,including those normally thought to derive directly from a party breach.and,to be sure,parties to a contract are free to define their terms in any manner they wish.up may be defined as down,right as left,day as night.but,while the parties may depart from the meanings associated with ordinary english and existing law,courts will recognize and give effect to such private definitions only where the parties intention to deviate from common usage is manifest.see corbin on contracts restatement second of contracts a.that is,we are reluctant to shed ordinary meanings and presume unusual private ones without some clear indication that the parties wished us to do so.here,we are directed to no textual indicia that the parties intended such a departure.neither do we find sprint proffered authority of much help to its cause.in many of the cases sprint cites,lost profits were not,as here,placed in an illustrative list of the sorts of consequential damages excluded instead,they were singled out as a separate and distinct category of forbidden damages sprint own authority thus illustrates how parties easily can manifest an intent to preclude lost profits of any stripe and highlights how section,by contrast,simply failed to do so 
even if penncro is entitled to direct lost profits,sprint submits that it is not obliged under the parties agreement to pay for productive hours per month when penncro never provided or was able to provide that amount of labor.at the very least,sprint urges us to find ambiguity in the contract on this point so that we might step outside the four corners of the document and examine extrinsic evidence,including the parties course of conduct during the contract start up period when they agreed to provide and pay for fewer hours of work.
penncro responds that,while its willingness or ability to perform was an element of liability,liability is not contested and performance is irrelevant to the assessment of damages because the contract language unambiguously requires sprint to pay for productive hours per month.we are constrained to agree.
the relevant contract language provides flatly that penncro agrees to maintain staffing levels and that sprint agrees to pay for productive hours per month.contract order sprint obligation to pay thus is not conditioned in any way on how many hours penncro was actually able to provide.instead,the parties entered into a bilateral contract in which penncro promised to provide sprint with,and sprint promised to pay penncro for,a fixed amount of labor.see,heller martin,d,in a classic bilateral contract,each party promises future performance in consideration for the other promise of future performance.people exchange bank of elmdale miller.
we acknowledge the apparent at first blush,at least inequity of this reading,as it affords penncro damages for services it never rendered,and was unable to render.but a somewhat gentler light is shone on our interpretation when one recognizes that the parties contract was one for capacity.penncro agreed to maintain staffing levels at productive hours,and a productive hour includes time spent waiting for calls.contract order b,neither penncro obligation nor its compensation was dependant on the number of calls,if any,that sprint actually routed to penncro.in return,sprint agreed to pay for this set amount of call center capacity,whether or not penncro phones were ringing.contract order 
the terms of the parties incentive program,in attachment a,confirm the point.as structured,the capacity hours agreed to by the parties could be changed only in the event of poor in no event by more than twenty percent.by contrast,under sprint reading of the parties agreement,sprint could reduce or,presumably increase the number of hours it sought from penncro simply by making a phone call at the beginning of the month.such a reading would make the agreement to reduce capacity only in the event of poor performance,and even then only by twenty percent,surplusage.indeed,the entire incentive program would be meaningless if hours were merely a forecast of the parties future than a binding capacity commitment on both sprint could alter at its whim.
sprint replies with three arguments.first,it stresses penncro demonstrated inability to provide all the hours envisioned by the contract and the parties agreement to proceed in several months on different terms.but,having found the promise to pay for hours of capacity to be unambiguous in the language of the contract itself,we are precluded by kansas law from entertaining sprint extrinsic evidence concerning the parties course of conduct.farrell,at.of course,not every state is so restrictive on this score,see generally farnsworth on contracts,but the parties deliberately contracted for application of kansas law.furthermore,the msa explicitly prohibits modification of the contract terms except in writing,msa,so the parties themselves specifically agreed that there could be no modification of their obligations through the course of performance.riley state bank of riley spillman,holding that,where a clause required waiver to be in writing,course of conduct could not give rise to waiver.
of course,sprint arguments about penncro failure to perform its end of the bargain could well have offered a good basis for contesting liability.see,fusion.aluminum castings,discussing plaintiff material breach proffered as a defense to a breach of contract claim.but sprint long ago made the tactical decision not to contest liability on this or any other as mutual breach,anticipatory breach,mistake,fraud,or material its decision to hang its hat at trial solely on the nature and quantum of penncro damages can not be reconsidered on appeal.see cortez stores,cir wilson muckala,cir see also hill kemp,cir.
second,recognizing the weakness of its appeal to extrinsic evidence,sprint argues that its obligation to pay only for hours that penncro actually worked is manifest in the parties agreement itself,pointing us to section of the msa.section indicates that t he execution of a contract order is penncro agreement to provide and sprint agreement to accept and pay for services and deliverables in accordance with this agreement and the applicable contract order rather than support sprint position,however,this section merely confirms,as we have already indicated,that the msa did not obligate either party to supply or purchase services,deferring the nature of the parties possible future obligations to the contract order.as the document itself explains,sprint has no obligation to accept and pay for services or deliverables that are not set forth in an executed contract order.msa see also supra part and the contract order unambiguously reflects sprint promise to pay for productive hours.
third,sprint argues that the addendum to attachment a,which removed the term guaranteed before the words productive hours outlined in section c of the contract order from attachment a,commands its construction.specifically,sprint argues that the removal of the word guaranteed shows that,under the agreement in effect at the time of the breach,the number of productive hours were not,if they ever were,guaranteed by sprint.
for its part,the district court refused to credit the removal of guaranteed.the court noted that sprint made this change unilaterally,sending the addendum as an email attachment to penncro,and without even noting the alteration in its cover email which,notably,highlighted other changes.see supra part.but even assuming that the addendum effectively modified attachment a to remove the word guaranteed,the presence or absence of the word is immaterial to our conclusion that sprint promised to pay for hours of call center capacity.attachment a,whether or not modified by the addendum,merely sets out the details of the incentive plan sprint used to evaluate its vendors.under its terms,vendors can be rewarded for good performance by monetary bonuses,and they can be punished for poor performance by a reduction in productive hours.the performance plan,however,simply does not speak to the critical question before,the nature of the productive hours agreed to by the parties for alteration under attachment a incentive plan.put plainly,was productive hours,merely a forecast of demand or was it a fixed amount of labor capacity attachment a is mute on this dispositive question.instead,it merely points the reader back to
