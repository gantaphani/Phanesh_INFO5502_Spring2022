the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,finding,inter alia,that halicki lacked standing to bring her claims for copyright infringement,trademark infringement,unfair competition,and declaratory relief because she had no rights in remake eleanor,having transferred those rights pursuant to the agreement.

iii.discussion 
halicki reserved the merchandising rights to remake eleanor 
under copyright law,only copyright owners and exclusive licensees of copyright may enforce a copyright or a license.sybersound records,uav,cir citing b conferring standing only to the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right who is entitled to institute an action for any infringement while he or she is the owner of it internal quotation marks omitted.
halicki primary argument is that paragraph b of the agreement,which grants her the right to manufacture,sell and distribute merchandise utilizing the car known as eleanor from the original gss,should be read to grant her rights to manufacture,sell,and distribute merchandise utilizing the remake eleanor as well as the original eleanor.halicki claims that reading paragraph b as reserving her rights related to the remake eleanor is supported by the language in the agreement itself extrinsic evidence that the district court was required to consider by california law and the parties conduct subsequent to the release of the remake gss.because the district court rulings were based in large part on a contrary interpretation of the,pursuant to the agreement,halicki transferred her rights to remake eleanor and therefore lacks standing to assert her interpretation of paragraph b of the agreement is the core issue in this case.
the meaning of paragraph b must be determined by reading it in the context of the entire agreement.moreover,the extrinsic evidence presented by halicki must be considered in aid of the interpretation of the contract.reading paragraph b in its context,and examining the extrinsic evidence,we conclude that the district court erred in its interpretation of paragraph b of the agreement.we agree with halicki that paragraph b reserves to her the merchandising rights to remake eleanor.
the agreement 
halicki claims that the plain language of the agreement supports reservation of her rights to the remake eleanor.after examining halicki arguments with respect to the language in the agreement itself,we conclude that the agreement is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation she urges.asp properties group fard,th,d.at the same time,the agreement language does not command halicki interpretation.as a result of this ambiguity,we may properly examine extrinsic evidence to determine a definitive interpretation.see id.we consider the agreement language in this section,and the extrinsic evidence in the ensuing section.see part,infra.
first,halicki argues that paragraph b speaks of the car known as eleanor from the original gss emphasis supplied by halicki.we agree that the use of the word from lends weight to halicki proposed interpretation of paragraph b.indeed from can be defined as a function word to indicate the source or original or moving force of something as the source,cause,means,or ultimate agent of an action or condition.webster third new international dictionary.this implies that eleanor in another as a sequel or a remake of still eleanor from the original gss and is therefore encompassed by paragraph b.
halicki next asserts that while paragraph a speaks of rights to continue to distribute and exhibit the original gss,paragraph b speaks of the right to manufacture,sell and distribute,not to continue to do so if paragraph b was meant to refer only to the original eleanor,halicki contends,it would have granted a right to continue to manufacture,sell and distribute merchandise depicting the character eleanor.we agree that the description of the reserved rights in paragraph a as the right to continue to distribute and exhibit original opposed to the right in paragraph b to manufacture,sell,and distribute merchandise related to original support to halicki proposed interpretation of paragraph b.
halicki next urges us to examine the interaction between paragraphs and b.under paragraph,halicki granted to hpc 
all right,title,and interest of every kind and nature to sequels to remakes of the property,including without limitation the following 
j.the right to manufacture,sell,furnish,supply and distribute products,services,facilities,merchandise and commodities of every nature and description which make reference to or are based upon or adopted from the property,including,the characters,subject to paragraph.
paragraph b reserves to halicki t he right to manufacture,sell and distribute merchandise utilizing the car known as eleanor from the original gss.we agree with halicki that these two provisions,when read together,are at least capable of supporting her proposed interpretation of the agreement,even if they do not command it.according to halicki,paragraph j provided hpc with merchandising rights only for products related to a remake of or sequel to the original film.this reading is consistent with the language from paragraph introductory paragraph which grants hpc the rights only to sequels to remakes of the property.if we accept halicki view that paragraph granted hpc merchandising rights only to remake gss,then paragraph b would be completely superfluous unless,as halicki suggests,it was intended to reserve her rights to produce merchandise related to remake eleanor.after all,if halicki retained all of the merchandising rights to the original gss,there would be no reason for her to protect specifically her right to manufacture,sell and distribute merchandise utilizing the original eleanor in paragraph b.because we conclude that the introductory portion of paragraph renders halicki interpretation of the rights granted in paragraph j reasonable,the inclusion of paragraph b in the contract supports halicki argument that she and hpc intended that she retain the rights to remake eleanor.
in a related argument,halicki contends that paragraph,which grants her merchandising royalties in all products sold by hpc in connection with picture or property,other than the car from the original picture known as eleanor,likewise supports her interpretation of the agreement.again,if halicki view that the parties intended paragraph to grant hpc only the rights to remake gss merchandise and not to original gss or original eleanor merchandise is we hold that it would be no need to reference the car from the original picture known as eleanor in paragraph unless that language referred to remake eleanor.thus,paragraph,read in light of halicki reasonable interpretation of paragraph,also supports the interpretation of the contract which would reserve to halicki the rights to remake eleanor.
accordingly,the plain language of the agreement permits an interpretation of paragraph b as reserving halicki merchandising rights in remake eleanor as well as original eleanor.
the extrinsic evidence 
in her opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment,halicki submitted declarations of two of her attorneys,kirk hallam and eric weissmann,each of whom had participated in the negotiations leading up to the agreement.each declarant stated that halicki and her attorneys made it clear to that she was to retain all rights to eleanor in the remake as well as the original gss and accepted that term and intended the agreement to reflect the reservation of halicki rights in the character eleanor.moreover,hallam declared that the drafts of the agreement and related notes reflected this understanding.in her opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment,halicki also submitted a declaration stating that she had made it clear to hpc that her retention of the merchandising rights to eleanor was a deal point.
in her motion to reconsider the district court decision,halicki claimed that the district court did not consider the hallam,weissmann,and halicki declarations in its summary judgment.after filing the motion for reconsideration,halicki submitted an acknowledgment and agreement between hpc and halicki in further support of her motion,which stated that hpc hereby acknowledges that as between it and halicki,halicki retained the merchandising rights to that certain car called eleanor as such car appears in the remake gss the acknowledgment and agreement accompanied the declaration of attorney jeffrey kravitz,which stated that halicki attorneys had been trying for nine months to secure such an agreement in writing from hpc and had only been successful once hpc learned of the district court summary judgment.
on april,the district court denied halicki motion to reconsider its summary judgment.the district court stated as memorialized in the civil minutes that it had considered the weissmann and hallam declarations in deciding the summary judgment motion but that it had determined that the evidence presented therein did not yield to a contractual interpretation to which the agreement is reasonably susceptible.the district court did not mention the halicki declaration either in its summary judgment or in its decision on the motion for reconsideration.the district court also did not mention the acknowledgment and agreement,which had been submitted on january.
where parties dispute the meaning of contractual language,the first question to be decided is whether the disputed language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party.if it is not,the case is over.people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco,th,d.when deciding this question,
the trial court must provisionally receive any proffered extrinsic evidence which is relevant to show whether the contract is reasonably susceptible of a particular meaning i t is reversible error for a trial court to refuse to consider such extrinsic evidence on the basis of the trial court own conclusion that the language of the contract appears to be clear and unambiguous on its face.
morey vannucci,th,d,citations omitted.although extrinsic evidence is generally prohibited to vary,alter or add to terms of a contract,id.at,t he test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face,but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible,pacific gas,at.if in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in interpreting the contract.asp properties group,d at internal quotation marks omitted.
in its decision denying halicki motion to reconsider,the district court addressed the hallam and weissmann declarations,but it did not even mention the halicki declaration or the acknowledgment and agreement.lacking any indication that the court considered these documents although specifically asked to do so and although mentioning others,we assume it did not consider the documents not mentioned.the court erred in failing to consider this evidence.these items supported halicki claim of a demand of all rights to eleanor and of hpc intended acquiescence in that demand.the court further erred in concluding that the language in the agreement was not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation advanced by halicki in light of the declarations and the acknowledgment and agreement.the court was required to use the extrinsic evidence to aid in its interpretation of the contract.see asp properties group,d at.
reading the agreement as a whole along with the extrinsic evidence,paragraph b is reasonably susceptible to halicki interpretation.halicki submitted three of her own and two from her that the reservation of rights in eleanor was a term and that understood and agreed to this.moreover,had nothing to gain by doing the acknowledgment and agreement,making clear that it was its intention that the rights to remake eleanor be reserved to halicki.this is not the more usual situation where parties to an agreement disagree as to the meaning of its terms.here,statements by both parties to the declarations of halicki and her attorneys and the acknowledgment and agreement executed by that each party had the same intention as to the meaning of paragraph b having concluded that the contract,when read in light of the extrinsic evidence,is susceptible to halicki interpretation,we must now consider whether that interpretation is in fact the correct one.here,the extrinsic evidence unequivocally supports halicki interpretation.accordingly,we can only conclude that paragraph b reserves to halicki the rights to remake eleanor as well as original eleanor 
whether the eleanor character is entitled to copyright protection 
the defendants assert on appeal that the eleanor character does not qualify for copyright protection.
this court has stated that where a character is only the chessman in the game of telling the story he is not within the area of the protection afforded by the copyright.warner.pictures,columbia broad,cir.warner held that a character could only be granted copyright protection if it constituted the story being told.id.the defendants rely on this strict standard,arguing that eleanor is not the story being told but is simply a car.in deciding that dashiel hammet sam spade character did not qualify for copyright protection,warner reasoned that literary characters are difficult to delineate and may be based on nothing more than an unprotected idea.see walt disney prods.air pirates,cir.air pirates,however,distinguished cartoon characters from literary characters,reasoning that comic book characters have physical as well as conceptual qualities,and are more likely to contain some unique elements of expression.at.
this court has also recognized copyright protection for characters that are especially distinctive,see olson broad,cir,and has noted,consistent with air pirates,that copyright protection may be afforded to characters visually depicted in a television series or a movie,olson,at citing silverman cbs.characters that have received copyright protection have displayed consistent,widely identifiable traits.rice fox broad,cir citing toho,william morrow,d,recognizing copyright protection for godzilla,am.honda motor,recognizing copyright protection for james bond anderson stallone,wl,recognizing copyright protection for rocky balboa.the defendants argue that,to the extent eleanor can be regarded as a character,it is not sufficiently distinctive and therefore not deserving of copyright protection.
the district court did not directly examine the question of whether eleanor is a character deserving of copyright protection.the court therefore never addressed the question of what the appropriate standard is for making such a determination.in examining the question whether remake eleanor was a derivative of original eleanor,however,the district court implied that eleanor is deserving of copyright court stated that,i f the remake eleanor is deemed a derivative work of the original eleanor,plaintiffs,as the author of the original eleanor,would also have the exclusive right to the remake eleanor.halicki,wl,at citing a.
the eleanor character can be seen as more akin to a comic book character than a literary character.moreover,eleanor display s consistent,widely identifiable traits,see rice,at,and is especially distinctive,see olson,at.in both films,the thefts of the other cars go largely as planned,but whenever the main human character tries to steal eleanor,circumstances invariably become complicated.in the original gss,the main character says i getting tired of stealing this eleanor car.and in the remake gss,the main character refers to his history with eleanor.nevertheless,this issue must be remanded to the district court for a finding in the first instance as to whether eleanor is entitled to copyright protection.on remand the court should examine whether eleanor physical as well as conceptual qualities and unique elements of expression qualify eleanor for copyright protection.see air pirates,at.
halicki trademark claims 
the district court held that halicki lacked standing to sue for common law infringement of either the eleanor or gone in seconds trademarks.we can not agree.with respect to the eleanor mark,the district court failure to evaluate halicki contentions that she acquired an ownership interest in the mark through prior use and that she had a cognizable commercial interest in the mark renders the court standing analysis fatally incomplete.we therefore reverse the district court decision and remand for further consideration.we likewise reverse the district court ruling that halicki lacked standing to sue for infringement of the gone in seconds mark.as the court acknowledged,halicki is the registered owner of the gone in seconds mark for two product classes,toy model cars and toy model car kits and baseball caps.a valid ownership interest in a mark for any product class is sufficient,although not necessary,to provide standing to sue for infringement of that mark.see,a.we therefore hold that halicki has standing to sue for infringement of the gone in seconds mark.
standing requirements for a trademark infringement claim 
to establish standing to sue for trademark infringement under the lanham act,a plaintiff must show that he or she is either the owner of a federal mark registration,the owner of an unregistered mark,or a nonowner with a cognizable interest in the allegedly infringed trademark see,a thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed noting that standing to sue for trademark infringement under the lanham act extends to owners of registered and unregistered marks,and nonowners with a protectable interest in the mark see also licensing ass n,llc inland joseph fruit,d,t o maintain a claim under a,the plaintiff must show that it has a commercial interest in the allegedly misused mark that is likely to be damaged.citing waits,cir.
the eleanor mark 
the district court found that halicki lacked standing to bring her trademark claims based on the eleanor mark solely because she had not proffered evidence that she was the registered owner of the mark.in addition,the court noted that the defendant carroll hall shelby trust had produced evidence that it was the registered owner of the mark for vehicles,namely,automobiles,engines for automobiles,and structural parts of automobiles.halicki,wl,at.
the district court analysis suffers from a fundamental flaw.halicki does not argue that she has standing to sue for infringement of the eleanor mark as a registered owner of the mark.rather,halicki asserts standing on other grounds.
first,she maintains that she has acquired ownership of the eleanor trademark through prior use.in other words,halicki is asserting her rights as the owner of an unregistered trademark.it is axiomatic in trademark law that the standard test of ownership is priority of use i t is not enough to have invented the mark first or even to have registered it first the party claiming ownership must have been the first to actually use the mark in the sale of goods or services.sengoku works rmc int l,cir.accordingly,ownership of an unregistered trademark,like ownership of a registered mark,is sufficient to establish standing under the lanham act.see mccarthy,trademarks and unfair competition,supra,at.
whether halicki has acquired ownership of the eleanor mark through prior use in commerce is a inquiry that requires the district court to evaluate the totality of the circumstances of halicki case see chance teletrac,cir providing a list of five factors for the district court to consider.in this case,the district court failed even to acknowledge halicki prior use arguments,let alone evaluate whether her activities were sufficient to establish ownership of the eleanor mark.we therefore reverse the district court finding that halicki lacks standing to assert a trademark infringement claim based on the eleanor mark and remand for a determination of whether her prior actions were sufficient to establish ownership of the mark.if so,halicki has standing to bring an infringement claim 
halicki further asserts that,in the event the district court concludes that she did not acquire ownership of the eleanor mark through prior use,she nonetheless has standing because her royalty interest in the sale of remake gss products provides her with a commercial interest in the eleanor mark.she makes this argument on the assumption that we have not reversed the district court finding that she does not own the merchandising rights to the remake eleanor.because we have reversed that finding,however,halicki argument must now be that her ownership interest in the merchandising rights to the remake eleanor provides her with a cognizable commercial interest in the eleanor mark.in other words,halicki also believes she qualifies under the third possible basis for lanham act standing,as a with a cognizable commercial interest in the allegedly infringed mark.
the district court did not reach halicki nontrademark owner standing argument.if the district court determines on remand that halicki has not established ownership of the eleanor mark through prior therefore does not have standing on that court must then consider halicki argument that she is a with a commercial interest in the allegedly misused mark that is likely to be damaged.see licensing ass n,llc,d at mccarthy,trademarks and unfair competition,supra,at.
the gone in seconds mark 
with respect to the gone in seconds mark,the court found that halicki lacked standing because halicki registered marks for gone in seconds are for toy model cars,toy model car kits,and baseball caps,whereas the defendants only manufacture,produce,and sell restored vehicles fitted and detailed to replicate the shelby and,actual cars.halicki,wl,at because plaintiffs are not the registered owner of gone in seconds for vehicles or automobiles,plaintiffs may not claim standing in this instance as a registrant.this conclusion confuses an analysis of the merits of halicki infringement claim with an analysis of whether she has standing to bring those claims.to establish standing under the lanham act,a plaintiff need only demonstrate that she is the registered owner of a mark for any class of products,even one that does not compete directly with the defendant products.see.the question of whether the products on which the allegedly infringing mark appears are sufficiently related to goods sold by the plaintiff such that the defendant actions qualify as infringement is,by contrast,a merits question.see ebay,cir noting that the degree of relate
