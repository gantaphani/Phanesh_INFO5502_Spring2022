scope of review 
the order granting nonsuit or directed verdict may be made only when there is no substantial conflict in the evidence.in ruling on the motion,the court does not consider credibility of witnesses but gives to the evidence of the party against whom it is directed all its legal value,indulges every legitimate inference from such evidence in favor of that party,and disregards conflicting evidence.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,trial,original italics.the same test applies to the appellate court.osborn irwin memorial blood bank th,d.

background 
on october,a tow truck driver delivered angelo mustang to aptos for repairs.in late november,mechanic glenn davis telephoned angelo and conveyed that the repairs were complete and the invoice was.but a hose blew when davis drove the car out of the shop,and the car remained for further repairs.at the end of december,davis telephoned angelo and stated that the repairs were complete.when he disclosed the amount of the bill,angelo related that he did not have enough money.angelo asked davis to keep the car in the shop until he could accumulate the money.davis agreed.after two weeks,davis telephoned angelo several times directing him to take the car and pay the bill.in one of these conversations,on february,angelo said he would pick up the car the next day.angelo failed to do so.on february,angelo received a notice of lien sale demanding repair costs of,a towing fee of,lien sale costs of,and storage fees of accruing at per day.on march,aptos conducted a lien sale and sold the mustang for.aptos then successfully sued angelo for the deficiency in small claims court.it thereafter served angelo father,pete,with an order of examination.angelo worked for pete in pete restaurant,and aptos wanted to determine the salary arrangements for purposes of collecting the judgment by garnishing angelo wages.according to plaintiffs evidence,darrell correia,one of aptos owners,threatened pete by telling pete over the telephone that he would be arrested and his business shut down if he did not take care of angelo debt.plaintiffs also submitted evidence that brownell,aptos other owner,joined in the threat.pete satisfied the judgment in court when he attended the order of examination.
one of the bases for the trial court grant of directed verdict was that aptos was simply not a debt collector as defined by the act.we agree with the analysis,which depends upon the interplay of several definitions found in section.
the term debt collector means any person who,in the ordinary course of business,regularly,on behalf of himself or herself or others,engages in debt collection,subd.c.the term debt collection means any act or practice in connection with the collection of consumer debts,subd.b.the terms consumer debt and consumer credit mean money,property or their equivalent,due or owing or alleged to be due or owing from a natural person by reason of a consumer credit transaction,subd.f.the term consumer credit transaction means a transaction between a natural person and another person in which property,services or money is acquired on credit by that natural person from such other person primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,subd.e,italics added.
plaintiffs argue that the automobile repair transaction at issue constituted a consumer credit transaction which,in turn,might arguably qualify defendants as debt collectors because defendants provided both goods and services in advance,before receiving payment.we disagree.
the first step in construing a statute is to examine the actual language of the statute.registry,municipal court th,d.we give the words of the statute their ordinary,everyday meaning,unless,of course,the statute itself specifically defines the words otherwise.ibid.if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt,or uncertainty,then the language controls and there is nothing to interpret.ibid.
section,subdivision e,does not state that a consumer credit transaction means a transaction where a person provides property or services in advance of payment.the section states that a consumer credit transaction means a transaction where a person acquires property or services on credit.in other words,there is a consumer credit transaction when the consumer acquires something without paying for it.
we venture that in the automobile repair context there rarely would exist a consumer credit transaction because repair shops typically do not release repaired vehicles without payment thus a vehicle owner would typically not acquire a shop property or service until the property or service is paid for and he or she regains his or her own property.
here,of course,it is axiomatic that angelo never acquired property or services from defendants because he never regained his mustang.the act therefore does not apply to this case.the trial court therefore properly granted defendants motion for directed verdict.
evidence of prior similar incidents 
one of plaintiffs causes of action was for violation of the automotive repair act.bus,et this statute generally requires an automotive repair dealer to provide a written estimate and receive authorization before undertaking repairs.
plaintiffs proffered the testimony of albert cuellar to the effect that cuellar had his vehicle repaired by aptos,davis allowed cuellar to leave the vehicle on the premises but said nothing about storage fees,and aptos later demanded for storage fees and conducted a lien sale after cuellar could not pay.according to plaintiffs,the evidence was relevant for the purpose of showing defendants habit and custom,apparently as rebuttal evidence to defendants anticipated showing that they did everything as best they could and they did know any better 
defendants objected to the proffer on the ground of evidence code section.defendants counsel argued that she did not know whether the facts of the cuellar case were similar since plaintiffs did not disclose cuellar as a witness.plaintiffs took the position that cuellar was an impeachment witness who did not need to be disclosed.she posed well,your honor,if we are going to be doing that,then we are going to have to get into angelo past practices of running up bills that he does pay and making promises that he does keep with his bill collector.
the trial court sustained defendants objection.it explained we are not doing that,but on this particular item this seems to me plaintiffs counsel,the problem is that you do get a whole other set of circumstances,and we are going to have to try that whole case in relation to this.now,if it relevant,it seems to me it relevant on the issue that you say that no notice was given.well,defense counsel position is notice was given,so that the only basis that i hear from you that we really have relevance.and then in addition to that,the probative values far outweigh in my mind the prejudicial effect and the undue consumption of time here because we got another set of circumstances.in addition,i concerned that it was discovered over to them and so,you know,if we were going to go into this mean that might have
