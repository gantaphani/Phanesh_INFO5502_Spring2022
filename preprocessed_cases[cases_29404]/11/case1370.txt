background 
a.the underlying suit with gateway 
freightquote is a lenexa,kansas internet shipping broker that uses its website,to act as intermediary between shippers and carriers.at its website,customers can obtain quotes on shipping services and schedule shipments from a variety of freight carriers with whom freightquote contracts.in addition to its own website,freightquote created other internet websites to market its services.was a shipper that marketed freightquote services through a page created by freightquote.although had its own logo and was made to look like its own business,it essentially operated as an agent for freightquote.thus,customers that scheduled shipments through were in fact provided shipping services through freightquote.
from approximately may through october,gateway transportation services,a freight brokerage company incorporated in florida,scheduled numerous shipments for itself and others through the website.according to freightquote,gateway and its customers never paid for these shipping services despite freightquote repeated demands for payment.freightquote alleges that it had to pay the various freight carriers on gateway behalf.
freightquote sought legal advice from an attorney in boston,massachusetts regarding gateway refusal to pay.the attorney advised freightquote that it had a legal right to send a demand letter to gateway customers,and the attorney assisted in drafting such a letter.the letter stated

between october and november,freightquote sent the letter and miami herald article to numerous gateway customers.in response to the letter,on november,gateway filed a complaint against freightquote in county the gateway suit.gateway alleged that the letter and miami herald article tortiously interfered with its contractual and business relations.freightquote counterclaimed for unpaid services.it then turned to its insurer,hartford,for a defense to the lawsuit.
b.the hartford liability insurance policy 
at the time of the gateway suit,hartford insured freightquote through a general commercial liability policy.the policy provided coverage for bodily injury,property damage,and personal and advertising injury.the policy states in relevant part 
we will pay on behalf of the insured those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury,property damage or personal and advertising injury to which this insurance applies however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages to which this insurance does not apply.
emphasis added.
the policy goes on to define personal and advertising injury to include,among other things,o ral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services.finally,the policy specifically excludes coverage for p ersonal and advertising injury arising out of an offense committed by,at the direction of or with the consent or acquiescence of the insured with the expectation of inflicting personal and advertising injury the intentional act exclusion clause.according to freightquote,hartford had a duty to defend gateway claim for tortious interference under the policy personal and advertising injury provision.
hartford denial of coverage 
shortly after receiving gateway complaint,hartford undertook an investigation to determine whether the gateway suit fell within the policy intentional act exclusion clause.on november,hartford sent a letter to freightquote stating that an investigation was underway.counsel for freightquote replied on december,reaffirming freightquote demand that hartford defend the gateway suit and indemnify against any losses.in the letter,freightquote counsel cited our circuit decision in bankwest fidelity deposit of maryland,cir,which held under kansas law that a general liability insurance policy covers a claim for intentional interference with contractual and business relations.freightquote counsel stated in the letter that this decision entitled freightquote to coverage in the gateway suit.
nevertheless,hartford ultimately concluded that it did not have a duty to defend the gateway suit.in a letter dated february,hartford told freightquote that none of the allegations in the complaint deals with damages that would qualify for coverage under the policy and its definitions.specifically,hartford stated that even if gateway allegations qualified as personal and advertising injury,the policy excludes coverage due to the intentional nature of freightquote acts.
in may of,freightquote counsel sent a letter for the purpose of putting hartford on notice that settlement discussions were underway in the gateway suit and requesting hartford participation in those discussions.predictably,hartford refused.freightquote eventually settled the gateway suit at a total cost to freightquote of approximately,and hartford refused to indemnify against the loss.in july,freightquote filed suit against hartford in the united states district court for the district of kansas.
d.the district court order 
in its lawsuit against hartford,freightquote alleged that hartford breached its contractual duties to defend freightquote and indemnify against losses in the gateway suit.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court denied freightquote motion for summary judgment and granted hartford motion.in sum,the district court found that the policy intentional act exclusion clause applied to gateway tortious interference claim.thus,because coverage did not exist under the policy,hartford did not have a duty to defend the gateway suit or indemnify freightquote losses.this appeal followed.
