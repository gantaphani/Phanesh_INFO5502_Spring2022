background 
i.the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act 
congress enacted the fsptca in to grant the food and drug administration fda authority to regulate tobacco products under the food,drug,and cosmetic act,et.see a.under the act,the fda authority extends to the regulation of all cigarettes,cigarette tobacco,tobacco,and smokeless tobacco and to any other tobacco products that the fda by regulation deems to be subject to the act.id.b.
of particular relevance to the present action is of the fsptca.entitled tobacco product standards,it sets out a special rule for cigarettes,which provides that a cigarette or any of its component parts shall not contain,as a constituent or additive,an artificial or natural flavor other than tobacco or menthol or an herb or spice.id.a a.section further grants the fda authority to revise the special rule for cigarettes,id.a,and to adopt additional product standards if appropriate for the protection of the public health,id.a a.specifically,the fda is authorized to establish standards respecting the construction,components,ingredients,additives,constituents,including smoke constituents,and properties of tobacco product s,id.a b i,and to adopt provisions restricting their sale and distribution,id.a b v.the fda may not,however,ban all cigarettes,all smokeless tobacco products,all little cigars,all cigars other than little cigars,all pipe tobacco,or all tobacco products,or requir e the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.id.d.
before imposing restrictions on the sale and distribution of a tobacco product,the fda must determine that such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.id.d.in deciding whether a regulation is appropriate,the fda must consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole,including users and nonusers of the tobacco product.id.specifically,the fda must take into account the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products,as well as the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products.id.d a,b.finally,the fda may not prohibit the sale of any tobacco product in transactions by a specific category of retail outlets or establish a minimum age of sale of tobacco products to any person older than years of age.id.d a.
also central to this appeal is the act preemption provision,set out in.the section is composed of three parts.first,a preservation clause states,in relevant part 
except as provided in the preemption clause,nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to limit the authority of a state or political subdivision of a state to enact,adopt,promulgate,and enforce any law,rule,regulation,or other measure with respect to tobacco products that is in addition to,or more stringent than,requirements established under this subchapter,including a law,rule,regulation,or other measure relating to or prohibiting the sale,distribution,possession,exposure to,access to,advertising and promotion of,or use of tobacco products by individuals of any age 
id.a.a preemption clause then establishes an exception to this broad preservation of states authority,providing 
no state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a tobacco product any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement under the provisions of this subchapter relating to tobacco product standards,premarket review,adulteration,misbranding,labeling,registration,good manufacturing standards,or modified risk tobacco products.
id.a a.finally,a saving clause carves out an exception to the exception,stipulating that the preemption clause does not apply to requirements relating to the sale,distribution,possession,information reporting to the state,exposure to,access to,the advertising and promotion of,or use of,tobacco products by individuals of any age.id.a b.
ii.the new york city ordinance 
new york city administrative code prohibits the sale in new york city of any flavored tobacco product except in a tobacco bar.a flavored tobacco product is any item,not including cigarettes,that contains both tobacco and a constituent that imparts a characterizing flavor.id.e.a characterizing flavor is a distinguishable taste or aroma,other than the taste or aroma of tobacco,menthol,mint or wintergreen,imparted either prior to or during consumption of a tobacco product or component part thereof.id.b.a tobacco product is not deemed to have a characterizing flavor solely because of the use of additives or flavorings or the provision of ingredient information,but any public statement or claim made or disseminated by the manufacturer of a tobacco product that such tobacco product has or produces a characterizing flavor shall constitute presumptive evidence that the tobacco product is a flavored tobacco product,id.e.
although the city ordinance applies to all flavored tobacco products,there is no indication in the record that flavored cigars or products other than smokeless tobacco constitute a commercially significant product category,and in any event plaintiffs do not seek to challenge the ordinance insofar as it relates to products other than the flavored smokeless tobacco products they manufacture and distribute.smokeless tobacco products are,as the term suggests,tobacco products used by means other than smoking.they include chewing tobacco,dip,and snuff,and,according to plaintiffs,they are typically consumed by adults,primarily in the south.
plaintiffs represent,and the city does not contest,that there are only eight tobacco bars in new york city,all of which are in manhattan and none of which sells flavored smokeless tobacco.accordingly,we assume for purposes of this decision that such products are unavailable for purchase anywhere in the city.
