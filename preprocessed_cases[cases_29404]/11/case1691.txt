in mangini reynolds tobacco cal th,d,mangini,this court held that the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act fclaa et,which regulates tobacco advertising,did not preempt a claim against tobacco companies under the state unfair competition law bus,et for advertising cigarettes in a manner that encouraged minors to begin smoking.the main issue presented here is whether,as the court of appeal concluded,the united states supreme court later decision in lorillard tobacco reilly,d lorillard is inconsistent with,and thus impliedly disapproved,mangini.we agree with the court of appeal,and we are bound to accept the high court decision in lorillard as controlling authority.accordingly,we will affirm the court of appeal judgment.
in,four years before this action was filed,the attorney general of california joined with the attorneys general of the other states in bringing an action against six tobacco companies,including phillip morris incorporated phillip morris,reynolds tobacco company reynolds,lorillard tobacco company lorillard,and brown williamson tobacco corporation brown williamson.in november,that action was resolved by a master settlement agreement under which the defendants agreed to pay the states a total of billion and consented to an injunction barring them from t aking any action,directly or indirectly,to target minors in their advertising,promotion,or marketing of tobacco products people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco th,d.the settlement agreement also enjoined the defendants from engaging in a number of specific advertising and promotional techniques,such as sponsorship of events with a significant youth audience.the defendants expressly waived any claims that any provision of the agreement violated state or federal constitutions.th at,fn,d.the agreement provided that it settled claims only by the state attorneys general,so that individual plaintiffs retained the right to sue.
a month before the master settlement agreement was executed,plaintiffs devin daniels,bryce clements,daimon fullerton,nicole morrow,and maren sandler filed this class action against phillip morris,reynolds,lorillard,and brown williamson on behalf of all persons who as california resident minors under years of age smoked one or more cigarettes in california between april,and december.daniels phillip morris companies,super.san diego county.plaintiffs complaint,based in large part on the california attorney general complaint in the action,alleged that defendant tobacco companies advertising and promotional activities intentionally targeted minors.
specifically,plaintiffs alleged that defendants reynolds and phillip morris conducted marketing studies to determine how best to induce teenagers ages to to begin smoking that all defendants designed advertisements and marketing campaigns to appeal to minors that these campaigns included placing advertisements near schools,near playgrounds,in video arcades,and in publications that defendants sponsored sporting events and concerts that appealed to minors and,finally,that defendants paid to have their products used in films that appealed to youth audiences.plaintiffs alleged that other tobacco companies that did not target minors lost market shares to defendants.
plaintiffs alleged that defendants conduct violated the state unfair competition law,which authorizes civil suits for any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising bus,because the conduct encouraged or induced violation of penal code section,which prohibits the sale of tobacco to minors and the purchase and possession of tobacco by minors.defendants advertising campaigns,plaintiffs alleged,succeeded in inducing plaintiffs and all other members of the class to begin using defendants cigarettes when plaintiffs were still minors plaintiffs and the other class members became addicted to nicotine and are unable to stop smoking,spending substantial sums annually to buy cigarettes.in their second amended complaint,at issue here,plaintiffs seek restitution of defendants profits from the sale of cigarettes to minors since april.
other plaintiffs filed actions similar to the suit filed by plaintiffs here.the trial court ordered the case added to judicial council coordination proceeding,entitled in re tobacco cases ii,and it certified the class.in march,defendants jointly moved for summary judgment on the ground that the fclaa preempted the state law on which plaintiffs complaint was based.four days later,defendants jointly filed a second motion for summary judgment on the ground that defendants advertising and marketing practices were protected speech under the first amendment to the federal constitution.
in support of their summary judgment motions,defendants filed declarations stating that their advertising appeals to adults as well as to minors,that defendants themselves do not sell cigarettes to consumers,and that defendants have fully complied with federal labeling requirements.in opposition,plaintiffs submitted declarations asserting that defendants advertising and promotions deliberately targeted minors,and they attached copies of defendants advertisements.
the trial court granted both of defendants summary judgment motions and entered judgment for defendants.plaintiffs appealed.
on the preemption issue,the court of appeal recognized that our decision in mangini,supra,cal th,d,was directly on point.the court of appeal concluded,however,that mangini had been superseded by the united states supreme court decision in lorillard,supra,d.relying on lorillard,the court of appeal affirmed the summary judgment for defendants on the preemption issue,without deciding whether the federal constitution first amendment established an independent ground for sustaining the summary judgment.we granted plaintiffs petition for review.
introduction 
as we explained in dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare cal th,d,the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution grants congress the power to preempt state law.s tate law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.cipollone liggett group,d cipollone,quoting maryland louisiana,d.it is well established that c onsideration of issues arising under the supremacy clause start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress,and also that t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of analysis.cipollone,supra,at.accord,lorillard,supra,at.
the united states supreme court has explained that federal preemption arises in three circumstances first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.english general electric,d see crosby national foreign trade council,d dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,supra,cal th at,d.
here,we need not consider the second and third forms of preemption because the preemptive scope of the fclaa is governed entirely by the express language of the act.cipollone,supra,at.see also lorillard,supra,at.our task is to identify the domain expressly.
defendants here contend that,notwithstanding our decision to the contrary in mangini,supra,cal th,d,the fclaa preempts a claim asserted under the state unfair competition law that seeks to impose liability on tobacco companies for advertising and promotional practices that target minors for the purpose of inducing them to purchase and smoke cigarettes.to evaluate that contention,we first examine specific provisions of federal and state statutes concerning cigarette advertising and minors,then turn to mangini and to the united states supreme court decisions in cipollone,supra,d,and lorillard,supra,d.
b.the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act fclaa 
we summarized the pertinent federal legislation in people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco cal th,d,reynolds.the fclaa,which congress enacted in,prohibits manufacturing,packaging,or importing for sale or distribution any cigarettes whose package fails to bear specified warnings by the surgeon general.the preemption provision of the federal act prohibited states from requiring tobacco companies to add to cigarette labels or advertising any statements relating to smoking and health that were not required by federal law.see act of july,stat.in,however,congress amended the fclaa to require stronger warnings of the dangers of smoking,to allow the federal trade commission to require warnings in cigarette advertising,and to prohibit cigarette advertising in any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission.see lorillard,supra,at.at the same time,congress expanded the scope of federal preemption by amending the federal act to provide no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.b.
c.the california statutes 
the state unfair competition law bus,et authorizes civil suits for unfair competition,which it defines to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.it governs business practices as well as injuries to consumers,and has as a major purpose the preservation of fair business competition.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.by defining unfair competition to include any unlawful business act or practice citation,the unfair competition law permits violations of other laws to be treated as unfair competition that is independently actionable.kasky nike,cal th,d.
penal code section prohibits both the sale of tobacco products to any person under the age of and the purchase and possession of tobacco products by any such minor.violation is a misdemeanor.when first enacted in,penal code section prohibited only selling or furnishing tobacco to minors.stats,ch.subdivision b,which prohibits the purchase of tobacco by minors,was added in.stats,ch.penal code section provides criminal punishment for violators,but it does not expressly authorize civil liability,nor does it expressly refer to advertising of tobacco products.
the united states supreme court decision in cipollone,supra,d,was its first decision construing the fclaa.the issue there was whether the fclaa ban on state regulation of advertising in section preempted state common law actions accusing tobacco companies of failing to warn of the dangers of smoking,of fraudulent advertising,of breaching warranties that asserted that the use of cigarettes had no significant health consequences,and of conspiring to deprive the public of scientific and medical data showing the dangers of tobacco use.in a divided opinion,the high court held that the federal act preempted only the causes of action based on failure to warn of the dangers of tobacco use,but permitted the other causes of action.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.
justice stevens authored the lead opinion in cipollone,concluding that the fclaa preempted some,but not all,of the plaintiff causes of action.chief justice rehnquist,justice white,and justice joined fully in that opinion.justice blackmun wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion,in which justices kennedy and souter joined,asserting there was no evidence of an unambiguous congressional intent to preempt any common law cause of action.cipollone,supra,at.conc.dis.opn.of blackmun.although he joined in parts i through iv of justice stevens lead opinion,justice blackmun dissented from that opinion parts v and vi,in which justice stevens explained why the fclaa preempted some common law claims but not others.at.in another concurring and dissenting opinion,justice scalia,joined by justice thomas,took the opposite view,that the fclaa preempted all of the common law causes of action.at.conc.dis.opn.of scalia.justice scalia did not join in any part of justice stevens opinion 
in cipollone,the high court noted that in the fclaa preemption provision congress spoke precisely and narrowly cipollone,supra,at,but that the plain language of the provision in the act is much broader id.at.the cipollone plurality set forth an analysis to be used to determine whether,as amended in,the fclaa preempts a common law cause of action.the central inquiry in each case,justice stevens wrote,is straightforward we ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the damages action constitutes a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health imposed under state law with respect to advertising or promotion,giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.the plurality then applied that analysis to the common law claims at issue there,which were based on new jersey law,for failure to warn,breach of express warranty,fraudulent misrepresentation,and conspiracy to misrepresent or conceal material facts.
to support the claim for failure to warn,the plaintiff in cipollone had asserted two related theories first,that the defendant tobacco companies were negligent in the manner that they tested,researched,sold,promoted,and advertised their cigarettes and second,that the tobacco companies failed to provide adequate warnings of the health consequences of cigarette smoking.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.the plurality reasoned that because the fclaa preempts common law claims to the extent that they rely on a requirement or prohibition with respect to advertising or promotion,it preempted the plaintiff claim,under either theory,insofar as it asserted that the tobacco companies advertising or promotions should have included additional,or more clearly stated,warnings.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.the fclaa did not preempt the claim,however,insofar as that claim relied solely on the tobacco companies testing or research practices or other actions unrelated to advertising or promotion.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.
the cipollone plurality concluded that the fclaa did not preempt the claim for breach of express warranty because any requirements enforced through that claim were not imposed under state law but instead had been voluntarily untaken by the party issuing the warranty.in short,a remedy for a contractual commitment voluntarily undertaken should not be regarded as a requirement imposed under state law within the meaning of b of the fclaa.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens,fn.omitted.
the plaintiff in cipollone had alleged two theories of fraudulent misrepresentation.the cipollone plurality concluded that the fclaa preempted the claim under the first theory,which was that the defendant tobacco companies,through their advertising,neutralized the effect of federally mandated warning labels,because that theory was predicated on a prohibition against statements in advertising and promotional materials that tend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.but the cipollone plurality concluded that the fclaa did not preempt the claim under the second theory,which was that the defendant tobacco companies had falsely represented material facts,because that theory was predicated not on a duty based on smoking and health but rather on a more general duty not to deceive.id.at.plur.opn.of stevens.
for similar reasons,the cipollone plurality concluded that the fclaa did not preempt the claim for conspiracy to misrepresent or conceal material facts concerning the health hazards of smoking,because t he predicate duty underlying this claim is a duty not to conspire to commit fraud,which was not a prohibition based on smoking and health as that phrase is properly construed.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.
in mangini,which we decided in,the plaintiff sued reynolds under the state unfair competition law,claiming that its advertising campaign for camel cigarettes,featuring a cartoon character called old joe camel,improperly targeted minors.after reviewing the united states supreme court decision in cipollone,supra,d,decided two years earlier,we concluded that the plaintiff claims were not preempted.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.
the state unfair competition law claim,we reasoned,was analogous to the common law claims for conspiracy and misrepresentation that the high court in cipollone,supra,d,had held were not preempted by the fclaa.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.under the reasoning of the cipollone plurality,we observed,whether the fclaa preempts a cause of action depended upon whether the predicate legal duty underlying that cause of action was based on smoking and health.mangini,supra,at,d.applying that test to the plaintiff action in mangini,we concluded the predicate duty under the state unfair competition law is to not engage in unfair competition by advertising illegal conduct or encouraging others to violate the law.in cipollone,the predicate to not based on smoking and health this one is similarly not.id.at,d.
our decision in mangini also examined penal code section,which prohibits the sale of tobacco to minors and the purchase of tobacco by minors.we observed that this statutory prohibition was originally enacted in,long before concerns about the effect of smoking on health arose,and was apparently intended to protect minors from immoral activities.mangini,supra,cal th at,d.it is part of a chapter of the penal code containing offenses against good morals,and it is immediately followed by prohibitions against admitting a minor to a house of prostitution,or to a prize fight or cockfight.mangini,supra,at,d.we concluded t he state protective role,and not primarily health concerns,motivated the prohibition against selling cigarettes to minors.ibid.
acting under the authority of a state statute banning unfair or deceptive trade practices,and intending to fill gaps in the master settlement agreement that terminated the action brought by the state attorneys general see ante,d at,at,the massachusetts attorney general in january issued regulations that,among other things,barred outdoor advertising of cigarettes within feet of any school,park,or playground.lorillard,supra,at.the united states supreme court in held that the fclaa preempted the massachusetts regulations.lorillard,supra,at.justice wrote the majority opinion,in which chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia,thomas,and kennedy joined.justice stevens authored a dissenting opinion,in which justices souter,ginsberg,and breyer joined.
in lorillard,the high court rejected the massachusetts attorney general contention that the state regulations were not based on smoking and health,because they do not involve content in cigarette advertising but instead target youth exposure to cigarette advertising.lorillard,supra,at.the court noted that congress in the fclaa had sought to protect the public,including youth,from being inundated with images of cigarette smoking in advertising and for that reason had banned electronic media advertising of cigarettes and had vested the federal trade commission with authority to regulate cigarette advertising.lorillard,supra,at.observing that the massachusetts attorney general attempt to address the incidence of underage cigarette smoking by regulating advertising was similar to the fclaa ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media,the court concluded at bottom,the concern about youth exposure to cigarette advertising is intertwined with the concern about cigarette smoking and health.thus the attorney general attempt to distinguish one concern from the other must be rejected.lorillard,supra,at.
the high court in lorillard also rejected the argument that federal preemption was limited to cigarette advertising content,not its location t he distinction can not be squared with the language of the provision,which reaches all requirements and prohibitions imposed under state law.a distinction between the content of advertising and the location of advertising in the fclaa also can not be reconciled with congress own restriction,which bans advertising in electronic media,but not elsewhere.lorillard,supra,at.
the high court summarized its conclusions w e fail to see how the fclaa and its provision permit a distinction between the specific concern about minors and cigarette advertising and the more general concern about smoking and health in cigarette advertising,especially in light of the fact that congress crafted a legislative solution for those very concerns.we also conclude that a distinction between state regulation of the location as opposed to the content of cigarette advertising has no foundation in the text of the provision.congress state cigarette advertising regulations like the attorney general because they would upset federal legislative choices to require specific warnings and to impose the ban on cigarette advertising in electronic media in order to address concerns about smoking and health.accordingly,we hold that the attorney general outdoor and advertising regulations targeting cigarettes are by the fclaa.lorillard,supra,at.
the high court cautioned,however,that the fclaa did not preempt generally applicable zoning restrictions and that r estrictions on the location and size of advertisements that apply to cigarettes on equal terms with other products appear to be outside the ambit of the provision.lorillard,supra,at.nor does the fclaa preempt state laws prohibiting cigarette sales to minors or state prohibitions on common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct,such as solicitation,conspiracy,and attempt.lorillard,supra,at.
plaintiffs argue that their claim is indistinguishable from the fraud claim at issue in cipollone,supra,which the united states supreme court held was not preempted by the fclaa.they maintain that both the state unfair competition law,on which their claim is based,and the common law prohibition on fraud,on which one of the claims at issue in cipollone was based,are laws of general application not motivated by concerns about smoking and health.but the cipollone plurality did not conclude that,to avoid fclaa preemption,it was sufficient that a state law claim be based on a law of general application not predicated on concerns about smoking and health.rather,the plurality there considered each common law theory to determine whether,as applied in the particular case,the claim based on that theory would impose a duty based on concerns about smoking and health.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.the fraud claim in cipollone sought to regulate cigarette advertising on the basis that it contained false assertions of the claim sought to impose a duty not to was broader and more general than concerns about smoking and health.id.at.plur.opn.of stevens.
the cipollone plurality concluded that the fclaa did preempt other common law claims insofar as they sought to impose duties on cigarette advertisers based on concerns about smoking and health.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.thus,the plurality concluded that the fclaa preempted the plaintiff and fraudulent misrepresentation claims to the extent they sought to impose restrictions,based on concerns about smoking and health,on the content of cigarette advertising.cipollone,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.
likewise in lorillard,supra,the united states supreme court stated that the fclaa did not preempt general zoning regulations that apply to cigarettes on equal terms with other products lorillard,supra,at,but also that the fclaa did preempt the regulations at issue there,which applied only to cigarettes and were based on concerns about youth smoking,because the court concluded that those concerns were indistinguishable from the concern about cigarette smoking and health lorillard,supra,at.
accordingly,it is not sufficient to consider here whether plaintiffs have based their claim on a law of general application that is not motivated by concerns about smoking and health.see morales trans world airlines,d there is little reason why state impairment of the federal scheme should be deemed accept
