essar steel limited essar appeals from the united states court of international trade decision affirming the department of commerce commerce finding that essar received countervailable subsidies from the government of india for certain carbon steel flat products.the united states government and united states steel corporation us steel the trial court decision affirming commerce finding that essar received no subsidies through the chhattisgarh industrial program cip.for the reasons described below,we affirm the trial court decision to uphold the subsidies found by commerce and reverse its decision regarding the cip.
background 
in,commerce initiated an investigation to assess whether essar received countervailable subsidies for its iron ore products in india for the period of review from january,through december.see initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews and request for revocation in part.commerce investigated several programs,including essar purchase of iron ore from the national mineral development corporation nmdc,participation in programs under india special economic zone sez act,and participation in the cip administered by the state government of chhattisgarh,india.
commerce concluded that essar purchase of iron ore from nmdc was countervailable.to compare pricing of iron ore purchases,commerce sought benchmark purchases of both iron ore lumps and fines,which are two different types of iron ore products.commerce relied on essar previous purchase of iron ore lumps from a brazilian supplier during the period of review.commerce found no comparable essar purchase of iron ore fines,so it used the price from hamersley,australia listed in the tex report,which is a daily japanese publication reporting on international price negotiations for iron ore.in addition,commerce included freight and delivery charges in its benchmark pricing.
with respect to the sez act,commerce found that the government of india did not cooperate to the best of its ability in responding to commerce questions.as a result,commerce applied adverse facts available and determined that essar use of programs under the sez act constituted subsidies.
commerce also questioned essar regarding its participation in the cip.in may,essar stated that it did not have any manufacturing facilities in the state of chhattisgarh.commerce then identified a press release indicating that essar did,in fact,have an iron ore manufacturing plant in chhattisgarh,so commerce submitted the question to essar a second time.in response to the second question,in october,essar stated that it did not have an iron ore beneficiation plant in chhattisgarh.a beneficiation plant differs from a manufacturing plant,but both are involved in the processing of iron ore.essar claimed that the chhattisgarh facilities were still in the planning stage.accordingly,in its preliminary results that same month,commerce found that essar had no facilities in chhattisgarh and therefore did not benefit from the cip.
before commerce initiated its investigation for the period of review and before essar denials regarding the existence of any plant manufacturing or beneficiation,essar applied to the government of chhattisgarh for benefits under the cip because of its facility in chhattisgarh.essar sent a request to the government of chhattisgarh on march.essar received word from the government of chhattisgarh on september,while the instant investigation was still underway that its application for benefits under cip was denied.essar did not submit either its request for benefits or the denial of these benefits to commerce in response to commerce questionnaires.
along with its answers to commerce questions during the investigation for the period of review,essar submitted to commerce a annual report,which lists an essar facility in chhattisgarh.hence the only evidence of record at that time was an annual report and press release which both indicated the presence of a facility in chhattisgarh and two separate denials by essar of any facilities in chhattisgarh.finally,in its february rebuttal brief to commerce during commerce review of its initial results,essar argued for the first time that its facility in chhattisgarh was ineligible for benefits under the cip.it did not submit any evidence in support of this claim.commerce noted essar failure to respond to the best of its ability to commerce questions by providing false information about its chhattisgarh facility.because of essar failure to respond to the best of its abilities,commerce applied adverse facts in its may final results and concluded that essar did benefit from the cip.
essar appealed commerce final results to the court of international trade.the court upheld commerce decision to impose duties for essar purchase of iron ore from nmdc and its participation in the sez act.essar steel united states,d.int l trade.the trial court held that commerce applied appropriate benchmark pricing for its evaluation of essar iron ore purchases from nmdc and correctly included freight and delivery charges.id.at.it further upheld commerce results with respect to the sez act.id.at.essar argued for the first time at the trial court that it did not produce merchandise within the special economic zone,but the court held that essar failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to that argument.id.
the trial court remanded the case to commerce for further proceedings regarding the cip.the court relied on the september,letter in which the government of chhattisgarh stated that essar chhattisgarh facility was not eligible for benefits under the cip.the court knew of the letter because essar had submitted it during commerce independent review in a different investigation of essar iron ore practices for the period of review,not the instant investigation.id.at.although the trial court accepted that essar did not act to the best of its ability in responding to commerce questions,it directed commerce to reopen the record to consider the letter on remand.
on remand,commerce entered two documents into the record the march,letter from essar to the government of chhattisgarh requesting subsidies under the cip and the september,letter from the government of chhattisgarh informing essar that it did not qualify for benefits under the cip for to.despite having the documents in its custody during commerce investigation,essar did not submit either document to commerce.commerce strongly disagreed with the trial court decision to remand and enter the documents into the record,but under protest it held that essar did not receive benefits under the cip.the court of international trade affirmed commerce finding.
essar appealed commerce decision to impose subsidies for its purchase of iron ore from nmdc and its participation in the sez act program.the united states and us steel the decision regarding the cip.we have jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the court of international trade pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of international trade decisions de novo,applying anew the same standard of review applied by that court.skf usa,united states.we uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.nsk united states,b b i.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.steel united states,citations omitted.
the countervailing duty laws impose duties on imported goods that are subsidized by the country of export or manufacture.the countervailing duty laws provide that a countervailable subsidy exists when a foreign government provides a specific financial contribution to a party and that party benefits from the contribution.see.one way that a party receives a benefit is through the provision of goods or services at less than adequate remuneration.e iv.
essar appeal 
at the outset,we note that in this appeal essar presents identical arguments for the nmdc subsidies as in its previous appeal,which was decided after essar submitted its principal brief in this case.we rejected essar arguments in the previous appeal and upheld the trial court decision to use the australian and brazilian benchmarks and add freight and import costs to the benchmarks.steel united states.the previous appeal relates to a separate commerce investigation of the period of review covering january,through december,so it is not binding on us in this case.we identically conclude that commerce decision to apply countervailing duties for the nmdc subsidies is supported by substantial evidence and comports with the regulation.
essar argues that commerce erred in choosing benchmark prices for the sale of iron ore lumps and fines.rather than relying on the sales to essar by the brazilian suppliers and the australian sales listed in the tex report,essar argues that commerce should have used sales made by nmdc to japanese buyers as the proper benchmark.
commerce must determine the proper benchmark price in order to determine if the goods were sold for less than adequate remuneration.see.commerce regulations set forth a hierarchy to identify the appropriate benchmark.id.first,commerce looks for a tier benchmark,an actual transaction price in the country in question,which may,in some cases,include sales by government auctions.a i.if no such transactions exist,commerce looks for a tier benchmark,a world market price for the goods in question.a ii.if neither of those is available,commerce measures the adequacy of the remuneration by assessing whether the price is consistent with market principles.a iii.
essar contends that nmdc sale to japanese buyers is an appropriate tier benchmark for both lumps and fines.although essar acknowledges that nmdc is controlled by the indian government,it submitted no evidence that nmdc sale price to japanese buyers was determined by a government auction.commerce has stated that a government auction must be open to everyone,protect confidentiality,and be based solely on price.countervailing duties,dep t commerce.the record evidence shows that nmdc sale to japanese buyers was open only to indian government officials and five japanese buyers during a private iron ore dealing mission.therefore commerce conclusion that the nmdc sale price to japanese buyers is not an appropriate tier benchmark price is supported by substantial evidence.
commerce appropriately identified essar purchase of iron ore lumps from the brazilian supplier as a tier benchmark for the iron ore lumps essar purchased from nmdc.for iron ore fines,commerce had no tier benchmark,so it identified the published price of iron ore fines from hamersley,australia as a tier world market price.though the australian iron ore is not identical to nmdc iron ore,commerce regulations require only that it be a comparable price that would be available to the purchasers in the country at issue.we conclude commerce properly took into account factors affecting comparability in its selection of the benchmark.commerce conclusion that the hamersley,australia iron ore fines price is an appropriate benchmark is supported by substantial evidence.see a ii.
essar further argues that commerce and the trial court erred by adding freight and import costs to the world market price.both the statute and the regulation,however,require that these costs be added to the benchmark prices.e t he adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions includ ing price,quality,availability,marketability,transportation,and other conditions of sale.emphasis added a iv stating that the benchmark price will include delivery charges and import duties emphasis added.commerce decision to add these charges to the benchmark prices is consistent with the relevant statute and regulation and is supported by substantial evidence.
essar also appeals the trial court decision to uphold countervailing duties for benefits received under the sez act.though essar acknowledges that it was eligible for subsidies under the sez act at some point and that it did receive sez benefits during the period of review,it argues that the subject merchandise was ineligible because it was produced before the date on which essar eligibility for sez act benefits took effect.accordingly,essar urges that the benefits should be tied only to merchandise produced or exported after this date.because none of its subject merchandise was produced after that date,essar argues that no countervailing duty should be imposed.
commerce regulations state that i f a subsidy is tied to the production or sale of a particular product,the secretary will attribute the subsidy only to that product.b i.however,no evidence exists to support tying the benefits under the sez act only to particular products.in the absence of such evidence,commerce was correct to apply the subsidies to all products exported by essar.see b.that is precisely what commerce did here.
finally,essar argues that commerce should not have imposed any countervailing duties under the sez act because it does not produce any subject merchandise in the sez area and therefore can not benefit from the sez act.as the trial court correctly held,this argument fails because essar has not exhausted its administrative remedies.essar did not raise this argument before commerce and is thus precluded from raising it for the first time at the court of international trade.see dorbest united states.we agree that substantial evidence supports commerce decision to impose countervailing duties on essar for benefits received under the sez act.
ii.the united states and us steel cross appeal 
the united states and us steel collectively,the appeal from the trial court decision affirming the determination that essar received no countervailable benefits through the cip.the argue that the court should have let stand commerce previous determination applying adverse facts.commerce has the power to apply adverse facts when an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information.b.the trial court acknowledged that essar did not act to the best of its ability when responding to commerce questions,but nonetheless vacated and remanded commerce determination to apply adverse facts.the trial court based its remand on essar belated admission after the imposition of adverse facts that it had a facility in chhattisgarh and on the court own identification of the two letters relating to essar facility in chhattisgarh.the trial court ordered the remand and required commerce to place the letters on the record and consider them.this exceeded the trial court authority and was erroneous.
essar responses to commerce questions in the initial determination demonstrate that it did not act to the best of its ability to comply with requests for information.when asked the first time about facilities in chhattisgarh,essar stated that essar does not have any manufacturing facilities in the state of chhattisgarh.after finding the press release about essar chhattisgarh plant,commerce presented the question a second time,but essar still withheld the truth about its chhattisgarh facility 
commerce on page iii of your may qr,you stated that you do not have any manufacturing facilities in the state of chhattisgarh.an essar press release on the record of this review appears to indicate that you have an iron ore beneficiation plant located in chhattisgarh.please state whether you received subsidies under the chhattisgarh industrial policy with respect to an iron ore beneficiation plant in chhattisgarh and any other facility in chhattisgarh.
essar no.essar does not have an iron ore beneficiation plant in chhattisgarh.
essar repeatedly denied having a plant manufacturing or beneficiation in chhattisgarh.if essar had no plant in chhattisgarh,then there would be no question about the cip subsidies.both of these denials occurred after essar had applied for these exact same cip subsidies claiming entitlement because of its chhattisgarh plant.hence,essar was applying for cip benefits because of its chhattisgarh facility and then telling commerce it does not even have a plant in chhattisgarh.essar then received a response to its application for subsidies from the government of chhattisgarh des
