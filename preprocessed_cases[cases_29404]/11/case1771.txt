introduction 
petitioner global packaging,global packaging,sought a writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c after the trial court denied its motion to quash service of summons for lack of jurisdiction.the court found a contractual provision to be a clause and interpreted this clause as subjecting global packaging to its jurisdiction.
we now grant the petition.the trial court improperly conflated venue,forum,and jurisdiction to imply global packaging consent to personal jurisdiction.the summons should have been quashed for lack of personal jurisdiction in california.
global packaging,located in pennsylvania,produces packaging for consumer products.it licensed some software from epicor software corporation epicor,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in orange county.paragraph of epicor end user license agreement agreement,provides in pertinent part any controversy or claims arising out of or relat to this agreement shall be venued only in the state or federal court in and a orange county,california or b the jurisdiction in which the software is located without regard to their conflict of laws and principle sic.such venue shall be determined by the choice of the plaintiff bringing the action.
a dispute arose between epicor and global packaging over payment for the software,and epicor sued global packaging in may in orange county.global packaging moved to quash service of summons under section,subdivision a it asserted that california had no jurisdiction over it based on its actual presence within the state or minimum contacts and that paragraph of the agreement,upon which epicor relied,did not constitute a consent to personal jurisdiction.the trial court denied the motion on the ground paragraph was an enforceable clause that,by implication,included a consent to jurisdiction.global packaging petitioned for review of the denial of the motion to quash.
discussion 
we review de novo issues of contract interpretation not dependent on any factual findings.parsons bristol development cal d.
at the outset,we point out that epicor forum selection clause as it pertains to instituting a lawsuit in california is phrased in terms of a county rather than of the state.section limits the counties in which a corporation may be properly sued in california,and parties can not make other arrangements by prior agreement.see alexander superior court th,i t is not for the parties or the courts to set venue.that is the role of the legislature.see also general acceptance robinson cal.the clause is void to the extent that it specifies a california county alexander superior court,supra,th at,and unless orange county corresponds to one of the counties identified in section,global packaging could not properly be sued there 
global packaging,however,did not object to the clause on this basis,and its motion to quash was denied on the ground that the clause was a clause constituting global packaging consent to personal jurisdiction in california.because we can determine this issue as a matter of law,by examining the contract,we do not need to send the case back for further proceedings regarding the propriety of orange county as a venue.even considered as a clause,paragraph of the agreement is insufficient to confer jurisdiction over global packaging on a california court.
jurisdiction 
jurisdiction is rooted in geography.as the united states supreme court stated in that favorite pennoyer neff,the authority of every tribunal is necessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the state in which it is established.pennoyer neff.this territorial concept of jurisdiction has two corollaries e very state possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory and no state can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons or property without,outside its territory.id.at.even when these principles were relaxed by the doctrine of minimum contacts see international shoe washington,international shoe,jurisdiction was still limited by presence in a state as evidenced by activities within its territory.id.at.
generally speaking,a civil court gains jurisdiction over a person through one of four methods.there is the method residence or presence within the state territorial boundaries.pennoyer neff,supra,at.there is minimum contacts activities conducted or effects generated within the state boundaries sufficient to establish a presence in the state so that exercising jurisdiction is consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe,supra,at,quoting milliken meyer.a court also acquires jurisdiction when a person participates in a lawsuit in the courthouse where it sits,either as the plaintiff initiating the suit mikulski mikulski d,or as the defendant making a general appearance,subd.a.finally,a party can consent to personal jurisdiction,when it would not otherwise be available.estate of heil d.
jurisdiction can be regarded from two points of view,that of the individual subject to it and that of the court exercising it.
jurisdiction from the individual viewpoint 
although most citizens probably manage to escape significant involvement with a court,our legal system recognizes the importance of protecting those who do not avoid this fate.without question,the people downtown in the black robes can set some very powerful machinery in motion.they can take away one house 
one personal property,one money.they can freeze one bank account,subd.c and remove part of one paycheck.they can put one children in foster care welf,or even give them to someone else to rear.id.they can put a person in jail although he has committed no crime,subd.a.every state has these machines it is vitally important,then,to limit the number of machines with which someone may have to contend.
our system sets these limits territorially,by state.any attempt to exercise authority beyond these limits would be deemed in every other forum an illegitimate assumption of power,and be resisted as mere abuse.pennoyer neff,supra,at.as justice frankfurter observed,the history of american freedom is,in no small measure,the history of procedure.malinsky new york.by putting a person beyond the reach of a court in any state with which he has no significant ties,limits on jurisdiction help to protect this freedom.see international shoe,supra,at due process does not contemplate that a state may make a binding judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts,ties,or relations.
jurisdiction from the court viewpoint 
jurisdiction both defines and delimits a court authority.within its territory,a court,even as constrained by law,has enormous power to bid and forbid.but its power ultimately ends at the state line.see world wide volkswagen woodson,limits on jurisdiction protect states rights as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.a state court must also contend with the overlay of federal law and power operating within its territory.see,yellow freight systems,donnelly,cox superior court cal d.
courts have not looked benignly on efforts to restrain their power.they have generally sought to repel efforts of others whether official bodies or private parties to call any shots they think they should be calling.see,vaden discover bank,arbitration agreements once seen as restricting court power railway whitton administrator,state law can not restrict federal court jurisdiction kulawy united states cir internal revenue service can not deprive court of jurisdiction.courts once resisted clauses for this very reason they were seen as attacks on the courts power.
ii.forum selection clauses 
in a great many situations,forum and jurisdiction are undifferentiated.the forum the state where the court is physically located is coterminous with the court jurisdiction.the term jurisdiction has therefore developed two meanings.its primary meaning,at least in constitutional discussions,is the power or authority a court has over a person.in other contexts,however,it has also come to mean the territory within which this power is or can be exercised.ofte
