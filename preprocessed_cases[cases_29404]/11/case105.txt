plaintiff wagner and wagner auto sales,appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment rejecting its claims against defendant land rover north america,under the automobile dealer day in court act,addca,and.laws ch,the massachusetts dealer bill of rights.see generally coady toyota motor,cir.lrna terminated a temporary dealership arrangement with wagner,which led to this lawsuit.the district court wrote a thoughtful and meticulous opinion,wagner wagner auto sales,land rover,d,which we affirm.
we describe the undisputed material facts on which entry of summary judgment was based.
wagner owned two luxury car dealerships in massachusetts,which sold automobiles from manufacturers such as,bmw,audi,and jaguar.in,wagner wanted to expand to include land rovers and reached an agreement with lrna to that effect.three years later,on october,lrna and wagner entered into a letter of intent loi that annulled and replaced the agreement.under the loi,wagner would construct a combined land dealership in boylston,massachusetts to be opened by march.in november,however,wagner requested to change the location of the proposed site for the dealership to shrewsbury.lrna approved this request because it believed shrewsbury was the superior site.
the parties amended the loi on june,and entered into a second letter of intent loi,which stated that it incorporated any prior agreements and that its terms controlled in cases of conflict.the loi is the contract at dispute in this case.under the loi,if wagner met certain benchmarks it would receive a temporary land rover dealer agreement tda,which would terminate if wagner did not timely construct a new facility in shrewsbury meeting particular requirements.if wagner met the first deadline on august,wagner would receive the tda.wagner did so and received the tda,thus becoming a temporary land rover dealer at the boylston location.
the loi also established that the deadline for completion of construction of the permanent facility was february.it set interim deadlines for submission of plans,obtaining necessary regulatory approvals,and construction of the facility in shrewsbury.the loi also established a planning volume of land rovers and jaguars.paragraph of the loi stated time is of the essence with respect to this schedule.the loi provided a termination clause that if wagner failed to meet any of the foregoing deadlines this agreement and loi shall,at land rover option,expire and become null and void any such failure shall also constitute a substantial and material breach of the tda warranting the termination of the tda.
sometime after opening this temporary dealership in boylston in september,wagner concluded that the proposed permanent dealership in shrewsbury would not be financially viable under the specifications of the loi.this was,in part,because lrna had pulled one particular the market.moreover,jaguar sales across the country had fallen precipitously since,with new vehicle sales falling from in to in.
wagner did not meet the loi october,interim deadline for applying for all necessary regulatory approvals.wagner also failed to meet the march,interim deadline for furnishing detailed construction drawings to lrna or identifying a general contractor for the project.
on may,lrna sent wagner a letter advising that it had not met the march deadline.wagner requested an extension.on august,lrna offered a extension of the loi deadlines subject to wagner signing amended agreements.on august,wagner responded and requested an extension of up to three years and suggested that it was the ford takeover of lrna in that caused delays in construction of the land dealership.the letter also mentioned the national decline in jaguar sales.
in response,on september,lrna reiterated its prior offer of a extension and stated that it would reconsider the size of the planning volume.wagner failed to respond in writing.lrna sent a final letter on february,saying that wagner needed to contact virginia slocum,lrna liaison to the dealership,by february,or the agreement would be terminated effective may.
when the parties could not come to agreement regarding an extension of the contract,lrna sent a notice of termination to wagner on march,stating that the tda would expire in ninety days.the letter stated that the grounds for termination included wagner failure to comply with the agreed upon deadlines under the loi.
wagner brought suit in the district court contesting the validity of lrna termination under both.laws ch,and the addca,seeking damages,injunctive relief,and costs after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lrna,wagner timely appealed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of wagner.mellen trs.of boston,cir.

wagner claims that lrna violated section of the chapter in three ways.first,wagner argues that lrna violated the chapter requirement that terminations of dealerships be for good cause,largely because wagner alleges that lrna also breached the loi.second,wagner argues that lrna violated section by acting in bad faith in terminating the agreement.third,wagner argues that lrna failed to demonstrate good cause because it did not give wagner an opportunity to cure.
section of chapter makes u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices unlawful.laws ch.among the enumerated unfair methods and unfair or deceptive acts or practices,section makes the termination of a motor vehicle franchise agreement unlawful under certain conditions.id.under section,i t shall be a violation of subsection a of section for a manufacturer,distributor or franchisor representative without good cause,in bad faith or in an arbitrary or unconscionable manner to terminate the franchise agreement of a motor vehicle dealer 
in coady corporation,we held that arbitrariness under chapter can not be shown if the defendant actions were based on reasonable business practices.at.it is only the egregious decision which can be labeled arbitrary or unfair.the chapter was not intended to protect dealers from the normal risks of a free economy.id.

in determining whether good cause has been established for terminating,refusing to extend or renew or changing or modifying the obligations of the motor vehicle dealer as a condition to offering a renewal,replacement or succeeding franchise agreement,the court shall consider all pertinent circumstances,that may include,but shall not be limited to the existence and materiality of any breaches,defaults or violations by the affected motor vehicle dealer of the terms or provisions of the existing franchise agreement or of ap
