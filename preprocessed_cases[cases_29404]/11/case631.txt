this appeal turns in part on whether the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver must abide by louisiana reinscription rules to preserve its liens.the district court determined that the mortgage and assignment held by the assignee of the fdic,the dennis joslin company joslin,lost priority status because of the fdic failure to reinscribe the mortgage within the statutory period.the court found that two creditors,bank one and david jump,had valid liens that were senior to the fdic interest.
in addition to its assertions based on louisiana law,joslin argues that the fdic is not bound by reinscription requirements.the argument is that either the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,firrea,or federal common law insulates the fdic from reinscription requirements.we are not persuaded and affirm this holding of the district court.we also conclude that jump lien was based on a judgment that was not final when registered.we reverse the district court contrary holding and remand.
on november,rory mcfarland pledged a note in the amount of million to the bank of commerce of shreveport,louisiana mcfarland secured this note with a mineral lease mortgage and assignment,an assignment of runs,of his interest in the oil,gas,and minerals produced from the mortgaged leasehold and mineral interests 
a casualty of the misfortunes that befell banking in the,the bank of commerce failed in.the fdic was appointed receiver and took over the bank assets,including the pledged note and the assignment 
in august,bank one equity investment,formerly premier venture capital corporation,obtained judgment,the bank one judgment,against mcfarland in louisiana state court.bank one recorded this judgment in various louisiana parishes between march and august of.
on october,david jump obtained a judgment against mcfarland,the jump judgment,in the united states district court for the western district of colorado.jump registered the judgment in the western district of louisiana on june.in june and july of,jump recorded the judgment in various louisiana parishes.
on october,the fdic filed suit to collect the debt owed by mcfarland to the bank of commerce,including the mortgage and assignment.bank one and jump intervened in the seeking the proceeds from the mineral leases that had been paid into the court registry they claimed that the assignment did not encompass a specific offshore lease.
in,the district court ordered mcfarland to pay the fdic from the proceeds in the court registry and recognized the mortgage as the first lien.the court also held that the assignment did not include and ordered mcfarland to pay the proceeds of that lease to bank one and jump the fdic recorded the judgment of the district court in various louisiana parishes between november,and november.this court subsequently affirmed the judgment in relevant part 
the fdic reinscribed the mortgage and assignment in various louisiana parishes in july.in,the fdic assigned the mortgage and assignment to the dennis joslin company.
in,joslin filed a motion for issuance of a writ of execution and for foreclosure of the property subject to the mortgage and assignment.joslin also sought distribution of the funds that had accumulated in the court registry.the district court issued the requested writ of execution and the united states marshal for the western district of louisiana seized the property.the marshal advertised the sale of the property and set october,as the date of sale.
through successive filings on october and,jump objected to joslin actions.jump contended that the fdic failure to reinscribe the mortgage and assignment within ten years of its execution resulted in a loss of ranking.jump argued that the jump judgment consequently had priority as to both the mineral interests and the proceeds deposited in the court registry.the court postponed the marshal sale.
in june,the district court entered another judgment holding that louisiana law required the fdic to reinscribe the mortgage and assignment by november,the fdic reinscription in was therefore untimely,depriving its assignee,joslin,of priority rank.the court consequently ranked the bank one judgment first,the jump judgment second,and the fdic mortgage and assignment third.joslin appeals this determination.
joslin contends,first,that this case is moot joslin points to the judgment,in which the district court declared the fdic to be the owner and entitled to all funds paid into the registry of this court.joslin argues that,except for the funds derived from the lease,the fdic was declared owner of all past and future proceeds from the leases in question.because the judgment vested the fdic with priority lien status,joslin contends that the reinscription question was rendered moot 
joslin position is meritless.there is a live case or controversy regarding the meaning of the extent to which it encompasses future,as well as past,proceeds deposited in the registry.moreover,we note that louisiana law mandates the reinscription of mortgages and assignments within a period as the louisiana supreme court has held,a litigation between the mortgage creditors does not dispense from reinscription the inscription must continue until the proceeds of the property mortgaged are reduced to possession.the judgment did not then implicitly end the fdic continuing obligation to reinscribe the mortgage.moreover,the fdic failure to reinscribe the mortgage did not occur until,and the issue was not properly before the district court even if we were to interpret the judgment as declaring the fdic to be owner of all future proceeds deposited in the court registry,the judgment would still not exclude the possibility that other,failure to deprive the fdic of its lien.the instant appeal therefore presents a live controversy 
the larger question posed by this case is whether louisiana reinscription law applies to mortgages held by the fdic.the parties urge three different means of resolving this question.first,contends that the judgment disposed of the reinscription question and is the law of the case.second,joslin argues that the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of frees the fdic from reinscription requirements.if firrea does not apply,joslin asserts that federal common law governs the fdic,thereby precluding the imposition of state reinscription obligations.we address each contention in turn.
jump argues that the district court in the case was bound by the judgment,which provided the law of the case.under the law of the case doctrine,a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of a case becomes a binding precedent to be followed in successive stages of the same litigation.where a final judgment is entered,the case appealed,and the case remanded,a trial judge must adhere on remand to the rulings it made in the case before appeal,assuming that the appellate court has not overturned the rulings moreover,an appellate court is generally precluded from reexamining issues decided in a prior appeal this doctrine applies regardless of whether the issue was decided expressly or by necessary implication 
jump notes that the judgment found a mortgage and assignment issued by mcfarland in to be preempted.he contends that the district court found the mortgage to be preempted because of the fdic failure to reinscribe the original mortgage within a period.jump concludes that the district court thereby recognized that the fdic must comply with louisiana reinscription requirements.jump concedes that the judgment did not and could not address the fdic subsequent failure to reinscribe the pledged mortgage.however,he asserts that the judgment enunciated a legal principle that was binding on the judgment as we understand it,he contends that the case was merely a prior stage of the same litigation,and that the district court prior judgment bound it in future phases of the same case 
on the face of the matter it is doubtful whether the and proceedings constitute the same case.it is true that the same trial judge presided at both proceedings and that the two judgments had the same case number and caption.it is equally true,however,that the decision was a final judgment and the case was not decided on remand from our decision.by then,several facts had changed joslin became the holder of the fdic mortgage and assignment,and the fdic failed to reinscribe the mortgage 
even if we assume that the two rulings were part of the same case,we do not read the judgment as advocated by jump.the judgment does not explain its finding of preemption.in a order adopted by the district court in,the court recognized as a contested issue of law w hether the fdic mortgage is unenforceable because it was not reinscribed emphasis added.the court also noted two other objections to the mortgage whether the mortgage was unenforceable because it failed to comply with.and whether failure to fill in the effective date on the mortgage similarly rendered it unenforceable.the record does not reflect any further discussion by the parties of the reinscription issue prior to the judgment.
the judgment failed to unambiguously affirm the fdic obligation to abide by louisiana reinscription law.while louisiana cases occasionally employ the term preemptive to describe the period in which a mortgage must be reinscribed this language differs from the court order,unenforceable.given these uncertainties,we are not prepared to conclude that the law of the case doctrine barred the district court from considering the reinscription issue 
joslin argues that firrea,b,protects the fdic from reinscription requirements the statute provides 
when acting as a receiver,the following provisions shall apply with respect to the corporation no property of the corporation shall be subject to levy,attachment,garnishment,foreclosure,or sale without the consent of the corporation,nor shall any involuntary lien attach to the property of the corporation 
joslin asserts that the plain meaning of the statute compels the conclusion that louisiana reinscription law would not apply to the fdic.
the louisiana reinscription statute may effect a of liens.failure to reinscribe a mortgage within the period specified in article of the louisiana civil code does not invalidate the mortgage as between the contracting parties untimely reinscription does,however,render the initial inscription of the mortgage ineffective against third parties.creditors then have priority over the mortgage that was not timely reinscribed.any attempt to reinscribe after the period can not alter this change in seniority.late reinscription merely crystallizes the ranking in effect at the time of the reinscription 
although failure to reinscribe a mortgage may result in the application of an involuntary lien to fdic property,firrea does not provide relief.we read the provisions of firrea in context,cognizant of the statute structure and purpose passed in the wake of a national crisis in the banking and industries,firrea was intended to promote stability,economic recovery,and increased public confidence to this end,the fdic was empowered to serve as receiver for failed financial institutions section was enacted to facilitate the fdic efforts as receiver and was intended to protect assets involuntarily acquired by the fdic from losing value because of its lack of knowledge about local and state tax liens.
before the passage of firrea,section only included the provision currently codified as a,which articulated the fdic exemption from taxation while acting in its corporate capacity firrea added subsection b to extend this exemption to the fdic role as receiver we are persuaded that section b merely extends the general exemption of the fdic from taxation to the receivership context.as a house report accompanying firrea indicated 
section b clarifies the existing provision specifying that the only kind of tax to which the fdic,in its corporate capacity or as receiver,is subject is a tax on real property.the exemption from taxation extends to the fdic property and operations in whatever capacity it is functioning,and particularly as receiver for a national bank,a branch of a foreign bank,or a savings association but not as a receiver for a state bank under state law 
the title to section confirms the arrangement established by firrea section is labeled,exemption from taxation limitations on borrowing.firrea added the heading,general rule,to subsection a the heading which firrea designated for subsection b,other exemptions,confirms that section b was intended to address other exemptions from taxation than those stipulated in the general rule.the other exemption at issue in this case is the rule precluding the attachment of an involuntary tax lien to fdic property.the structure,title,and purpose of the statute compel this conclusion.
this court has consistently interpreted section b in this fashion.we have found that this section prohibits state and local taxing authorities from foreclosing on property subject to an fdic lien without its consent this court has not applied the exemption of section b to liens not attached by state and local taxing authorities indeed,we have repeatedly found that section b represents the express will of congress that the fdic must consent to any deprivation of property initiated by a state.
joslin attempts to apply this exemption to the intervention initiated by jump and bank one.as jump and bank one are private entities possessing normal judgment liens,however,their claims are not barred by section b.we therefore find that firrea does not preclude the application of louisiana reinscription law to the fdic property.nothing in firrea prevents louisiana law from recognizing either the fdic obligation to reinscribe mortgages or the loss of ranking suffered by the fdic if it fails to meet this obligation.firrea only prohibits state and local entities from taking advantage of the fdic failure to reinscribe by attaching liens and other instruments to satisfy tax judgments.as these circumstances are not present here,joslin argument fails 
joslin argues,in the alternative,that federal common not louisiana reinscription the status of fdic liens.in united states kimbell foods,the supreme court articulated the general framework for determining whether to apply federal common law or state law.the kimbell foods case addressed the question of whether liens arising from federal loan programs take precedence over private liens.the court noted that,in the absence of a federal statutory provision setting priorities,it must first decide whether federal or state law provides the rule of decision for the controversy if a federal rule of decision is appropriate,the court must determine whether to fashion a uniform federal standard or to incorporate state commercial law the court inquiry was guided by consideration of three factors the federal interest in uniform federal rules whether application of state law would frustrate the specific objectives of the federal program at issue and to what extent application of a federal rule would disrupt commercial relationships predicated on state law in subsequent cases,the court has held that federal law provides the rule of decision in lieu of state law only where there is a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law.the supreme court has observed that such a conflict is a precondition for recognition of a federal rule of decision,and has noted that such cases are few and restricted.
we find that state law provides the rule of decision in this case.firrea is a comprehensive and detailed statutory scheme the supreme court has stated that we are not to adopt a rule to supplement federal statutory regulation that is comprehensive and detailed matters left unaddressed in such a scheme are presumably left subject to the disposition provided by state law.joslin does not articulate a valid basis for overcoming this presumption.
moreover,the fdic in this case acts not in its corporate capacity,but as receiver for a private bank.this court has followed the supreme court in recognizing that the capacity in which the fdic acts may have a determinative impact on whether a state or federal rule should control.as receiver for the bank of commerce,the fdic rights and liabilities derive from a private lien held by a private bank.precedent confirms that the fdic actions as receiver do not implicate the concerns articulated in cases such as kimbell foods as the fdic actions as a receiver do not concern the rights of the united states in a nationwide federal program,state law normally supplies the rule of decision 
we also do not find that application of state law would create a significant conflict with the fdic putative interest in the application of a uniform national standard joslin points to provisions in firrea which protect the fdic from the effects of state law yet offers no reason why these of which is relevant to the reinscription issue at the need for a uniform national standard while uniformity of law would free the fdic from the obligation of consulting state law to determine reinscription and lien priority rules,this requirement is one of the ordinary consequences of operating as receiver disposing of the assets and obligations of a failed financial institution necessarily requires an individualized inquiry into the effects of local law firrea lightens this burden considerably by protecting the fdic from the effect of state law in various respects.joslin provides no compelling reason for this court to extend these protections.nor does it offer any limiting principles were we to proceed down that road,demonstrating the runaway tendencies of federal common law.
joslin articulates no significant federal policy or interest that would be jeopardized by exposure to reinscription requirements.there is a candidate.firrea was designed in part to facilitate the efficient and speedy recovery of the assets of failed financial institutions.given the need to market occasionally large quantities of assets,the fdic prefers to sell assets without the risk of losing its priority position.while we are not unsympathetic to the bureaucratic limitations of the fdic,we fail to see how the requirements at issue pose a significant conflict with the federal interest in effectively disposing of the assets at the fdic disposal.
precedent also leaves little doubt that a federal agency interest in preserving priority lien status is insufficient to render state law inapplicable.although kimbell foods applied a federal rule of decision,it incorporated state law for purposes of determining the relative priority of competing federal and private liens in magnolia federal bank united states our court similarly found that,i nsofar as magnolia claim would subordinate rather than bar enforcement of sba liens for untimeliness,state law is properly invoked against the federal agency.failure to reinscribe a lien in louisiana does not extinguish the mortgage.the mortgage merely loses priority status other creditors the prohibition against applying state statutes of limitations to the activities of federal agencies consequently does not govern this case the louisiana law at issue presents no significant conflict with the fdic interests.
we further note that the application of federal law would disrupt commercial relationships predicated on state law as joslin concedes,louisiana has a strong public records doctrine the public records doctrine serves important reliance interests,as third parties are entitled to rely on the absence from the public records of any unrecorded interest in the property.the purposes of the louisiana reinscription requirement are to provide public notice of the essentials of the mortgage and to limit searching,for the evidence of mortgages,more than ten years back.the significance of this doctrine is evident in the louisiana rule stating that actual knowledge by third parties of an unrecorded interest is immaterial recordation and reinscription are alone dispositive of priority status 
case law affirms the importance of respecting this state policy.the supreme court has recognized that state laws of this kind provide private commercial entities with the stability essential for reliable evaluation of the risks involved.the supreme court also has noted that if federal law were to displace state law regulating lien priority,c reditors who justifiably rely on state law to obtain superior liens would have their expectations thwarted whenever a federal contractual security interest suddenly appeared and took precedence.moreover,this court jurisprudence affirms that we are to defer to state property regimes when considering whether to apply a federal common law rule we have found that the strong local interest in state regulation of land titles should be overridden by the federal courts only where clear and substantial interests of the national government,which can not be served consistently with respect for such state interests,will suffer major damage if the state law is applied.as we do not find that state law will significantly impede the work of the fdic as receiver in this context,we decline to override this intricate state law of general applicability on which private creditors base their daily transactions.we are to take such a step and leave this matter in congress capable hands 
assuming that louisiana reinscription law applies to the fdic,joslin contends that the judgment satisfied these requirements.we disagree.article of the louisiana civil code requires that the holder of the mortgage file a signed,written notice of reinscription which,inter alia,shall declare that the document is reinscribed.article of the civil code affirms that this method is exclusive of all others the act creating the reinscription method currently in effect states that t he procedure for reinscription of mortgages and privileges as set forth in civil code articles through shall be effective as to all requests for reinscription filed on or after january.assuming that the judgment constitutes a request for reinscription,the method outlined in article applies.not only was the judgment not signed by an fdic representative,but it also does not declare that the document is to be reinscribed.consequently,the judgment did not reinscribe the mortgage and assignment.
even under prior law,the judgment would not constitute an effective reinscription of the mortgage and assignment.although a recorded judgment could effectively reinscribe a mortgage,it had to include each of the substantial particulars of the mortgage a reinscription had to contain notice to the world that the mortgagor continue s to admit his indebtedness,and that the mortgagee continue s to maintain its mortgage on the property described.the judgment does not include a copy of the mortgage and assignment.it only refers to the oil and gas leases,royalty interests,overriding royalty interests and other property described in the mortgage.this description fails to provide with the notice required under louisiana reinscription law the judgment also was deficient in other respects,as it failed to include,inter alia,the name of the officer who passed the act of mortgage and assignment.we therefore agree with the district court that the judgment was not a valid reinscription of the mortgage and assignment 
joslin contends that the jump judgment was not a final judgment and therefore improperly registered.allows for registration where a judgment has become final by appeal or expiration of the time for appeal or when ordered by the court that entered the judgment for good cause shown.by the plain language of the statute,registration may only occur where a judgment or order is final for purposes of appeal the only exception contemplated by section is where the district court makes a good cause determination.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure affirms that a judgment is not final for purposes of appeal where it disposes of fewer than all of the claims or parties involved in a case.rule b allows a court to direct the entry of final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.
the jump judgment only disposed of jump claims.litigation involving other parties to the colorado litigation did not conclude until august,after the fdic reinscription of the mortgage and assignment.as jump concedes that no rule b certification was obtained,the judgment upon which he bases his claim was not final because the registration of the jump judgment was premature it could not prime the fdic lien following the fdic reinscription of the mortgage and assignment in.although registration of the judgment would assure jump of a claim to mcfarland assets,a resulting lien would remain subordinate to those held by bank one and joslin,respectively 
the district court focused on the unique status of consent judgments,which are unappealable the court held that the time for appeal from a consent judgment expires immediately upon the entry of judgment even if we accept the court position,it does not alter the fact that jump failed to obtain the requisite rule b certification.we are unprepared to carve out an exception to rule b for consent judgments.such a decision is more appropriately taken by congress 
in light of the preceding,we hereby affirm the judgment of the district court finding that louisiana reinscription law operates to strip the fdic of priority lien status.we further reverse the district court holding that the jump judgment was an executable,final judgment and its finding that the jump judgment was senior to joslin lien.we remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
affirmed in part,reversed and remanded in part.
although mcfarland executed other mortgages in favor of the bank of commerce,none of these instruments is relevant to the instant appeal.
the assignment,which was executed on the same day as the note,encompassed mcfarland right,title,and interest in and to the oil,gas and other minerals,of whatever nature and kind whatsoever,situated in and under and which may be produced from the land affected by the leases described in a schedule attached to the mortgage.
we will refer to the mortgage note as the mortgage and the mineral lease mortgage and assignment as the assignment.we will also refer to both instruments jointly as the mortgage and assignment.
bank one and jump agreed to combine their efforts in the ensuing ranking dispute.
texaco,had deposited proceeds from the mineral leases into the court registry.the fdic had joined texaco as a party given its status as the operator of most of the encumbered mineral interests.the fdic had also joined as parties russell long and palmer long,who were trustees of certain expired trusts of which mcfarland had been beneficiary.prior to the action,the longs periodically received funds from texaco and distributed them to mcfarland.
on october,bank one received from the funds deposited in the court registry that were traceable to the lease.bank one then released its judgment as to mcfarland interest in the lease.jump initiated foreclosure proceedings and purchased that leasehold interest at a sale held by the united states marshal.jump also received the balance of the funds on deposit in the registry attributable to the lease.

because the facts litigated in the judgment differ from those in the judgment,collateral estoppel is of no assistance to joslin.see copeland merrill lynch,cir.
joslin also frames its mootness argument in terms of the law of the case doctrine.joslin contends that the judgment granted it through the fdic ownership of the past and future proceeds from the leases.it argues that this decision was binding on the proceedings.this argument fails for the same reasons as joslin mootness claim.the judgment did not preclude the possibility that other circumstances could strip joslin of its ownership interest.moreover,as discussed infra,we are skeptical as to whether or not the and proceedings constitute different phases of the same case.united states lawrence,cir.
jump is the only party besides joslin participating in this appeal.pursuant to a prior compromise and settlement agreement,jump is participating on behalf of both himself and bank one.

joslin also invokes d c,which provides no attachment or execution may issue by any court upon assets in the possession of the receiver.courts have construed this provision as prohibiting the attachment of liens and judgments against the property of the fdic or resolution trust corporation rtc when they are acting as receivers.see resolution trust cheshire mgmt,cir gwn petroleum,at cambridge capital halcon.however,none of these decisions has applied this provision to the assignee of the fdic or rtc.indeed,the plain language of section d c affirms that the provision applies only while the assets are in the possession of
