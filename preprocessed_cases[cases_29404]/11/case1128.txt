in,congress passed the fair and accurate credit transactions act facta,stat,an amendment to the fair credit reporting act,et,in part to combat identity theft.facta provides that 
no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.
g.this restriction covers only receipts that are electronically printed,and does not apply to transactions in which the sole means of recording a credit card or debit card account number is by handwriting or by an imprint or copy of the card.id.g.
expedia,runs a website that allows users to make travel arrangements online.like other merchants that accept credit cards or debit cards,see id.g,expedia must comply with facta.dimitriy simonoff purchased travel arrangements through expedia website.expedia then emailed him a receipt,which included the expiration date of simonoff credit card.he claims that this email receipt violates facta.
the question we consider under facta is the meaning of the words print and electronically printed in connection with an emailed receipt.print refers to many different technologies from mesopotamian cuneiform writing on clay cylinders to the gutenberg press in the fifteenth century,xerography in the early twentieth century,and modern digital printing but all of those technologies involve the making of a tangible impression on paper or other tangible medium.see generally steinberg,five hundred years of printing new ed.although computer technology has significantly advanced in recent years,we commonly still speak of printing to paper and not to,say,ipad screens.nobody says,turn on your droid or iphone or ipad or blackberry and print a map of downtown san francisco on your screen.we conclude that under facta,a receipt that is transmitted to the consumer via email and then digitally displayed on the consumer screen is not an electronically printed receipt.we affirm the district court dismissal of simonoff claims under rule b.
forum selection clause 
we first address a procedural aspect of the case a forum selection clause.simonoff initially filed an action in illinois state court.expedia removed the case to federal court and then moved to dismiss the action on the basis of the forum selection clause in expedia user agreement.simonoff voluntarily dismissed the action and his suit in state court in king county,washington.expedia again removed the case to federal court,and the district court denied simonoff motion to remand.
before a user can complete a transaction through expedia website,the user must consent to a user agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the website use.the agreement contains a forum selection clause that provides you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in king county,washington in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of this website.the thrust of simonoff argument is that exclusive jurisdiction and venue in king county limits jurisdiction to the state courts.
we apply federal law in interpreting the forum selection clause in expedia agreement.doe aol llc,cir per curiam.the plain language of the contract should be considered first,id.quoting klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir,with the understanding that the common or normal meaning of language will be given to the words of a contract unless circumstances show that in a particular case a special meaning should be attached to it,id.quoting hunt wesson foods,supreme oil,cir.
our recent decision in doe is central to our analysis.there we considered a forum selection clause in aol website user agreement that provided for exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute in the courts of virginia.id.at.we concluded that the choice of the preposition of in the phrase the courts of virginia was determinative of is a term denoting that from which anything proceeds indicating origin,source,descent,and the like.id.at quoting black law dictionary ed.thus,the phrase the courts of a state refers to courts that derive their power from the state,only state courts and the forum selection clause,which vested exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of virginia,limited jurisdiction to the virginia state courts.id.at.
by way of contrast,however,we observed in doe that a forum selection clause referring to courts in a state imposes a geographic limitation,not one of sovereignty.id.at.the word in means to express relation of presence,existence,situation,inclusion inclosed or surround by limits,as in a room.id.at quoting black law dictionary ed.hence the phrase courts in a state includes any court within the physical boundaries of the state,even if the court does not derive its power and authority from the sovereignty of the state.see id.at.in short,the rule we adopted in doe is that a forum selection clause that specifies courts of a state limits jurisdiction to state courts,but specification of courts in a state includes both state and federal courts 
the forum selection clause in the expedia contract vests exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts in king county emphasis added.because the clause uses the preposition in,the contract contemplates federal as well as state courts as proper courts for adjudication.as other circuits have recognized,when a federal court sits in a particular county,the district court is undoubtedly in that county.see alliance health,at global satellite commc n,at 
simonoff reliance on the tenth circuit decision in excell,sterling boiler mechanical,cir,is at odds with our precedent.the forum selection clause in excell provided that j urisdiction shall be in the state of colorado,and venue shall lie in the county of el paso,colorado.id.at.the tenth circuit held that,under this clause,venue was proper only in state court.id.at.in doing so,the court relied on the notion that f or federal court purposes,venue is not stated in terms of counties.rather,it is stated in terms of judicial districts.id.citation omitted.but,as the fifth circuit noted in alliance health,the reasoning in excell would be more persuasive were the federal courts organized in total disregard of state counties if,for instance,federal judicial districts were defined by metes and bounds.alliance health,at.because judicial districts are in fact defined by counties,nothing in excell undermines our reasoning in doe nor may we our own precedent 
consistent with doe and the decisions of our sister circuits,we hold that a forum selection clause that vests exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts in a county provides venue in the state and federal courts located in that county.the district court did not err in declining to remand the case to state court.
ii.facta does not cover emailed receipts 
we next consider simonoff claim that expedia violated facta by including the expiration date of the card in an emailed receipt.the crux of this dispute is whether an electronically printed receipt includes an email receipt displayed on a computer screen.as with all matters of statutory interpretation,w e begin with the text of the statute.kasten saint gobain performance plastics,d.the relevant portion of facta provides
