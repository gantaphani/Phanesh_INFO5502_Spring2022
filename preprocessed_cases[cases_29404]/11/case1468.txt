traditionally if that can be said of anything in the information age,many internet users lumbered along via connections over standard copper phone lines.increasingly,however,broadband internet service is becoming available,providing significantly higher access speeds.two of the most widespread methods of delivering broadband service are digital subscriber line dsl,which utilizes the portion of copper lines,and cable modem service.other technologies,such as fiber optics,are steadily gaining ground.
in the case before us,the federal communications commission fcc agreed not to require the bell operating companies bocs to provide their competitors with unbundled access to certain network facilities.see c b.earthlink,an internet service provider that benefits from such unbundling,challenges the fcc order.persuaded that the agency interpretation and application of the statutory scheme are permissible,we deny the petition for review.

in,in its triennial review order,the fcc attempted to implement the unbundling requirements of c.review of the section unbundling obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers,triennial review order in pertinent part,the agency relieved those obligations on a nationwide basis with respect to certain new fiber broadband network elements.specifically,the fcc did not require ilecs unbundle ftth loops,loops extending from the ilec central office all the way to the customers premises in places where fiber loop plant had not previously existed greenfield situations,new residential areas where no lines had existed and overbuild situations,locations where only copper loop plant was in place.id.at.in the latter,however,if the ilec decides to retire the incumbent copper loops,it must then make its fiber loops only for narrowband,not broadband uses.id.the fcc also declined to require unbundling as to the next generation network,packetized capabilities of hybrid loops,loops comprised only partially of fiber and.id.at.
in the agency view,balancing the costs and benefits of unbundling,with particular attention to incentivizing new fiber investment by both ilecs and clecs,the scales tipped against mandating unbundling.see,id.at.the fcc emphasized that its obligation to ensure the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability under section warrants different approaches with regard to existing copper loop plant and new fiber loop plant.id.at.
in usta ii,while vacating much of the triennial review order,we upheld the fcc nationwide decision to refrain from requiring unbundling as to the fiber broadband elements described above.usta ii,at.the fcc had reasonably determined,for example,that any damage to broadband competition from denying unbundled access to the broadband capacities of hybrid loops is likely to be mitigated by the availability of loop alternatives or intermodal competition.id.at.as to the latter,we noted that cable companies,having roughly a share of the nationwide broadband market,provided robust intermodal competition to ilecs,which occupied a secondary market position.id.
furthermore,we held that the fcc reasonably interpreted c to allow it to withhold unbundling orders,even in the face of some impairment,where such unbundling would pose excessive impediments to infrastructure investment,id.at,because s ection a identifies one of the act goals beyond fostering competition on ilec facilities,namely,removing barriers to infrastructure investment,id.at.even if the fcc judgment entails increasing consumer costs today in order to stimulate technological innovations,we opined,there is nothing in the act barring such.id.at.that is,fcc may weigh the costs of unbundling,investment disincentives against the benefits of removing this barrier to competition.id.at discussing hybrid loops see id.at t he section considerations are enough to justify the fcc decision not to unbundle ftth.
in turn,we found reasonable the fcc conclusion that requiring unbundling of the elements at issue would,indeed,produce undesirable incentives as it is likely to delay infrastructure investment,with clecs tempted to wait for ilecs to deploy ftth and ilecs fearful that clec access would undermine the investments potential return.id.at.accordingly,we upheld the fcc refusal to unbundle the broadband fiber elements,even in the face of some clec impairment,in light of evidence that unbundling would skew investment incentives in undesirable ways and that intermodal competition from cable ensures the persistence of substantial competition in broadband.id.at.

the fcc acknowledged the important role that competition plays in ensuring reasonable rates,protecting consumers,and furthering the public interest.id,see also b.the agency determined,however,that the bocs have only limited competitive advantages in the market.id.considering the wholesale market in conjunction with competitive conditions in the downstream retail broadband market,the fcc looked to several factors,including the emerging nature of the broadband market,in which the preconditions for monopoly are not present the fact that cable modem providers,not ilecs,control a majority of all residential and lines the expected rise of other intermodal broadband competition,such as fixed wireless,satellite,and broadband over powerline and the clecs continued ability to compete in the broadband market by deploying their own fiber loops or accessing ilecs legacy copper elements.order.ultimately,the fcc concluded that any effects on competition are offset by the prospect of additional intermodal competition and the benefits that forbearance will provide incentives for both ilecs and clecs to invest in and deploy broadband facilities,which will increase competition going forward and thereby keep rates reasonable,benefit consumers,and serve the public interest.
earthlink,an internet service provider that relies on clecs and ilecs including the bocs for access to consumers,petitions for review of the order.verizon,at t and bellsouth intervene in support of the fcc.
earthlink raises a number of challenges to the fcc interpretation and application of the statutory forbearance provision.we conclude the fcc decision survives chevron analysis,is neither arbitrary nor inconsistent with fcc precedent,and is supported by the record.
first,earthlink argues the order runs afoul of a.we examine the fcc interpretation under the familiar chevron framework.chevron,natural res.def.council,d cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc.first,if the statute unambiguously controls the precise question at issue,then we need go no further.chevron,at.second,where the agency exercises delegated authority to resolve statutory ambiguity,we will uphold the fcc interpretation as long as it is reasonable,see id.at,even if there may be other reasonable,or even more reasonable,views,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.see also at t fcc,chevron deference is due only if the agency has acted pursuant to delegated authority and the agency action has the force of law.citations omitted.
according to earthlink,the statute permits the fcc to grant forbearance only after a painstaking analysis of market conditions in particular geographic markets and for specific telecommunications services.we disagree.on its face,the statute imposes no particular mode of market analysis or level of geographic rigor.see a requiring forbearance in any or some of a carrier geographic markets if three conditions are met.seizing on the phrase geographic markets in a,earthlink contends the decision to forbear on a nationwide considering more localized regions per se improper.this argument is tenuous,at best.in context,the language simply contemplates that the fcc might sometimes forbear in a subset of a carrier markets it is silent about how to determine when such partial relief is appropriate.similarly,the statute does not require consideration of specific services.see id.permitting forbearance as to a class of telecommunications carriers or telecommunications services emphasis added.instead,we are persuaded the agency reasonably interpreted the statute to allow the forbearance analysis to vary depending on the circumstances.
insofar as earthlink suggests the statute does not permit the fcc to make the forbearance decision with an eye to the accounting for section goals and assessing likely market argument also fails nothing in prohibits weighing such considerations in assessing the impact of forbearance on rates,consumers,and the public interest.see a,id.b.further,section explicitly directs the fcc to utiliz e forbearance to encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans.as the precise interplay between section and the forbearance inquiry is not from the text,it is precisely the type of ambiguity entrusted to reasonable agency construction.the language of section suggests a approach and,reading the two statutory provisions together,we can not fault the fcc for interpreting it to inform the analysis.
this conclusion finds support in usta ii where we held that the fcc properly considered section goals in deciding not to require unbundling.see at interpreting d at a minimum clause.we rejected the argument that the act prohibits ad hoc balancing of the statute goals with an allegedly conflicting goal derived from section,holding instead that s ection a identifies one of the act goals beyond fostering competition on ilec facilities,namely,removing barriers to infrastructure investment.id.at.similar tradeoffs are also reasonably incorporated into a decision to forbear from unbundling.while the fcc prior decision to relieve unbundling does not automatically make it proper to forbear from the separate unbundling requirements,the fcc permissibly construed the statutory scheme to permit weighing similar considerations in each case.
next,earthlink argues the order arbitrarily assessed broadband competition in an irrational and ad hoc manner.we review the fcc application of the act pursuant to the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.see cellular telecomms.internet ass n,at a.our role in this regard is a limited one and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.cellular telecomms.internet ass n,at.we must ensure the fcc has considered the relevant factors and articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,at quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.we will reverse only if the agency decision is not supported by substantial evidence,or the agency has made a clear error in judgment indeed,an extra measure of deference is warranted where the decision involves a high level of technical expertise in an area of rapid technological and competitive change.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
similar to its statutory interpretation argument,earthlink contends competition can only rationally be assessed by focusing on more specific product and geographic markets and by conducting a traditional market analysis including market share,demand and supply elasticity,and other factors.while such an analysis is no doubt appropriate in some circum
